<abstract>
<p>An integral issue to the study of bias crimes is how violence targeting lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) victims is different from other more common forms of violent crimes. Limitations in official bias crimes data have inhibited our understanding of the relative nature of anti-LGBT crimes. The purpose of this study is to examine the similarities and differences in anti-LGBT homicides and average homicides in the United States between 1990 and 2008. The current study addresses methodological issues by relying on an open-source database of anti-LGBT homicides. This study found that the nature of these homicides is both similar and significantly different from the average homicide. Implications for the ongoing bias crimes discourse are discussed.</p>

<p>Every year members of the lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) community become victims of bias crimes. Despite anecdotal evidence of the brutality of some high-profile crimes, largely missing from the bias crimes literature are empirically based comparative analyses of anti-LGBT violence and common (or average) forms of violence in the United States. To date, past research on anti-LGBT violence in the Unites States has been stunted by unreliable official bias crimes data, including discrepancies across states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0886260512462301">Nolan &amp; Akiyama, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0886260512462301">Perry, 2001</xref>), differences in police agency working practices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0886260512462301">Boyd, Berk, &amp; Hamner, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0886260512462301">Haider-Markel, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0886260512462301">McDevitt et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0886260512462301">Nolan &amp; Akiyama, 1999</xref>), local sociopolitical contexts in which police operate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0886260512462301">Hamm, 1998</xref>), and challenges to accurately assessing offender motives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0886260512462301">Boyd et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0886260512462301">Haider-Markel, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0886260512462301">Nolan &amp; Akiyama, 1999</xref>). Therefore, we currently lack a clear picture of violence against sexual orientation minorities and how these crimes compare to the average homicide in the United States. The current study addresses these specific limitations of prior research.</p>
<p>Drawing from doing gender theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0886260512462301">West &amp; Zimmerman, 1987</xref>), the current study contributes to bias crimes and homicide research literatures by explaining similarities and differences in anti-LGBT and average homicide events in the United States. Anti-LGBT homicides refer to fatal acts of criminal violence in which victims are targeted in whole or part because of their actual or perceived sexual orientation or gender identity.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0886260512462301">1</xref></sup> Average homicides refer to homicide events representing modal homicide incident and participant categories in the United States. Anti-LGBT homicide data are extracted from an open-source database, while average homicide data are randomly sampled from the Uniform Crime Reports-Supplementary Homicide Report for the same time period. This study is guided by the following research question: How does the nature of anti-LGBT homicides compare to average homicides in the United States between 1990 and 2008?</p>
<p>This is the first study to examine a national sample of known anti-LGBT homicides based on open-source data. This study contributes to prior literature by combining open-source and official data sources in order to compare suspect and incident characteristics of anti-LGBT and average homicides. Open-source data allow for the examination of homicides that may not have been charged or prosecuted as bias crimes, but for which indicators of bias motives were present. Relying on explicit indicators of offenders’ bias motives, this research guards itself against the inclusion of homicide cases for which there is a lack of credible information. The current study also contributes to the literature by focusing exclusively on homicide events. As opposed to other nonfatal forms of violence, the likelihood of events being identified in open-sources and the amount of open-source information about each homicide increases. Concentrating on a single form of violence also makes it possible to reduce the risk of overgeneralizing explanations of homicide to all forms of violence against LGBT victims.</p>

<title>Unique Harm of Bias Violence?</title>
<p>Upon the presidential signing of the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act, sentence enhancements could be applied to those convicted of violent crimes against LGBT victims. Opponents of bias crimes laws have questioned how “biased” violence is different from other routine forms of violence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0886260512462301">Jacobs, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0886260512462301">Senate Republican Policy Committee, 2000</xref>). Critics have also questioned why bias crimes, including those against sexual orientation minorities, deserve special legal attention. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0886260512462301">Jacobs (1993</xref>, p. 13) wrote that “. . . murder, rape, kidnapping, arson—are so devastating that it seems to deprecate the victim’s pain and anguish to conclude, as the hate crime laws do, that there is more trauma if the perpetrator is a bigot as well as a brute” (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0886260512462301">Jacobs &amp; Potter, 1997</xref>). In contrast, arguments on the necessity to protect sexual orientation minorities through bias crimes laws stem from the belief that anti-LGBT violence is different in nature from more common forms of violence. A number of scholars have suggested that anti-LGBT violence is often more harmful than typical violence, causing harm to immediate victims as well as the broader LGBT community (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0886260512462301">Dunbar, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0886260512462301">Garnets, Herek, &amp; Levy, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0886260512462301">Herek &amp; Berrill, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0886260512462301">Herek, Gillis, Cogan, &amp; Glunt, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0886260512462301">Iganski, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0886260512462301">Lawrence, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0886260512462301">Rose &amp; Mechanic, 2002</xref>). Research has found that this type of violence can be especially divisive, disrupting the tranquility and the safety of communities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0886260512462301">Herek &amp; Berrill, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0886260512462301">Iganski, 2008</xref>). Although all homicides can devastate victims’ families and respective communities, targeting victims because of their gender identity or sexual orientation leads to disproportionate psychological harm and feelings of vulnerability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0886260512462301">Dunbar, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0886260512462301">Garnets et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0886260512462301">Herek et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0886260512462301">Iganski, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0886260512462301">Rose &amp; Mechanic, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>Whether or not sexual orientation bias violence is a unique form of violence is a question that can be addressed through empirical research. The next section provides a theoretical framework for explaining how anti-LGBT homicides may be similar and different from average homicides in the United States.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0886260512462301">
<title>Theoretical Orientation</title>
<p>This study relies on the concept of heterosexism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0886260512462301">Herek, 1990</xref>) while also drawing from the doing gender theory to provide a theoretical framework for explaining why anti-LGBT violence may be unique from average forms of violence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0886260512462301">West &amp; Fernstermaker, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0886260512462301">West &amp; Zimmerman, 1987</xref>). This framework will then serve as a context for reviewing past research findings on this type of violence.</p>
<p>Two assumptions regarding macrosocial structures and social interaction are necessary. First, this framework assumes that social institutions along with cultural norms promote heterosexist views of gender roles while also denigrating alternative perspectives of gender. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0886260512462301">Herek (1990</xref>, p. 317) has suggested that <italic>heterosexism</italic> is an “. . . ideological system that denies, denigrates, and stigmatizes any nonheterosexual forms of behavior, identity, relationship, or community.” Heterosexism is one component of the broader social context in which anti-LGBT violence may occur.</p>
<p>Second, this theory maintains that gender is not an assigned or a fixed aspect of one’s identity. For young males, there is often a need to demonstrate or “prove” commitment to heterosexist norms. This can involve expressing adherence to hegemonic notions of masculinity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0886260512462301">Connell, 2005</xref>), and rejection of alternative masculinities (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0886260512462301">Schrock &amp; Schwalbe, 2009</xref>, for a review of “multiple masculinities” research). Opportunities to demonstrate masculine behaviors and attitudes can come in the form of actual or perceived challenges to gender identity or sexual orientation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0886260512462301">Connell, 2005</xref>). Threats to masculinity lead to fear, anger, and anxiety, and are more likely to provoke aggression depending on a number of factors, including offenders’ ability to express emotion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0886260512462301">Cohn, Seibert, &amp; Zeichner, 2009</xref>) and levels of sexual prejudice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0886260512462301">Bernat, Calhoun, Adams, &amp; Zeichner, 2001</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0886260512462301">Bufkin (1999</xref>, p. 157) wrote that bias crimes victims “. . . stand in opposition to hegemonic masculinity by virtue of their existence.” When challenged, heterosexual males are expected to uphold traditional gender norms of masculinity and punish those who violate them through violence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0886260512462301">Harry, 1992</xref>). Successfully eliminating such challenges serves to momentarily accomplish masculinity and police those that violate gender roles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0886260512462301">Perry, 2001</xref>, p. 106; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0886260512462301">Tomsen &amp; Mason, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>Societal structures, institutions, and cultural ideologies promote hegemonic notions of heterosexuality and sexual prejudice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0886260512462301">Herek, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0886260512462301">Kimmel, 1997</xref>). It is often through social interaction that males situationally negotiate masculinity and demonstrate commitment to heterosexual norms. The action of negotiating gender through violence, or “enacted stigma” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0886260512462301">Herek, 2007</xref>), then serves to reaffirm gendered social structures. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0886260512462301">Messerschmidt (1993)</xref> refers to this mutually constitutive relationship between social structures and social interaction as “structured action” (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0886260512462301">Bufkin, 1999</xref>). The situational act of a bias crime is conceptualized as one “resource” for accomplishing masculinity. Although empirical tests of the relationship between doing gender theory and anti-LGBT violence are lacking, past research findings can be placed in the context of the doing gender theoretical approach in order to understand the relationship between situational affronts to masculinity and anti-LGBT violence.</p>

<title>Prior Literature</title>
<p>Past research indicates that bias crimes offenders tend to be young, White males (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0886260512462301">Garofolo &amp; Martin, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0886260512462301">Harry, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0886260512462301">Martin, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0886260512462301">Maxwell &amp; Maxwell, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0886260512462301">Messner, McHugh, &amp; Felson, 2004</xref>), and this is also indicative of anti-LGBT violence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0886260512462301">Berrill, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0886260512462301">Comstock, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0886260512462301">Tomsen, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0886260512462301">Van Der Meer, 2003</xref>). Young, often working-class, males are required to confront obstacles and are limited opportunities to advance into adult male roles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0886260512462301">Connell, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0886260512462301">Tomsen, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0886260512462301">Van Der Meer, 2003</xref>), such as attending college or attaining stable employment. Moreover, young, White males view diversity policies and programs, such as affirmative action programs, that assist certain groups based on race, ethnicity, and gender as unfairly discriminatory. Without legitimate opportunities to constitute gender identities, young, White males may seek other means of accomplishing masculinity, including violence against sexual orientation minorities.</p>
<p>Past research findings on incidents of anti-LGBT violence may also help us explain differences from average forms of violence. In some situations, the most effective way to demonstrate conformance to heterosexual gender norms is to express masculinity through violence in the presence of peers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0886260512462301">Harry, 1992</xref>). Anti-LGBT homicides tend to be more likely to be carried out by multiple perpetrators than average violent crimes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0886260512462301">Martin, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0886260512462301">Tomsen, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0886260512462301">Van Der Meer, 2003</xref>). In fact, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0886260512462301">Janoff (2005)</xref> found that in Canada 45% of anti-LGBT violence involved multiple offenders. What is often referred to as “gay-bashing,” serves as an opportunity to publicly demonstrate masculinity against victims who may be perceived as less likely to retaliate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0886260512462301">Harry, 1992</xref>, p. 115). In addition to multiple offenders, research has found that multiple victims are often attacked in a single act of violence against sexual orientation minorities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0886260512462301">Martin, 1996</xref>). Scholars have also suggested that violence against sexual orientation minorities can be especially brutal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0886260512462301">Berrill, 1990</xref>), serving as a warning to others that gender nonconformity will not tolerated. These brutal attacks often involve weapons other than firearms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0886260512462301">Miller &amp; Humphreys, 1980</xref>), which is the most common type of weapon used in average homicides. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0886260512462301">Tomsen (2009)</xref> found that “bashing” was the most common cause of death, while some victims were both stabbed and beaten with blunt household objects. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0886260512462301">Tomsen (2009</xref>, p. 65) speculated that “a more hands-on approach” was needed to increase gratification for some offenders. Instances of “overkill” have also been found to be common in anti-LGBT homicides including excessive beating of victims’ heads and postmortem stabbings and mutilation. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0886260512462301">Janoff (2005)</xref>, for instance, found that 60% of sexual orientation bias homicide cases involved extraordinary or excessive violence. Finally, some scholars have found that this type of violence tends to target strangers representative of the LGBT community (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0886260512462301">Herek &amp; Berrill, 1992</xref>). Studies have found, for instance, that approximately 40% of victims were strangers, while slightly less were friends or acquaintances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0886260512462301">Tomsen, 2009</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0886260512462301">
<title>Research Expectations</title>
<p>Drawing from the doing gender approach and other studies reviewed above, it is possible to posit research expectations regarding the similarities and differences in anti-LGBT homicides and average homicides in the United States. As for homicide suspects, it is expected that offenders of anti-LGBT homicides will be more likely to be White, male, and younger than common homicide offenders. It is expected that anti-LGBT homicide incidents will be more likely to be perpetrated by multiple suspects using weapons other than firearms against unknown victims who represent the LGBT community, while average homicides will be more likely to consist of fatal shootings that are perpetrated by single suspects against known victims.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0886260512462301" sec-type="methods">
<title>Method</title>
<p>A number of steps were involved in the preparation of anti-LGBT homicide data and average homicide data for this study. In this section, issues of identifying anti-LGBT homicide events from open-sources (e.g., advocacy group reports) are discussed. Then, the process for gathering open-source information and coding of sexual orientation bias homicide events are outlined. Next, this section describes data sampled to represent the average homicide event for purposes of comparison. Finally, how homicide offender and incident variables are measured follows.</p>
<sec id="section6-0886260512462301">
<title>Identifying Homicide Events</title>
<p>This study identified all known anti-LGBT homicides occurring in the United States between 1990 and 2008 from open-sources. Homicides were identified by systematically searching sources, such as crime chronologies located in existing advocacy group reports (e.g., Human Rights Campaign [HRC], National Gay &amp; Lesbian Task Force [NGTLF], Southern Poverty Law Center [SPLC], National Center for Anti-Violence Programs [NCAVP]), as well as systematic print news media searches using the <italic>LexisNexis</italic> search engine. Keywords were systematically employed to guarantee that searches of news print stories of anti-LGBT homicides (e.g., homosexual, lesbian, bisexual, transgender, homicide) were captured. Successful identification of anti-LGBT homicides was likely influenced by the relative novelty of these crimes. As anti-LGBT homicides involve novel motivational circumstances, these events are even more likely to become high-profile crimes. Although they occur less frequently than other types of crimes, bias homicides may be more likely to receive news media attention.</p>
<p>There are two other issues to consider that may shape the identification of anti-LGBT homicides. First, it is possible that the sexual orientation bias motivational circumstances never come to the attention of authorities or others. Unfortunately, the number of homicides in this category will remain unknown. Second, some homicides for which less is known about the motivational circumstances may be listed as potential anti-LGBT crimes by advocacy groups based largely on speculation. To avoid including such crimes, the current study relies on a set of bias indicators to serve as inclusion criteria for anti-LGBT homicides, as discussed in more detail below. This study also follows <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0886260512462301">Iganski (2008)</xref> who relied on a victim-based conceptualization of bias crimes. Rather than risk being stalled in the debate regarding if offenders actually have “hatred” for victims, the question remains whether or not victims were targeted because of their actual or perceived gender identity or sexual orientation. As critics of bias crimes laws have noted, determining offenders’ thoughts or feelings is not only a difficult task but it is also legally suspect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0886260512462301">Jacobs, 1993</xref>). In this study, speculative or unsubstantiated claims by witnesses of suspect motives were inadequate alone for case inclusion. Instead, a set of incident and suspect-based behavioral inclusion criteria were utilized to determine why victims were initially targeted. By relying on this “discriminatory selection model” it remains unnecessary to determine the extent that anti-LGBT violence was motivated by offenders’ thoughts and beliefs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0886260512462301">Lawrence, 1999</xref>, pp. 29-30).</p>
<p>For a homicide event to be included in this study, it must involve one or more <italic>primary indicators</italic> shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0886260512462301">Table 1</xref>. Primary indicators are homicide characteristics that demonstrate that offenders selected victims in part or solely because of victims’ sexual orientation or gender identity.</p>

<p>Most homicides involved multiple indicators of sexual orientation bias. Primary indicators include verbal harassment and taunts, symbolic manipulation of victims’ bodies, symbolic homicide location, mode of victim selection, filing of official hate crime charges, offender admission of sexual orientation bias, and prior anti-LGBT crimes perpetrated by the offender. In addition, a number of <italic>secondary indicators</italic> were identified that alone did not indicate motive but provided supplemental information for event classification. Secondary indicators include a lack of ulterior motive (e.g., robbery), victim attire (e.g., male in female clothes), and evidence of overkill. Based on the primary and secondary indicators, this set of homicides represents those events for which there was ample evidence to determine that victims’ sexual orientation influenced their victimization. There were 120 sexual orientation bias homicides between 1990 and 2008 that were identified from open-sources.</p>
<p>In <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0886260512462301">Table 2</xref>, victim gender and sexual orientation (or gender identity) characteristics are provided. Only one victim for every anti-LGBT homicide is represented in the table; however, approximately 93% of all anti-LGBT homicides involved only one fatality. Based on available evidence, it appears that most anti-LGBT homicides between 1990 and 2008 targeted males (94.2%).</p>

<p>In addition, available evidence indicates that over 70% of homicides targeted gay males, while less than 5% targeted lesbians (females) and less than 2% targeted bisexuals. Nine anti-LGBT homicides actually targeted victims known to be heterosexual but who were perceived as being gay. Unfortunately, it was not possible to identity victims’ actual sexual orientation with confidence; though it was clear that in all cases victims were targeted because of their perceived sexual orientation or gender identity.</p>
<p>While the proportion of homicides targeting transgender victims is relatively substantial, many homicides of transgender individuals were excluded from the study due to a lack of clear indicators of anti-LGBT bias. For example, many transgender homicide victims not included in the study were found murdered in the dress of the opposite sex in outdoor and public locations. While some have speculated that victims were targeted for being transgender, these cases were not included unless there were other primary indicators of bias (as described above).</p>

<title>Open-Source Searching of Anti-LGBT Homicides</title>
<p>Some of the key information on anti-LGBT homicide events was gathered during the homicide identification process of each event from open-sources. To supplement this information, an open-search protocol was developed and used to search for additional information on each homicide. There were a number of steps to this open-search process. First, a number of reports and chronologies produced by extremist group watchdog organizations, advocacy groups, and other nonprofit organizations were thoroughly searched for additional information. Second, homicide event details (e.g., perpetrator and victim names, location of homicide, etc.) were used as keywords to search major newspapers. Third, keywords were used to search for information on homicides from major search engines. A number of less popular search engines (e.g., GoogleScholar, Dogpile, Scirus, etc.) were also searched using identical and similar keywords in order to generate and collect all available information for each homicide and homicide participants. Fourth, for some cases it was necessary to retrieve information about specific homicides from <italic>Newslibrary</italic>, a subscription-based online newspaper index of various regional and local newspapers around the country.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0886260512462301">
<title>Coding Anti-LGBT Homicides</title>
<p>The collected open-source materials produced information for each homicide event and research assistants (or coders) inputted these data into electronic codebooks that were used for this study. All coders went through extensive training on the coding process for each variable. Each new coder entered into a probationary status in which he or she coded a number of duplicate cases as seasoned coders. Therefore, this study was able to explore the data for abnormalities across coders. Similar to the searching process, coding of homicide events occurred in successive stages. In the first stage, coders entered data for variables based on all available open-source information. Because many of these homicide cases were not closed and continued to evolve, missing observations were continuously filled in based on newly gathered open-source information. This presented continued opportunity for coders to correct and update their past coding work, as well as the work of fellow open-source coders.</p>
<p>For purposes of comparison, 610 homicides were sampled from the 2000 Uniform Crime Reports-Supplementary Homicide Report (SHR). The year 2000 was selected as a midpoint between the 1990 and 2008 time frame. Homicide data from the SHR are collected by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and made available to researchers from the Interuniversity Consortium for Political and Social Research. Approximately five comparison homicides were randomly sampled from the SHR for every anti-LGBT homicide. These homicides represent the “average” homicide in the United States and the characteristics of homicide events most likely to occur. Randomly selecting average homicides ensures that anti-LGBT events are being compared to common types of homicide most likely to occur in the United States. This strategy used to sample comparison homicide cases has been successfully incorporated into prior research on extremist violence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0886260512462301">Gruenewald, 2011</xref>). Because these homicides are randomly sampled from all homicide events in the United States, it is possible that sexual orientation bias homicides in 2000 will also be captured in the comparison data. Due to the statistical unlikeliness of this occurring, this possibility was not deemed a threat to the validity of findings.</p>

<p>A number of homicide incident variables were also considered. The primary weapon<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0886260512462301">3</xref></sup> was measured with five categories. The first category was <italic>firearm</italic>, which included all types of long guns and handguns. The second category was <italic>knives or other types of sharp cutting instruments</italic>. The third category was <italic>blunt objects</italic>, which could be any type of solid object used to beat a victim. The fourth type of weapon captured was <italic>bodily weapons</italic>, which included fists, boots, and so on. Finally, an <italic>other weapons</italic> category was included to capture all other weapon types.</p>
<p>The relationship between primary victim and primary offender was measured as well with three categories, including strangers, friends/acquaintances, and family. <italic>Strangers</italic> included all instances for which there was no evidence that the offender knew the victim. <italic>Friends/acquaintances</italic> was a broad category that included neighbors, coworkers, persons known only for a brief amount of time, as well as, long-term friends. <italic>Family and intimates</italic> included all victims and offenders who were related by blood or by marriage, as well as, by anyone who was at one point or another involved in a romantic relationship.</p>
<p>The number of offenders and number of victims involved in each homicide were also captured as continuous measures. Number of offenders referred to the number of offenders charged in each homicide, while number of victims referred to the total number of deaths in each event.</p>
<p>In this study, the temporal and the sociogeographical context of homicide events was also considered. The number of anti-LGBT homicides was measured for every year between 1990 and 2008. Region of homicide was broken into five U.S. Census-based regional categories, including Midwest, Pacific, Northeast, West, and South. Also based on information from the Census, the population of the town or city for each homicide was considered. Finally, this study measured whether or not homicides occurred in highly populated areas (200,000 or more) or less-populated towns and cities (199,999 or less).</p>

<title>Findings</title>
<p>As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0886260512462301">Table 3</xref>, primary offenders of anti-LGBT homicides were overwhelmingly White (73.4%). One of the most apparent differences between anti-LGBT and average homicides was in race. Less than 20% of sexual orientation bias offenders were Black, compared to nearly 45% of average homicide offenders. However, these differences may also be due to the fact that anti-LGBT homicides perpetrated by Black offenders are less newsworthy, thus less visible using open-source searching strategies.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0886260512462301">4</xref></sup> <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0886260512462301">Table 3</xref> shows that sexual orientation bias offenders were overwhelmingly male. In contrast, slightly less average homicides (9.4%) involved female offenders.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0886260512462301">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>Sexual orientation bias homicide offenders were also substantially younger, approximately 25 years of age, compared to average homicide offenders who have a mean age of approximately 32 years. As expected, anti-LGBT homicide offenders were proportionately more likely to be young White males compared to the average homicide offender. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0886260512462301">Table 3</xref> also shows that sexual orientation homicides were proportionately more likely to be committed with less lethal weapons. More specifically, anti-LGBT homicides were proportionately more likely than average homicides to involve stabbings (28.7% compared to 16.4%), blunt objects (16.4% compared to 7.7%), and bodily weapons (22.1% compared to 10.9%).</p>
<p>The findings for victim–offender relationship are somewhat more surprising, as approximately 33% of anti-LGBT offenders knew their victims prior to the homicide. Therefore, anti-LGBT homicides were not much more likely to target unknown victims. There are substantial differences, however, in the proportion of family and victims and offenders who were at some point romantically involved for bias homicides (1%) and average homicides (26.7%). If victims were acquainted with offenders only briefly (i.e., a few hours) was also measured for anti-LGBT homicides, though this information was not available for comparison homicide data. Interestingly, approximately 15% (<italic>n</italic> = 18) of all sexual orientation bias homicides involved victims and offenders who knew each other only briefly.</p>
<p>As expected, anti-LGBT homicides were proportionately more likely to involve multiple offenders (42.7%) compared to average homicides (15.7%). Only a very small percentage of homicides, less than 10%, were linked to formal hate groups or extremist ideologies, thus supporting past research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0886260512462301">Bradley, 2007</xref>). The difference between the numbers of victims across homicide types was less dramatic, as slightly over 7% of anti-LGBT homicides involved multiple victims compared to nearly 4% of average homicides. The most anti-LGBT homicides that occurred in a particular year was in 1999, while the FBI reported only two anti-LGBT homicides for this same year in the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0886260512462301">FBI, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0886260512462301">Figure 1</xref>, the least number of homicides to have occurred in any single year was in 1990. One explanation for the high number of this type of homicide during 1999 is that law enforcement were more likely to report anti-LGBT homicide following the high-profile murder of Mathew Shepard in 1998. However, law enforcement were the least likely to report such incidents before the passage of the 1990 hate crimes legislation. There does not appear to be any major differences in the regional contexts of homicides across types. The most substantial difference was in homicides that occurred in the Northeast region of the country, as 23% of anti-LGBT homicides in the United States occurred in the Northeast compared to approximately 14% of average homicide occurrences. This difference was most likely due to the large number of anti-LGBT homicides that occurred in the New York City metropolitan area. It should be noted, however, that there was little difference in homicides occurring in cities of over 200,000 between anti-LGBT homicides (50.8%) and average homicides (53.2%).</p>

<title>Multivariate Analyses</title>
<p>The descriptive statistics indicate some potentially important differences across homicide types, but tell us little about the relative significance of each homicide predictor. Therefore, this section presents findings for a multivariate comparative analysis of anti-LGBT homicides and average homicide events. The purpose of this analysis was to statistically identify important differences between situational and suspect-related factors across homicide types. Binary-logistic regression was an appropriate regression tool for this analysis as the dependent variable was measured with a binary-coded variable (1 = sexual orientation bias homicide, 0 = average homicide; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0886260512462301">Long, 1997</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0886260512462301">LaFree &amp; Birkbeck, 1991</xref>). The race and age of primary homicide offenders were considered, though suspect gender was not included in the regression analysis due to a lack of statistical variation. Primary offender race was recoded into a binary variable (1 = White, 0 = non-White) in order to examine whether anti-LGBT offenders were significantly more likely to be White compared to average homicide offenders.</p>
<p>The findings in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0886260512462301">Table 4</xref> reveal that anti-LGBT homicide offenders were more than twice as likely as average homicide offenders to be White net the effects of other variables. Primary anti-LGBT homicide offenders were also significantly younger than average homicide offenders, while controlling for other potentially influential variables, thus supporting descriptive results and research expectations.</p>

<p>Homicide incident variables were also included in the multivariate analysis. To better understand how the use of firearms compared across homicide types, weapon was recoded into a binary variable (1 = firearm, 0 = non-firearm). As expected, anti-LGBT homicides were significantly less likely to involve firearms relative to average homicides net the effects of other variables. Victim–offender relationship was also recoded in order to compare homicides in which the victim was known (or a stranger) by offenders across homicide type. Interestingly, there were no significant differences when controlling for other variables in known victim–offender relationship across homicide types. Descriptive results indicated that anti-LGBT homicides proportionately involved more offenders and victims compared to average homicides. The multivariate regression findings shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0886260512462301">Table 4</xref> reveal that these differences were significant across homicide types while controlling for other potential influences.</p>
<p>Finally, social and geographic contextual variables were also included in the multivariate analysis. Both types of homicides were most prevalent in the Southern region of the United States, while average homicides were slightly proportionately more likely to occur in the South compared to sexual orientation bias homicides. Therefore, region was recoded into a binary variable (1 = South, 0 = other region). There were no significant differences in region across homicide types when controlling for other variables. Population size was also included in the analysis. The difference between homicide types was only slightly significant (<italic>p</italic> ≤ .1).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0886260512462301">Herek (1990</xref>, p. 316) described anti-gay violence as an “. . . extension of the heterosexism that pervades American society.” Although anti-LGBT homicides remain relatively rare, this form of violence remains a serious problem. At a time when violent crimes are declining overall, the National Coalition of Anti-Violence Programs (NCAVP) has noted increases in anti-gay murders in recent years (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0886260512462301">NCAVP, 2008</xref>). Importantly, these apparent increases may have much to do with the increased willingness of law enforcement to report anti-LGBT violence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0886260512462301">Jacobs &amp; Henry, 1996</xref>). Regardless, violence involving antisexual orientation bias has been thought to be vastly underreported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0886260512462301">Berrill, 1990</xref>, p. 279; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0886260512462301">NCAVP, 2008</xref>), and studying anti-LGBT homicides may provide the best chance for examining this form of violence due to open-source data availability.</p>
<p>The finding that anti-LGBT homicide offenders also tend to be younger (males) supports past research and the doing gender theory. Young males have the most need to define their gender identity and prove their masculinity to others. They also have the least alternative resources for accomplishing masculinity, such as gainful employment, and have yet to transition into adult male roles. That anti-LGBT offenders are more often White than the average homicide offender also supports doing gender theory. Scholars have suggested that it is young White males who grow up in the working and middle classes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0886260512462301">Cotton, 1992</xref>, p. 3000) that are more likely affected by shifts in the labor market and policies promoting increased opportunities (e.g., affirmative action policies) for women, racial/ethnic minorities, and sexual orientation minorities. In response, some young, White males may resort to violence in order to accomplish masculinity and establish conformance to adult heterosexual social roles.</p>
<p>Doing gender theory can also be used to put incident-level findings into context. This study found that sexual orientation bias homicides were significantly more likely to involve weapons other than firearms, which is the most frequently used and most efficient mode of killing for average homicides in the United States. This could indicate that the purpose of this violence is not only to kill victims. Scholars have suggested that bias violence offenders seek status and prestige through victim suffering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0886260512462301">Bufkin, 1999</xref>). Brutal killings involve slashings, beatings, and other forms of prolonged and tortuous death. This type of violence makes a statement of disdain for victims and demonstrates to peers and onlookers that offenders are masculine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0886260512462301">Cotton, 1992</xref>, p. 3000). Other situational explanations should also be considered. For instance, it may be that bias offenders tend to rely on alternative weapons because anti-LGBT homicides are less likely to be premeditated. Instead, these events evolve from confrontation to violent transaction more quickly and the use of bodily weapons and blunt objects becomes more likely.</p>
<p>The doing gender theory also sheds light on the significant results for multiple offenders involved in anti-LGBT homicides. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0886260512462301">Messerschmidt (1993</xref>, p. 100) argued that violence in the presence of other young, White males reaffirms commitment to heterosexuality. Offenders receive instant affirmation and “positive feedback” during attacks on sexual orientation minorities which serve as both cues and motivators to other offenders (Bufkin, 199, p.163).Other benefits of group attacks can include the deflection of responsibility and lowering the risk of failing to overpower victims, which could lead to both humiliation and threatened masculinity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0886260512462301">Messerschmidt, 1993</xref>). One somewhat surprising finding was the lack of significant differences in victim–offender relations across homicide types. It appears that anti-LGBT homicide offenders are no more likely to target strangers than average offenders. Offenders often have intricate knowledge of victims and their sexual preferences. Indeed, some homicides occurred following actual or perceived sexual advances, which served as direct threats to masculinity. Many of these violent transactions developed very quickly and occurred within the context of recreational alcohol and drug use. Often offenders felt justified in their behavior toward the victim as they viewed violence as “self-defense” in response to victims’ provocations. The large percentage of known victims for anti-LGBT homicides could also be partially due to how the category of “known victims” was coded. As discussed before, many victims of anti-LGBT homicides became acquainted with their offenders only a few hours before their deaths. These relationships are very different in nature from homicide participants who were acquainted for much longer periods of time. More research is needed to examine similarities and differences in victim–offender relationships.</p>
<p>There are a number of implications based on the findings of this study for police, policymakers, and theory. One of the strengths of this study is the utilization of a rich source of national anti-LGBT homicide data. Based on strict inclusion criteria, these data capture more of the actual universe of sexual orientation bias homicides than official data sources. Police agencies can integrate this study’s findings into their training materials in order to better identify, profile, and investigate homicides that target sexual orientation minorities.</p>
<p>Policymakers and advocacy groups can also use the findings from this study to inform their positions on the bias crimes laws debate. To claim that anti-LGBT homicides are no different from other common homicides is misleading, as this study showed that this is clearly not the case. This type of fatal violence is more likely to involve multiple perpetrators and victims, more intimate weaponry, and are more likely to be committed by a particular demographic of offenders (young, White males). Thus, these findings suggest that anti-LGBT violence is a unique phenomenon more prevalent among certain social groups that may inflict unique harms on victims.</p>
<p>This study drew from doing gender theory and supported the tenets of this explanatory model. In some situations, when other resources were lacking, young, White males used violence against sexual orientation minorities as a resource for accomplishing masculinity. Offenders commit this violence with others to demonstrate their commitment to hegemonic forms of heterosexuality and the rejections of alternative sexual orientations and gender identities. Nonetheless, a more in-depth examination of these dynamic transactions is necessary to fully consider how homicide participants “do gender.” Future research that assesses how offenders and victims interact before, during, and after bias violence will advance our understanding of how offenders accomplish masculinity in different situational contexts. Future research should also consider variations in sexual orientation minority victims in order to examine variations in the nature of extremist violence in more depth. What is more, research needs to empirically consider nonfatal forms of anti-LGBT violence as these attacks will likely have unique patterns and contexts. Finally, alternative situation-based explanations for anti-LGBT offending should be considered in addition to the doing gender approach.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>This study overcame limitations of existing bias crimes data by relying on an open-source database that captured a wider set of known anti-LGBT homicide events. In this way, it was possible to move past anecdotal evidence and speculation regarding similarities and differences in this form of domestic extremism from the average homicide. Laying the empirical groundwork, is a necessary step to a more informed debate over the uniqueness of anti-LGBT violence in the United States. Based on this research, future research should work to expand our understanding of this rare, complex, and serious form of violence.</p>
