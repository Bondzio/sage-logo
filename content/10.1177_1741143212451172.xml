<abstract>
<p>This article explores the ways in which leadership and management development (LMD) in England has been researched and analysed over the past 40 years. The article is in two parts. The first analyses the ways in which patterns of provision have evolved in response to changing conceptions of how the school system should be organized and how, consequently, the roles of those responsible for administering, managing and leading it should be constructed. This analysis shows how patterns of LMD provision have changed, with a slow but consistent movement from relatively limited and fragmented provision to one of the most centralized forms in the world. The second part broadens out the analysis, using as a framework three ‘perspectives’: the functionalist, the constructivist and the critical. It explores the literature on LMD, identifying areas of consensus or conflict, and suggesting where more work needs to be done. This includes more work from a variety of constructivist perspectives, especially on leader identity formation; more critical analysis of the content and processes of LMD; and more work on the ways in which power is distributed and used in LMD, especially at the ‘meso' level between the individual programme or activity and national policy.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>This journal has published a number of surveys of the history of the provision of leadership and management development in England since its foundation in 1972 until the mid-2000s (for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1741143212451172">Glatter, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1741143212451172">Hughes, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr99-1741143212451172">Wallace and Hall, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1741143212451172">Bolam, 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1741143212451172">2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1741143212451172">Brundrett, 2001</xref>). The purpose of this article is to bring the story that these papers describe up to date, to explore how this history has been reflected in the research literature over these years, and to suggest some pointers towards the future. As always in this field there is a problem of terminology: the terms ‘training’, ‘development’, ‘education’ and, more broadly, ‘learning’ are all widely used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1741143212451172">Mabey and Finch-Lees, 2008</xref>: 33–37). The use of these terms varies, sometimes arbitrarily and sometimes reflecting deeper issues of meaning. For the purposes of this article the term ‘leadership and management development’ (LMD) will be used to encompass the other terms and to reflect the broad focus of the article.</p>
<p>The article is primarily concerned with LMD for education in England. This is partly because the English experience, especially that of recent years, is in many ways unique and also quite complex: an article of this length is necessary to do it justice. More pragmatically, the starting point for this review was a consideration of articles on LMD and related topics which have been published in <italic>Educational Management Administration &amp; Leadership</italic> (<italic>EMAL</italic>) (and its predecessors) since its inception. A large majority of these articles centre on the English experience, and <italic>EMAL, </italic>as one of the primary UK journals in its field, can be argued to be representative of the academic discourse within which that experience has been located. Nevertheless, other journals have been searched for articles on LMD in England, to provide as representative a review of work with this focus as possible. The emphasis, therefore, is on how the evolving pattern of LMD has been theorized and on how it has been explored empirically.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1741143212451172">1</xref>
</sup> The review covers work published up to the end of 2011. It makes little reference, therefore, to the significant changes in the LMD landscape resulting from the election of the Conservative—Liberal Democrat coalition government in May 2010. These changes are referred to in the last part of the article. Despite the focus on England, it is hoped that much of the discussion, especially the attempt to produce a structured analysis of the literature on LMD will have wider resonances.</p>
<p>The article begins with an analysis of the ways in which patterns of provision have evolved in response to changing conceptions of how the school system should be organized and how, consequently, the roles of those responsible for administering, managing and leading the system should be constructed. Such an analysis shows how these changing conceptions and constructions have been reflected in changing patterns of provision with a slow but consistent movement from relatively limited and fragmented provision of LMD to one of the most centralized forms in the world. The second half of the article broadens out the analysis, using as a framework three ‘perspectives’: the functionalist, the constructivist and the critical. These enable the ways in which LMD for education has been treated in the literature to be explored, identifying areas where there is consensus or conflict, and suggesting where more work needs to be done. The conclusion draws the threads of the argument together and points towards the future.</p>

<title>Three Eras of Leadership and Management Development</title>
<p>In the most recent historical survey, Ray <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1741143212451172">Bolam (2004</xref>) suggested that the history of provision of LMD could be divided into three eras: ‘Ad hoc provision’ in the late 1960s and early 1970s, ‘Towards coherence and collaboration’ from the late 1970s to the end of the 1990s, and ‘A National College’ since the turn of the millennium. The analysis in this article uses a similar categorization of eras, but one which describes and analyses these in rather different ways, focusing on changes in conceptions about the kind of school system that was desired and, consequently, the kinds of people that should run it.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1741143212451172">2</xref>
</sup> The evolving title of the journal is instructive here. Beginning simply as <italic>Educational Administration</italic> in 1973, the word <italic>Management</italic> was added 10 years later in 1982, and this formulation survived for another 22 years until <italic>Leadership</italic> was added in 2004. Although the dates involved here might be challenged, it is helpful to analyse the history of the field in this country and hence of the practices explored in this article in relation to three eras: those of ‘administration’, of ‘management and of ‘leadership’.<sup>

<title>The Era of Administration: 1944 until the mid-1980s</title>
<p>This era covers a period that stretches back to before the journal was founded. It was embodied in the administrative structure of English education which was created by the Education Act 1944. This period was characterized by what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1741143212451172">Clarke and Newman (1997</xref>) have termed a ‘bureau-professional regime’, through which the welfare state, including education, was structured through a combination of high degrees of professional autonomy enacted within a broad framework of administrative rules and procedures. The system was often described as ‘a national system locally administered’, and the key players were local education authorities (LEAs) and the schools themselves. The underpinning values of the bureau-professional model were derived from the assumptions and practices of the constituent professions of the human services and, consequently, administrators were socialized within these values, which typically were based in ideas of equity, care and social justice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1741143212451172">Clarke and Newman, 1997</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1741143212451172">Gewirtz et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-1741143212451172">Simkins, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>Within this context, ‘educational administration’ was typically conceived to encompass those in positions of responsibility both in schools and LEAs.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1741143212451172">4</xref>
</sup> However, as the period progressed there was increasing uncertainty about the nature of these roles and the preparation necessary for them. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1741143212451172">Glatter (1979</xref>: 19) alluded to the low key role of the ‘humble administrator’ and drew attention to the distinction made by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1741143212451172">Andrews (1980</xref>) between the ‘generic’ and ‘specialist’ professional models of administration. The former involved administrators being ‘promoted from the pool of experienced teachers … [and] where training does exist it is not usually extensive and reliance is placed primarily on experience in the job’; the latter saw administration as a sub-profession growing out of the teaching profession with ‘appointments to senior positions [being] made from the pool of those who have successfully completed an extensive graduate programme in educational administration’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1741143212451172">Glatter, 1979</xref>: 22–23). Analysis of the dilemmas involved here was taken further in Hughes’ influential work which, in relation to headship, developed the idea of ‘professional-as-administrator’, a role that involved seeking accommodation between the complex and sometimes conflicting sub-roles of ‘leading professional’ and ‘chief executive’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1741143212451172">Hughes, 1985</xref>), a distinction that prefigured key aspects of the debates of later eras.</p>
<p>In this period, the English system of administrator development, insofar as it existed, reflected both the ‘generic model’ and the locally based system that it supported. The custodians were seen to be the LEAs and universities, although these two players approached the problem from very different positions. University provision was typically embedded in social science theory,<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1741143212451172">5</xref>
</sup> while LEA provision, in contrast, comprised short courses that were primarily based in practice. The result was a somewhat uneasy alliance between what were essentially two parallel forms of LMD provision, within a diverse, fragmented and relatively low key ‘patchwork quilt’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1741143212451172">Glatter, 1979</xref>: 27). Reporting on his 1980 survey of provision in England and Wales, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1741143212451172">Hughes (1982</xref>: 14) was very critical of this fragmentation of short course provision in particular, calling for ‘a bold and imaginative initiative … to stimulate, but not in any way compel or control, the growth of a country-wide network of training activities in school management’. Echoes of this view were to resonate more and more loudly in the ensuing decades.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1741143212451172">
<title>The Era of Management: The Mid 1980s to 1997</title>
<p>By the mid-1970s the bureau-professional regime was increasingly being challenged by the suggestion that school standards were too variable or, indeed, inadequate, and that this was the result of insufficient pressures within the system for effective performance. This was reflected in the gradual introduction of management ideas into the discourse, but the defining legislative moment of this era was the passing of the Education Reform Act 1988, which fundamentally redistributed power in the English educational system. Powers over the school curriculum were drawn to the centre, while major powers over staffing, finance and other matters were devolved from LEAs to schools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1741143212451172">
<italic>EMAL Special Edition,</italic> 2008</xref>). These changes were part of a wider movement towards a ‘managerialist’ reconstitution of the public sector more generally which has been discussed widely elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1741143212451172">Pollitt, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-1741143212451172">Simkins, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1741143212451172">Learmonth, 2005</xref>). The discourse surrounding these changes produced a form of resolution of the ambiguities surrounding the administrator role that was characteristic of the previous era. Administrators were reconstituted as ‘managers’ with responsibility for the performance of the devolved school system against criteria that were centrally determined in Westminster.</p>
<p>Three particular developments in relation to LMD can be identified during this period. First, the expectations placed on LMD became more explicit, with an increasing focus on the identification of standards and competences for managers and the development of technologies, such as assessment centres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1741143212451172">Lyons et al., 1993</xref>) associated with these. General occupational standards, such as those developed through the Management Charter Initiative (MCI) were soon imported into education, with specific standards developed by School Management South (SMS) and later by the Teacher Training Agency (TTA). In a detailed review of these approaches, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1741143212451172">Earley (1993</xref>: 235) suggested that many potential benefits in relation to both personal and organization development had been identified – for example, in relation to accreditation, self-assessment, appraisal or institutional/team review – and stated ‘it could be argued that they are particularly valuable for both institutions and individuals as the move towards school-based management development takes place’.</p>
<p>Second, conceptions of what LMD comprised became both sharper and broader. For example, the National Development Centre (NDC), which was nationally funded to promote the ideas of management development to LEAs and schools, outlined a ‘model for managing the development and training process’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr99-1741143212451172">Wallace and Hall, 1989</xref>: 166), emphasizing the importance of balancing individual, school and broader system needs, and encouraging</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>a wide range of on the job (e.g. coaching, job rotation), close to the job (e.g. school visits, team building), and off the job activities (e.g. short external training courses, award-bearing courses and secondments) to meet both short and long term needs. (1989: 167)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The model did not include any explicit reference to the values or philosophical principles that should underpin such activities, although it did lay the foundations for a wider concept of management development that was continuously reasserted over the ensuing periods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1741143212451172">Bolam, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1741143212451172">Brundrett, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1741143212451172">Bush, 2009</xref>). More generally, however, there was a shift in the kinds of knowledge that underpinned the discourse of development, with the social sciences initially being complemented by and then increasingly replaced by management theory, often adapted from business contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1741143212451172">Gunter and Thomson, 2010</xref>).<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1741143212451172">6</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Third, during this period central government attempted for the first time to influence provision of LMD and produce a somewhat more co-ordinated approach. Initially central control remained weak. LEAs were given responsibility for determining how the central funds – which were provided not just for management and leadership development but for in-service education for teachers more generally – would be spent. This led increasingly to a market developing with a range of providers competing for government funding and a continuing focus on courses external to the school (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr99-1741143212451172">Wallace and Hall, 1989</xref>). However, by 1989 Wallace and Hall noted in many LEAs:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>an urgent sense of having to respond quickly and appropriately to immediate specific needs rather than make long-term plans for the future … Considerable attention is being paid by both LEAs and schools to individual initiatives rather than the complete package of innovations. (1989: 172)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Many of these needs now arose from the demands made on heads and senior school staff by the Education Reform Act. Direct central intervention also increased. Compulsory appraisal of headteachers was introduced in 1991; the TTA, which was set up in 1994, embraced the competencies approach by establishing a set of ‘tasks and abilities’ required of headteachers; a development programme for newly appointed heads – HEADLAMP – was introduced in 1995 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1741143212451172">Gunraj and Rutherford, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1741143212451172">Blandford and Squire, 2000</xref>); and in 1997 the TTA introduced the National Professional Qualification for Headship (NPQH), the first of a collection of centrally designed and controlled programmes that were increasingly to dominate the leadership development landscape in England in the years to come.</p>
<p>By the mid-1990s, then, the reforms of the late 1980s were embedded. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1741143212451172">Bolam (1997</xref>: 271) noted, headteachers and other senior staff:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>are required to have strategic leadership, planning, marketing, evaluation and development skills; to focus much more directly than hitherto on student learning and assessment; to operate as a quasi chief executive in relation to school governors; to work collaboratively with parents and the community; to work productively with external inspectors; to co-operate as well as compete with colleague heads in neighbouring schools.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The history of this period, therefore, is one in which central government is active in the policy area of LMD for the first time. However, its approach embodied an on-going tension between the desire to co-ordinate provision in response to the perceived needs of fundamental policy changes for schooling on the one hand and a belief in the effectiveness of markets in organizing provision on the other. The outcome initially was a classic case of ‘policy steering’: central funding symbolized the policy significance of management development and training, decentralization of provision reflected market principles, but the severe pressures placed on the system by legislation had the effect of forcing provision in the desired direction. Alongside these developments, however, governments were clearly considering a more interventionist stance and by the end of the period the first elements of that approach were in place.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1741143212451172">
<title>The Era of Leadership: since 1997</title>
<p>As these developments were occurring the discourse was changing. ‘Management’ of devolved responsibilities was no longer seen to be enough. Despite the reforms of the late 1980s, political concerns about the performance of the school system had not gone away – if anything they had increased. The Labour government, which came to office in 1997, articulated a ‘modernization’ agenda, which built on the Conservatives’ framework of school autonomy and accountability, but added a further ingredient – ‘leadership’ – which was seen as providing a much stronger agentic thrust in instituting change and improving performance in the public sector in general and among schools in particular than the more conservative idea of ‘management’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1741143212451172">Newman, 2005</xref>; O’Reilly and Reed, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1741143212451172">2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1741143212451172">2011</xref>). This move was embodied in the establishment of the National College for School Leadership (NCSL) in 2000.</p>
<p>The NCSL soon developed a ‘leadership development framework’ comprising five stages of school leadership around which it built a comprehensive programme of courses, with at their core a suite of programmes linked to the framework, comprising Leading from the Middle (LftM), Leadership Pathways for senior school leaders, NPQH (taken over from the TTA) and the Leadership Programme for Serving Headteachers (LPSH).</p>
<p>Since its foundation, the NCSL has been the focus of increasing numbers of papers on LMD in England published in <italic>EMAL</italic> and elsewhere. A special edition of <italic>EMAL</italic> was devoted to the College in 2004, and since then there have been many other papers, especially evaluations of particular programmes offered by the College. A number of writers have noted ways in which the National College presented a break from most of what had gone before, citing the leadership development framework, the advocacy and support of networked learning communities, the extensive use of modern technologies, and the comprehensiveness of its programmes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1741143212451172">Bush, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1741143212451172">Bolam, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-1741143212451172">Riley and Mulford, 2007</xref>). In responding to the articles in the 2004 special issue, Geoff <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr94-1741143212451172">Southworth (2004</xref>: 345), Director of Research at the College, noted that, with an estimated potential clientele of 250,000 leaders and potential leaders, ‘programmes alone cannot meet or serve the needs of all these leaders: the scale of the task is too great’. In responding to this challenge, he (2004: 346, 349) emphasized a number of themes that have resonated in the College’s work over the years: the significance of distributed leadership and the importance of developing the capacity of schools to contribute as major players in meeting the scale of the leadership development challenge; the need to consider leadership at system as well as school level in order to address concerns about fragmentation in an increasingly diverse school system; and, ‘avoiding any one approach’, the ‘need to develop a far more discriminating and differentiated view of school leadership’ and, associated with this, leadership development activities ‘which are personalized to [leaders’] individual needs and circumstances’.</p>
<p>By 2010, therefore, the landscape of LMD for schools in England has been transformed. To quote <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1741143212451172">Bolam (2004</xref>: 255, 260) again:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>… over a generation, what is probably the most comprehensive and sophisticated national school leadership development model in the world has been gradually, and incrementally, developed in circumstances that are distinctive, and in some respects, unique … There can be little doubt that the college’s overall conception, scale, and execution represent a paradigm shift in comparison with predecessor models both internationally and in England and Wales. </p>
</disp-quote>
<p>However, with hindsight it can be seen that the NCSL was the natural continuation of earlier developments, albeit representing a step change from previous arrangements. As government concerns about the performance of the school system grew, and the relatively ‘soft’ concept of administration was replaced first by ’management’ and then by ‘leadership’, a fragmented system of LMD operating independently of government support or interference had over a period less than 20 years been completely transformed. First, a market system had been introduced, part-funded by and then increasingly steered by the centre, initially through the NDC but then increasingly by the power of legislation to influence provision. Alongside this a number of more interventionist initiatives were experimented with, particularly the NPQH, which was phased in as a mandatory qualification for new headteachers from 2004. Finally, these isolated initiatives provided the basis for the establishment of the National College.</p>

<p>A number of possible frameworks are available to help us make sense of both the history described above and the ways in which LMD has been represented in the literature. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1741143212451172">Gunter and Ribbins (2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1741143212451172">2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-1741143212451172">Ribbins and Gunter, 2002</xref>) in their mapping of ‘knowers, knowing and knowledge’, suggest six ‘provinces of knowledge’ in the field of educational leadership: conceptual, descriptive, humanistic, critical, evaluative and instrumental. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1741143212451172">Hartley (2010</xref>) draws on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1741143212451172">Burrell and Morgan’s (1979)</xref> seminal classification of ‘paradigms’ of organizational theory – functionalist, interpretive, radical humanist and radical structuralist – to analyse the literature on distributed leadership. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1741143212451172">Mabey and Finch-Lees (2008)</xref>, following the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-1741143212451172">Schultze and Stabell (2004</xref>) use a somewhat similar framework to that of Burrell and Morgan to identify four ‘discourses’ – functionalist, constructivist, dialogic and critical – to explore the theory and practice of management and leadership development.</p>

<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1741143212451172">7</xref>
</sup> The functionalist perspective explores LMD in terms of objective regularities between actions and outcomes that enable causal consequences to be understood, planned for and controlled. It assumes that agreed purposes of LMD can be specified and research can determine how these purposes can best be achieved. The constructivist perspective, in contrast, assumes that understandings of LMD are socially constructed. Meanings may not coincide between individuals and groups, but there is an emphasis on the role of research in enabling these meanings to be shared and explored with the aim of improving practice. In this sense, both the functionalist and constructivist perspectives are, in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1741143212451172">Burrell and Morgan’s (1979)</xref> terms, concerned with social regulation – ‘they are not intended to change radically the normative order’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1741143212451172">Hartley, 2010</xref>: 274). The third – critical – perspective challenges this order and seeks to promote social change through reconstructing patterns of social power. Research drawing on this perspective seeks to illuminate these patterns and the forces driving them, both through objective exploration of power relationships within society and through emphasizing the role of dominant discourses in privileging certain forms of knowledge and constructing identities in ways that entrench the power of particular social groups. Each of these perspectives will now be considered in turn.</p>

<title>The Functionalist Perspective</title>
<p>In Mabey and Finch-Lees’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1741143212451172">2008</xref>: 52) words:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>the thinking within [the functionalist] Discourse is based upon a simple premise that well-conceived and well-designed training and development will enhance leadership and managerial capability, which will, in turn, lead to improvement in organizational and, by consequence, national competitiveness.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Most of the literature which has been referred to so far embodies an essentially functionalist approach. It does this in three ways. First, it largely accepts that the purposes of LMD can be objectively determined and agreed – for example, through the specification of competences, qualities or skills that effective performance requires – and ‘best practices’ sought. This leads to an acceptance also that the evolution, described earlier, of the assumptions underpinning these purposes and practices from ‘administrative’ to ‘managerial’ to ‘leaderist’ ones represented desirable functional responses to changing society needs. Second, it sees the primary role of research and evaluation to explore the causal relationships between practices and outcomes in order that purposes can be better achieved. And third, it tends to marginalize potential debates about the values that underpin both these purposes and the practices that are designed to achieve them.</p>
<p>These assumptions largely underpin the movement, led by the NCSL, towards a significant increase in the evaluation of LMD programmes over the past 10 years in England. In 2004 Southworth asserted the NCSL’s commitment to external evaluation of its programmes, and since then a very large number of such programme evaluations have been undertaken. Unlike its research studies, the College does not normally publish programme evaluations. Nevertheless, a number of papers derived from such studies have appeared in the academic literature. These include studies of: the New Visions programme for early headship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1741143212451172">Bush and Glover, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1741143212451172">Bush et al., 2006</xref>); NPQH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1741143212451172">Brundrett, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-1741143212451172">Rhodes et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr93-1741143212451172">Simkins et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1741143212451172">Crawford and Earley, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1741143212451172">Cowie and Crawford, 2009</xref>); LPSH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1741143212451172">Brundrett, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1741143212451172">Luckcock, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr93-1741143212451172">Simkins et al., 2009</xref>); Fast Track to headship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1741143212451172">Churches et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1741143212451172">Jones, 2010</xref>), Leadership Pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-1741143212451172">Simkins, 2009</xref>) and Leading from the Middle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1741143212451172">Brundrett, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-1741143212451172">Simkins, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr93-1741143212451172">Simkins et al., 2009</xref>). These studies almost always report generally positive responses to the programmes. However, the range of data on which they are based varies: some are very small scale, often only reporting the responses of participants; others are multi-method, using some combination of questionnaires, interviews with a range of respondents (not just participants) and case studies of individuals or schools. Studies are rarely longitudinal, nor do they attempt to compare programmes (but see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1741143212451172">Brundrett, 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-1741143212451172">Simkins, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr93-1741143212451172">Simkins et al., 2009</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1741143212451172">Bush et al. (2007</xref>: 74), in a review of 35 evaluation studies for the NCSL, found that these were ‘much stronger in describing what was valued by participants, rather than linking this finding to how and why they work well’.</p>
<p>Perhaps of most concern is that very little of the published work on evaluations is theorized. Occasionally articles include critiques of programmes, but these are often separate from, rather than grounded in, the evaluation data. The dominant theoretical framework used has involved functionalist ‘level’ models of evaluation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1741143212451172">Coldwell and Simkins, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1741143212451172">Kottcamp, 2011</xref>). Drawing on the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1741143212451172">Kirkpatrick (1998</xref>), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1741143212451172">Guskey (2000</xref>) and, more recently, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1741143212451172">Leithwood and Levin (2005</xref>), the results of LMD programmes are conceived to occur at a number of levels of impact: on participant reactions, participant learning, leader behaviour and student outcomes. In relation to evaluations of NCSL programmes, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1741143212451172">Bush et al. (2006</xref>) refers to the use of this approach in their evaluation of the New Visions programme, but it is explicated most clearly in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr93-1741143212451172">Simkins et al.’s (2009)</xref> comparative study of three programmes: LftM, NPQH and LPSH, which will be referred to below.</p>
<p>Studies based on functionalist assumptions can be defended from both theoretical and pragmatic positions. Questions of causation are clearly significant if we are to understand development processes better; but pragmatically, it can also be argued that LMD provision designed on functionalist lines needs to be evaluated in its own terms, not least because only such evaluations are likely to be taken seriously by governments. Nevertheless, the functionalist perspective can be challenged from a number of directions. There are significant problems in designing and implementing research or evaluation designs using ‘level’ approaches and these can lead to concerns about the robustness and usefulness of their conclusions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1741143212451172">Earley and Evans, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1741143212451172">Bush, 2009</xref>). More fundamentally, it can be argued that the perspective ‘diverts attention from the important management development processes that include unanticipated outcomes and informal, more covert episodes’, while its over-preoccupation with performativity ignores major ethical and moral questions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1741143212451172">Mabey and Finch-Lees, 2008</xref>: 74). These issues lead us to explore more constructivist approaches to the study of development programmes.</p>

<title>The Constructivist Perspective</title>
<p>The evolving discourse about appropriate LMD activities, which has been led by the NCSL, has itself challenged simplistic functionalist assumptions with an increasing emphasis on constructivist approaches to programme design. Thus an early emphasis on blended learning, typically combining face-to-face and online provision, sometimes supplemented by in-school activity, have evolved more recently into an increasing focus on ‘personalization’ of provision. This can take many forms. At the most basic level it can simply involve choice in the activities that participants may engage in, through, for example modularization of content or providing a range of optional development activities. More fundamentally, it can emphasize process approaches to development, such as mentoring, coaching, action learning, projects, shadowing, placement or other activities that enable the participant to engage directly, to varying degrees, in negotiating the kinds of practical activities they engage in or the support they receive. At the extreme it may involve claims that programmes are ‘co-constructed’ with participants and providers ‘creating knowledge together’, as for example with the NCSL New Visions programmes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1741143212451172">Bush and Glover, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1741143212451172">Bush et al., 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>These examples imply two further ways in which approaches to LMD have evolved. First, there has been an increasing emphasis in the provision of direct personal support, especially through coaching and mentoring both within participants’ schools and by ‘expert’ leaders and managers such as serving or retired headteachers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1741143212451172">Bush, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1741143212451172">MacBeath, 2011</xref>); and second, much greater use has been made of the school as both a location for LMD and as a significant organizational actor in the process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-1741143212451172">Simkins, 2009</xref>). The latter development emerged initially for reasons of principle: the idea that practice-based activity is an essential aspect of effective LMD. Recently, however, it has also been accepted that school-led work is essential if the scale of the development challenge identified earlier by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr94-1741143212451172">Southworth (2004</xref>) is to be adequately addressed.</p>
<p>Many research studies, too, employ a constructivist perspective, drawing much of their data from interviews and case studies which seek to explore the perspectives of participants and other actors. This work has highlighted a number of themes. The first concerns the degree to which understandings of development activities are shared among actors. For example, some less experienced heads participating in LPSH seemed more instrumental in their expectations of the programme – in terms of enhancing their capacity to do their job – than some very experienced heads who wanted to take personal stock and consider where they wanted to go next. Similarly, on middle leader programmes, such as LftM and Leadership Pathways, participants varied in the degree to which they wished to engage in depth with the ideas they were presented with or do the minimum necessary to complete the programme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr96-1741143212451172">Stroud, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-1741143212451172">Simkins, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr93-1741143212451172">Simkins et al., 2009</xref>). Such variations in expectations challenge simple functionalist assumptions about pre-specified programme purposes.</p>
<p>However, when our gaze moves beyond the individual participants themselves, the potential for multiple interpretations of LMD activities increases. For example, in relation to NCSL blended programmes, the College, the school and the participant may each have different expectations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-1741143212451172">Simkins, 2009</xref>), while within schools coaches may be unclear whether they are expected to act as ‘support tutors’ to the programme, as mentors whose main role is to support their coachee in their development, or as school advocates whose primary purpose is to ensure a ‘match’ between the development of the programme participant and the school’s needs and priorities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-1741143212451172">Simkins et al., 2006</xref>). Similarly, where participants are expected to undertake in-school activities as part of their programme, the experience may be designed and reflected on very differently if it is seen as a ‘project’ whose primary focus is the needs of the school or a ‘developmental activity’ whose prime purpose is the participant’s leadership learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-1741143212451172">Simkins, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Recasting LMD participants as subjects rather than objects of programmes and activities as the constructivist perspective does, suggests a second theme, namely the need to see development as a longitudinal process. Such a perspective can manifest itself in various ways: for example through concepts of socialization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1741143212451172">Crow, 2007</xref>); of role transition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1741143212451172">Browne-Ferringo, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-1741143212451172">Simkins and Close, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1741143212451172">Crawford and Earley, 2011</xref>); or of career stages of leaders in general (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1741143212451172">Gronn, 1999</xref>: ch. 2) or of incumbents of specific roles such as headteachers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr96-1741143212451172">Stroud, 2006</xref>). Central to each of these manifestations is the issue of identity formation. For example, in their study following up participants on the NPQH and the Scottish Qualification for Headship (SQH), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1741143212451172">Cowie and Crawford (2009</xref>) suggest a number of variables that contribute to the construction of the identity of new headteachers: the role of reflection, the power of the language embodied in the programmes and in the standards on which both are based, and the development of networks of colleague heads. They (2009: 16) conclude:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>In terms of personal narratives, there are clear connections between [the participants on both programmes] in terms of developing an identity as a headteacher, separate from any professional programme. However, the programme may serve to embed and enhance that identity.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Finally, and complementing multi-perspective and longitudinal takes on LMD there is a further theme. This decentres the individual learner and the specific course or programme. It considers LMD to be concerned as much with ‘leadership’ as with ‘leader’ development and sees the workplace, and interactions within it, as a key arena for this. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr95-1741143212451172">Spillane et al. (2009</xref>) identify two issues here: the ways in which LMD can support distributed leadership, viewed both in terms of formal top-down distribution and less formal emergent patterns of teacher leadership, and the wide range of opportunities to learn, both formal and informal that occur for leaders in school contexts. There is a large and growing literature on work-based learning, but, although it is increasingly influencing work on teacher development (for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1741143212451172">Hodkinson and Hodkinson, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1741143212451172">Burn et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1741143212451172">Opfer and Pedder, 2011</xref>), its influence on the literature on school leadership development has been relatively limited. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr98-1741143212451172">Turner (2006</xref>) has analysed the role of different types of informal learning in the development of secondary subject leaders; while <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-1741143212451172">Simkins (2009</xref>) has explored the ways in which the individual participant, the programme and the workplace interact in NCSL blended learning programmes, emphasizing the challenges presented by the variation and complexity of local school contexts. In other work on the Scottish Qualification for Headship, Reeves and her colleagues provide a rich analysis of the tensions that arise when attempts to enable teachers to reframe their thinking and develop new identities as leaders through similar programmes come up against both the social and political realities of the workplace, whether these arise from specific school contexts or from broader aspects such as the cultural differences between primary and secondary schools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-1741143212451172">Reeves et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-1741143212451172">Reeves and Forde, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-1741143212451172">Reeves et al., 2005</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section9-1741143212451172">
<title>The Critical Perspective</title>
<p>Not surprisingly, perhaps, much of the writing on LMD in England over the past 40 years has been located within the two consensual paradigms of functionalism and constructivism. For example, in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1741143212451172">Bolam (1997</xref>: 277) suggested that there was:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>much greater clarity and agreement about the core tasks of teaching and schooling, and, therefore, about the tasks of school management … Hence it is now possible, to an extent not true 10 years ago, to achieve consensus about the main content areas of school management training.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As suggested earlier, this position, perhaps with the words ‘management training’ replaced by ‘leadership development’, is still the consensus position in much of the literature (see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1741143212451172">Bush, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Nevertheless, there is a powerful critical discourse that challenges these perspectives. There was relatively little hint of this in the ‘era of administration’, despite sporadic, but declining, discussions about the significance of social science theory, and theory more generally, in informing LMD programmes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1741143212451172">Hughes, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1741143212451172">Bolam, 1997</xref>). The critical perspective emerged from a wider policy debate, which has its origins in the ‘era of management’, concerning the purposes of education, the processes through which schools are organized, and the consequences of choices made in these areas for the distribution – and redistribution – of power in schools and beyond. An early hint of things to come was <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1741143212451172">Holmes and Neilson’s (1989)</xref> indication of the dilemmas to which the changes embodied in the Education Reform Act 1988 gave rise. They (1989: 68) asked ‘Which client and whose agenda?’, arguing:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>… It is common for senior staff in school to take violent issue with the philosophical assumptions underlying LFM<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-1741143212451172">8</xref>
</sup>. The new culture of management envisaged by Coopers and Lybrand [a key report underpinning policy] has connotations of entrepreneurship and managerialism for some people who perceive such ideas as tangential to schooling at best, and at worst an anathema. How far can a training programme accommodate debate on these issues? Should value issues be explicitly excluded?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Over the next 10 years the debates about ‘managerialism’ grew, both in general terms and in relation to more specific issues such as the competency movement. In 1993, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1741143212451172">Ouston (1993</xref>: 214) critiqued this movement, distinguishing between ‘fundamentalist’ approaches which focus on skills and performance and ‘liberal’ approaches that focus much more on personal qualities, concluding that a narrow competence-based approach does not take account of the fact that managers work in an integrated way, and underpinning values are crucial, as are aspects of individual psychology – ‘what has become known as “personal effectiveness”’.</p>
<p>It could be argued that such critiques were essentially constructivist in their underlying assumptions. The ‘era of leadership’, however, has seen such developments examined much more thoroughly from a critical perspective. For example, O’Reilly and Reed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1741143212451172">2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1741143212451172">2011</xref>) have coined the term ‘leaderism’ for the core legitimating narrative of recent public sector reform. They (2010: 962) argue that replacing the instrumental rationality of managerialism with value rationality of ‘leaderism’ addresses continuing concerns about the limited effectiveness of improvement strategies by ‘making the issue the establishment of a passion for a common goal between leaders and led’. In relation to education, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1741143212451172">Gronn (2003</xref>), for example, has developed the idea of ‘designer leadership’ to describe standards-based approaches to the selection of development of school leaders, while <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1741143212451172">Gunter and Thomson (2009</xref>) have explored the metaphor of the ‘makeover’ to characterize the approaches to LMD that have been emerging. The underlying idea here is that policy discourses and associated technologies – such as the NCSL’s online presence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr97-1741143212451172">Thrupp, 2005</xref>) – serve ‘to constitute actors [in this case leaders] in particular ways, which preference particular forms of judgement and which are based on particular forms of power and knowledge’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1741143212451172">Newman, 2001</xref>: 30; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1741143212451172">Newman, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1741143212451172">Gunter and Forrester, 2008</xref>). This means, for example, that:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>[h]eadteachers had to be transformational charismatic leaders with a ‘can do’ and change-oriented persona. They had to exercise self-control over their own feelings with refusal to give up, combined with accepting responsibility for policy delivery and policy outcomes regardless of whether they were completely in control of every thing that made policy implementation possible. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1741143212451172">Gunter and Thomson, 2009</xref>: 473)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Detailed, grounded applications of these ideas to LMD in education are rare. An exception is the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1741143212451172">Luckcock (2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1741143212451172">2008</xref>),<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-1741143212451172">9</xref>
</sup> who deconstructed the assumptions underpinning the design of the LPSH, arguing (2008: 545) that the programme:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>would appear to legitimate an approach to leadership development that values the interior life of the headteacher as long as this is exclusively oriented to a psychology of personal achievement and organisational effectiveness … there appears to be little interest in other philosophical approaches to community leadership, for example, the quest for wisdom, a flair for originality and authenticity, caring for the well-being of others or peaceful mediation in times of strife and conflict.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Writing from the critical perspective has been dominated by such post-structural approaches that emphasize the power of discourse and processes of identity construction. Nevertheless, there has been little evidence in the journals reviewed here of socially critical approaches to leadership development which address either general issues of social justice or more specific questions concerning, for example, gender and ethnicity. There is nothing to compare, for example, with some US studies that explore in a grounded way how such perspectives might be effectively embedded in leadership development activities, the kinds of alternative leader identities that this might imply and the barriers that exist to such developments (for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-1741143212451172">Rusch, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1741143212451172">Brown, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr103-1741143212451172">Young et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1741143212451172">Collay, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1741143212451172">Furman, 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>However, it is important not to lose sight of more concrete manifestations of power in relation to developments in the LMD field. Who controls LMD? – the government and its agencies? Local authorities? The universities? The profession? Or private organizations and individuals? And what are the levers and mechanisms through which this control is achieved? Broad trends here were identified earlier: the first two eras were associated with fragmentation in provision among a range of providers, but with LEAs dominating short course provision and universities award-bearing provision. This reflected the dispersal of power in the education system under the bureau-professional regime. When central government entered the arena through the provision of funding, it was initially to encourage a market in provision. However, this market was increasingly ‘steered’ as radical government policies, introduced during the ‘era of management’, created a climate where demand for provision was driven by pressures to respond to central initiatives and imperatives. Eventually, the central government increasingly reverted to more direct intervention through the creation of the TTA and then the NCSL, which is now the dominant actor in the field.</p>
<p>Concerns were expressed about NCSL dominance from an early stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1741143212451172">Brundrett, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1741143212451172">Bush, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1741143212451172">Crow, 2004</xref>). In his historical review in 2004 Bolam reflected on the temporary nature of previous developments at national level and wondered whether the political will to embed the College in the national scene would be maintained. Now (in 2011), with the College’s position reconfirmed by the current Conservative—Liberal Democrat government, its position seems secure – and, furthermore, securely located within the ambit of central government. This has, in fact, always been the case, as the annual ‘Remit Letter’ from the Secretary of State setting out his expectations for the year ahead has always made clear. However, it has been reinforced by the College’s transformation in April 2012 from an ‘arms length’ non-departmental public body to an Executive Agency of the Department for Education in order to be ‘directly accountable to ministers’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1741143212451172">NCSL, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the issue of changing power relationships is not a straightforward one. It is undoubtedly the case, as already suggested, that the College cannot possibly meet the scale of need implied by the demands of ‘leaderism’ across the whole educational system. Indeed, it has stated its intention to modify the way it works, moving from direct commissioning to a greater emphasis on brokerage, facilitation, accreditation and quality assurance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1741143212451172">NCSL, 2011</xref>). A less directive philosophy might also be indicated by the ministerial decision that holding the NPQH will no longer be a mandatory requirement for headship from 2012. However, it seems likely that the level of ‘steering’ that this will involve will continue to be high. Furthermore, its provision is dependent on an army of lieutenants comprising private companies, individual consultants, and schools, all of which play active parts in the delivery of its programmes. Wallace and his colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr100-1741143212451172">Wallace, O’Reilly et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr101-1741143212451172">Wallace, Tomlinson et al., 2011</xref>) have explored the degree to which the NCSL and other national public sector leadership development agencies act effectively as ‘conduits for reform’ through these mechanisms. Their conclusions are complex. On the one hand, evidence was found of the ability of intermediate actors – leadership developers, headteachers – to mediate the ‘message’ that NCSL programmes propounded. Conversely, it was clear that ‘their power to mediate … was nevertheless delimited by the imperative to demonstrate compliance under the relevant accountability regimes’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr101-1741143212451172">Wallace, Tomlinson et al., 2011</xref>: 278). In other words, the power of national leadership development initiatives to ‘acculturate’ leaders into the discourse of reform lies less in the programmes themselves than in the wider policy discourse and the incentives embodied in the accountability structures with which they are associated.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>It is almost a commonplace now to emphasize the increasing challenges of the job of school leader arising from factors such as the increasing complexity of school organizations and of the context in which schools operate, devolution of increasing responsibilities to the school site, and the increasingly high performance stakes to which schools are subjected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1741143212451172">Crow, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1741143212451172">Bush, 2009</xref>). Such arguments lead, typically, to demands for more sophisticated approaches to LMD which use a range of methods, are embedded in a variety of locations (including, increasingly, the workplace), and are increasingly ‘personalized’ to the individual circumstances and needs. These developments are embodied in the ways in which LMD provision has evolved in England over the past 40 years and, more recently, in the continuing evolution of the work of the NCSL.</p>
<p>The majority of the writing on LMD has accepted the essentially functionalist assumptions on which these narratives are based and adopted a largely ‘micro’ perspective, focusing on the characteristics and consequences of particular programmes. This emphasis has been encouraged in recent years by the channelling, in England, of the majority of funding for studies of LMD into what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1741143212451172">Gunter and Ribbins (2003</xref>) would term instrumental and evaluative studies.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-1741143212451172">10</xref>
</sup> Such studies focus primarily on the role of LMD in developing the knowledge, skills and qualities of individual leaders. Nevertheless, some of this work takes a more constructivist position, in particular exploring how the evolving identities of administrators, managers and leaders are constructed by particular LMD programmes and, more generally, through the processes of social interaction in which these individuals engage. However, alongside this work has been a counter-blast of critical analysis, which has challenged the underpinning assumptions of much LMD provision in relation to both the competence-based models of management adopted in the 1980s and early 1990s and the constructions of leadership which have emerged more recently. In contrast to the functionalist and constructivist studies, much of this critical writing takes a ‘macro’ perspective, engaging more directly with policy discourse than with the details of specific provision and practice.</p>
<p>This analysis suggests a degree of polarization in the literature on LMD in England – and perhaps more widely. Without entering debates about whether various paradigms drawn on in this article are commensurable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1741143212451172">Hartley, 2010</xref>), there is an argument for bringing them more closely together. In particular, there would be value in complementing the micro-level studies of specific programmes and individual leadership learning outcomes favoured by functionalist approaches and the macro-level critiques favoured by critical writers with a ‘meso’ perspective that explores the LMD landscape in a more systemic and nuanced way (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1741143212451172">Opfer and Pedder, 2011</xref>). A number of examples of key questions that such an approach might address will draw this article to a close.</p>
<p>First, while studies from the functionalist perspective have become somewhat more sophisticated over recent years (for example through developments in the use of level models), their potential remains limited. In part this is due to inherent difficulties in establishing causation and, in particular, linking LMD activities with more distant impacts such as on classroom practice and pupil outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1741143212451172">Earley and Evans, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1741143212451172">Bush, 2009</xref>). Some argue that the solution to this is more sophisticated positivist research and evaluation designs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1741143212451172">Leithwood and Levin, 2005</xref>; Kottcamp, 2011). However, more fruitful approaches are likely to lie in other directions – using level approaches in a more heuristic way and placing greater emphasis on constructivist perspectives (Coldwell and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1741143212451172">Simkins, 2011</xref>). These accept that the purposes and outcomes of LMD activities may be contested and the formation of leader identity is at least as significant an issue as the development of specific skills and qualities. Addressing issues of how LMD activities contribute to identity formation requires an approach that links such activities to both the personal (especially career trajectories and experiences) and the organizational (especially the school as a site for learning) realms. Indeed, work-based LMD is an area ripe for further exploration.</p>
<p>Second, while the critical perspective sets up crucial debates about underlying values that are embodied in discourses underpinning approaches to LMD, studies from this perspective do not often embed these arguments in empirical detail. There is room for more critical analysis of the content and processes embodied in LMD activities and the ways in which these influence leadership. One issue here concerns programme design. Studies which follow <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1741143212451172">Luckcock’s (2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1741143212451172">2008</xref>) deconstructions of LPSH would be a start, as would critical analyses of terms central to the current leadership development discourse such as ‘personalization’. Another area would be to explore in detail the nature of leadership mentoring and coaching. The ambiguities often associated with these roles have already been referred to, but there are deeper questions about focus and control. Indeed the three perspectives used in this article could be used to explore the coaching or mentoring process, differentiating between processes that are essentially conservative, whether in functionalist or constructivist terms, and those that genuinely seek to be transformative in enabling participants to engage in genuine critique of the status quo and opening up wider possibilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1741143212451172">Brockbank, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-1741143212451172">Robertson, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Such analyses would draw attention to a third set of questions that could usefully be explored further in the literature on LMD – those concerning power. Who will determine the nature of LMD activities that will take place and how they will be implemented? It was suggested earlier that a feature of the last 10 years in England has been increasing centralization through the work of the NCSL which has, many would argue, significantly weakened other players, such as local authorities, universities and the schools themselves. The coming to office of the Conservative—Liberal Democrat government in May 2010 provides an opportunity to revisit these conclusions. A central plank of the government’s policy has been to set in train processes through which schools will be encouraged, and in some cases required, to become independent of local authorities and funded directly by central government. The primary mechanism for this to occur is the conversion of existing schools into ‘academies’, although parents, faith groups and others will also be enabled to set up new schools, known as ‘free schools’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1741143212451172">Department for Education, 2010</xref>). The development dynamic of this system is seen as lying with schools themselves – a ‘self-improving school system’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47a-1741143212451172">Hargreaves, 2010</xref>) – rather than with LEAs or other agencies. Structures and processes have been put in place to support these changes. These include the establishment of teaching schools, which are expected to play a lead role in training and development activities for teachers, including LMD, at all stages of their careers through alliances with other schools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1741143212451172">Hargreaves, 2011</xref>); and the creation of national, local and specialist leaders of education, who are selected for their capacity to act as individual agents of LMD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-1741143212451172">Robinson, 2011</xref>). Thus, while the focus remains on leadership, the emphasis has now shifted to new types of leader – ‘system leaders’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1741143212451172">Higham et al., 2009</xref>) – and new approaches to leadership – ‘network leadership’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1741143212451172">Hadfield and Chapman, 2009</xref>). The NCSL has been given a key role in this strategy. It appoints, trains and supports leaders of education; it has now (2011) been given responsibility for the implementation of the teaching schools policy; and it is developing a modular framework for leadership development comprising a number of levels from team leader to aspirant head, the delivery of which will be licensed to a range of providers, including teaching schools and for which university accreditation is being sought (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1741143212451172">NCSL, 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>It is far from clear at the time of writing, therefore, how balance between the centralization of power in the NCSL, on the one hand, and the devolution of responsibilities to schools for leading teacher development, on the other, will work out. The emerging policy commitment to a ‘self-improving system’, which aims to place schools at the centre, has the potential to generate a much more complex arena in which central government, schools and both public and private agencies, including universities and what remains of local authorities, seek to position themselves in ways that ensure both their influence over the LMD agendas and, in some cases, their survival. The emerging landscape of ‘players’ in the LMD arena has changed rapidly in recent years, with an increasing number of actors – both organizations and individuals – engaged in LMD activities. The work of Stephen Ball and others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1741143212451172">Ball, 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1741143212451172">2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1741143212451172">Gunter and Forrester, 2008</xref>) has explored this at length in relation to the ‘macro’ policy scene in education, but much more needs to be known about how these new patterns of actors are influencing the nature of LMD at more local levels. What are the implications of a ‘self-improving’ school system for the ways in which LMD is constructed, the kinds of knowledge and activities that it embodies, and, not least, who controls it?</p>
