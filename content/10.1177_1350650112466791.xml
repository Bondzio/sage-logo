<abstract>
<p>A high-chromium alloy with 2Cr32Si2MnMo2 available for diesel engine valve seats was fabricated by centrifugal casting to improve valve seat quality. The friction and wear performances of the valve seat dry sliding against an exhaust valve were measured using a SRV testing machine. The test procedures include temperature and load sensitivities and wear. The test temperatures ranged from 100 ℃ to 280 ℃ and loads from 50 to 125 N. The friction and wear of the valve seat were found to decrease first and then increase with the increment of temperature or load. Scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy analyses revealed the tribofilms contained more friction-increasing Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> and the wear mechanism was a complicated combination of two-body abrasion, three-body abrasion and oxidation. The strong adhesion between the valve and its seat arrested the relative sliding, but with loads going up to 150 N. In most cases, the valve had unexpectedly higher wear resistance than that of its seat over the temperature range, which is ascribed to adhesion to the tribofilms.</p>

<p>The diesel engine has extensively been used in various submarines, ships, locomotives, large trucks, cars and electric generating plants since it was invented in 1892. Problems with the diesels have been exposed such as the high particulate emissions (soot), and the high temperature and pressures of combustion, which produce high levels of NO<italic><sub>X</sub></italic> emissions. In particular, the engine valve seat is subjected to the inclining impact and relative sliding of the exhaust valve, resulting in the contact surface abrasion, ablation and corrosion.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1350650112466791">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1350650112466791"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1350650112466791">3</xref></sup> The surface asperities make the gases in the cylinder leak during the practical compression process. The reductive gas pressures aggravate incomplete combustion of fuel and produce more soot. If soot is adhered to the exhaust valve, then hinder the valve motion and delay the valve closure. The valve and its seat have no ability to fit against each other together so as to provide a tight seal. Moreover, wear is a cumulative process and large wear creates a permanent recess, affecting engine performance and fuel economy. Accordingly, it is essential to select high wear-resistant materials available for the valve and its seat to offer the long-lasting and low-maintenance contact surfaces. In the present experiments, a high-chromium alloy used for the engine valve seats was prepared by centrifugal casting to improve valve seat quality and service life<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1350650112466791">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1350650112466791">5</xref></sup> and a commercial exhaust valve made of lower chromium alloy was adopted as a counter material. The friction and wear performances between two alloys were measured at different temperatures and loads on a SRV testing machine for comparison. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was utilized for the worn high-chromium alloy surface characterization and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) analysis for determining the ingredients and contents of the tribofilms.</p>

<p>A centrifugal machine used for the current experiment investigations was designed and fabricated, shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1350650112466791">Figure 1</xref>. It consisted of a flange, a taper pin, asbestos plates, check rings, a mould made of 45<sup>#</sup> steel and other components. The asbestos plates were employed to avoid melted alloy stuck to the check rings. The entire inner surface of the mould was coated with a coating compound, including 44 wt% zircon, 12 wt% calcium base bentonite and 44 wt% water. The coating layer was dried at a temperature of 180 ℃ to eliminate the moisture. This was followed by a second coating and drying run until the coating layer reached almost as thick as about 1 mm. The mould was preheated to 300 ℃. A tiny amount of silicon iron (0.3 wt%) acted as a nucleating agent was added into the aforementioned melted 2Cr32Si2MnMo2 alloy and then it was poured into the preheated mould cavity with the pouring rate of 1 kg/s.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1350650112466791">1</xref></sup> Open the stop valve for the cooling water 30 s after the pour and let the mould cool off directly. Cooling time was approximately 150–180 s. Based on the preliminary preparation observations, the centrifugal speed was chosen as 1750 r/min. The finished product as a valve seat material is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1350650112466791">Figure 2</xref> after removing the coatings from the surface. Specimens of 5.0 × 10.0 mm<sup>2</sup> were cut from the finished product and ground to a thickness of about 7.0 mm before polishing by the SiC abrasive papers up to 1000 grits and then a silk cloth under flowing-water conditions. The average density of specimens was 7.4 g/cm<sup>3</sup>, with hardness of 38 HRC.

<p>Friction and wear measurement methods on SRV machine (Optimol Instruments Prüftechnik GmbH) have well been established by offering oscillation and rotation on one easy-to-use system platform. In particular, oscillatory movement was considered to create stressful operating conditions and to produce distinguishable results fast. A substantial assessment of tribological behaviour of the valve seat dry sliding against an exhaust valve is a formidable task. However, the simulation of friction and wear processes on SRV testing machine and analysis for evaluating results with simplified specimens are quite likely to be a fast and effective way of tribotesting.</p>
<p>A new set of holder was specially designed and fabricated to be suitable for area contact testing (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1350650112466791">Fig. 4</xref> in Zhang et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1350650112466791">6</xref></sup>). It consisted of a quasi-cylinder, a fixing framework and other components. The detailed instructions can be observed in other papers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1350650112466791">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1350650112466791">7</xref></sup> In this experiment, the valve seat materials were employed as an upper specimen and the exhaust valve materials as a lower specimen. The upper and lower specimens need to be renewed when worn off with thickness below 6.9 mm. Test stroke and frequency were, respectively, selected as 0.4 mm and 150 Hz in all cases taking into consideration the repetitive impact of the valve and its seat, with small amplitude sliding in the practical application. Preliminary tests were conducted with the aim of eventually confirming kinetic and static friction. The test results showed that the sliding friction was stopped abruptly when the load went up to 150 N at 100 ℃. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1350650112466791">Figure 4</xref> includes SEM (S-3700 N, Japan) photographs of static friction testing, where no signs of friction tracks but the permanent plastic deformation are appreciated. Some regions are relatively flat where the contact load was readily concentrated, implying that the adhesive interactions should be extremely forceful so as to arrest the relative sliding in part because adhesion is characterized by micro-welding or bonding. Other regions display larger pits thanks to the partial peeling-off of the interfacial layer material. This experimentally seems to verify intense seizure occurrence at the contact interface. Based on the preliminary test observations, the loads of 50, 75, 100 and 125 N, equivalent to 1, 1.5, 2 and 2.5 MPa, respectively, were selected to be applied by a servo-system exerted on the quasi-cylinder holder. All the testing procedures were operated by a data acquisition system of a computer.

<sec id="sec5-1350650112466791"><title>Test method</title>
<p>A test schedule was developed to determine friction levels and wear. It consists of temperature sensitivity at 50 N and load sensitivity at 100 ℃, as well as temperature and load dependence of wear. Test procedures began with a running-in of at least 10 min duration at a load of 30 N and temperature lower than 90 ℃ on the SRV testing machine until the apparent contact area between two specimens surpassed 95%. This was followed by a temperature sensitivity test at 50 N, where the test temperatures were allowed to rise from 100 ℃ to 280 ℃ in steps of 60 ℃. Each test was started with new specimens and lasted 40 min, so that there was sufficient wear generation for comparison. At 60 ℃ intervals, the average friction reading was taken as representative for posterior 35 min duration. Each specimen wear thickness was measured before and after testing using a profile meter (BMT Expert), and then each average wear depth was expressed as the specific wear rate according to the calculation of the following formula
<disp-formula id="disp-formula1-1350650112466791"><label>(1)</label><mml:math xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline" id="math1-1350650112466791"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>k</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mi>xyh</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn><mml:mi>tlfP</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow></mml:math><graphic alternate-form-of="disp-formula1-1350650112466791" xlink:href="10.1177_1350650112466791-eq1.tif"/></disp-formula>

<p>The temperature sensitivity tests were conducted. The relevant friction properties under investigation are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1350650112466791">Figure 5</xref>. It has been found that the friction first fell and then ascended. At the end of the wear tests, the valve seat specimens were used for SEM analysis to account for the above friction behaviour and the relevant SEM observations were shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1350650112466791">Figure 6</xref>. Apart from some wear debris, a series of fine parallel grooves across the entire worn surface is visible in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1350650112466791">Figure 6(a)</xref>, which should be attributed to the ploughing action caused by the contact plateau tips at the counter surface. This is a typical two-body abrasion trait. However, with temperatures going up from 160 ℃ to 280 ℃, the so-called grooves are invisible and the tribofilms that comprised more wear debris increases. Some of the reasons are that the gradual softening of the valve seat alloy was conducive to adhesion to the tribofilms under the normal load so that the worn surfaces were covered with more tribofilms. On the other hand, the contact plateau tips may become blunter on account of temperature rise, impairing the action to plough the counter surface. These influences eventually lead to the transition from two-body abrasion to three-body abrasion.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1350650112466791">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1350650112466791">9</xref></sup> The latter became the dominant wear mechanism at elevated temperatures. The maximum friction coefficient at a low temperature of 100 ℃ is encountered in that the friction level in two-body abrasion is universally in excess of that in three-body abrasion.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1350650112466791">10</xref></sup> Notice that the friction coefficient is unusually high more than 1.0. This is likely relevant to with two counter materials having proximate components. In the case of metals or alloys in friction, the proximate components incline to cohere. The larger the adhesion strength, the higher the friction coefficient.

<p>The chemical ingredients and contents of the tribofilms were determined using EDS (Quantax, Bruker Co., Germany) to further investigate their influence on the friction and wear properties at 50 N and different temperatures and the test results are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1350650112466791">Table 4</xref>. If some trace elements were neglected, Fe, Cr, C and O were taken into account as crucial elements in the following investigations since they ranked in the top four among all the detected elements. It is well known that C in two alloys chiefly exists in the form of metal carbides. Metals and their carbides in the alloys are transferred into wear debris after tribo-chemical reaction. The high-content O denotes that the compositions of the wear debris, especially at its surface layer, is principally expected to consist of metal oxides and consequently the wear mechanism is given by the combination of abrasion and oxidation under the oxidative environments. The possible existence forms of these metal oxides contain Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, FeO and Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>. The former three are considered as mild abrasives and the last one, coupled with metal carbides, as severe abrasives<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1350650112466791">11</xref></sup> since materials hardness under study conforms to a decreasing sequence of metal carbides, metal oxides to metal with respect to an identical metal. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-1350650112466791">Figure 7</xref> plots the atomic percentages of the investigated four elements as a function of temperature, where it can be noted that Cr and C contents basically grow but Fe and O contents exhibit an opposite tendency. One of the reasons for C content growth is the difficulty in converting C into CO and CO<sub>2</sub> completely because of very short tribo-chemical reaction time, in particular, increasing the magnitude of wear within the temperature range 160–280 ℃ (see the following section of this article). Some tribo-chemical reaction channels were clogged with more wear debris; thus unreacted C existed in the form of metal carbides was retained. The increment of Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> and metal carbides in the tribofilms promoted three-body abrasion, resulting in an increase in the friction level with temperatures ranging from 160 ℃ to 280 ℃ in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1350650112466791">Figure 5</xref>.

<p>The wear tests were carried out. The test results are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-1350650112466791">Figure 8</xref>. Interestingly, the specific wear rates of the valve seat alloy mostly surpass those of the exhaust valve alloy. This is contrary to experience predictions associated with the hardness of two alloys. The possible reason is that the softer exhaust valve alloy adhered to the tribofilms more easily as compared to the harder valve seat alloy. The adhered tribofilms constructed a protective layer, suppressing the exhaust valve alloy abrasion better. Notice that the specific wear rate of the valve seat alloy exhibits a quite similar alteration to its friction in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1350650112466791">Figure 5</xref>. This similarity can be explained in the same above-mentioned way. Nevertheless, the specific wear rate of the exhaust valve alloy varies unpredictably and there exists no general trend. This is probably relevant to the fact that the tribofilms on the exhaust valve alloy as a lower specimen failed to be expulsed successfully.

<p>The load sensitivity tests were performed. The corresponding friction property is displayed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-1350650112466791">Figure 9</xref>. Also, the friction first dropped and then rose shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-1350650112466791">Figure 7</xref>. The worn valve seat alloy surfaces were examined and photographed using SEM after the wear tests in order to investigate the tribological phenomenon and the SEM observations were shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-1350650112466791">Figure 10</xref>. The surface topographies from (b) to (d) show a growing tendency in the number of the accumulative tribofilms. The reason is that more tribofilms were impressed into the worn surfaces as load increased. During the mixed-mode friction, the thicker tribofilms were beneficial to impeding two-body abrasion compared with the thinner ones and three-body abrasion gained in importance as previously described. Consequently, the friction level fell stemming from 50 to 100 N.

<p>Also, the chemical ingredients and contents of the tribofilms were determined using EDS to account for the friction and wear performances at 100 ℃ and different loads. The test results are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1350650112466791">Table 4</xref>. As remarked in a previous section, Fe, Cr, C and O were also taken into account as crucial elements in the following investigations. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11-1350650112466791">Figure 11</xref> plots the atomic percentages of the investigated four elements as a function of load, where basically, Cr and Fe contents gently ascend but C and O contents gently descend. The logical explanation of this situation is that the tribofilms is very likely to be entrapped between two counter materials and suffer from serious friction damage for longer periods of time so that more C, Cr and Fe were oxidized into their oxides with increasing load. The higher the load, the greater the friction damage. A comparison with the O content drops in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-1350650112466791">Figures 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11-1350650112466791">11</xref> shows that load plays a more significant role than temperature, confirming that the compacted tribofilms could more effectively deter oxidation reactions. The lower C content detected suggests that the influence of metal carbides can be negligible in the next investigation. Based on this consideration, more Cr and Fe oxides in the tribofilms contributed to more severe three-body abrasion, inducing an increase in the friction level stemming from 100 to 125 N in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-1350650112466791">Figure 9</xref>.
<fig id="fig11-1350650112466791" position="float"><label>Figure 11.</label><caption><p>Comparison of the influences of load on the main atomic percentages in the tribofilms at <italic>T</italic> = 100 ℃, <italic>l</italic> = 0.4 mm and <italic>f</italic> = 150 Hz.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1350650112466791-fig11.tif"/>
</fig></p>
<p>The final wear tests were conducted. The specific wear rate as a function of load is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12-1350650112466791">Figure 12</xref>. Notice that the variation of the specific wear rate is similar with that of the friction in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-1350650112466791">Figure 9</xref> only pertaining to the valve seat alloy. This remarkable similarity has been observed in the previous friction and wear as a function of temperature. Unfortunately, the specific wear rate for the exhaust valve alloy has shown an unstable tendency, appearing elusive. A detailed review on this unstability is a formidable task. The analysis of partial interpretation is given here. The specific wear rates within the lower load range 50–75 N are superior to those within higher load range 100–125 N. This situation displayed in wear is because the tribofilms were strongly compressed at higher loads and an effective protective layer came into existence so as to hinder further wear.

<sec id="sec9-1350650112466791" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title>
<p>The valve seat alloy dry sliding against the exhaust valve alloy was tested to investigate the tribological behaviour. The friction and wear performances of the valve seat alloy first lowered and then grew with increasing temperature or load. These performances were intensely dependent on the chemical ingredients, contents and thickness of the tribofilms and the transition from two-body abrasion to three-body abrasion was found at the worn valve seat alloy surfaces after SEM observation and EDS analysis. The sliding friction was stopped abruptly when the load went up to 150 N. In most cases, the exhaust valve alloy showed better wear resistance in comparison with that of the valve seat alloy over the temperature range 100–280 ℃, whereas the former wear resistance observed for loads from 100 to 125 N is superior to that for loads from 50 to 75 N because of the effective protection of the compressed tribofilms.</p>
