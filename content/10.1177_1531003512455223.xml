<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Spontaneous portal-systemic shunts within the hepatic parenchyma are rare but seem to be occurring more frequently, possibly because of increased availability and quality of radiological imaging. Anatomically, portal-systemic shunts are divided into intrahepatic and extrahepatic shunts. Extrahepatic shunts, also known as Abernethy malformations, were first described in 1793 by Abernethy, who reported on a 10-month-old patient with an absent portal vein and a congenital mesenterico-caval shunt.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1531003512455223">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1531003512455223">2</xref></sup> Intrahepatic portal-systemic venous shunts, on the other hand, are defined as communications between the intrahepatic portal vein and the hepatic or perihepatic veins, via anomalous intrahepatic venous channels measuring more than 1 mm in diameter.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1531003512455223">3</xref></sup> Park et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1531003512455223">4</xref></sup> described 4 types of spontaneous portal-systemic shunt, with type 3, an aneurysmal connection between the portal and hepatic veins, being the most common. A fifth type has also been added, which is a patent ductus venosus.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1531003512455223">5</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>Adult patients may present with encephalopathy, pulmonary hypertension, hepatopulmonary syndrome, hypoglycemia, or bleeding.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1531003512455223">6</xref></sup> However, most patients commonly present without symptoms, with an incidental imaging finding. Symptomatic patients usually have relative sparing of their hepatic synthetic functions and portal hypertensive symptoms such as splenomegaly, ascites, and varices are usually absent. Symptoms tend to occur with advancing age as the shunt enlarges and patients’ tolerance for high ammonia levels diminish.</p>
<p>Treatment options include observation for asymptomatic patients, medical therapy with restriction of protein intake and ingestion of lactulose or nonabsorbable antibiotics for encephalopathy, and finally, surgery (portal vein ligation or hepatic lobectomy) or transcatheter embolization as definitive therapy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1531003512455223">3</xref></sup> If intervention is recommended, transcatheter embolization of the portal-venous shunt is preferred because of its less invasive nature. Various embolization techniques have been described using a wide range of embolization materials.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1531003512455223">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1531003512455223">8</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>In this report, we describe a useful embolization technique for managing a complex, large type 3 symptomatic spontaneous intrahepatic portal-systemic shunt using Nester coils (Cook Inc, Bloomington, IN) and Amplatzer vascular plugs (AGA Medical Corp, Plymouth, MN).</p>

<title>Interventional Technique</title>
<p>A 77-year-old man with hereditary xerocytosis presented with encephalopathy, which had developed slowly over a 6-month period, culminating in the patient’s involvement in a minor traffic accident. Other past medical history included atrial fibrillation, hypertension, and noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus for which he was on warfarin, atenolol, and metformin, respectively. Physical exam revealed no significant abnormalities, except for an enlarged spleen on abdominal exam. A serum ammonia level was elevated to 400 µg/dL (normal = 10-80 µg/dL). Computed tomography (CT) scan demonstrated a very large, aneurysmal portal-venous shunt from the right portal vein to the right hepatic vein, measuring approximately 3.5 cm in diameter in the peripheral right liver lobe (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1531003512455223">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1531003512455223">B</xref>). The shunt involved both the anterior and posterior divisions of the right portal vein. Liver morphology did not reflect cirrhosis, but the spleen was enlarged to 13.4 cm presumably from the patient’s underlying hematopoietic condition. The patient was treated with lactulose and showed moderate improvement in mental function. Transcatheter embolization of the large spontaneous intrahepatic portal-venous shunt was planned.</p>

<p>Using ultrasound guidance, a right internal jugular puncture was made and a 6-French introducer sheath was placed. An H1 guide catheter (Cordis, Miami Lakes, FL) was then used to gain access to the enlarged right hepatic vein. The catheter was brought into the anomalous venous channel in the right lobe and a venogram was performed. This revealed reflux into the portal vein and an aneurysm at the point of portal-venous communication (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1531003512455223">Figure 2A</xref>). Subsequently, a 7-French Ansel I (Cook Inc, Bloomington, IN) introducer sheath was placed into the hepatic vein and wire access was gained into the right portal vein. An angiographic catheter was placed into the portal vein and simultaneous pressure measurements from the introducer sheath in the hepatic vein and the catheter in the portal vein revealed no pressure gradient (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1531003512455223">Figure 2B</xref>). Using a super-stiff Amplatz wire, the 7-French sheath was passed into the main portal vein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1531003512455223">Figure 2C</xref>). A 12-mm Amplatzer vascular plug was then deployed via the Ansel sheath across the parenchymal tract, causing complete obstruction of the shunt (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1531003512455223">Figure 2D</xref>).</p>

<p>The patient had no complications and was discharged home on the first postoperative day. An ultrasound performed before hospital discharge revealed patent portal and hepatic veins with normal directional blood flow and no residual portal-systemic shunt. The encephalopathy had completely resolved by clinical follow-up 2 weeks later. However, a CT scan performed at 4 months postprocedure revealed the intrahepatic portal-venous shunt to be patent again (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1531003512455223">Figure 3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1531003512455223">B</xref>). He was asymptomatic at this time and serum ammonia levels had returned to normal indicating that the shunt flow was much less than previous. Because of persistence of the shunt and risk of encephalopathy recurrence, a second embolization attempt was planned.</p>

<p>Initially, the right internal jugular vein was punctured and the very large right hepatic vein was catheterized similar to before. Wire access was gained into the portal vein past the previously placed Amplatzer plug but an introducer sheath could not be advanced because of the very acute angle. Therefore, the anterior abdomen was sterilely prepared and draped. Using ultrasound guidance, a puncture was made into the left portal vein and a 5-French introducer sheath was placed. A portal venogram revealed one large vascular shunt between the right portal vein and the right hepatic vein with 2 smaller shunts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1531003512455223">Figure 4A</xref>). An H1 guide catheter was placed selectively into the 2 smaller branches and each were embolized with a combination of 4-mm, 5-mm, and 6-mm Nester coils. The sheath was then upsized to 7-French and a tight J-wire was passed up into the right atrium through the right hepatic vein. The 7-French sheath was advanced through the shunt into the right hepatic vein and a 10-mm Amplatzer plug was deployed across the shunt. Care was taken not to affect the normal portal venous flow. There was continued flow around the plug, and therefore several more Nester coils were placed in this area. At the end of the procedure, a portal venogram was performed which revealed very little flow into the right hepatic vein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1531003512455223">Figure 4B</xref>).</p>

<p>The patient again had no complications and was discharged home on the first postoperative day. An ultrasound performed at 3 months postprocedure showed patent portal and hepatic veins with normal directional blood flow with no residual portal-systemic shunt. The patient was doing well at that time with no further episodes of encephalopathy.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The technique described allows for the endovascular treatment of large spontaneous intrahepatic portal-systemic venous shunts. Embolization of these shunts has been achieved with various materials including coils and microcoils, detachable balloons, and <italic>N</italic>-butyl cyanoacrylate (NBCA)–Lipiodol mixtures.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1531003512455223">3</xref></sup> Rarely have Amplatzer vascular plugs been reported in the adult literature. The main advantages of using the Amplatzer plug over coils are better control on deployment, larger luminal embolization diameter, and decreased metallic artifact on follow-up CT imaging, which allows better visualization of any persistent veno-venous shunting. Unfortunately, in our patient, additional channels developed on follow-up and the shunt became too complex to be adequately treated with a single Amplatzer plug. Therefore, a combination of coils and plugs were used to achieve closure. We selectively used Amplatzer plugs in the larger branches of the shunt and conversely used coils in the smaller branches. The plugs are safer than coils in larger branches due to their ability to be repositioned, being released only after the operator has verified appropriate placement. Additionally, the plug can also be used as an anchor for coils if there is persistence of flow.</p>
<p>Percutaneous systemic embolization, and transhepatic if necessary, is offered as the preferred approach for therapeutic treatment for spontaneous intrahepatic portal-systemic venous shunts. Despite the rarity of this condition, small series and case reports have consistently reported embolization techniques to have low morbidity and mortality. Various embolization materials have been shown to be safe and effective, including the Amplatzer vascular plug device and Nester coils described here. There were no complications seen in our patient but obliteration of portal-systemic shunts can be associated with ascites accumulation and/or formation of esophageal varices.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The present case illustrates that embolization of large, complex spontaneous intrahepatic portal-systemic venous shunts, with a combination of Amplatzer vascular plugs and Nester coils, is feasible and useful. This technique may expand the percutaneous embolization options for veno-venous shunts. The presented case also demonstrates 2 complementary approaches, systemic and transhepatic, for the treatment of the condition.</p>
