<p><bold><italic>Question</italic></bold>: Do I need to complete all my Direct Observations of Procedural Skills (DOPS) in general practice?</p>
<p><bold><italic>Answer</italic></bold>: DOPS form part of the Workplace Based Assessment (WPBA). They involve a GP trainee being observed carrying out 8 mandatory and 11 optional procedures, to ensure good clinical skills and to provide the opportunity for feedback. They can be observed by a GP (not necessarily your trainer), staff grade doctor, specialist trainee doctor of ST4 or above, nurse practitioner or clinical nurse specialist. Please do not ask your peers to assess you.</p>
<p>You should complete them as the opportunity arises during any part of your training. You will find that some are easier to complete in a hospital setting and others in a primary care environment but your deanery may wish that you have completed them all during your ST3 year to ensure your skills remain up to date.</p>
<p>You will need to have been assessed as competent in all the mandatory skills by the end of your ST3 year. There is no limit to the number of times you can carry out any DOP in order to achieve this. You will be assessed according to what your assessor would expect a competent fully trained GP to achieve so do not be disheartened if you are deemed to ‘need further development’ and need to repeat the DOPS.</p>
<p><italic>If you have a question that you would like to ask an examiner, please email your question to: editorialoffice@innovaitjournal.co.uk. We will try to find you an answer and print the best questions and answers in this section of InnovAiT</italic>.</p>
