<abstract>
<p>The lament speech form is an integral part of Israel’s faith and liturgy, yet its significance has not been adequately accounted for in Christian liturgy and theology. This is astonishing given that Jesus’ resurrection is God’s response to his lament on the cross. Jesus’ cry radicalizes Israel’s practice of lament, yet at the same time his lament contains the distinct aspects of revealing a trinitarian kenosis of God and portraying the crucified one as the new locus of encounter with God, all of which highlights the need to give prominence to an apophatic theology. Given the saving significance of Jesus’ suffering, our suffering, as taken up into the history of God, is to be viewed as a mode of God’s presence; it is not only a condition from which to be delivered but the means by which the hope of a ‘new creation’ will be realized. Jesus’ cry also discloses a complex threefold character to his suffering, which calls for a radical discipleship conceived as participation in the kenosis of the crucified one, who is in complete solidarity with all aspects of suffering humanity.</p>

<p>Recent Old Testament study of the lament as a speech form, especially the lament psalm, has revealed the important function that it plays in the faith and liturgy of Israel.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0021140012465037">1</xref></sup> Walter Brueggemann, for instance, has argued that the value of the lament as a form of prayer uttered in a situation of human distress lies in that ‘it shifts the calculus and <italic>redresses the redistribution of power</italic> between the two parties,’ so that the petitioner is truly heard and taken seriously by God who becomes newly engaged in the human crisis.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0021140012465037">2</xref></sup> J. David Pleins has written about how the biblical lament allows suffering believers to articulate feelings of grief, thereby ‘opening the way to a deeper struggle with God.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0021140012465037">3</xref></sup> Worship should not be confined to praise and thanksgiving, since a necessary dimension of worship is the acknowledgment that so much of human experience is beyond our control.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0021140012465037">4</xref></sup> Yet the lament, as John Mark Hicks has pointed out, must not be treated as an opportunity to wallow in the sorrow of the human predicament; rather, the lament as an expression of faith performs an empowering function. ‘Lament gives hope, because embedded in the lament is an appeal that arises out of trust in the God whose love is forever. Lament is the mode by which hope is reborn.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0021140012465037">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>Despite the current scholarly recognition of the essential role that lament plays in the faith and liturgy of Israel, Brueggemann is concerned that the use of the lament speech form is largely lost in contemporary church usage, and he attributes this fact to the tendency amongst Christians to disregard the laments on theological grounds, believing they are superseded by key christological claims.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0021140012465037">6</xref></sup> Oswald Bayer’s degree of concern is even more pronounced in that he traces back the lack of use of the lament speech form to the earliest days of Christianity; he finds it simply astonishing that ‘the fundamental significance of lament has not been accounted for in the church’s liturgy or its theology.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0021140012465037">7</xref></sup> This astonishment consists in the fact that the resurrection of Christ is confessed as the answer to the lament of Jesus expressed on the cross (cf. Mark 15:34; Matt 27:46), in which case the praise of God necessarily incorporates the lament of the son’s undeserved suffering and violent death. In the Eucharist, the crucified one is present as the living and risen one; he speaks as the one who has been heard by the father (cf. Heb 5:7), and together they send the spirit of new life, which is the power that saves and re-creates out of the midst of suffering and death.</p>
<p>It is of the utmost importance, then, that the faithful in the throes of injustice, suffering, and death be allowed to open their hearts in prayers of lament and take initiative with God, for only in this manner can real-life situations be honestly acknowledged, and the lament function as a genuine liturgical and theological activity of mourning before God, whose veil of silence seems impenetrable. The experience of everyday life is such that the faithful are inevitably led to mourn the apparent silence of God in human affairs, so that faith often gives way to the distress of spiritual desolation.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0021140012465037">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>The aim of this article is to contribute to the development of a theology of lament by proposing that it represents a true apophatic theology. The adjective ‘true’ is not intended to imply that this article will critique and replace a ‘false’ apophaticism; rather, by true is meant that the way Jesus’ lament on the cross is interpreted represents a radicalization of the apophatic or negative way of unknowing in theology. The notion of ‘kenosis’ will emerge as integral to the development of the argument, but the notion of God’s self-restriction or ‘surrendered attributes’ in the event of the incarnation of the Logos will be repudiated and replaced with an understanding of the self-emptying of the divine persons in giving themselves completely to one another in perfect reciprocity as an expression, not retraction, of the fullness of deity that dwells bodily in Jesus Christ. The article will proceed as follows. First, recent study of the psalms of lament will be briefly reviewed in order to appreciate the basic structure and movement of the lament psalm as a speech form. Second, Jesus’ cry of God-forsakenness in the Markan and Matthean crucifixion story, which is taken from Psalm 22, will be examined in light of the wisdom motif of the <italic>passio justi</italic> (the suffering just or righteous ones). The findings of the second part of the essay will show the legitimacy of Israel’s practice of lament, which should not be regarded as superseded by christological claims, although at the same time the intention will be to shed light on some distinctly Christian insights into the drama of the divine–human relationship. In the third and final section of the article, some significant implications of the argument will be underscored, especially in respect of our understanding of the divine nature and apophatic theology. This involves a complex view of Christ’s solidarity with suffering humanity and its implications for Christian discipleship and worship.</p>

<title>Current Study on the Prayer of Lament</title>
<p>The practice of lament as a speech form is not confined to the psalms of the Psalter but can be traced to early narrative texts that give voice to hardships experienced by the people.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0021140012465037">9</xref></sup> It is Moses who first models displeasure with God from whom he seeks guarantees (cf. Exod 32:31–32; 33:15), which leads him to protest that the burden placed on his shoulders as the leader of the Hebrew people is far too heavy for him (cf. Num. 11:10–15).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0021140012465037">10</xref></sup> The most extraordinary thing about these texts is that, in each case, Moses, not God, is portrayed as the one who prevails in the dialogue. The protest is not simply heard and received by God, but God is truly affected by the complaint and responds to Moses by doing a new thing in the drama of salvation history so that a genuine covenant interaction is in view. The lament psalms of the Psalter follow in the same vein as Moses insofar as the state of distress is laid squarely at the throne of God, who must take decisive action in order to save the distressed supplicant from affliction and injustice.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0021140012465037">11</xref></sup> It is with the prophet Jeremiah, though, who lived throughout the catastrophic events that culminated in the Babylonian Exile of 587 BCE, that the lament tradition is heightened to intense, personal speech (cf. Jer 20:7–12, 18) by raising ‘the issue of divine integrity within the context of a <italic>via dolorosa</italic> [way of suffering].’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0021140012465037">12</xref></sup> Even during the reform period under Ezra and Nehemiah, the great prayer of Ezra begins by recounting God’s deeds of creation and merciful redemption (Neh 9:3–31), and then proceeds to exhort God not to treat lightly all the hardship that has come upon the people gathered in Jerusalem (Neh 9:32–37).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0021140012465037">13</xref></sup> The apex of the lament tradition, however, is reached with Job whose harsh protest (cf. Job 9:19–24) serves to nullify the dominant theology of deeds and consequences; that is, if something is amiss then it must be the fault of the protester, who is required to acknow- ledge guilt and do penance in order to restore right relationship to God. The fact that it is Job who is declared by God as having spoken of what is right, not the friends (Job 42:8), shows that the conventions of the accepted rational order are now being declared as inadequate and in urgent need of revision, reinterpretation, and upgrading.</p>
<p>Brueggemann concludes that this ‘counter-tradition’ articulated by Moses-Psalms-Jeremiah-Job is sufficiently pervasive in Jewish literature that it be regarded as a major source of tension with the clear-cut rationality of the theology of sanctions.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0021140012465037">14</xref></sup> The lament form of speech respects the voice of pain (How long? and Why?) as a legitimate voice that is heard by the living God; it points to the practice of ‘limit expression,’ which gives access to those dimensions of present reality that defy our attempts to pin everything down in the interests of control, management, and certainty.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0021140012465037">15</xref></sup> Through the lament form of speech, the dynamic between God and his suffering people is changed by virtue of the introduction of genuine reciprocity in the divine–human relationship.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0021140012465037">16</xref></sup> While the Old Testament makes it plain that the relationship is asymmetrical inasmuch as God initiates the relationship and first addresses the human, nonetheless, this asymmetrical character of the relationship is not portrayed in a strictly unidirectional manner but is thought of as truly dialogical in character; that is to say, God not only addresses the human, but the human also addresses God and protests that justice does not have the upper hand, that the world is out of kilter. It is precisely this dialogic character of the divine–human relationship that creates room for surprise, for the living of human life as openness to unfathomable mystery, and hence for the reconfiguration of present reality through a new self-utterance of God.</p>
<p>The biblical lament, while risky since spoken honestly out of the depths of the heart, is not dismissed by God but taken seriously in a way that leads to <italic>newness</italic> in the covenant relation between the parties. What is redressed in the lament speech form, as stated earlier, is the redistribution of power between God and Israel. The laments function, then, in a very different way to Greek tragedy, for they raise a cry out of the depths in the confidence that God has the power to lift the lamenter out of the ‘miry bog’ and to set their feet upon a rock (Ps 40:1–3). Yet, while the laments are heartfelt expressions of the distressing reality of human suffering, loss, and grief, at the same time, they are utterances of praise that are offered to God in the confidence that God is faithful and will not abandon his servants, but will be moved to perform a new action that will bring deliverance and salvation to them. This will become more evident from the structure of the lament speech form in the Psalter, to which we now turn.</p>
<p>While there is some variation in the details according to the interests of the psalmist, the lament form exhibits a discernible structure.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0021140012465037">17</xref></sup> In each of the following structural components that typically make up the lament psalm, the relevant verses from Psalm 22 will be cited so as to prepare for an adequate interpretation of Jesus’ cry on the cross, which will be discussed in the next section of this essay. (a) <italic>Address to God</italic>: The address of the lamenter can be a brief and poignant cry (vv. 1–2) or a recollection of the saving deeds of God in the past (vv. 3–5). (b) <italic>Complaint</italic>: The lament arises out of terrible distress and grief caused by military crisis, threat of enemies, severe drought, prolonged famine, undeserved sickness, fear of death, or awareness of sin and guilt (vv. 6–10, 12–18). (c) <italic>Confession of trust</italic>: Notwithstanding the negative and dark experience of lived reality, the lamenter expresses confidence in the living God that he will rescue them from affliction (vv. 3–5). (d) <italic>Petition</italic>: The petition conveys the supplication for divine intervention so that present reality may be reconfigured and transformed (vv. 11, 19–21). (e) <italic>Vow of praise and thanksgiving</italic>: In the confidence that God not only hears the lament but will respond decisively to the supplication, the lamenter vows to call upon the name of God and to testify before the community of Israel to what God has done (vv. 22–28).</p>
<p>As can be seen from the overall pattern of the lament psalm, the cry out of the depths of distress is ‘motivated by a deep confidence that Yhwh is the compassionate God—the God who hears, who is concerned, and who is involved with the people.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0021140012465037">18</xref></sup> The God whom Israel worships, in other words, is characterized by <italic>pathos</italic>. It is of particular importance to stress that the composition is such that the lament never stands by itself, which would amount to a hopeless wallowing in self-pity and misery and to a denial of God’s past deeds as giving grounds for hope. Instead, like the second movement of a symphony, the initial petition conveyed out of a state of distress moves into the final movement of future praise of God, who alone can vindicate and deliver those who lament from the adverse situation in which they are immersed.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-0021140012465037">19</xref></sup> No lament directed to God exists ‘entirely without remembered trust or, finally, expected answer.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-0021140012465037">20</xref></sup> The lament, in other words, while an acknowledgment of loss and failure, is, at the same time, an act of faith that assumes and enlivens hope. It is not intended as a reflection on human suffering but as a candid utterance of the reality of human distress spoken out of the depths of the heart, in the radical hope that the faithful God, who identifies with the suffering people will respond out of the depths of the divine compassion so as to make a way into the future for them.</p>
<p>What the lament speech form brings into sharp focus, to state the matter differently, is the bipolar character of Israel’s faith as both ‘in the fray’ and ‘above the fray.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-0021140012465037">21</xref></sup> The embrace of pain is admitted as integral to the life and faith of Israel as the servant of the living God; yet, at the same time, it is acknowledged as a posture of God, who hears the cries of the covenant people and identifies with them in bringing about a new action to relieve the suffering and create a new future for them. The embrace of pain and the grief of abandonment are a crucial voice in the history of Israel, and, in the development of the liturgy of the people of God, it runs towards the cross of Jesus Christ in the New Testament: ‘Psalm 22 prefigures a theology of the cross, when God and man are together crucified. They are united in the ultimate agony.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-0021140012465037">22</xref></sup> The next section will seek to demonstrate the legitimacy of this concluding statement.</p>

<sec id="section2-0021140012465037">
<title>Jesus’ Cry and the Wisdom Tradition of the Suffering Just One</title>
<p>A useful starting point for reflecting on the passion of Jesus is the narration of the episode in the Garden of Gethsemane (cf. Mark 14:26–42; Matt 26:36–46; Luke 22:39–46), for what transpires in the garden is ‘the key to all that is about to happen, a warning to read all that follows in this light.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-0021140012465037">23</xref></sup> What this narrative highlights is that Jesus manifests himself as the one who is united with the father in unfathomable love (cf. John 4:34; 6:38). At the same time, the narrative marks a crucial transition point for the enactment of Jesus’ obedience to the father. The transition is from a certain liberty of action and scope of movement, which Jesus had enjoyed as a figure of authority and power in his proclamation of the kingdom of God, to a distressing situation of powerlessness and helplessness that Jesus enters into freely when he gives himself over to the Jewish and Roman authorities.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-0021140012465037">24</xref></sup> We are given here a rare glimpse into Jesus’ inner life when, pleading with the father that ‘this cup’ be removed from him, he confirms instead his obedience to the father (Mark 14:36; Matt 26:39; Luke 22:42; John 18:11) with whom he is one.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-0021140012465037">25</xref></sup> ‘It is now shown where the victory which Jesus won in the temptation in the wilderness leads (cf. Luke 4:13), that the end will involve the death of the victor.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-0021140012465037">26</xref></sup> Jesus’ obedience unto death should not, however, be interpreted as Stoic submissiveness to the father, but as personal commitment to carrying out his mission as the son who brings the glad tidings of final salvation for Israel and the world.</p>
<p>While Jesus is genuinely affected by distress and agony (Luke 22:44 says that Jesus sweated drops of blood in the garden), the emphasis in the narrative falls on Jesus as truly tested in his fidelity to the father. The Letter to the Hebrews states the matter clearly when it says that Jesus offered up prayers ‘with loud cries and tears’ and ‘learned obedience through what he suffered’ (Heb 5:7–8). For all his sovereignty, it is tested faith that identifies Jesus as the son, and he crowns a tradition that turns out to be Israel’s long tradition of tested faith in an invisible God (cf. Heb 11:1–3). In the description of the man Jesus, we would do well to keep coming back to the truth of the words uttered by the chief priests and the scribes: ‘He saved others; he cannot save himself’ (Mark 15:31; Matt 27:42; Luke 23:35; cf. Ps. 22:7–8). These words suggest that if Jesus had not given up the power to save himself from death, he could not have saved others, in which case we are to see in the transition from power to helplessness the actual realization of Jesus’ saving power. Jesus had spoken at the Last Supper of his blood of the covenant, which will be ‘poured out for many’ (Mark 14:24; Matt 26:28), and now the shedding of his blood can be seen as the content or purpose of his obedience to the father that is enacted in the garden. We are not given another glimpse into the inner life of Jesus in the events climaxing the Gospel story apart from the poignant and fitting lament of Jesus on the cross: ‘My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?’ (Mark 15:34; Matt 27:46).</p>
<p>Against this backdrop of Jesus’ prayer in the Garden of Gethsemane as marking the son’s transition from power to helplessness, an attempt will now be made to illuminate the meaning of Jesus’ cry of lament within the framework of the Old Testament motif of the <italic>passio justi</italic> (the suffering just one). The earliest Christians had to address not only the considerable problem of preaching a Messiah who had experienced death, but the much bigger problem posed by the cross, which was a form of death that was reserved for hardened criminals, rebellious slaves, and rebels against Roman rule. ‘A crucified Messiah, son of God or God, must have seemed a contradiction in terms to anyone, Jew, Greek, Roman or barbarian, asked to believe such a claim, and it will certainly have been thought offensive and foolish.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn27-0021140012465037">27</xref></sup> Paul sums up the situation succinctly when he writes that to preach a crucified Messiah is ‘a stumbling block to Jews and folly to Gentiles’ (1 Cor 1:23). The earliest Christians simply could not present their Gospel message to the Jewish world without first attempting to resolve the scandal of a crucified Messiah.</p>
<p>To address this key problem, recourse was made to the Jewish wisdom motif of the just one, who suffers, despite fidelity to God’s will, and who feels abandoned by God to adversity. According to this tradition, which is given abundant expression in the psalms of lament, it is precisely in the apparent absence of God that the suffering just proclaim trust in God, for ultimately they can turn only to God for vindication and deliverance from a situation of distress, affliction, and injustice. The structural movement in the psalms of lament, as highlighted earlier, is from a situation of lament to anticipated future praise of God. Hence when we seek to interpret Jesus’ cry of lament, which is a recitation of the opening verse of Psalm 22, we must bear in mind that the movement of the psalm ends in a vow of renewed praise of God (vv. 22–28) in light of the anticipated new redemptive action of God, who alone can make a way into the future when all seems futile and lost.</p>
<p>The fact that the psalm ends in a vow of praise of God does not, however, allow us to gloss over or tame Jesus’ genuine lament or cry of dereliction by turning it solely into a cry of trust in God.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn28-0021140012465037">28</xref></sup> When the cry is interpreted in the context of the development of Jesus’ identity as the son in the Gospel story, it is presented as the culminating point of Jesus’ increasing isolation and loneliness in carrying out his mission to Israel: he is abandoned by the Jewish people at large, by the Jewish religious authorities, by his very own disciples, and now he feels abandoned even by God to terrible adversity at the hands of his enemies. We should, then, fully appreciate the immediate sense of abandonment by God conveyed in the opening words of Psalm 22 on Jesus’ lips, and not downplay it by turning the lament into a cry of trust in God and future praise of God.</p>
<p>On the other hand, we must not lose sight of the fact that since Jesus’ cry belongs to the tradition of the suffering just one, and is thus to be regarded as a radical test of faith in the living God, it is also inadequate to hold that it is a cry of a desperate man in the throes of intolerable suffering and grief.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn29-0021140012465037">29</xref></sup> We are required to hold in dialectical tension, in other words, both the reality of Jesus’ torment of God-forsakenness and the enactment of Jesus’ perfect obedience to the father as the climactic point of his mission to Israel. Insofar as Jesus is aware of his mission as the son as coming from the heavenly father with whom he is one, we can say that he is ‘above the fray.’ The Lucan account of Jesus’ last words on the cross, namely, ‘Father, into thy hands I commit my spirit!’ (23:46)—which is taken from the lament Psalm 31:5—is able to convey this aspect of the cross with special force.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn30-0021140012465037">30</xref></sup> Yet, at the same time, we cannot lose sight of the fact that since Jesus’ identity as the son is forged in the harsh and brutal reality of being ‘in the fray’ of a fallen world, where evil forces seem to have the upper hand in their opposition to God’s reign of justice, goodness, and peace, Jesus feels genuinely forsaken by God and delivered into the hands of his enemies.</p>
<p>The motif of the suffering just one underwent a significant development, however, which is especially apparent in the Book of Wisdom (cf. 2:10–20), where the just are persecuted not <italic>despite</italic> the fact that they are upright and righteous, but precisely <italic>because</italic> they bear faithful witness to the living Lord.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn31-0021140012465037">31</xref></sup> While the sufferings are still seen as putting the faith of the just to the test so that they may be proved to be worthy of God (cf. Wis 3:5), the primary emphasis falls on depicting the suffering endured as proof of their justice: the persecution of the righteous by the godless, on the grounds of the just lives they lead, becomes the sign of divine election. The text of Wisdom 2:10–20—which purports to be the scornful talk of the impious and godless (alluded to in vv. 6–8 of Psalm 22)—was a primary source for the Gospel narratives of the passion of Jesus, as Jesus is cast in the role of the one who is unjustly put to a shameful death for having irritated the powers that be by his proclamation of the radical love of the father for his people. Seemingly forsaken by God, Jesus’ faith in God is put to a decisive test by his scornful rejectors. The renunciation on Jesus’ part of any kind of self-justification before his enemies (cf. Mark 15:29–30; Matt 27:39) and the acceptance of his unjust suffering unto death without the expectation of any saving act on the part of God, as demanded by those who mock and taunt him (cf. Mark 15:31–32; Matt 27:41–43; Luke 23:35–38), is thoroughly consistent with the motif of the persecuted just one depicted in the Book of Wisdom and in Psalm 22. Jesus gives himself over completely to the father, who falls silent during his hour of distress and affliction, yet by freely accepting a shameful and unjust death at the hands of sinners out of fidelity to his mission as the son, his suffering becomes the proof both of his divine election and the integrity of his justice.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn32-0021140012465037">32</xref></sup> By virtue of standing <italic>for</italic> God, Jesus stands <italic>against</italic> the powers and forces in the world that oppose the establishment of God’s reign in the world.</p>
<p>But while the suffering Jesus who bears faithful witness to God in a cruel and unjust world awaits no decisive act of God in this life, God’s response does come in a definitive manner by raising Jesus from the dead in the power of the spirit (cf. Rom 1:4). The resurrection of Jesus appears as the answer to his cry of abandonment on the cross. Jesus’ lament is not only heard by God, but God responds in a new action that conquers death in the full sense and reveals the crucified one as ‘the Holy and Just One’ (Acts 3:14). The victory of Jesus over death consists in an eschatological act that represents the dawn of the anticipated ‘new creation’ (cf. Isa 66:22–23; Jer 31:31–34; Ezek 36:26–28) that is integral to the faith of Israel. In his state of utter forsakenness and helplessness, by enduring the absence of God out of love of God, Jesus gives up his spirit without reserve to the father (cf. Luke 23:46) so that on the cross what is accomplished is the perfect union of his humanity with the father.</p>
<p>From the foregoing discussion of Jesus’ lament on the cross, two distinct but interrelated poles are apparent. First, although the reader is left with a clear sense of Jesus’ real experience of the darkness of rejection, loneliness, and suffering on the cross, this psychological or affective aspect of his passion, significant as it may be, is not the primary focus of the Gospel narrative. Instead, the emphasis falls, as the episode in the Garden of Gethsemane makes unequivocally clear, on Jesus’ perfect obedience to the father’s will as a decisive manifestation of personal unity with the father in unfathomable love. The mystery of the person of Jesus lies in that his identity as the son is inextricably tied to his personal unity with the God, whom he addressed as father, which the Christian tradition has articulated in terms of Jesus’ ‘consubstantiality’ with the father as to divinity. The divinity of the man Jesus, in other words, is to be thought of in terms of his <italic>modus of being-related</italic> to the father, which, moreover, requires his divinity to be conceived as mediated by his humanity.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn33-0021140012465037">33</xref></sup> The identity of Jesus as the son of the father is not something that is given from the very beginning of his life, but unfolds in a truly historical manner, so that the cross appears as the climactic point of the gradual process of Jesus’ individualization that takes place with reference to his sustained relationships to his hostile surroundings, on the one hand, and to his faithful identification with the kingdom of the father, on the other.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn34-0021140012465037">34</xref></sup> We can, therefore, say that the man Jesus is the father’s representative before the world—this allows us to conceive of the father’s suffering in abandoning his son to the world, which will be discussed below.</p>
<p>Second, following the Jewish wisdom tradition of the suffering just one, Mark and Matthew do not have in mind a juridical interpretation of Jesus’ cry of lament; rather, the focus is on the theological meaning of Jesus’ lament.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn35-0021140012465037">35</xref></sup> On the lips of Jesus, the opening words of Psalm 22 are intended as an interpretation of his death; that is to say, Jesus, the just one, who suffers an unjust death at the hands of his enemies because of steadfast fidelity to the father’s kingdom of justice, goodness, and peace, has completely assumed in his person the human condition of suffering and estrangement from God of which the cross is the consummate sign.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn36-0021140012465037">36</xref></sup> This theological interpretation of Jesus’ death lends its support to much contemporary rethinking of satisfaction theories of atonement insofar as the son was not stricken by God’s thirst for retributive justice but by the violence of a sinful humanity that refuses to accept the kingdom of God as proclaimed by the son.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn37-0021140012465037">37</xref></sup> This second pole, contained within and inseparable from the first, highlights Jesus’ solidarity with the concrete human condition, which is what the Christian tradition means when it affirms that Jesus is ‘consubstantial’ with us as to humanity. In light of the latter affirmation, the man Jesus appears as humanity’s representative before the father (in this type of representation, every human lament is taken up into the lament of Jesus addressed to the father). In the crowning act of perfect obedience to the father in suffering death on a cross for our sake, the rejected Jesus has identified himself fully with adamic flesh in order that an estranged humanity might be ‘reconciled to God’ (Rom 5:10) and ‘raised up’ (John 6:40; 12:32) to permanent union with God as its final end. What the two closely intertwined poles indicate, to sum up, is that the man Jesus is the mediator between divinity and humanity, so that in his person we human beings become ‘partakers of the divine nature’ (2 Pet 1:4).</p>
<p>What Jesus’ lament on the cross announces is the solidarity and identification of the living God with the wretchedness, brokenness, and limits of the human condition, as well as with all the suffering innocent who are tortured and put to death by human cruelty and violence. Jesus, the just one, who is perfectly united with the father in unfathomable love, dies not a gentle death like Socrates (and his cup of hemlock) or a passing at the end of a fulsome life, but a torturous and utterly humiliating death on a cross. There is no question that the word of the cross ‘caused offence, but in this very offence it revealed itself as the centre of the gospel,’ as God’s new response to the troublesome ‘Why Lord?’ and ‘How long Lord?’ questions that are characteristic of the lament speech form.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn38-0021140012465037">38</xref></sup> What transpired in the Garden of Gethsemane and on the hill of Golgotha is God’s ‘yes’ to a humanity groaning for its salvation, which does not, however, remove the suffering or explain it away, or justify it, but rather inserts it into the incomprehensible mystery of God, who alone is able to end suffering, deliver justice, and create new life out of a helpless situation of affliction and distress.</p>
<p>As a final point, the recognition of the ineffable love between the father and the son as the exegesis of Jesus’ lament on the cross leads us to appreciate that the father surrendered his son to a heartless world, that he willingly ‘gave him up for us all’ (Rom 8:32) in order that ‘the world might be saved through him’ (Jn 3:18).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn39-0021140012465037">39</xref></sup> The notion of the father’s forsaking of the son unto death not only highlights the pathos of God but also sheds light on the father’s silence in enduring a sinful people so as to make a way into the future for them. The illumination consists in the acknowledgment that not only does Jesus suffer the abandonment of the father (cf. Gal 2:20), but the father suffers the abandonment of the son (cf. Rom 8:32) to religious and worldly authorities, so that the silence of the father takes on a profound revelatory and salvific significance in terms of the father’s identification with the crucified one.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn40-0021140012465037">40</xref></sup> The radical unity of love between the forsaken son and the forsaking father—which is preserved in the spirit of God—implies that the non-intervention of the father must be seen in a positive light, for the father reveals himself on the cross not despite his silence but precisely in this silence. The silence of God, then, should not be interpreted as meaning the loss of divine presence altogether, although clearly Jesus’ lament indicates the loss of a certain intensification of God’s presence, which he had enjoyed earlier as a figure of authority in his mission to Israel. It is worth listening to how J. Moingt positively states the father’s silence on Calvary:
<disp-quote>
<p>When interrogated in the light of Easter, the scandalous silence of God on Calvary becomes revelation. God manifests himself by disappearing in the death of Christ. He manifests himself as the interiority of this event of death … as the exchange of relationships and of gifts that constitute them, the one and the other, in their being of father and son. The father reveals himself on the cross not despite his silence and his non-intervention but positively, by contrast, in this silence and through the very fact of abandoning his son. He intervenes insofar as he abstains from intervening, and this abstention is a decisive and definitive act.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn41-0021140012465037">41</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The silence of the father in abandoning the son on the cross can be regarded as a silent lament that is intrinsic to Jesus’ cry of lament. This divine lament highlights the pathos of God and the manner in which God is working to bring salvation to Israel and the world. What takes place in this definitive event of salvation is the perfect union of the son’s humanity with the father and the complete identification of the father with the crucified son, which results in the formation of a new creation that is perfectly consecrated by the glory of God in the son’s being raised from the dead in the spirit. From being the consummate sign of suffering and God-forsakenness, the cross of Jesus becomes the new revelation of God’s salvific activity in regard to Israel and the world, which delivers people from the ‘dominion of darkness’ (Col 1:13) so that they might enjoy the glorious liberty of becoming sons and daughters of God in the son of God (cf. Gal 4:4–7). This reversal of situation is expressed in the Gospel story by two impressive signs: the torn veil of the temple (cf. Mark 15:38; Matt 27:51) and the Roman centurion’s confession of faith (cf. Mark 15:39; Matt 27:54). These signs indicate that the body of the crucified one now becomes the new temple, the new locus of encounter with the living God, which means that the common theology of reward for obedience to the Torah and punishment for disobedience is now null and void: God does not judge according to the demands of strict justice but is now to be thought of as ‘the one who loves in freedom.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn42-0021140012465037">42</xref></sup> The lament of Jesus, as in the overall pattern of the psalms of lament discussed earlier, gives way to praise of God, but the praise of God is connected with Jesus’ glorious resurrection and exaltation to the right hand of God and the sending of the spirit (cf. Acts 2:32–33).</p>

<title>Implications for Theology, Discipleship, and Prayer</title>
<p>(a) The interpretation of Jesus’ cry of lament presented in this essay leads to the bolstering and radicalizing of a particular understanding of the divine character, which is already apparent in the Old Testament; namely, the living God enters into and shares in the present condition of the covenant people, so as to make a way into the future for Israel and the world. In the person of Jesus of Nazareth, God truly enters into and shares in the condition of the people. Yet with regard to Jesus’ concrete solidarity with the human condition, this should not be viewed as a simple matter but as a complex reality since it is possible to identify three integral elements in the above interpretation of Jesus’ lament on the cross.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn43-0021140012465037">43</xref></sup></p>
<p>First, Jesus allows himself to be delivered into the hands of evil forces and, thereby, takes upon himself the <italic>consequences</italic> of sin. Jesus, in other words, suffers ‘because’ of the sin of the world, yet precisely by remaining in relationship to those who reject and condemn him to death (cf. Luke 23:34) the just one becomes their ‘representative’ before the father. Second, Jesus’ concrete solidarity with adamic flesh implies that ‘he too was judged by God, but not in the sense of propitiating and appeasing God.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn44-0021140012465037">44</xref></sup> The Pauline utterance that Jesus was <italic>made sin</italic> (2 Cor 5:21) for our sake is significant in that it portrays Jesus in his God-forsakenness on the cross as ‘bearing’ the sin of the world; that is to say, the just one suffers ‘for’ sinful humanity.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn45-0021140012465037">45</xref></sup> What is in view here is the concept of ‘substitution’ in Christology, according to which the son takes the place of the sinner and suffers the hell of God-forsakenness for the sake of humanity’s blessed union with God. Third, the rejected and suffering Jesus is in complete ‘solidarity’ not only with sinners but also with all the suffering just, who seek to uphold righteousness in the world, and with suffering humans in general, who cry out for deliverance from their affliction. Jesus, in other words, suffers ‘with’ the afflicted and the grieving, with all those who experience the darkness of rejection, loneliness, anguish, and death. The work of Jesus Christ has to do not only with the overcoming of sin and the promise of eternal life for the justified, but also with ending human pain and suffering and wiping away all tears (cf. Rev 21:4). In Pauline theology the work of Jesus Christ is reduced to the problem of human sin, but we need to acknowledge the deeper and broader meaning of Jesus’ life and passion in terms of God’s solidarity with all those who suffer and cry to God out of the depths of human distress, affliction, and loss.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn46-0021140012465037">46</xref></sup></p>
<p>In light of the father’s silent identification with the forsaken Jesus, moreover, it is necessary to speak of a corresponding threefold suffering of the forsaking father. The father suffers ‘because’ he delivers the son, who is his representative in the world, into the hands of sinners, thereby forsaking the son. What is more, insofar as the father sends the son into the world to bear the sin of the world and take the place of sinners, it can be said that the forsaking father suffers ‘for’ sinners. And given the father’s identification with the forsaken son, then the father suffers ‘with’ the afflicted son, who is in solidarity with all the suffering just, the afflicted, and the aggrieved. Not only, then, does Jesus’ cry of lament on the cross represent a radical self-surrender of the son out of unfathomable love for the father and for us, but we are also required to acknowledge the father’s radical self-surrender in giving up his only son to a heartless world, in order to bring salvation and new life to the world.</p>
<p>Of course the spirit of God is also integral to the picture being painted here. However, unlike the son and the father, the spirit of God on the cross experiences neither forsakenness nor the loss of surrendering. The Gospel narrative makes it plain that Jesus is conceived in the power of the spirit and when the spirit descends upon him in his baptism he is empowered to proclaim the kingdom of God to Israel with great authority and power, which causes the people to marvel at his preaching and works of healing. The episode in the Garden of Gethsemane, though, as discussed earlier, marks an important and radical transition from power to helplessness in Jesus’ mission as the son. If, on the one hand, the cross is an experience of absence for the son and the father alike, for the spirit, on the other hand, it is an experience of presence, even though this presence amounts to an ‘abnegation’ of the work of the spirit in Jesus’ ministry to Israel.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn47-0021140012465037">47</xref></sup> The signs and wonders that Jesus had performed earlier by virtue of being empowered by the spirit are no longer apparent in his passion; he is now scorned and mocked, rejected and condemned, and abandoned by God. Yet in this saving event of the forsaken son and the forsaking father, it is the spirit of God who communicates and preserves the ineffable love between the son and the father, which is the exegesis of the event. The son on the cross experiences the abandonment or separation from the father, yet this should not be interpreted as remoteness or alienation from the father, for the spirit of God, who embodies the unity of father and son is ‘the witness who can always testify to their unity even in separation.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn48-0021140012465037">48</xref></sup></p>
<p>(b) The above interpretation of Jesus’ lament on the cross reveals a trinitarian kenosis of God; that is, the forsaking father who freely gives up his son for our sake, the forsaken son who willingly surrenders himself to the father, and the abnegation of the spirit, who is the ineffable bond of love between the father and the son. On the basis of this trinitarian kenosis of God, we should come to appreciate more deeply that what God does in history flows out of what God essentially is, namely, the ‘one who loves in freedom’ (cf. 1 John 4:8, 16), and that personhood should not be regarded as a quality that is added to being; rather, the relating of the persons is being itself. The proposal by Hans Urs von Balthasar that the eternal processions in God be regarded in terms of kenosis, that is, the complete self-giving of the divine persons to one another in perfect reciprocity, is supported by the argument formulated in this article.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn49-0021140012465037">49</xref></sup> To think of the event of the incarnation of the son in terms of kenosis has nothing to do, then, with the notion of God’s self-restriction or ‘surrendered attributes.’ On the contrary, the self-emptying of God in the incarnation, since it flows out of the inner-trinitarian event of self-emptying love of the divine persons, is an expression, not retraction, of the whole fullness of divinity that dwells bodily in the man Jesus (cf. Col 2:9). This means that the mystery of the man Jesus must not be reflected upon in terms of two inert and separate natures, but in terms of the one historical man, Jesus of Nazareth, who is wholly God, so that his divine character is to be seen as mediated by his genuine humanity.</p>
<p>(c) What the trinitarian kenosis of God revealed by Jesus’ lament on the cross also brings to light is that God is not to be thought of as impassible and removed from the historical process, which is characterized by so much distress, sin, grief, mourning, and loss.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn50-0021140012465037">50</xref></sup> As the one who loves in freedom, as the one who sends the son into the world for our salvation, God must be thought of in terms of ‘event,’ not according to a static metaphysical concept of God that simply fails to convey the dynamic character of God as intimately engaged with temporality and history. As Karl Barth has rightly argued, divine freedom is to be understood not as freedom <italic>from</italic> the world but freedom <italic>for</italic> humanity; it is a freedom of intimate involvement with time and history, so that eternity and immutability encompass, rather than preclude, temporality, change, and mortality.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn51-0021140012465037">51</xref></sup> Hans Urs von Balthasar holds the same view when he writes that nothing can be placed ‘outside’ of God, including all forms of suffering and death.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn52-0021140012465037">52</xref></sup> Jürgen Moltmann is also of the view that God be portrayed as receiving the world into the divine self, so that all human history is to be regarded as taken up into the history of God. To ‘think of history in God,’ writes Moltmann, ‘first means to understand humanity in the suffering and dying of Christ, and that means all humanity, with its dilemmas and its despairs.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn53-0021140012465037">53</xref></sup></p>
<p>The interpretation of Jesus’ lament in terms of a trinitarian kenosis of God implies that suffering should not be used as evidence of God’s absence in human affairs. Since, rather, the darkness of suffering is taken up into the history of God, suffering is to be regarded as ‘a mode of God’s presence.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn54-0021140012465037">54</xref></sup> Because the passion of Jesus is so meaningful in respect of our final end of union with the unfathomable God, our own suffering and death acquire ultimate significance not only as a condition from which we are to be delivered but also as the means by which that deliverance might come.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn55-0021140012465037">55</xref></sup> In light of the event of Jesus Christ, it is more correct to speak of the hiddenness, not absence of God in situations of distress, affliction, sin, and suffering. What the lament spoken out of the depths gives expression to is the loss of a certain intensification of God’s presence, and not the loss of divine presence altogether, since the same spirit of God that preserved the radical unity of love between the crucified Jesus and the father is present to the afflicted and joins their lament to that of Jesus the son.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn56-0021140012465037">56</xref></sup> God is not absent and disengaged from our human predicament, but he identifies with and suffers with us; God, in Jesus Christ, is internally connected to our suffering and makes it his own, and in this way we are transferred to ‘the kingdom of his beloved son’ (Col 1:13) in whom ‘all the fullness of God was pleased to dwell’ (Col 1:19; 2:9). Divine salvation, therefore, can only mean ‘that it is <italic>the life man has lived</italic> that is saved, not that man is saved <italic>out</italic> of this life.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn57-0021140012465037">57</xref></sup> God takes the whole of our lives as we have lived them and transforms them into eternal life, that is, participation in the very life and glory of the ineffable Trinity, which leads us to recognize the stuff of everyday life that is lived in flesh and blood as the ‘raw materials of holiness.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn58-0021140012465037">58</xref></sup></p>
<p>(d) The interpretation of Jesus’ cry of lament in terms of a trinitarian kenosis of God serves to underscore the need to give prominence to the ‘apophatic’ or negative way of unknowing in theology over against the ‘cataphatic’ or positive path of knowing. The ultimate achievement of theology should not be knowledge of God, where God is considered as an object of our reflection, but rather that which transcends all knowledge, namely, union with God.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn59-0021140012465037">59</xref></sup> Jesus does not regard the father as an object of reflection; instead, we have seen that his identity is concretely forged in his perfect obedience and self-surrender to the father in carrying out his mission as the son, all the way to the horror and torment of the cross. The lament of Jesus expresses the son’s plunge into the darkness of God-forsakenness and death, notwithstanding the ineffable love between the son and the father.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn60-0021140012465037">60</xref></sup> Within the framework of this apophatic theology, the reality of God calls for a renunciation of knowing according to the human ability to know God. Instead, we must allow ourselves to surrender completely to the incomprehensible God; that is, we must speak of a coming to knowledge of God by means of our utter self-emptying in love (cf. 1 John 4:8, 16), not by means of philosophical abstraction.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn61-0021140012465037">61</xref></sup> To know God is to abide in love; those who abide in love abide in God, and God abides in them, which amounts to a ‘partaking of the divine nature’ (2 Pet 1:4).</p>
<p>(e) The complex threefold character of Jesus’ lament on the cross discussed in section (a) above brings into sharp relief the need to treat the concepts of representation (on our behalf), substitution (in our place), and solidarity (with us) in Christology as mutually inclusive of one another, for each concept highlights an integral dimension of the son’s work in establishing a new creation, a new ontological reality. This perspective is not shared, though, by some notable contemporary theologians. Karl Rahner, for example, prefers to avoid the notion of ‘vicarious representation’ because he believes it leads to a distorted view of the cross as the cause, not consequence, of God’s merciful love towards the world. Hence Rahner thinks in terms of God allowing sin because God from the beginning willed Christ in his ‘solidarity’ both with sinners and with God.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn62-0021140012465037">62</xref></sup> Gerald O’Collins argues in a similar vein when he asserts that substitution and representation are ‘extrinsic’ terms that undermine a sense of personal participation in the son’s redemptive death, where we are shown that the son wants to be ‘with us’ and to share ‘with us’ our human condition.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn63-0021140012465037">63</xref></sup></p>
<p>The two poles of Jesus’ lament on the cross explicated in the previous section of this essay serve to underscore Jesus’ solidarity both with God and with the human condition, and to show that the ineffable love between the son and the father is the exegesis of the event of the cross. But such solidarity is also depicted as including the concepts of representation and substitution: the former acknowledges that the son dies at the hands of a sinful world, yet precisely by keeping himself in relationship to those who condemn him to an unjust death becomes their representative before the father; while the latter acknowledges that the son dies, not only at the hands of sinners, but also at the hands of God insofar as he suffers death as God-forsakenness in a way that no other person can. In support of this view, recourse can be made to Hans Urs von Balthasar’s theology of Holy Saturday, where the son’s complete solidarity with the human condition is stressed, while still employing the notion of substitution to convey the exclusive aspect of the son’s conquest of the ‘second death’ (Rev. 20:6) for our sake.</p>
<p>(f) With regard to an adequate understanding of discipleship, the foregoing statements suggest that the complex nature of Jesus’ suffering must be reflected in the lives of his disciples. To be baptized into Jesus Christ is to live as the suffering just ones, earthly servants of the living God, who suffer ‘because’ they are committed to imitating the self-emptying love of Jesus Christ in a cruel and sinful world that is opposed to the kingdom of God as preached by the just one. To follow Jesus Christ entails a willingness to live in solidarity with the victims of evil and injustice, to suffer ‘with’ the oppressed, marginalized, helpless and voiceless ones (in the hope of making a way together into the future).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn64-0021140012465037">64</xref></sup> And, finally, the community of disciples must display a preparedness to suffer ‘for’ others, that is, to willingly bear the sins of others, rather than exacting judgment, so as to make a future life possible for them too, even if this involves being subjected to humiliation for the sake of the accomplishment of God’s hidden purposes in the world. In sum, the disciples of Jesus should give witness to the reality of participating in the radical kenosis of the son, whose humanity was perfected on the cross in an act of perfect self-surrender to the father in love, for the sake of the salvation of the world.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn65-0021140012465037">65</xref></sup></p>
<p>The upshot of all this is that the church community is to be seen as having a truly sacramental and incarnational character, that is, making visible, concrete, and real the reign of God’s compassionate love, which has manifested itself definitively in the event of Jesus Christ. The community of disciples conceived as the body of Christ is able to convey most effectively, to my mind, the life of discipleship as a being conformed to the complex suffering of the crucified one, who is the unsurpassable locus of encounter between divinity and humanity.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn66-0021140012465037">66</xref></sup> To speak of discipleship in terms of the body of Christ has the advantage of always keeping before us the mystery of the fullness of divinity that dwells bodily in the crucified Jesus (cf. Col 2:9), who shares fully in the human condition so that we might share in the glory of the divine life. On this incarnational model, we come to appreciate that God is not foreign to and removed from human suffering, but rather is internally related to the human condition and makes it his very own, so that suffering and death are not to be seen merely as situations from which we seek deliverance, but the very means by which God’s salvation comes and makes all things new. The human being is not saved ‘out’ of this life; instead, what is saved is the afflicted, fragmented, and incomplete lives that we have lived in this world. The notion of church as the People of God cannot convey this fundamental point concerning God’s utter solidarity with the human condition as persuasively as the concept of the body of Christ.</p>
<p>Furthermore, by thinking in terms of the body of Christ, we will come to appreciate more fully that, while holiness in the community of disciples derives in the first instance from the presence of the holy one in the midst of the church community, nevertheless, holiness in the second instance will grow according to the measure of our involvement, solidarity, and identification with a suffering and sinful humanity. To bear witness to the kingdom of the father as preached by the son is to acknowledge that the disciples of Jesus are situated both ‘in the fray’ (crucifixion and the embrace of pain) as well as ‘above the fray’ (resurrection and praise of God). The fact that the object of Christian faith is the risen one, who comes to us especially in the Eucharist, qualifies, however, what the mission of discipleship can achieve within history, and this qualification is taken up in the conclusion to this essay.</p>
<p>(g) In respect of Christian prayer, since suffering is part of the rhythm of human experience in this world of ours, the lament needs to become part of the rhythm of liturgical life. Prayer as the opening of oneself to the living God must come from the totality of the person, that is, from the open and wounded heart. Prayer that is truly heartfelt cannot be limited to penitential prayer, prayers for the deceased, and prayers of praise and thanksgiving, but must be broadened to include honesty about life’s ambiguities, sufferings, and torments, so that the supplicant is able to express genuine complaints to God about real-life situations in need of deliverance and transformation. By reaching out to the mystery of God from the depths of affliction, the supplicant confronts the worst aspects of human existence, and by doing so the negative forces already cease to exercise a tyranny over the supplicant. There is a sense in which the very act of addressing complaints to God in prayer is the beginning of their healing, since such an act of reaching out into the mystery of God gives hope to the supplicant. The reality of life in the historical realm does tend to overwhelm God’s servants, and the lament speech form dares to ask, Can God be trusted?<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn67-0021140012465037">67</xref></sup> Trust in God, and belief in divine goodness, is essential to viable faith, and the lament speech form puts these to a radical test. In order to function properly the lament assumes not only that the supplicant will get a sympathetic hearing, but that God, as the primary covenant partner, will respond with a new action that further develops and deepens the covenant relationship: ‘Behold, I make all things new’ (Rev 21:5).</p>
<p>The lament of Jesus on the cross demonstrates in a conclusive fashion that these assumptions, to be found in the Old Testament literature, have solid underpinnings. Hence prayers of lament are to be seen as integral to the practice of prayer in the life of the church. To follow Jesus Christ necessarily entails a readiness to be suffering servants of God (<italic>passio justi</italic>) in a world estranged from God, and to have none other than God to commend ourselves to for ultimate deliverance and transformation: holding to God against God! Faith in Jesus Christ is always tested faith in the face of suffering, persecution, and injustice. The lament speech form performs an essential task in recognizing this reality and asking God to vindicate the suffering faithful, to the praise of the holy one. The lament, while allowing the faithful to argue with God, is, nonetheless, an act of radical faith and expression of fundamental trust in God who is incomprehensible. The lament of the open heart not only gives voice to present affliction and distress, but also becomes a word of God addressed to the supplicant since all suffering is taken up into the history of Jesus Christ’s suffering, which gives hope in the present by recalling God’s past action of raising Jesus from the dead and anticipating God’s action to come. Worship that incorporates the uncomfortable dimension of lament will recognize in the cry for help, moreover, a world prayer, since the plea for help is ‘the one universal prayer emer- ging from the heart of all who suffer or who are exploited.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn68-0021140012465037">68</xref></sup></p>

<p>Central to the Old Testament lament speech form is the supplicant’s cry that God intervene in human affairs, that God undertake a new action to deliver the covenant people from a situation of affliction and distress. But in the case of Jesus’ lament on the cross, we have seen that the suffering son, who bears faithful witness to the father in love and freedom awaits no decisive act of God in his earthly life. Instead, he comes to understand that his mission as the son entails, as the climactic point of his life, that he accept the suffering of death on a cross. The response of the father does come, but it comes as an eschatological act of raising the son from the dead, in the power of the spirit. The bodily resurrection of Jesus appears as the father’s ‘new action’ of delivering the son from integral death, which he has borne vicariously for the sake of the establishment of the ‘new creation.’</p>
<p>The vindication of the suffering just ones, therefore, cannot be expected in this life; the disciples of Jesus Christ must bear faithful witness in this world to the truth of the risen one. They await in hopeful expectation their ultimate vindication and glorious salvation beyond death. The resurrection of Jesus as God’s definitive response to his lament on the cross indicates clearly that we cannot expect to see the fulfilment of the covenant promises within history, but only at the end of time, when the holy and just one will come in glory as judge and saviour of the world and finally transform this ‘groaning creation’ (Rom 8:22) into the new creation (cf. Rev 21). The fact that Christian praise of God is intimately connected to the resurrection of Jesus Christ means that the fullness of praise will be enacted only when humanity and the world share in the glorious resurrection of the crucified one. Until that time, God’s countenance remains veiled (cf. 1 Cor 2:9), and the sacrament of the Eucharist nourishes our basic trust in the goodness of God, who is not only above the fray but also in the fray. By virtue of the fact that God, in the person of Jesus Christ, has assumed the human condition in order to redeem it and elevate it to the glory of partaking in the divine life, suffering humans can find consolation in the hope that there will come the day when God ‘will wipe away every tear from their eyes, and death shall be no more, neither shall there be mourning nor crying nor pain anymore, for the former things have passed away’ (Rev 21:4).</p>

<p>The modern study of the psalms, by and large, takes place within the framework established by Hermann Gunkel, who divided the psalms into different literary genres (see Hermann Gunkel, <italic>The Psalms: A Form-Critical Introduction</italic>, trans. Thomas M. Horner [Philadelphia, PA: Fortress, 1967]). Gunkel’s student, Sigmund Mowinckel, was not satisfied with literary classification alone and sought to establish the cultic background of the Psalter (see Sigmund Mowinckel, <italic>The Psalms in Israel’s Worship</italic>, trans. Dafydd Rhys Ap-Thomas [Nashville, TN: Abingdon, 1962], 2 vols).</p>

<p>Claus Westermann has observed that a few laments can be termed ‘penitential laments’ in that they attribute human suffering to personal sin. Only Psalms 38 and 51 focus on sin, while the other laments make little or no mention of personal guilt (Claus Westermann, <italic>Praise and Lament in the Psalms</italic>, trans. Keith R. Crim and Richard N. Soulen [Atlanta, GA: John Knox, 1981], 273–74). Prayers of penitence are geared to forgiveness, contrition of heart, and submission to God’s will, while prayers for justice display an opposing attitude of protest from out of the depths of human anguish, of holding to God against God.</p>

<p>Attending to the need for spiritual understanding in times of desolation is integral to the Ignatian tradition of spirituality. Ignatius of Loyola, in his rules for the discernment of spirits, teaches that a balance must be arrived at between spiritual consolation and spiritual desolation (see Timothy M.

<p>Psalms 88 and 39, it should be noted, are exceptions to the rule that the movement of the lament psalm is from desolation to rejoicing, from humiliation to exaltation. These two psalms are hopeless prayers of unrelieved desolation and distress. Roland Murphy has suggested that a distinction be made between a ‘lamentation’ and a ‘lament’—the former expresses grief over a calamity that is not reversible, whereas the latter is an appeal to God to intervene and change a desperate situation (Roland Murphy, <italic>The Psalms, Job, Proclamation Commentaries</italic> [Philadelphia, PA: Fortress, 1977], 41).</p>

<p>In the writings of the prophets, the cup often appears as God’s wrathful judgement (see Isa 51:17, Jer 25:15–18, Ezek 23:32–34), although the symbol is variable and can also signify God’s consolations (see Jer 16:7) or the individual’s destiny (see Ps 16:5). David M. Stanley, SJ, contends that the meaning of the cup emerges from the words of eucharistic institution—the cup of the new covenant in his blood—in which case the cup symbolizes Jesus’ saving death, the dark side of which is his taking on himself God’s judgment upon sinful humanity (David M.

<p>The view of the scholastic period, where the problem was how to reconcile the beatific vision of Christ with his suffering on the cross, tended to undermine his genuine lament. Thomas Aquinas, for example, offered a solution on the basis of the two natures of Christ: the incarnate Word suffers in his body and in the ‘inferior’ part of his soul, but the ‘superior’ part of his soul, which has to do with the redemption of humanity, cannot suffer from God’s non-intervention (see STh I 47.3 and 50.2).</p>

<p>Rossé, for example, is at pains to highlight the necessity of not interpreting Jesus’ cry as a tragic cry of despair, on the one hand, or, on the other, as a cry of trust in God (Rossé, <italic>The Cry of Jesus</italic>, 101–7).</p>

<p>In the Lucan perspective, one may get the impression that Jesus appears to be consoled before he breathes his last, but his last words are taken from Psalm 31, which is a prayer of lament in which the distressed lamenter, scorned by his adversaries, asks that he be delivered from the hand of his enemies so that God’s face might shine on his servant. Luke’s account, then, should not be seen as incompatible with Mark’s and Matthew’s narrative, where Psalm 22 is used to draw attention to Jesus’ real sense of God-forsakenness on the cross.</p>

<p>This understanding is still in evidence in contemporary Judaism. It is movingly narrated, for example, by Zvi Kolitz in his story entitled <italic>Yossel Rakover’s Appeal to God</italic>, the historical background of which is the Warsaw ghetto uprising of April, 1943. In Kolitz’s story, to suffer as the people of God is at the very heart of what it means to be a Jew.

<p>The incarnation of the Logos is not to be treated in terms of two inert natures, but in terms of the one historical man, Jesus, who is wholly God in human form. The humanity of Jesus, as Karl Barth came to affirm later in his thinking, mediates or attests to his divine power and authority (see John McIntyre, <italic>The Shape of Christology</italic> [London: SCM, 1966], 157–61; Karl Barth, <italic>Church Dogmatics</italic>, vol. 4.2, <italic>The Doctrine of Reconciliation</italic>, trans. Geoffrey W. Bromiley [Edinburgh: T &amp; T Clark, 1958], 98). In this way, no dualistic modes of thought are allowed to drive a wedge between the divine and the human, and metaphysical abstractions that detract from the concrete event of Jesus Christ are avoided.</p>

<p>Frans Jozef van Beeck, for instance, develops an individuating account of the life of Jesus, whose identity emerges out of the dynamic interplay of his intentions and actions, on the one hand, and the response of his surroundings, on the other (Frans Jozef van Beeck, <italic>Christ Proclaimed: Christology as Rhetoric</italic> [New York: Paulist, 1979], 360–75). Such an account takes seriously the historical reality in which Jesus’ life and identity develop, and it amounts to a gradual or progressive incarnation. Yves Congar endorses a gradual incarnation, when he says that Jesus was ‘constituted’ Messiah at the time of his baptism and ‘made’ Lord at the time of his resurrection (Yves Congar, <italic>I Believe in the Holy Spirit</italic>, vol. 3, <italic>The River of Life Flows in the East and in the West</italic>, trans. David Smith [London: Geoffrey Chapman, 1983], 165–71). François-Xavier Durrwell also advocates a gradual incarnation, when he maintains that the work of salvation is completed in Jesus’ resurrection, where ‘God causes the fullness of divinity to live in his body (cf. Col 2:9)’ (François-Xavier Durrwell, <italic>Holy Spirit of God: An Essay in Biblical Theology</italic>, trans. Sister Benedict Davies, OSU [London: Geoffrey Chapman, 1986], 33).</p>

<p>By invoking texts such as 2 Corinthians 5:21 and Galatians 3:13, the Reformers proposed a juridical view of redemption according to which Christ suffered the punishment of hell in our place and appeased the wrath of God against the sinner. Barth and von Balthasar, while still adopting the notion of substitution, have distanced themselves from this traditional penal substitution theory, for they wish to stress that God’s love, not wrath, is the cause of the passion of Christ. The term ‘punishment’ is still used by Barth and von Balthasar, but it is used to express Jesus’ suffering endured as the ‘second death’ (see David Lauber, <italic>Barth on the Descent into Hell: God, Atonement and the Christian Life</italic> [Aldershot: Ashgate, 2004]).</p>

<p>The view that the love between the son and the Father is the exegesis of the cross is shared, for example, by the following theologians: Moltmann sees the cross as an event between the son and the Father and writes that it ‘contains community between Jesus and his Father in separation, and separation in community’ (Jürgen Moltmann, <italic>The Crucified God: The Cross of Christ as the Foundation and Criticism of Christian Theology</italic>, trans. R. A. Wilson and John Bowden [London: SCM, 1974], 252); von Balthasar places the abandonment within the eternal generation of the son from the Father and asserts that on the cross we see ‘the highest union possible in love’ between them (Hans Urs von Balthasar, <italic>Theo-Drama</italic>, vol. 5, <italic>The Last Act</italic> [San Francisco, CA: Ignatius, 1998], 263); and Rossé holds that ‘the extreme abandonment manifests the extreme communion of the Son with the Father’ (Rossé, <italic>The Cry of Jesus</italic>, 116).</p>

<p>Terence E. Fretheim has identified Old Testament texts that express how God suffers ‘because’ of Israel’s sin (cf. Ps 78:40–41; Isa 1; Jer 2), how God suffers ‘with’ the afflicted people (cf. Exod 2:23–25), and how God suffers ‘for’ the people, that is, God bears their sin (cf. Jer 44:22; Isa 1:14, 43:24; Hos 11:8–9) rather than exacting judgment (Terence E. Fretheim, <italic>The Suffering of God: An Old Testament Perspective</italic> [Philadelphia, PA: Fortress, 1984], 107–48).

<p>Von Balthasar speaks of a primal kenosis (<italic>Urkenosis</italic>) of the Father, wherein the Father eternally surrenders the divine being in the begetting of the son. This eternal event of self-emptying love in the inner life of God contains within itself all the modalities of love, including Christ’s suffering, abandonment, death on a cross, and descent into hell. Von Balthasar has been influenced by modern Russian Orthodox theology, where there has developed the idea that the divine kenosis is not confined to the incarnation which culminates in Christ’s passion, but is something eternal in the life of the triune God. Vladimir Soloviev, Sergius Bulgakov, and Vladimir Lossky are amongst the main representatives of this movement.</p>

<p>The approach that limits the suffering of Jesus to his human nature alone (the Antiochene School) is simply inadequate because it fails to do justice to the witness of the New Testament, where the person of the son is depicted as having suffered death on the cross (as stressed by Cyril of Alexandria). But the attribution of suffering to God, as von Balthasar has argued, should not be treated as a univocal attribution inasmuch as the inner-trinitarian event of self-emptying love contains and surpasses all possible happenings in the divine–human drama (Hans Urs von Balthasar, <italic>Theo-Drama: Theological Dramatic Theory</italic>, vol. 3, <italic>The Dramatis Personae: The Person in Christ</italic> [San Francisco, CA: Ignatius, 1992], 226).</p>

<p>To Barth’s mind, divine immutability consists in the fact that God continues to be what God always is from all eternity, while being subjected to change and opposition in time and history. In this manner Barth radically rethinks immutability and divine ontology by substituting dynamic time-affirming categories for the tradition’s metaphysical inertia, while seeking to remain faithful to the Chalcedonian formula of ‘one person in two natures.’</p>

<p>Von Balthasar says that the temporal sphere lies not ‘outside’ eternity but unfolds within it since the place of creation is the inner-trinitarian ‘event’ of love. Hence, there is real communication between God and the world (Von Balthasar, <italic>The Last Act</italic>, 126).</p>

<p>I have argued elsewhere that because our death is assumed into Christ’s redemptive death, then the event of our own death becomes meaningful as the privileged moment for sharing in the gracious benefits of Christ’s paschal mystery (see Henry Novello, <italic>Death as Transformation: A Contemporary Theology of Death</italic> [Farnham: Ashgate, 2011]; Henry Novello, ‘Death as Privilege,’ <italic>Gregorianum</italic> 84 [2003]: 779–827).</p>

<p>See Vladimir Lossky, <italic>The Mystical Theology of the Eastern Church</italic> (London: James Clark, 1957), 28. In his treatment of mystical theology, Pseudo-Dionysius recalls the story of Moses who plunges into the divine darkness on the top of Mount Sinai. By entering into the darkness of unknowing, Moses possesses a knowledge that exceeds his understanding (see Dionysius the Areopagite, <italic>The Divine Names</italic> and <italic>The Mystical Theology</italic>, trans. Clarence E. Rolt [London: SPCK, 1972], 191–201).</p>

<p>We read in the New Testament that Jesus ‘increased in wisdom and stature’ (Luke 2:52) and that he had no knowledge of the day of final judgment (Mark 13:32). He did not have a total knowledge that allowed him to see future events; rather, his knowledge related to being the son of the Father and to the provision for the final redemption of Israel and the world.</p>

<p>Karl Rahner, for example, argues that human self-transcendence is orientated to the reality of the incomprehensible God. The incomprehensibility of God is not simply an indication of the finiteness of human knowing; rather, the supreme act of knowledge is the final assertion of the mystery of the incomprehensible God (the goal of <italic>ratio</italic> is mystery). Thus even the beatific vision of God is spoken of by Rahner as the vision of the unfathomable mystery of God, so that theology is emphasized as mystical theology (see Karl Rahner, ‘The Concept of Mystery in Catholic Theology,’ in <italic>Theological Investigations</italic>, vol. 4, trans. Kevin Smyth [London: Darton, Longman &amp; Todd, 1966], 36–73).</p>

<p>This dimension of discipleship gives an impetus to engagement with liberation theology, which Gustavo Gutiérrez has defined as ‘a critical reflection on Christian praxis in light of the word of God’ (Gustavo Gutiérrez, <italic>A Theology of Liberation</italic> [Maryknoll, NY: Orbis, 1988], xxix). Gutiérrez acknowledges, importantly, that the praxis of liberation from social situations of oppression and marginalization is but one element of liberation in Jesus Christ: there is also liberation from sin and personal transformation.</p>

<p>The notion of the Church as the People of God, embraced by Vatican II, is capable of conveying the sense of the disciples of Jesus as the suffering faithful, who are journeying in pilgrimage towards the fullness of the kingdom of God to come, but it does not guarantee a central and sustained focus on uncovering the significance of God’s identification with the crucified one in whom the fullness of divinity dwells bodily.</p>
