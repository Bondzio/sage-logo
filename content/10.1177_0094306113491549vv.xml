<p>Lewis D. Solomon’s latest book seeks to establish the privileged role of “private enterprise” in resolving what he describes as a water and wastewater crisis in the United States. Rather conventionally, his analysis pits the public and private sectors in opposition to one another, reasoning that private enterprise will reverse public failures by investing in the development of water efficiency technologies as well as in municipal infrastructure systems. Unfortunately, there are several problems with the thesis and how it is supported. First, the analysis of the water and wastewater crisis is weak and ignores root causes. Second, in ignoring root causes, the book proposes solutions whose simplicity has been widely discounted in the literature on water supply. Indeed, even the operators of large water multinationals have questioned the ability of the private sector to resolve persistent water problems simply through the application of their business acumen. More importantly, the book misses the opportunity to advance a more complex and integrated understanding of public and private activities for water management. This goes against recent literature, which exposes the unhelpful nature of the public/private binary.</p>
<p><italic>America’s Water and Wastewater Crisis</italic> is divided into three parts, with a total of nine chapters. Part I provides an historical overview of water and wastewater systems in the United States, including the evolution of investment and government regulation. This chapter is very interesting, informative, and well documented. The problems with the book begin in Part II. There, Solomon seeks to build the argument that water scarcity is the impending water and wastewater crisis in the United States. This is done in two chapters. The first focuses on climate change and “public sector conservation efforts,” while the second tries to make the case for private enterprise as the motor of innovation in technologies for water efficiency. The analysis of the impending crisis is not convincing. Climate change and water scarcity will be of varying importance across the United States rather than a homogeneous issue requiring a one size fits all solution. Moreover, it is hard to see how private innovation on water efficiency, as opposed to broader governmental initiatives to address climate change (which may include private innovation on efficiency), will prove adequate to address the magnitude of the issue.</p>
<p>Part III seeks to make the case for private sector operation and management of water and wastewater services in five chapters. In the first of the five, Solomon surveys different types of private sector involvement in water supply. Although his book discusses “privatization,” he is really promoting the breadth of options for private sector participation (PSP). In Chapter Six, he seeks to establish the fact that municipalities are in a financial crisis, causing limited investment in water supply. The private sector is promoted as able to provide financing, increase efficiency, reduce costs, and further environmental compliance. In Chapter Seven, he surveys the literature on privatization experiences to support his arguments for PSP. He concludes in Chapter Eight with two more detailed case studies of PSP projects for water supply in the United States: Atlanta and Indianapolis.</p>
<p>Thus, while the book advances the particular crisis of water scarcity, it actually addresses two distinct crises and advances two separate types of activities for “private enterprise” to resolve. The second crisis, decaying municipal infrastructure and service capacity, is the more convincing of the two. Following policy advancement throughout the 1980s and 1990s, Solomon argues that a change in operator—from public to private—is sufficient to resolve the issue. Again, root causes in inadequate municipal revenues, taxation policy, and government transfers, are mentioned but not addressed. Instead of improving access to reliable funding for water and wastewater, cities and towns are meant to rely on the private sector to invest. Unfortunately however, data (including that gathered by the World Bank) show that with PSP projects, the private sector tends to depend on government investment, especially where investment needs are high. Thus, even though PSP may be a good option in a variety of cases, governments will still need to fix their revenue problems if the infrastructure issues are to be resolved. It is widely agreed across the once public/private divide that solutions are to be found in the strengthening of governance, whether the owner and/or operator are public or private.</p>
<p>Overall, Solomon does not add anything new to the now well-trodden debates on water and wastewater provision. Rather, by once again pitting the public and private sectors as two distinct and incompatible options with predetermined outcomes, he ignores many of the advances in the literature that put the public/private dichotomy in question. Yet, his own discussion of private sector activity evinces that the apparent public/private boundary is more fluid than dogmatic positions allow. For example, public sector financing enabled many of the instances of private innovation that he highlights. Yet, the connection between public sector support for new technologies and both their development and entry into the market is not made. Many such technologies would not see the light of day if left solely to “the market,” an issue that has been carefully studied and theorized in the social studies of technology literature.</p>
<p>In summary, Solomon is quite right to point out that many of the stark stances taken against private involvement in water and wastewater have been ideological, although based on more than a simple “disdain [of] the private sector” (p. 162). Yet, ideological positions have been widespread on both ends of the debate, which only further underscores the need for a more integrated approach that seeks locally specific solutions to widespread problems. Indeed, there has always been some level of cooperation between public and private financing, operation, and maintenance for water and wastewater services. It is this complexity that ought to be recognized and developed in ways that are sustainable over the long term for individual localities. Moreover, senior governments must do their fair share in terms of setting and enforcing standards for water quality, system maintenance, and technical capacity. One-sized, fits-all models focused on reforming the local level while remaining blind to the wider governance context are now largely accepted as inadequate, whether they promote public or private sector operators.</p>
