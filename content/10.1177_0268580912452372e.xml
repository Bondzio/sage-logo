<p>Sovereignty, citizenship and rights seem to be the new pastiche of the scholarship on states and social movements in the twenty-first century. The ritual of democracy and the technologies of rule or governmentality, as Foucault would have termed it, are hence no more to be considered as unalloyed goods through which modern nation-states operate. In fact the ascendancy of the rights-based discourse of development in such a context seems to have given a fresh lease of life to the very essence of social movements. The present work under review makes a subtle attempt to exfoliate such a symbiosis of states and social movements. Drawing heavily on the writing of Charles Tilly and Theda Skocpol, the book is structured in six thematic chapters, which critically analyse what the author terms ‘social movement societies’, within the broad contours of the institutionalization of protest in contemporary democracies. The key thrust of the book is an exploration of the ways in which the modicum of protest camouflages itself with the change in state regimes. That is to say, the author attempts to cut to the core of how social movements interact with all sorts of state systems to produce repression, insurrection or revolution.</p>
<p>The introductory chapter characterizes the relationship between states and social movements as contingent on a fourfold relation: citizenship, equality, responsiveness and protection, better described with the acronym CERP. The author argues that, analytically, ‘there are shifts on a cultural rather than a structural plane. Social movements . . . are guided not just by interests but also by definitions of justice’ (p. 30). The second chapter delineates the trajectory that various forms of protest in contemporary democracies follow by an innovative application of Doug McAdam’s ‘Political Process Theory’. The author herein contends that the political process model of social movement mobilization acknowledges that each social movement is a modular form of protest where the criteria of membership does reorient itself according to the prevailing public opinion and cultural patterns. He cites the example of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) and the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE) as the emergent modes of mobilization that the historic Civil Rights Movement in America has witnessed in recent years. Such a development however is conceptualized as ‘contentious politics’ (a term he borrows from McAdam, Tarrow and Tilly’s <italic>Dynamics of Contention</italic>, 2001) wherein, ‘the key difference [is] not [between] social movements, political parties, and/or revolutions, but rather between contained contention, that is, politics mostly within institutional structures, and transgressive contention, the substance of protest studies and revolutions’ (p. 59).</p>
<p>The author proceeds to outline in the third chapter the key facets of his ‘Social Movement Society’, an idea he develops on what Alberto Melucci had earlier termed as the ‘movementization of society’ in his classic <italic>Nomads of the Present: Social Movements and Individual Needs in Contemporary Society</italic> (1989). Such a Society has gone on to widen its gamut to include new social movements (NSMs) like that of the Greenpeace movement and the LGBT movement, wherein ‘the struggle for low-level survival needs are more easily fulfilled and higher-level needs such as identity and self-actualization are given prominence (p. 92). On the topic of repressive states in the fourth chapter, the author nuances the different degrees of oppression of protest, by explaining how varying degrees of repression often reflect strategic evaluation of the threat posed by the protest. Analysing the various models of the repression–mobilization relationship which scholars like Neidhardt and Lichbach have put forth, the author goes on to explore the relevance of what he calls ‘free spaces’. These refer to events like hit-and-run protests, graffiti, event seizures, recreational groupings, etc., which the author reckons are crucial to the way in which the proponents of any social movement bargain their position with what he cheekily terms as the moderate ‘reform elites’ and the repressive ‘bunker elites’. In the penultimate chapter, the author goes on to cite numerous examples, primarily the Latin American ones, about regime defection that explain it as a common consequence of revolutionary social movements. He argues that such sorts of movements impel a chain reaction that first infringes upon the interests of the elite and hence consequently leads to the doling out of regimes of decertification as seen in the case of media sabotage in Tiananmen Square. The last chapter, concerning the implications of globalization on social movements, is however a disappointment with no great novelties, but its empirical focus does provide a solid finality to the volume.</p>
<p>Thus in conclusion it can well be remarked that the wide coverage of statist forms – from democratic to repressive contexts – provides a convincing scaffold to the book’s basic premise, i.e. both institutionalized and non-institutionalized politics is shaped by the form of governance in vogue. The book, however, leaves us wanting for more clinical detail, in the sense that a social history of a few case-specific social movements in contemporary times in both the Global North and the Global South could have been more helpful in providing the reader with a better appreciation of the numerous hypotheses that the author attempts to play out. However, given the genre of model-oriented analysis that he chooses to adopt, it does succeed in a way to draw home the billion dollar point with which he opens up his analysis, i.e. ‘the State is an arena where conflicting interests of political elites, economic elites, state elites – the bureaucrats and civil servants that make it up – plus the additional element of popular pressure play themselves out in undetermined ways to produce configurations of state institutions’ (p. 16). This is exactly what I would prefer to term the ‘symbiotic spaces of neo-populist sovereignty’, which seem to have progressively emerged as the new lexicon of democracy that the neoliberal order has set in motion.</p>
