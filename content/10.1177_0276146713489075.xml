<p>This issue of the <italic>Journal of Macromarketing</italic> contains articles on the macromarketing implications of corporate sponsorship, the ethics of social marketing, food marketing systems, and the evolution of an important market segment. It also features reviews of two recent books, one on contemporary and one on historical events of great relevance to macromarketing. </p>

<title>Articles</title>
<p>In early September 2010, while in London attending a conference, I visited the Tate Britain for the first time. Immediately upon entering, a huge sign celebrating the museum’s BP sponsorship caught my attention. Given the loss of life and environmental destruction of the Deepwater Horizon catastrophe a few months earlier, I found this publicity annoying. As author Derrick Chong explains in our lead article, “Institutions Trust Institutions: Critiques by Artists of the BP/Tate Partnership,” I had plenty of company. At the Tate’s 2010 Summer Party, artists and artist cooperatives already had protested the dependence of this major cultural institution upon a socially irresponsible corporation and have since remained engaged in their opposition. Chong positions their artistic demonstrations and performances within the “institutional critique” and its theoretical underpinnings. In so doing, he has provided a fine exemplar of how macromarketing analysis can engage the arts. Macromarketers should be concerned. After this article was sent off to Sage Delhi for final production, BP accepted a $4.5 billion fine, the largest in American criminal history, to settle all criminal charges. BP pled guilty to 11 counts of manslaughter. Total liabilities at this writing could amount to $60 billion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0276146713489075">Macalister 2012</xref>). </p>
<p>Our second article, “A Marketing Systems View of the U.S. Housing Crisis,” is by William Redmond. It provides a fresh perspective on the topic by conceptualizing broad networks of marketing actors and by showing how they evolved and ultimately failed in reaction to environmental change. The buying and selling of homes had long consisted of three interrelated markets: 1) the primary housing market of buyers and sellers; 2) a mortgage market of local banks facilitated by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac; and 3) a facilitations market comprised of real estate agents, appraisers, and title companies. Government policy began to affect this macromarketing system when a series of presidents and Congresses, cheered on by the homebuilding and mortgage lending industries, took steps to broaden homeownership especially among lower income and minority households. More crucial were financial innovations (subprime loans, mortgage securitization, credit default swaps) in the mortgage and mortgage facilitation markets. The result was market failure accompanied by regulatory failure. Redmond does a fine job showing how these developments inform and are informed by previous macromarketing research.</p>
<p>Controlling women and their bodies has been a human passion for millennia. Religions, legal systems, social institutions, and cultural norms and values all contribute to different forms of control. In “Women’s Bodies as Sites of Control: Inadvertent Stigma and Exclusion in Social Marketing,” authors Lauren Gurrieri, Josephine Previte, and Jan Brace-Govan explore how even well-intentioned social marketers engage in this activity. Taking a critical feminist perspective and utilizing embodiment theory, their research examines three body control projects in contemporary social marketing: weight management, breastfeeding, and physical activity. What would appear to be reasonable goals on the surface become increasingly problematic under close inspection. The study makes good use applying visual culture methods to the analysis of how women are represented in social marketing and how forms of aestheticizing may foster vulnerabilities and, ultimately, lead to social exclusion. Thus, social marketing, when considered as a type of marketing system, may have unintended consequences for target audiences, effects that raise large ethical questions. </p>
<p>Drawing on 80 different product cases from 36 countries, Paul F. Skilton and Zhaohui Wu’s article, “Governance Regimes for Protected Geographic Indicators: Impacts on Food Marketing Systems,” addresses the core macromarketing interest of how society affects marketing systems. A Protected Geographic Indicator (PGI) is a type of communally held intellectual property rooted in place of origin names, favoring traditional and craft processes, and recognized by nations and in international law. PGIs share some attributes with trademarks and labels, but also differ in significant ways. PGI systems ostensibly help local producers and rural populations, while supporting biodiversity and sustainable production. After an excellent overview of the topic, the authors develop a series of propositions that constitute a new theory of PGI marketing systems. The strength of communal control and the level of heterogeneity in producer interests and capabilities define PGI governance regimes. These are ideas are nicely illustrated by examples from the cases. The analysis concludes with suggestions for improving the effectiveness of PGI systems through the proper levels of governance. </p>
<p>Our final article combines historical and experimental research to examine changing interrelationships among consumers, marketing, and society. In “Self-Oriented Masculinity: Advertisements and the Changing Culture of the Male Market,” authors Blaine J. Branchik and Tilottama Ghosh Chowdhury apply content analysis to over 1000 ads from 51 years of <italic>Sports Illustrated</italic> magazine and also conduct an online experiment where 96 American men of varying ages responded to ads with white and black male models and self-focused and other-focused text. They find that the incidence of self-focused values in ads has increased over time, whereas the frequency of other-focused themes in ads has declined. From the experimental evidence we learn that today, younger males (18–44) have more positive attitudes toward self-focused advertising irrespective of model race, whereas those 45 and older only prefer self-focused ads that feature white models. Based on their findings, the authors discuss whether advertising reflects society as an indicator of changing cultural norms and whether advertisers get ahead of their markets and actively promote social change.</p>

<title>Book and Media Reviews</title>
<p>This issue features two book reviews. Contributing a timely companion piece for our lead article, Robin Canniford discusses <italic>Greenwash: Big Brands and Carbon Scams</italic> by Guy Pearse (Melbourne: Black, Inc., 2012). Then, Terrence H. Witkowski examines <italic>Advertising at War: Business, Consumers, and Government in the 1940s</italic> by Inger L. Stole (Urbana: University of Illinois Press, 2012).</p>
<p>The Journal is committed to maintaining a strong book and media review section that advances the field of macromarketing. Suggestions for book reviews, or inquiries about what the book review editor may have available, should be sent to Marilyn Liebrenz-Himes (<email>liebrenz@gwu.edu</email>). We will also consider reviews of documentary films relevant to macromarketing and its core interests. Preference will be given to reviews that span two or more books or documentaries and stress macromarketing implications.</p>
