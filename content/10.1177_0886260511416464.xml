<abstract>
<p>The authors test the hypothesis that separation from a violent husband or partner improves maternal parenting in Japan and examine how childhood abuse history (CAH), experience of domestic violence (DV), mental health problems, husband or partner’s child maltreatment, and other demographic factors affect maternal parenting after such separation. A self-administered questionnaire survey is conducted for mothers (<italic>n</italic> = 304) and their children (<italic>n</italic> = 498) staying in 83 mother-child homes in Japan to assess the mothers’ CAH, DV experiences, current mental health problems, and exposure to a husband or partner’s child maltreatment. The authors also assess maternal poor parenting (physical and psychological abuse, neglect, no playing, and no praise) before and after admission into the mother-child homes. The total poor parenting score (specifically for neglect, no playing, and no praise) significantly reduces after separation from a violent husband or partner (<italic>p</italic> = .001, paired <italic>t</italic> test). However, scores for psychological abuse significantly increase after admission (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, paired <italic>t</italic> test). CAH, DV, and mental health problems are not associated with a reduced total poor parenting score after admission. Husband or partner’s child maltreatment is independently significantly associated with a reduced maternal poor parenting score: A 10% increase in such maltreatment is associated with a 5% reduction in the poor parenting score after separation. Marital status also contributes to the score reduction: The reduction is less in married or divorced mothers than in those who did not marry the partner. Mother-child homes might be useful for improving maternal parenting. Further study is needed to elucidate the mechanism of the impact of separation from a violent husband or partner on maternal parenting.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Child maltreatment is more likely found in the presence of domestic violence (DV) between parents. Previous studies have reported that a mother who is abused by a husband or partner often abuses the child (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0886260511416464">Browne &amp; Hamilton, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0886260511416464">Dixon, Browne, &amp; Hamilton-Giachritsis, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0886260511416464">McGuigan &amp; Pratt, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0886260511416464">Moffitt &amp; Caspi, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0886260511416464">Tajima, 2000</xref>). On the other hand, a husband or partner who abuses his wife is more likely to also maltreat the child, and the husband or partner’s child maltreatment might lead to poor parenting by the mother. Previous studies have shown that mothers are more likely to abuse a child if fathers do not provide sufficient care for the child (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0886260511416464">Guterman, Lee, Lee, Waldfogel, &amp; Rathouz, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Thus, it is reasonable to hypothesize that separating from a violent husband or partner can improve maternal parenting. Few studies have investigated how separation from a violent husband affects the quality of parenting by the mother (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0886260511416464">Jarvis &amp; Novaco, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0886260511416464">Wathen &amp; MacMillan, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Separation from a violent husband or partner is considered to be one way to break the cycle of violence. We believe there may be other factors associated with a improvement in maternal parenting after separation. Childhood abuse history (CAH), which is associated with both having a violent husband or partner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0886260511416464">Fantuzzo, Boruch, Beriama, Atkins, &amp; Marcus, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0886260511416464">Ross, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0886260511416464">Tajima, 2000</xref>) and child maltreatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0886260511416464">Ertem, Leventhal, &amp; Dobbs, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0886260511416464">Steele &amp; Pollack, 1968</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0886260511416464">Widom, 1989</xref>) might be one such factor. In addition, mental health problems might be associated with the improvement of maternal parenting; mental health problems have previously been described as the pathway between DV and poor parenting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0886260511416464">Dixon et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0886260511416464">Egeland &amp; Susman-Stillman, 1996</xref>). Thus, separation from a violent husband might lead to some relief of mental health problems and an improvement in parenting.</p>
<p>In Japan, there are mother-child homes for victims of DV and other mothers who want to separate from a husband or partner who abuses their children; the women and children are provided with shelter, and some are given support for mental health problems. By using this setting to conduct our study, we can assess the impact of CAH and DV on parenting and determine whether the effects of CAH and DV persist even after the mother has separated from the violent husband or partner.</p>
<p>Therefore, the purpose of this study was to test the following two hypotheses:</p>

<list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 1:</italic> Separation from a violent husband or partner improves maternal parenting</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 2:</italic> CAH, experience of DV, mental health problems, a husband or partner’s child maltreatment, and other demographic factors are associated with the change of maternal parenting after separation from a violent husband or partner among mothers in Japan.</p></list-item>

<sec id="section3-0886260511416464">
<title>Sample</title>
<p>Details of this study procedure have been previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0886260511416464">Fujiwara, Okuyama, Izumi, &amp; Osada, 2010</xref>). This study was conducted by means of questionnaires distributed to clients of the 83 mother-child homes in Japan, which are welfare facilities. Mothers and children experiencing family problems (e.g., DV, child maltreatment by the husband or partner, a single mother with financial problems) can stay and receive assistance to become self-supporting. The directors of mother-child home explained the purpose of the questionnaires to the participants and informed them of the risks (i.e., the psychological distress while responding). It was also communicated that mothers who did not want to join the study need not respond to the questionnaires. Questionnaires were sent to a sample of 421 mothers who agreed to participate in this study. A total of 340 mothers completed the survey (80.1%). Mothers were asked to fill out a separate questionnaire that measures maltreatment by father or partner and parenting by mother for each of their children (i.e., if a mother had two children, the mother completed two questionnaires). In total, 665 child questionnaires were collected. The child questionnaire completed by the mother was labeled with a maternal ID to allow for further analysis along with the mother’s questionnaire. To maintain anonymity, respondents were instructed to work on the survey, which required no formal consent, alone; thus, no support was provided in the completion of the survey.</p>

<title>Measurements</title>
<sec id="section5-0886260511416464">
<title>Childhood abuse history (CAH)</title>
<p>CAH of mother was assessed by using the following seven statements: (1) I was a victim of violence from my parents (including stepparents), (2) I was ignored or refused attention by my parents, (3) My parents insulted me verbally, (4) I experienced violence from my parents severe enough to require hospital treatment, (5) I have been deprived of food or warm clothes, (6) I have experienced forced sexual contact by a parent (sexual contact includes sexual intercourse, petting, exposure of genitals, and taking naked pictures), and (7) I have experienced forced sexual contact by an adult other than a parent. Each statement was ranked on a 1 to 4 Likert-type scale with the following responses: 1 = <italic>not at all</italic>, 2 = <italic>rarely</italic>, 3 = <italic>sometimes</italic>, and 4 = <italic>frequently</italic>. These statements were created based on the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0886260511416464">Bernstein et al., 1994</xref>) but were modified to suit the Japanese language and minimized to seven statements to reduce the burden on the respondents. The total history of childhood abuse was calculated by the summation of the responses to these seven statements. Cronbach’s alpha for this scale is .78.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0886260511416464">
<title>Experience of DV</title>
<p>Experience of DV was assessed by using the following four statements: (1) My husband or partner was sufficiently violent toward me to cause injury, (2) My husband or partner insulted me strongly enough to cause psychological harm, (3) I perceived a strong threat from my husband or partner, and (4) My husband or partner forced me to have sexual contact. Each statement was ranked on a 4-point Likert-type scale (1 = <italic>not at all</italic>, 2 = <italic>rarely</italic>, 3 = <italic>sometimes</italic>, 4 = <italic>frequently</italic>). These statements were created based on the Index of Spouse Abuse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0886260511416464">Hudson &amp; McIntosh, 1981</xref>) but modified to suit the Japanese language; they were reduced to four statements to reduce the burden on the respondents. Summation of the responses to these statements was used as a scale to indicate the respondent’s experience of DV. Cronbach’s alpha for this scale is .86.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0886260511416464">
<title>Mental health problems of the mother</title>
<p>The mothers’ mental health problems were classified as dissociated, depressive, or traumatic. Questions used for this assessment were created based on the <italic>DSM-IV</italic> and have been described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0886260511416464">Fujiwara et al., 2010</xref>). Symptoms of dissociation when mothers take care of their children were assessed by means of a summation of responses to 10 questions (e.g., “Do you have any of the following experiences these days?” “I find myself hitting or pinching my child when scolding him/her. I can’t exactly remember the flow of events as to why or when I did it.”) answered using a 4-point Likert-type scale (1 = <italic>not at all</italic>, 2 = <italic>rarely</italic>, 3 = <italic>sometimes</italic>, 4 = <italic>frequently</italic>). Similarly, depressive and traumatic symptoms were assessed by means of 11 and 8 questions, respectively, answered using a 4-point Likert-type scale. For example, a question on depressive symptoms was, “Did you experience any of the following in the past week?” “I wake up suddenly in the middle of sleep,” and a question on traumatic symptoms was, “Did you experience any of the following in the past week?” “My body reacts when I remember a past bad experience, and I break into a sweat, experience difficulty breathing, or feel nauseous.” Cronbach’s alpha values for assessment of dissociated, depressive, and traumatic symptoms are .82, .88, and .85, respectively. In this study, a sum of the scores for these symptoms was used for analysis.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0886260511416464">
<title>Maltreatment of the child by the husband or partner</title>
<p>The husband or partner’s child maltreatment while living with the mother and child was assessed from maternal responses to the following eight statements: (1) The husband or partner committed violence toward the child, (2) The husband or partner committed violence toward the child severe enough to cause injury, (3) The husband or partner prohibited providing food for the child, (4) The husband or partner spoke harmful words to the child, (5) The husband or partner ignored the child and failed to provide discipline or affection, (6) The husband or partner let the child physically assault the mother, (7) The husband or partner intentionally beat the mother in front of the child, and (8) The husband or partner committed sexual abuse of the child. Each statement of maltreatment was assessed with a 4-point Likert-type scale (1 = <italic>not at all</italic>, 2 = <italic>rarely</italic>, 3 = <italic>sometimes</italic>, 4 = <italic>frequently</italic>), and the sum of these eight items was used as the husband or partner’s child maltreatment score. These statements were developed based on the Parent-Child Conflict Tactics Scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0886260511416464">Straus, Hamby, Finkelhor, Moore, &amp; Runyan, 1998</xref>) but were modified to include only eight statements to reduce the burden on the respondents. Internal consistency of the current assessment of a husband or partner’s child maltreatment was acceptable (Cronbach’s alpha = .81).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0886260511416464">
<title>Quality of parenting by the mother</title>
<p>To assess the quality of the mother’s parenting skills during the time the mother lived with the husband or partner (i.e., before separating from the husband or partner) and in the current living environment (i.e., after separating from the husband or partner and moving into the mother-child homes), five statements were used: (1) I beat or hit the child (physical abuse), (2) I speak words to harm the child (psychological abuse), (3) I do not provide necessary food or clothes (neglect), (4) I play or enjoy talking with the child (reverse coded, no playing), and (5) I praise the child (reverse coded, no praise). Each experience was assessed by using a 4-point Likert-type scale (1 = <italic>not at all</italic>, 2 = <italic>rarely</italic>, 3 = <italic>sometimes</italic>, 4 = <italic>frequently</italic>). These statements were developed based on a Japanese version of Maltreatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0886260511416464">Center for Child Abuse Prevention, 1999</xref>), which originally comprised 17 items, and on the Home Observation for Measurement of the Environment Scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0886260511416464">Caldwell &amp; Bradley, 1984</xref>), but was reduced to 5 statements in order to reduce the burden on the respondents. The sum of these five items was used as the mother’s total score for “poor” parenting. Internal consistency of the current assessment of mother’s poor parenting was acceptable (Cronbach’s alpha of mother’s total score of poor parenting before and after separation from husband or partner was .66 and .59, respectively).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0886260511416464">
<title>Other risk factors</title>
<p>Potential risk factors were assessed in the questionnaire. For the mother, the following factors were assessed: age, current marital status, current working status, length of stay in the facility, and professional support (i.e., medical or legal support, including psychological therapy). For children, age, sex, birth order, whether they were the mother’s biological child, medical treatment, and other welfare/educational support were assessed. Details of the items used to assess these covariates are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0886260511416464">Table 1</xref>.</p>

<title>Institutional Review Board Approval</title>
<p>The Institutional Review Board at the National Center for Child Health and Development approved this study. Because the directors of the mother-child home had explained the risks associated with the questionnaire, the return of the completed survey was considered the respondents’ consent to participate in the study.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0886260511416464">
<title>Analysis</title>
<p>Because CAH, DV, mental health problems, and poor parenting before and after separating from a violent husband or partner were major explanatory and outcome variables, respondents who completed these variables were included for further analysis (<italic>n</italic> = 304 for mothers, <italic>n</italic> = 498 for children). To aid in the interpretation of the regression coefficient, CAH, DV, mental health problems, husband’s or partner’s child maltreatment scores, and maternal poor parenting scores were converted to a range of 0 to 10.</p>
<p>First, the mother’s total score of poor parenting, in addition to each item of parenting, before and after separation from a violent husband or partner was compared by paired <italic>t</italic> test. Second, the difference in the mother’s poor parenting score (the score before separation minus the score after separation) was regressed by the possible risk factors using generalized estimating equation model that adjusts for the clustering of outcomes within siblings. All analyses were performed with STATA SE version 10.</p>

For the mothers, mean age was 35.8 years (<italic>SD</italic> = 7.1), with a range of 19 to 56 years. The majority of the mothers in the sample (72.7%) had divorced their husbands. Most were staying in the mother-child homes because of DV or child maltreatment by the husband or partner. The mean duration of stay in the mother-child homes was 2.39 years (<italic>SD</italic> = 2.49), with a maximum of 18 years. Professional support, including psychiatric or psychological therapy, support by a public health nurse, or legal consultation, was provided to 35.5% of the mothers included in the study. Mean age of the children was 7.8 years (<italic>SD</italic> = 4.5); ages ranged from 1 month (infant) to 20 years (adolescent). Some children (14.7%) received medical treatment for their chronic physical or mental problems. In addition, 18.5% of children received welfare or educational support to address developmental or mental disabilities.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0886260511416464">Table 2</xref> shows a comparison of scores for the mother’s poor parenting before and after separation from a violent husband or partner. The total score for mother’s poor parenting after separation was significantly lower than that before separation (1.59 vs. 1.85, <italic>p</italic> = .001). Scores for neglect, no playing, and no praise were also significantly lower after separation as compared with before separation. However, no change was seen in physical abuse. The scores for psychological abuse of the child by the mother were significantly higher after separation from a violent husband than before separation (2.32 vs. 1.91, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001).</p>

<p>The effects of violence-related factors and other demographic factors on the reduction in maternal poor parenting before and after separation from a violent husband or partner are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0886260511416464">Table 3</xref>. Because the difference in mother’s poor parenting was calculated by subtracting scores for the period after separation from the scores for the period before separation, a positive value can be interpreted as a reduction in poor parenting. Among violence-related factors, husband or partner’s child maltreatment was positively significantly associated with a reduction in mother’s total score for parenting (more specifically, physical and psychological abuse) after separation from the violent husband or partner; that is, a 5% reduction in the total score for mother’s poor parenting after separation from the violent husband or partner can be expected if the child was 10% more likely maltreated by the husband or partner. CAH, DV, and mental health problems were not associated with a reduction in mother’s poor parenting. In terms of demographic factors, marital status did have an effect: Mothers who did not marry before moving into the mother-child homes showed a greater reduction in the total score for mother’s poor parenting (specifically, no playing and no praise) after separation from a partner as compared with mothers who were still married or even divorced after moving into the mother-child homes. Interestingly, length of stay in the mother-child home was significantly associated with the increase in psychological abuse.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study revealed that mother’s poor parenting (specifically, neglect, no playing, and no praise) was significantly improved after separation from a violent husband or partner. An improvement in maternal parenting was found after separation in cases of husband or partner child maltreatment. CAH, DV, and mental health problems were not associated with a reduction in the total score for poor parenting after the mother’s move to mother-child homes. Marital status also affected the improvement in maternal poor parenting: Still married or divorced mothers showed less improvement than those who did not marry.</p>
<p>To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to show an improvement in mother’s parenting after separating from a violent husband or partner and living in the mother-child homes. A number of previous studies have investigated the impact of DV shelters in preventing the occurrence or reoccurrence of abuse of women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0886260511416464">Berk, Newton, &amp; Berk, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0886260511416464">Sullivan &amp; Bybee, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0886260511416464">Sullivan, Campbell, Angelique, Eby, &amp; Davidson, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0886260511416464">Sullivan &amp; Davidson, 1991</xref>); no difference was reported between shelter users and those not in shelters, but those who received a specific program of advocacy and counseling services reported a decreased rate of recurrence of abuse. However, few studies have been published that investigate the impact of the DV shelter in the prevention of child abuse by battered women. In the current study, we found that separation from a violent husband or partner helped improve the mother’s poor parenting, a finding that suggests that battered mothers might follow the violent husband or partner’s parenting style (i.e., maltreatment). It is possible that a paternalistic framework exists in a family with a violent husband or partner who encourages the mother to maltreat the child in a manner similar to that of the husband or partner. Because the experience of DV was not associated with an improvement in maternal poor parenting, we do not believe the mother’s child maltreatment is in reaction to the DV by the husband or partner. Further study is needed to elucidate the mechanism of how separation from a violent husband or partner improves the mother’s poor parenting.</p>
<p>CAH was not associated with a reduction in the mother’s child maltreatment (<italic>p</italic> &gt; .6, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0886260511416464">Table 3</xref>). This finding suggests that separation from the violent husband could not help break the cycle of intergenerational continuity of child maltreatment. The mediator of intergenerational continuity of child maltreatment is considered to be mental health problems in the parent, such as dissociation or depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0886260511416464">Dixon et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0886260511416464">Egeland &amp; Susman-Stillman, 1996</xref>). Although professional support, including mental care for mothers, was provided in the mother-child homes, it might not have been enough to remedy the mental health problems, as professional support for mothers was not associated with a reduction in child maltreatment (<italic>p</italic> &gt; .5, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0886260511416464">Table 3</xref>).</p>
<p>The impact of separation from a violent partner was larger than the impact of separation from a husband in terms of improvements in maternal parenting, especially in regard to play and praise; that is, mothers who did not marry but were living together with the violent partner showed a greater increase in playing and praise of the child after separation from the violent partner as compared with those who were married. For mothers who divorced the husband, the significant reduction in poor parenting was not observed. This finding suggests that mothers who did not marry the violent partner may have been less influenced by the partner and had a more flexible parenting style after separation.</p>
<p>It was interesting to note that psychological abuse by the mother increased after separation from a violent husband or partner, despite an improvement in poor parenting. The result that the length of stay was significantly associated with the increase in psychological abuse (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0886260511416464">Table 3</xref>) suggests several possible pathways. For example, living in a mother-child home might produce other types of stress among mothers, such as stress arising from living with other families or staff, which might be directed at their children in the form of psychological abuse. Furthermore, a longer stay at mother-child home might deteriorate the children’s mental development, which induces psychological abuse by mothers. Alternatively, economic deficits induced by the separation from the husband might accelerate the physical and psychological abuse. Considering that poor parenting improved and that child abuse did not, mother-child home may enhance positive parenting (e.g., playing with and praising the child) through interactions with other residents or staff working at mother-child home, but living in mother-child home may induce different burdens, such as interpersonal stress, mental developmental delay in children, and long periods of economic deficits. Further research is needed to examine the reasons why living in the mother-child home improved only poor parenting but not child abuse.</p>
<p>Several limitations of this study need to be acknowledged. First, as CAH, DV, and maternal parenting before separation from the husband or partner were assessed retrospectively and were self-reported, and the measurement of these experiences might have recall bias, especially with respect to earlier maternal parenting, due to the relatively long duration of living in a mother-child home (mean = 2.39 years). However, mothers might be able to remember their past parenting behavior on the basis of comparison with current parenting (e.g., if the mother felt that she had not changed, she would indicate the same parenting score, and if the mother felt that her parenting had improved, she would indicate a worse parenting score for the earlier parenting question). Furthermore, these variables might be affected by mental health problems (i.e., a mother with CAH might not be able to remember her CAH due to dissociation while responding). Second, mental health problems were not assessed at the time the mother and child were living with the violent husband or partner. We assumed that mental health problems due to CAH or DV would be similar to any symptoms present at the time of the survey (i.e., after separation from the violent husband or partner and while living in the mother-child homes), as mental health problems due to CAH or DV do not quickly diminish. However, because some mothers received professional support that may have effectively treated their mental health problems, they may have underestimated their symptoms at the time of living with the violent husband. Nonetheless, a strong and significant impact of mental health problems on poor parenting at the time of living with a violent husband or partner was observed; this finding suggests that a stronger impact may be found if we could assess mental health problems at the actual time the mother was living with the violent husband or partner. In addition, the questionnaire on mental health problems was self-administered; it was not assessed in person or by telephone interview.</p>
<p>Third, a standard scale, such as Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0886260511416464">Bernstein et al., 1994</xref>), Index of Spouse Abuse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0886260511416464">Hudson &amp; McIntosh, 1981</xref>), or Parent-Child Conflict Tactics Scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0886260511416464">Straus et al., 1998</xref>), was not used to assess CAH, DV, child maltreatment, or poor parenting, though these scales were referenced for development of measurements. It is extremely difficult to use lengthy standard scales to inquire about CAH and DV for battered women, especially in Japan. Our survey on CAH and DV was constructed with a minimal number of questions; thus, further research is warranted to show the validity and reliability of the scale used in this study. Fourth, for parenting measurement, social desirability factors might have pushed the women to describe their current parenting favorably. Alternatively, woman who wished to positively evaluate the mother-child homes might have overemphasized the problems in earlier parenting. The influence of these social factors on responses to the questionnaire might have led to overestimation of the impact of mother-child homes. Fifth, the study sample was a convenient one, with weighted mothers who have lived with a violent husband or partner. Thus, it is hard to generalize the results, even to mother-child homes, due to sampling bias. Future research that involves the general population is needed to confirm findings of intergenerational continuity of child maltreatment.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, the findings of this study suggested that separation from a violent husband or partner might have an impact on improvement of mother’s parenting, probably through discontinued exposure to the husband or partner’s child maltreatment. Thus, provision of mother-child homes might be useful not only in protecting the battered mother but also in protecting the child from maltreatment by both the husband or partner and the mother. However, several caveats of the impact of mother-child homes on child maltreatment should be noted: Professional support in mother-child homes may not be enough to treat the effects of CAH or mental health problems of mothers.</p>
<p>In conclusion, mother-child homes might be a useful welfare facility that helps to improve maternal parenting. Further study is needed to elucidate the mechanism of the impact of separation from a violent husband or partner on maternal parenting.</p>
