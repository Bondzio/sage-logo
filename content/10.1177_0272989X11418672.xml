<abstract>
<p>Using a 2009 American debate on a federal public health recommendation on mammography screening for women under the age of 50 as a case study, it is argued that public acceptance of health technology assessment (HTA) depends on the ethical acceptability of its recommendations. At the same time, that acceptability cannot be separated from the politics and values of the health care system of which it is part. In the United States, those values display a sharp ideological split between a conservative individual-based ethic and a liberal community-oriented ethic. A clash of this kind cannot be solved by invocation of ethical principles when it is those principles themselves that are in conflict. Inevitably HTA acceptance is threatened by this conflict as is the fate of health care reform.</p>

<body>
<p>The ethical considerations and problems of health technology assessment (HTA) can roughly be put in 2 categories, one of which can be called interior and the other exterior. By “interior,” I mean that part of HTA that focuses on the methodologies used by HTA to collect and assess data, which have been called the methodological standards. I will not comment on those issues, important though they are. Instead, I will be concerned with what I call the “exterior” ethical issues, by which I mean those that arise in the move from data collection and the judgment of the researchers to their dissemination and use in the medical community and, beyond that, to the public as well.</p>
<p>Aristotle contended that ethics is a branch of politics. I want to contend that the professional and public acceptance of HTA depends upon the ethical acceptability of its recommendations. But its acceptability in that respect cannot be separated from the politics and values of the health care system of which it is a part.</p>
<p>As I will try to show, the debate about, and often resistance to, HTA in the United States rests on a number of ethical values and principles. At bottom, that debate, which can look like nothing more than politics—understood narrowly as a clash of interest groups vying for dominance—is an ethical debate and one that has to be resolved at that level. I will use the major 2009 American debate on mammography screening for breast cancer as a starting point to make clear the intertwining of ethics and politics. I will then move on to an examination of HTA more broadly, aiming to understand the likely political difficulties it will encounter in the future as the combination of aging societies and more expensive medical technologies lead it into ever more troubled waters. My focus will be on the United States, not simply because I know its health care system best but because the politics of HTA has been particularly vexed, offering a cautionary tale for other countries so far blessed with more coherent health care systems.</p>

<title>The Research Recommendation and its Criticisms</title>
<p>In 2009, The US Preventive Services Task Force (PSTF) recommended that mammography for women under the age of 50 years should not be routinely prescribed and that, for women between that age and 74 years, screening was best done only every 2 years.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0272989X11418672">1</xref></sup> For women under the age of 50 years, individual decisions should be made based on the patient’s history and values. Not only is there a reduced risk of breast cancer for women under 50 years, the task force held, but there can also be psychological problems, false-positive findings, and the harms of unnecessary treatment and radiation exposure. At no point do the recommendations mention costs as a consideration.</p>
<p>The recommendations were promptly, publicly, and widely attacked by various medical interest groups (The American Cancer Society, The American College of Radiology, and the National Cancer Institute), by breast cancer survivors, and by patient advocacy groups. They were said to be excessive, a serious threat to the lives of women under 50 years. The criticisms were quickly taken up and amplified by politically conservative groups as a dangerous incursion of government into the doctor-patient relationship and as an opening salvo in rationing care. The fact that the recommendations took place in the midst of the American health reform debate, part of which encompassed HTA, served to amplify the furor. Nonetheless, despite some gestures in that direction, there were no serious criticisms of the research methodology, and the PSTF has a solid reputation for the quality of its research. Even so, the attack evoked a defensive response from the Obama administration, with Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Resources Kathleen Sibelius, emphasizing that in the end screening decisions should be left up to doctors and their patients, effectively marginalizing the PSTF recommendations.</p>

<sec id="section2-0272989X11418672">
<title>Historical Resistance to HTA</title>
<p>HTA has had a troubled history in the United States, of which the mammography struggle is just a recent instance. But it has also had a peculiar kind of history. HTA, and even cost-benefit studies, together with practice guidelines based on them, have been numerous over the years within some federal agencies, medical specialty groups, and private industry. The state of Washington, for instance, quietly runs an HTA program, encompassing evidence of treatment effectiveness, safety, and comparative effectiveness research (CER).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0272989X11418672">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>When HTA is raised to the federal level, however, that is a disconcertingly different story. The US Medicare program for the elderly has been forbidden since its initiation in 1965 from using cost-benefit research (CBR) to make benefit decisions. “Reasonable and necessary,” an inherently vague concept, is the only acceptable standard. Decades of complaints by Medicare administrators about this policy have had no effect. A Center for Health Care Technology was established in 1978 and then summarily killed in 1981 because of complaints by the American Medical Association and the Health Industry Manufacturers Association.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0272989X11418672">3</xref></sup> A productive Office of Technology Assessment (but only in part focused on medical technologies), established in 1972 by Congress, lost its funding in 1995. The work of the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research, established in 1985, and responsible for HTA, had its mission seriously curtailed in great part because of complaints by back surgeons about an agency decision in favor of a nonsurgical approach.</p>
<p>That history of resistance, and often hostility, to HTA was prominently on display in the health care reform debate. In its run up to the final legislation, the Obama administration included in a package of measures designed to deal with the financial recession $1.1 billion for CER. That money was then folded into the reform legislation but with the firm stipulation that the research findings could not be used to establish practice guidelines or even to make recommendations. The hand of industry was heavy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0272989X11418672">4</xref></sup> While CER can be valuable, that prohibition effectively neutered it as a direct means of cost control, one of the principal aims of the reform bill. Along the way to the reform bill, moreover, the dread word “rationing” was rhetorically treated as the logical outcome of HTA, with even CER as some of the grease on the slippery slope, and all the worse because faceless government bureaucrats would do the dirty work. The dread specter of an American National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) agency wielding quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) was advanced as the means of rationing. Even so, hardly anyone denied that CER could be of some value; it just has to be kept on a tight leash.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0272989X11418672">
<title>Ethics and Politics</title>
<p>At first glance, the troubled history of HTA can appear to be nothing other than a display of the political power of the various interest groups long dominant in American medicine and health care: the medical profession, various industry groups, and conservative antigovernment political forces. But what is striking about their politics is that its arguments and rhetoric invoke ethical principles as their foundation. Industry resistance to HTA stems from a long-standing fear of government price controls and invokes market freedom as its ethical principle (a freedom necessary for democratic freedom). The resistance of some physician groups is based on the ancient belief that the highest goal of medicine is individual health. They believe that ethical goal will be lost with the probabilistic studies endemic to CER, focused on group data and not on individual patients in all their variety (“every patient is different”). The closely related ethical value of the doctor-patient relationship, traditionally referred to by the American Medical Association as the “sacred doctor-patient relationship,” is seen as a high wall to keep out the government from bureaucratically interfering with it.</p>
<p>The comparative effectiveness work of the reform legislation centers on the creation of a public-private initiative called the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute. It will have a board of directors of 21 persons, drawn from a mix of representatives of special interests and of 2 government health agencies. The fight over this institute was almost epic in its complexity and ferocity. As John Iglehart, an astute observer of the health care scene and the founding editor of <italic>Health Affairs</italic>, wrote, the survival of the institute concept “illustrates how Congress’s majority ultimately prevailed over Republican rhetoric about a ‘government takeover’ and rationing of health care. On another level, it’s a story of how the Democrats succeeded only after making a series of accommodations with private interests.”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0272989X11418672">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>At bottom, the political struggle about CER comes down to an ethical clash of market-oriented individualist values, with the ethical value of freedom at its core, and a common good/solidarity set of ethical values. Unless I am mistaken about HTA in other developed countries, my impression is that the European health care’s ethical foundation in the value of solidarity has made it easier to introduce both CER and CBR. America’s congenital individualism, as well as the active role played by physicians, industry groups, and patient advocacy groups, has made it much harder in the United States.</p>
<p>Yet, if the much-noted American “exceptionalism” is on display in the CER debate, why do I call it a cautionary tale for other countries, so far blessed with a greater willingness to embrace HTA? First of all, I believe the growing problem of cost escalation in every developed country, intensified as the proportion of elderly continues to grow and the dependency ratio of workers to retirees worsens, will put more and more pressure on health care systems to drastically control costs.</p>
<p>Second, the steady stream of new and improved medical technologies will intensify the cost problem. As the American Congressional Budget Office noted in a 2008 report, “examples of new treatments for which long-term savings have been clearly demonstrated are few . . . improvement in medical care that decreases mortality . . . paradoxically increase overall spending on health care because surviving patients live longer and therefore use health services for more years.”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0272989X11418672">6</xref></sup> Most recent medical progress has served up not cures of chronic disease but the ability to keep those with such diseases alive longer and more expensively.</p>
<p>Third, while there are already complaints and problems with expensive pharmaceuticals for the treatment of cancer—$50,000 to $100,000 for some with only a small increase in life expectancy—it is reasonable to anticipate that sooner or later, some drugs will come along for some major cancer (e.g., breast cancer) that for a similarly high price will increase life expectancies for years and not just months. Think of it as the economic doomsday drug. Every woman with the disease would clamor for it, and no agency, public or private, would want to provide it. At a somewhat lower level of economic horror, the much touted advent of personalized genetic medicine has been hailed as a major new medical frontier, but there is every expectation that it will be expensive.</p>
<p>In short, I would expect that at present, and even with the use of QALYs, very few technologies and treatments will fall into the category of intolerable costs for minimum benefits, much less intolerable costs for even larger benefits. NICE issues negative judgments on only somewhere between 10% to 13% of the technologies submitted for review.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0272989X11418672">7</xref></sup> That situation is likely to change as the technologies get more effective and, with a growing elderly population, there are proportionately more people on whom to use them. HTA decisions against treatments will, correspondingly, get to be more common, more difficult, and more controversial. Then other countries, relatively quiescent so far, will run the risk, even the likelihood, of a revolt by physicians, industry, and the public.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0272989X11418672">
<title>Responding to the Ethical and Political Problems</title>
<p>It is not clear to what extent the PSTF anticipated the hostility of the many groups that spoke out against its recommendations, much less the way those critics made their criticisms public by immediately going to the media. It was not a quiet debate among researchers over differences to be resolved politely in professional journals. The critics made sure of that.</p>
<p>What lessons can be learned from that event, which has some parallels in reactions to NICE decisions in the United Kingdom? I think of that problem in terms of a kind of preventive medicine. The obvious starting point is that the science behind the research, at what I earlier called the “interior” category, must be solid and in particular untainted by outside interested parties, whether government officials, industry concerns, and patient groups. The research process, that is, must be as transparent as possible.</p>
<p>So far as possible, the major stakeholders in the research outcomes and recommendations should have a role as commentators at the beginning, the middle, and the end of the research process. But does that suggestion not contradict my first recommendation of keeping the research process untainted by interested parties? Not if it is done carefully. Their opinions and ideas should be welcomed and their interests put on the table, while at the same time, making clear that the researchers must be ruled in the end by the ethic of scientific research, which has its own professional rules. If that exchange is done well, and in a collegial way, it should be possible to anticipate the responses of those interest groups when the findings and recommendations are made public.</p>
<p>The recommendations themselves require the greatest care. I believe there is a general public belief that HTA comes to simple yes-or-no judgments: things work, or they do not. The reality, of course, is that of probabilistic judgments, far more in the gray area than black or white. The PSTF recommendations do not say “do not screen under 50.” Bearing in mind a variety of adverse hazards for women 40 to 49 years, they say “there is moderate certainty that the net benefit is small.”</p>
<p>No numbers are attached to the “moderate certainty” judgment, just as there are no numbers provided for the possible adverse events (e.g., false-positive results leading to biopsies, anxiety, and other stresses). In short, a judgment was made, an all-things-considered, on-balance judgment. It is doubtful that much more precision could have been brought to the study, and it is obvious (as some critics loudly noted) that some otherwise low-risk women from 40 to 49 years not screened would develop breast cancer and be at risk of death. The same could be said of routine screening of women 30 to 39 years. Just as the recommendations were coming out, a young colleague of mine told me about a 20-year-old friend of hers who believed she detected lumps in her breast. But she could not at first persuade her university doctors to perform a mammography. It was, they said, highly improbable that she could at her age have breast cancer. Indeed so, but they did screen anyway because she was obviously anxious, and she did have cancer. Stories like that get around.</p>
<p>I might add that, if the physician of a woman at, say, age 35 years, should for reasons of family history or other considerations decide to screen her, he could probably provide no hard risk data either if his patient were skeptical. In short, there will almost always be uncertainty, conflicting judgments even among those who agree on the evidence, and even more opportunities for doubt and controversy when the recommendations go out to a public, including physicians looking for certainty and not carefully formulated, prudential judgments. The pitfalls of making judgments are many, and at least in the American context, there are enough alleged experts around ready to jump on HTA conclusions.</p>
<p>In a 2007 work written for the Biotechnology Industry Organization (BIO), <italic>The Complexities of Comparative Effectiveness</italic>, Dr. Ted Buckley worked his way through an intimidatingly long list of those complexities: for instance, the lack of a standard definition of just what CER is, a history of health care providers and patients who do not pay attention to relevant information anyway, population-based studies not pertinent to individual patient needs, and so on.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0272989X11418672">8</xref></sup> His aim, he says, is simply “education” about the complexities, but by the end of the work, it would seem that CER is so mired in that jungle of complexity that only fools would even attempt it. He is not wrong about the complexities, but they seem no worse than in other sectors of human life: predictions about climate change, the best foreign policy for dealing with China, assessing the hazards of nuclear reactors in one’s neighborhood, and offshore drilling. That is just the way modern life is. I am not certain I would ask Dr. Buckley whether it is safe to get out of bed in the morning.</p>
<p>Most of everything I have said so far points in one direction, that of the need for much improved public and professional education. Not only is that necessary for the sake of scientific literacy about HTA but all the more so to alert doctors and the public about the way various interest groups can sometimes shape data to their own ends or to debunk even the most careful studies. I would particularly single out the importance of educating the media as well. Not only is it rare for the public to read, or readily understand, complex scientific findings, but many physicians (at least in my own experience) are also less than assiduous in keeping up with the medical literature. They are also as likely to be alerted to new studies and data by the media as the general public.</p>
<p>My guess, for instance, is that many physicians first learned about the mammography debate from the extensive news coverage, not from picking it up directly from the <italic>Annals of Internal Medicine</italic> where it was published. For the most part, the reporting was balanced and careful but dealt little with its methodology or the nuance of its recommendations. And it did not direct attention as much as it might have to the self-interest of some of the medical and professional groups that were the most critical. Workshops and special conferences for the media about HTA would be most fruitful. I doubt there is more than a handful of American reporters and medical writers who could be said to be experts on the subject. If and when some truly momentous struggle breaks out over an HTA study and recommendation, the reporting of it in the media is likely to be of the highest importance.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0272989X11418672">
<title>Perennial Problems</title>
<p>Three problems are likely to dog the footsteps of HTA: prevention studies, the treatment of statistical outliers, and HTA and the role of the physician: the art and science of medicine.</p>
<p>The mammography screening recommendation is a type of study whose findings will often be controversial. In essence, how many people is it worth screening in order to find a comparative few who will benefit from treatment? As the portion of beneficiaries declines, for instance, from 60% to 50% all the way down to 1%, at what point does it make no economic sense to carry out the screening? QALYs analysis can in principle answer that question, but inevitably, there would be some denied screening whose life might have been saved; and in this social media era, their names are likely to be known.</p>
<p>At least in the mammography case, it could be shown that the screening could itself have adverse effects, allowing a tradeoff between different kinds of health risks and benefits. Screening procedures ruled out at some level solely on economic grounds would have no such redeeming virtues. In the case of cost alone, a recommendation not to screen beyond a certain point would simply look cold and cruel, however valid the research design. The only way to lessen the negative public impact would be to enhance the efforts suggested above: to ensure that the likely affected interest groups were fully aware of the ongoing research, and with a strong consultative role from beginning to end, and that the media were signaled in advance what the recommendations would likely be. Avoid surprises.</p>
<p>There is a phrase in the competitive golfing world about tournament players who do not “make the cut.” By that phrase, it is meant that if, early in a tournament, a golfer does not achieve a minimum score, he or she will not be allowed to continue further. They are just out of the tournament altogether. Some HTA recommendations will mean that, for economic or other reasons, some patients will not be eligible for a particular treatment; they will not “make the cut.” The ethical dilemma of considering their fate is of the worst kind. They are not responsible for the fact that their disease, or their status with it, is not their fault. We cannot say to them, “why did you choose to have this disease?” Getting it was their bad luck. They are losers in the lottery for treatment, the statistical outliers.</p>
<p>They will put HTA to its most severe test. To pass this test, HTA must have a secure scientific and public reputation, legislators and the public must understand the resource scarcity that makes such outcomes necessary, and the recommendations must not be presented as an impersonal bureaucratic decision but as the resolution of an unpleasant and difficult moral dilemma. If at all possible, efforts to enlist industry support for those outliers should be solicited. Their prices for drugs or devices will be part of the problem, and they can be considered a source of the moral dilemma, one that is as likely to give them a public black eye as HTA. They would be wise; it should be expressly pointed out to them to do what they can to relieve the economic burden leading to such a decision. But that will not always be feasible, in which case the public standing and integrity of the HTA agency will be the critical variable.</p>
<p>It has long been understood within the profession that medicine properly understood is both science and art. The science comes from the broad generalizations about the human body made possible by scientific research, whether biological or HTA. The art comes from an understanding that patients are different, that experience and judgment come into play in trying to simultaneously bring those skills together with the scientific knowledge in the treatment of individual patients. The good physician is understood to be one who knows how to do that and knows it can be difficult on occasion.</p>
<p>Yet, it is also known that some physicians are too much swayed by their limited experience, by the practices of their neighboring colleagues, or simply by the fact that they do not work hard to keep their scientific knowledge up to date. The common but seemingly counterintuitive advice that a patient might do better with a young, newly minted physician filled with the latest information might be better than a much older, more experienced one reflects that background perception, reflecting a certain skepticism about physician judgment. The fact that many physicians have long been notorious for not acting on well-known and published HTA findings bears out that skepticism. I have a physician who is much loved, sensitive to me as a person, and thought well of professionally. But I long ago discovered how awkward it is for me to ask him, concerning some of my medical conditions, if he has read this or that journal article on recent evidence of diagnostic or treatment strategies. Too often, he has not and is a bit sheepish about that. Nonetheless, he has so many other physician virtues that I have not sought a change.</p>
<p>In other words, I am sympathetic to physician worries that HTA will impose rigid guidelines on their behavior or limit what they can, in their best judgment, prescribe for their patients. Even so, too much sympathy would be a mistake given how hard it is to get many physicians to take evidence seriously and change their practice habits accordingly. The refusal by our Congress to allow the use of CER to establish practice guidelines or even to make recommendations seemed to me and many others to have been a huge mistake, which many critics are even now working to change, however difficult that may be, and similar efforts are underway with cost-benefit analysis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0272989X11418672">9</xref></sup> The Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services should not, as noted above, have given in to the interest groups that objected to the mammography recommendations, undercutting a reputable agency that works under her authority in her own department and particularly when those recommendations make clear that they could be overridden in individual cases.</p>
<p>I can offer no clear advice on the best way to get physicians to take seriously HTA evidence and act upon recommendations. A strictly regulatory approach aiming to micromanage physicians would not only put aside the important tradition of deference to physician judgment in treating their patients but also would bring HTA into disrepute because of its insensitivity to patient differences. Yet, bland recommendations will not do too much good either. I believe the PSTF has a reasonable way of dealing with that kind of dilemma. In making use of a grading system for its recommendations—ranging from “A” for services where there is a “high certainty that net benefit is substantial” through “D,” a recommendation against the service—it makes clear its own standards and the weight of potential pressure behind them. In the case of its mammography recommendations, it gives them a grade of “C,” which is a recommendation “against routinely providing the service.”</p>
<p>That kind of recommendation leaves considerable room for physician judgment with individual patients, but it also deals effectively with a common criticism of HTA that it supplies only a “one-size-for-all” judgment. Its “A” grade might be said to do that, but it can be applied only when the evidence is overwhelming. When that is the case, its recommendations can legitimately be used to put considerable pressure on physicians, socially as well as professionally. If I am sometimes embarrassed to cite my Internet findings to my doctor, I would have no objection to an HTA agency using that same resource to tell physicians how they might, all things considered, make use of evidence in their treatment patterns. And we, their patients, can be listening in.</p>

<sec id="section6-0272989X11418672">
<title>The Politics of Ethics</title>
<p>I have tried in this article to interpret the meaning of the mammography debate in the United States in terms of the interplay of ethics and politics. Ethics as a long-established academic discipline has historically sought to remove itself from the political arena, not out of distaste for it but instead to see if some enduring moral values, principles, rules, and virtues can be fashioned that will help us shape our own lives as individuals and our social relationships with others. One important way to pursue that goal is to examine the way people actually live their lives, the way they articulate their values, and the implicit and explicit moral rules common in their society and its subgroups. The political arena is one place to focus attention and, in the mammography case, the medical arena as well.</p>
<p>As the American health care debate has made clear, there is a fundamental split between those for whom the ethical values of freedom and individual choice are paramount and those for whom the collective common good is most important. In the context of health care, the former set of values often draws heavily on some ancient medical values, notably the primacy of the individual doctor-patient relationship and not the collective health of the public. The common good approach, by contrast, often articulated in the language of solidarity in European countries, stresses the mutual interdependence of human beings, their common neediness in the face of illness, and the obligation to support each other in paying for health care. Layered on top of those ethical struggles is a fierce debate about the role of government. One side, in the tradition of Thomas Jefferson, is hostility to a strong government role, not only in health care but most other areas of American life (save for national defense); the other side, invoking justice, looks to government to facilitate our obligations to others in time of need. The market, on the other side, is seen as the main economic vehicle for the expression of choice, with as little government interference as possible.</p>
<p>In the end, this political/ideological/ethical struggle comes down to a fundamental clash of different visions of how to live our individual and collective lives. American HTA must do its work in that vexing context. If HTA is envisioned in an ethically minimalist way, doing nothing but collecting and assessing data but passing no judgment on its clinical or other uses, it can pass muster with those worried about judgments making use of that data to interfere with the commercial drug and device industries or the private doctor-patient relationship. The political clout of those interests accounted for the limits placed on government-sponsored CER. But effective HTA, I believe, must be used to establish clinical guidelines, allow for assessments of opportunity costs among competing technologies, and have an important place in health care budgeting. But then, I am on the side of a solidarity-based, government-regulated, universal access health care system, and HTA at its strongest best fits into that kind of system.</p>
<p>The utility of ethics, and its best contribution, comes when it is possible to introduce ethical principles and rules into a context that is still open to different perspectives and in need of some guidance. The trouble comes when there are 2 or more competitive value systems, each of which has been fashioned and polished by its adherents into a coherent, tight system. The history of moral theories—for instance, utilitarianism versus duty-oriented systems—is that their adherents have worked on them and turned them into (in their eyes) plausible and internally consistent theories, not readily admitting of compromise. The ideological and political struggle over health care in the United States is a clash between such theories. Understood in that way, one could say that the problem is not a lack of ethics but a clash of incompatible theories that each blends ethical values and political values together in a way not easily open to moderation or compromise.</p>
<p>The result in the United States is, in effect, both an ethical and a political stalemate, one marked by intransigence on both sides among politicians as well as the general public. As I write this in the spring of 2011, it is simply impossible even to guess how the stalemate will be broken and a compromise brought about. The field of ethics has itself over the centuries displayed analogous stalemates, many of them resolved by the entrance of new theories. No such opening is now apparent in the health care reform struggle nor in the deployment of HTA. One side welcomes it and will push to strengthen it, moving toward its use in shaping policy and influencing physician behavior. The other side sees it as a danger to be combated and its impact nullified or minimized. A problem of that kind cannot be solved by the invocation of ethics. It is a clash of ethics that is itself at the core of the problem. The fate of HTA is thus up in the air, along with the rest of American health care reform.</p>
