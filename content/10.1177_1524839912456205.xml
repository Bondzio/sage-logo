<abstract>
<p><italic>Aging, Society, &amp; the Life Course</italic> is a comprehensive textbook and timely edition with updates on a number of contemporary issues affecting our aging society including an increased focus on baby boomers as they approach retirement and critical issues on global aging. The authors provide in-depth discussions on how societal forces influence the aging process and examine these from personal, familial, community, societal, and global perspectives. The book also integrates theories with context to help readers better understand the diversity of the older population, and aging and the life course as social phenomena. This text is ideal not only for both undergraduate and graduate courses but also for practitioners to better understand how aging is much more than an individual journey through time, and is also a complex social process that will affect our field. The life course perspective also helps inform new research and theoretical developments in the field of gerontology.</p>

<p><italic>Aging, Society, &amp; the Life Course</italic> (4th ed.) is a comprehensive and thought-provoking text discussing micro and macro perspectives of contemporary issues related to aging and life course. Both authors have decades of experience in research and teaching in gerontology. Dr. Morgan is currently an associate dean at the Erickson School of Aging Studies and co-director of its Gerontology Doctoral Program at the University of Maryland. She has been principal or co-principal investigator on several National Institutes of Health–funded studies focusing on economic well-being and family relationships to assisted living. Dr. Kunkel is the director of Scripps Gerontology Center at Miami University. Her research has focused on demography of aging, and innovations and quality in long-term care systems.</p>
<p>As our rapidly growing, changing, and aging society continues to affect our lives, culture, and norms, emerging issues and theories to answer questions related to the study of aging and society warrant critical attention. The life course perspective and theory application this text offers provide fascinating views toward contemporary issues related to the aging population. What makes this text particularly timely and relevant is that the authors apply theory in real-world context of aging and life course throughout, and make it relevant and memorable. In addition, the authors also propose interesting questions, such as the changing family structure and resulting norms on filial obligations, for future research responding to our increasing complex and diverse aging society. Topical essay on issues of “love, sex, &amp; longevity,” “e-elders,” “anti-aging,” and musical preferences of certain cohorts further provides interesting read via contemporary lenses. This 12-chapter book starts with an overview on aging and society, research methods, and demographic perspectives; then moves from individual to family and societal aspects discussing the aging individual, family, and work and retirement in the life course; follows with economics, health, and politics; and concludes with a special focus on global aging, baby boomers aging, and the dynamics of aging in our future.</p>
<p>Chapter 1 discusses the dimensions of aging, ways to categorize people by age, and social perspectives on aging. Chapter 2 surveys aging relevant research designs and methods. The authors discuss an interesting and controversial theoretical argument about cohort size and life chances. The economist <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1524839912456205">Easterlin (1987)</xref> argues that members of large cohorts need to compete for attention in families, schools, and job opportunities whereas a smaller generation generally has less competition and better life chances. This concept has been revisited throughout the text including in the discussion of different boomer cohorts. Chapter 3 describes how the demographic transition theory is used to examine how the shape of population pyramids change as our society aging, compounded with the changes of fertility, mortality, and migration patterns.</p>
<p>Chapter 4 discusses the aging individual in social context. The life course perspective focuses on a sequence of stages people move through as they age, with implications on entry into and exit from important social roles shaped by culture and societal age norms. The authors discuss measuring age norms using what people typically <italic>do</italic> or what people say they think they (and others) <italic>should do</italic>. For example, studies have found very little change in women’s median age at marriage, but find a substantial decline in the duration of childbearing stage as family size declines in the 21st century (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1524839912456205">Glick, 1977</xref>). Since human do take active roles in constructing their life course, age norms can be different from personal timetables and are flexible across social contexts.</p>
<p>Chapter 5 moves from individual to family and discusses core norms and expectations. The study of filial duty, which adult children have toward aging parents, warrants more attention. The authors offer fascinating perspectives on the family life cycle theory to illustrate how the family relationships and dynamics change as one’s dependence on the family change. It was interesting to note the family life has evolved significantly. From a time of high fertility, births clustered fairly closely together with low divorce rates, to the contemporary variations in having both teenager and preschoolers at the same time, childlessness, divorce and remarriage, or single parenthood. A shifted attention to family dynamics on transitions experienced rather than assigning them to particular stages maybe more relevant to our current social context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1524839912456205">Cohler &amp; Altergott, 1995</xref>). This chapter also highlights important research gaps on familial roles and relationships as one ages, such as those between siblings and parent–child relationships. Emerging phenomenon such as woman in the middle (i.e., the sandwich generation), those who simultaneously have responsibilities for their children and aging parents were discussed. The changes in marriage patterns, including increased age at first marriage, decreased marriage rates, low fertility, and changes in the size and shape of families (i.e., from the narrow base of one couple with many offspring to a taller but narrower structure, which involves more generations) warrants further research.</p>
<p>Chapter 6 covers work and retirement, the occupational life cycle, and age discrimination in employment and policies. The authors discuss two sets of theories relevant to retirement transition and adaptation: (a) “disengagement versus activity theories” where one views social disengagement in retirement as a positive and normal process that enables the aging person to pursuit of other more voluntary and flexible activities, whereas the other argues that individuals need to be active by maintaining social roles and interaction rather than disengaging in order to age well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1524839912456205">Cumming &amp; Henry, 1961</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1524839912456205">Lemon, Bengtson, &amp; Peterson, 1972</xref>) and (b) “continuity theory and the busy ethic,” which has grounded view of job-related achievement as the basis of self-worth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1524839912456205">Atchley, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1524839912456205">Ekerdt, 1986</xref>). Therefore, similar to the importance of work ethic to employment, the “busy ethic” honors an active retirement life and encourages retirees approach leisure in the same organized and purposeful manner they used for employment to minimize the risks of disruption and distress. An interesting application could be rethinking senior centers to include meaningful volunteerism and opportunities for part-time employment to meet the needs of future cohorts of retirees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1524839912456205">Fitzpatrick &amp; McCabe, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Chapter 7 discusses economics and the aging society, the role of social security and pensions, and the economic well-being of older adults. The economic life cycle perspective encourages readers to rethink the “economics of aging,” including issues on spending and saving over the life course. Chapter 8 discusses aging, health, and health care. The “political economy of aging” perspective draws attention to the economic and political forces that shape the policies, services, and experiences of an aging population. The authors argue that the current medical model in the United States and the lack of universal health care have created a system not well suited to the needs of an aging population. Hopefully, health care reform helps to address this issue. Alternative long-term care models include community-based long-term care, which provide home-based daily activity assistance by community-based agencies, or the continuing-care retirement communities may be further explored. Chapter 9 covered politics, government, and aging in America. Issues such as political behaviors (voting, participating in political activities, or running for office), old-age political power, the “graying of the federal budget,” and the current hot debate on generational equity are discussed.</p>
<p>Chapter 10 broadens the discussions to global aging. Although more developed countries currently have a much higher proportion of older people, aging is actually occurring much more rapidly in less developed countries than it did in already-aging countries such as the United States. For example, it took France 115 years for the proportion of individuals aged 65 and older to increase from 7% to 14%, whereas it will take only 22 years for Thailand to double the proportion of its older population. One implication is that less developed countries are having or will have significantly less time and fewer resources to face challenges to serve the unique health, housing, social, and economic needs of older population. Three case studies are used to illustrate how different demographics, culture, and social situations affect population aging. The “one-child policy” in China is a unique case of developing countries undergoing a rapid population pyramid transition to an aging society, resulting from a very rapid decrease in fertility and low morality. In a culture that honors elders and values traditions of respect, China is facing challenges on norms and expectations about the responsibilities of children to provide care for elders as family size and structure changes, and young adults migrate from rural areas to cities. Additional challenges include a shortage of facilities or trained professionals for nonfamily alternatives for long-term care needs, few opportunities for meaningful use of time after retirement, and the inadequate Chinese pension system. The Germany case, on the other hand, represented the classic pattern of well-developed countries, which has little population growth and worse aged dependency ratios. These societies normally value and promote healthy, active aging, and lifelong opportunities for learning and civic engagement, and may find these challenged as the population pyramids invert. On the other hand, Kenya’s circumstances reflect those in less developed countries, with a true pyramid shape as a young society and undergoing demographic transition with shape getting thicker in the middle and growing noticeably broader at the top. At the same time, Kenya also faces many health threats, such as the HIV/AIDS epidemic, which has led to a decline in its population life expectancy and loss of young adults in their prime years. Many older people in Kenya now live in skipped-generation households, with the middle generation missing and grandparents acting as surrogate parents for their orphaned grandchildren. These cases provide readers a better understanding of the impact and complexity of global aging in varied context.</p>
<p>Chapter 11 focuses on baby boomers aging. The authors describe characteristics of the different boomer cohorts: (a) The “leading edge” boomers (those born 1946-1954) who were very much affected by the Vietnam War and (b) the “trailing edge” boomers (born 1955 to 1964) who were less embroiled in antiwar causes. Given the more flexible marital norms and higher divorce rates among boomers, the authors point new trends of sharing lives and new language, which might emerge as we learn more from these boomers. For example, boomers may be pioneers in later-life living apart together, or LAT, a new family form of nonmarital but committed relationships in which the partners define themselves as a couple but each lives in her or his own home (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1524839912456205">Levin, 2004</xref>). Overall, boomers experience longer and healthier life expectancy after retirement than preceding generations. The authors discuss an interesting new phase of the life course—the “third age,” which refers to the healthy postretirement years when one is still active and independent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1524839912456205">Laslett, 1991</xref>). This phase ends when the “fourth age” begins as one experiences declining health and loss of independence. The movement of “productive aging”, an important dimension of the third age, advocates expanding meaningful opportunities and encourage older people to continue contributing to the community.</p>
<p>Chapter 12 concludes with the dynamics of aging in our future. While we prepare to face the impact of aging baby boomers, changes that occur as a result of continuing population aging in many societies and beyond the boomers needs attentions. How could society provide new meaningful opportunities or encore careers for the healthy older adults in their “third age,” or how could our society be better prepared to meet the diverse needs from the growing, changing, and aging of the older population globally? Factors such as changing family structures, emerging new familial or quasi-familial social norms, alternative caregivers, senior housing, changes in health, and the uniqueness of aging in each cohort need to be taken into consideration in our contemporary gerontology research. Interdisciplinary frameworks that examine physical, psychological, and social aspects of aging at the micro and macro levels are needed to firm up our theoretical foundations and our abilities to better transform knowledge to inform policy and practice.</p>
<p>This text serves as a comprehensive and excellent resource for our aging world. Contemporary aging issues, life course perspectives, strong theory application, and thought-provoking discussions made this text an interesting read. It also offers a Kindle version for e-readers. One major weakness is its textbook style format, the use of small fonts, and few white spaces. It might be somewhat difficult and less attractive for practitioners to pick up and read.</p>
<p>In summary, this new text edition is a timely update on the changing and aging world. This text is an important contribution to advancing the practice of health promotion and instrumental in encouraging new perspectives, interdisciplinary collaborations, and developing emerging services and programs needed in our rapidly growing aging society. Public health professionals, practitioners, and students who are new to issues related to aging and its significant impact on our future and society can gain a comprehensive understanding of key issues to rethink the life course in our contemporary aging society.</p>
