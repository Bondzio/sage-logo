<p>The 2010–2011 RTDNA/Hofstra University Survey showed again that the TV news business isn’t limited to TV. More than three quarters (78.4%) of stations provided local news content to one or more other media—beyond their own station or website (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1931243113495517">Table 1</xref>). These numbers actually reflect a drop in most categories from the previous year. But while the numbers were down, they’re not down much, and we might simply be seeing more specialization and concentration of outside effort.</p>

<title>TV News Departments Are Providing Content to a Variety of Other Outlets</title>
<p>Even more puzzling than the slight downward trend overall is that mobile was actually slightly lower than the year before, albeit less than 3 points. “Other” was most often a digital channel or a newspaper. Over three quarters of all groupings of stations (by staff size, region, etc.) provided content to others … with three exceptions: the smallest newsrooms (1–10 staffers), other commercial, and noncommercial stations. Those three were all around 60%, rather than the 80% of every other group.</p>
<p>I asked a separate question on whether a station was producing news on another local or nearby station. Logic suggests that that number should mirror the number for “another local TV station,” but it doesn’t. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1931243113495517">Table 1</xref> shows 25.1% of stations reported they produced news on another local TV station. But 30.4% said they were producing news that runs on another local or nearby station. It’s hard to imagine that the difference hinges on “nearby.” Those 30.4% said they were producing news on an average of 1.42 stations. I track stations that get news from another station, but if this number is correct, then there are a lot more of those stations receiving news than I’m aware of. It’s possible that the difference involves other digital channels, which I could well be behind in tracking as opposed to more distinctly separate stations.</p>

<p>That’s actually down a point from the year before. The steady rise in cooperation with another TV station or a local radio station has stabilized, and so has the steady drop in the percentage of TV stations working with a local newspaper. Cooperative ventures with newspapers had been dropping steadily since 2005, but it actually edged up 2 points in this survey. Overall, the larger the market, the more likely to see a station involved in some sort of cooperative arrangement, but specific cooperative choices also tended to be more and more market-specific. “Another TV station” was much more likely to be a top 25 market phenomenon “Local newspaper” tended to be higher in markets 26–150. “Radio” mostly went up as market size fell (except the smallest markets, which dropped again). Generally, the bigger the staff, the more likely a station was involved in some sort of cooperative arrangement. CBS stations were more likely to be involved in cooperative ventures than all the other affiliates, and they were especially likely to be involved with local radio (which had become a corporate strategy among CBS-owned stations). About two thirds of the “other” category involved radio or cable.</p>
<p>Cooperative ventures rose substantially during the severe economic downtown of the last few years. It will be interesting to see if a reviving economy and revenue growth leads to fewer cooperative arrangements.</p>
<p>All the categories listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1931243113495517">Table 3</xref> on what stations shared more than doubled from the previous year. The percentage sharing information was slightly lower for the biggest stations in the biggest markets, but otherwise there was little difference no matter how I broke down the categories. Pool video varied more. Fox affiliates were a little more likely to cooperate there, and ABC affiliates were less likely to do so. Helicopter was market-specific, not surprisingly. Almost 43% of top 25 markets reported sharing a chopper. That dropped to just under 14% in markets 26–50, but the survey doesn’t pick up whether that’s because there’s less sharing or fewer choppers. Most of the “other” category involved content, but news directors were more specific—most often noting video and packages.</p>

<p>The previous year, I asked stations not involved in cooperative arrangements whether they were planning or discussing one. More than a quarter (28.6%) said yes. Most were in the three middle (26–101) market groups. There’s no evidence in this year’s survey that those plans resulted in new arrangements. In 2010–2011, almost a quarter (24.8%) said they’re planning or discussing a new cooperative arrangement; most likely, bigger markets and CBS and Fox affiliates.</p>

<p>The year before, almost 46% of news directors noted they were involved in plans for content on the station’s digital channels. A year later, evidence says that few of those plans went anywhere. Some of the numbers were up a little (weather and other), but some were down a little (all news and whether they’re doing anything at all). Interestingly, 8.3% of stations with 51+ news employees are now running an all news digital channel. More than a quarter of TV stations reported running a weather channel. Most often, “other” meant another station on another digital channel; just behind that was news but not all news. Well behind were entertainment and sports. Fox stations were markedly less likely to be involved in these things overall and in each area specifically. Stations in the West also tended to be less involved than stations in other areas.</p>

<p>The use of OMBs (multimedia or backpack journalists) rose about 3.7 points in the last year. That’s a slightly higher rate of growth than a few years ago. Overall, in the 4 years that I’ve tracked this, the use of OMBs has increased 3–4 points a year.</p>
<p>In the last year, the biggest change came in the top 50 markets, where there has been a 10–15 point drop in the “not much” category and a corresponding increase in the “use some” grouping. Other than stations in the Northeast being much less likely to have OMBs than stations elsewhere, there were no big differences by geography or network affiliation.</p>
<p>This year, for the first time, I asked how many OMBs a station employed (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table8-1931243113495517">Table 8</xref>).</p>

<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table8-1931243113495517">Table 8</xref> gives a different dimension on how widespread the use of OMBs was. The median, or midpoint of the numbers, probably gives a better picture of how the typical TV station operates.</p>
<p>These numbers were very much market-dependent. The typical station in markets 1–50 had two OMBs. In markets 51–100, there were three. Markets 101–150 had four; and markets 151+ came in at five.</p>
<p>I also asked what the OMBs did before they were OMBs. Most often, they were either reporters or in college. Less often, they were photographers. Even less often, they were something else. But the answer varied by market size and staff size. In the largest markets and in newsrooms with the largest staff sizes, OMBs were most likely to have been reporters and then photographers. In markets 101+, OMBs were a little more likely to have been college students than reporters.</p>
<p>Almost 43% (42.9%) said the use of OMBs changed who they hired; 38.1% said it didn't change, and 19% said it did sometimes. Not surprisingly, generally, the smaller the market and the smaller the station, the less likely that the use of OMBs changed who they hired. Many—if not most—of them have always hired OMBs.</p>
<p>If the use of OMBs had changed how a station hires, I asked how? All told, 149 news directors answered that question. Over 40% wrote about new and more skills that the people hired must bring to the job. Almost 29% specifically noted that hires had to know how to shoot or how to shoot and edit. Several news directors mentioned that new hires must want to shoot and edit or get involved with various new media skills. Some news directors simply noted that all future hires would be OMBs, and a number of news directors also talked of looking for web skills.</p>

<title>About the Survey</title>
<p>The RTDNA/Hofstra University Survey was conducted in the fourth quarter of 2010 among all 1,729 operating, nonsatellite television stations and a random sample of 3,000 radio stations. Valid responses came from 1,360 television stations (78.7%) and 203 radio news directors and general managers representing 603 radio stations.</p>
<p>Some data sets (e.g., the number of TV stations originating local news, getting it from others and women TV news directors) are based on a complete census and are not projected from a smaller sample.</p>
