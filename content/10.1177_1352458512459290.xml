<title>Methods:</title>
<p>We retrospectively reviewed data of Thai patients with multiple sclerosis (MS), neuromyelitis optica (NMO) and NMO spectrum disorders (NMOSDs) who attended the MS Clinic at Siriraj Hospital, Thailand from March 2000 to October 2011.

<title>Results:</title>
<p>Of the 40 MS patients who received IFN-β, 26 adhered to the medication for at least 2 years. In addition, 27 NMO/NMOSDs patients who had been diagnosed with MS were treated as such with IFN-β.

In addition, in 69.2% of the patients, IFN-β also showed beneficial effects by prolonging the time to first relapse to 15.9 months and stabilizing or decreasing progression of the disease. In contrast, no significant benefit was seen in the NMO/NMOSDs group. On the contrary, an increase in EDSS was seen in 53.3 % of them. The most common side effects seen were local skin reactions and flu-like symptoms.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>An increased understanding about the pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis (MS) has led to many new treatment approaches, in particular, molecular targeted therapy. However, beta-interferon (IFN-β), the first disease modifying agent with proven efficacy for treatment of MS since the early 1990s, remains an important first-line therapy. It has been used worldwide for more than two decades and has demonstrated long-term benefit, with predictable side effects. Previous trials show that patients with Relapsing–Remitting MS (RRMS) who were treated with IFN-β had a lower annual relapse rate, slower disability progression and fewer new lesions detected by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), compared with those treated with placebo.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1352458512459290">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1352458512459290"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1352458512459290"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1352458512459290">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>The incidence of MS is low among Asian countries; nevertheless, we found that the number of Thai patients with MS has been increasing.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1352458512459290">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1352458512459290">6</xref></sup> Previous studies demonstrate some differences in the disease characteristics within Asian nations, when compared to Western nations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1352458512459290">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1352458512459290"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1352458512459290"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1352458512459290"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1352458512459290"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1352458512459290">10</xref></sup> Recent data suggests that some patients who participated in those studies actually had Devic’s disease or neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders (NMOSDs).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1352458512459290">11</xref></sup> There has been no report of efficacy of IFN-β in Thai patients with RRMS. Our study objective is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of IFN-β in Thai patients with RRMS, as well as NMO/NMOSDs who were misdiagnosed as MS and treated as such.</p>

<sec id="section7-1352458512459290" sec-type="materials|methods">
<title>Materials and methods</title>
<p>We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 307 patients attending the MS Clinic at Siriraj Hospital, Mahidol University, Bangkok, Thailand during the period between March 2000 and October 2011.</p>
<p>We made a diagnosis of MS or NMO, based on the revised McDonald criteria of 2005<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1352458512459290">12</xref></sup> and Wingerchuk criteria of 2006, respectively.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1352458512459290">13</xref></sup> We diagnosed NMOSDs in patients who had their serum anti-AQP4 antibody-positive, as determined by the cell-based assay described by Takahashi et al.,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1352458512459290">14</xref></sup> and if they fulfilled either of the following criteria: recurrent optic neuritis without brain lesions, acute myelitis with a spinal cord lesion over three vertebral body segments ( ≥3 VBs) with or without brain lesions, or optic neuritis or myelitis without a long spinal cord lesion (&lt; 3 VBs) but with brain MRI findings compatible with those seen in NMO.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1352458512459290">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1352458512459290">16</xref></sup> We diagnosed clinical isolated syndrome (CIS) in patients who presented with a first inflammatory demyelinating event.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1352458512459290">17</xref></sup></p>
<p>Our primary outcome was a reduction in post-treatment annualized relapse rate (ARR) compared with pre-treatment ARR. Pre-treatment ARR was defined as an average number of relapses per year in the 2 years prior to IFN-β treatment. Post-treatment ARR was defined as an average number of relapses per year in the 2 years after IFN-β had commenced for at least 6 months.</p>
<p>Secondary outcomes were the percentage of patients who had a reduction in relapses of at least 30%, 50% or no relapse, when compared with pre-treatment; the time to first relapse, defined as the duration after IFN-β was administered for at least 6 months to the first relapse; disability progression, determined by a change confirmed in Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1352458512459290">18</xref></sup> of 1.5 points in baseline EDSS of 0–3.5, and 1.0 point in baseline EDSS of 4.0–5.0 and 0.5 point in baseline EDSS of ≥5.5.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1352458512459290">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1352458512459290"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1352458512459290">21</xref></sup> No efficacy was defined as no change in relapse rate, or having relapses more than twice within 2 years, or disability progression. We included only patients who had received IFN-β for at least 2 years, in our analysis for primary and secondary outcomes. Adverse drug events were evaluated in all patients, regardless of treatment duration. This study was approved by the Siriraj Institutional Review Board, protocol number 681/2553.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1352458512459290">
<title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p>All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS version 13.0. Each set of data was expressed as the mean ± standard deviation (SD). The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was used to examine normality of distribution of the variables. The Wilcoxon signed rank test was chosen for comparing pre-treatment and post-treatment ARR. In order to compare MS with NMO/NMOSDs in every clinical outcome, Chi square and the Fisher exact test were used if clinical outcomes were categorical variables, while the Mann-Whitney U test was used if clinical outcomes were continuous variables. A P-value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.</p>

<sec id="section9-1352458512459290" sec-type="results">
<title>Results</title>
<p>Out of 307 patients who were primarily diagnosed with demyelinating diseases, there were 130 patients with MS (all were RRMS), 86 CIS, 48 NMO and 40 NMOSDs. The remaining three were later proven to have three other diseases, instead: systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) and lymphoma; so they were excluded from the study. Of those remaining 304 patients, 73 patients (24.0%) were treated with IFN-β. Of those, 40 out of 130 were MS patients (30.8%), 6 of 86 were CIS patients (7%) and the other 27 patients (30.7%) were initially identified as MS but later diagnosed with NMO/ NMOSDs.</p>
<sec id="section10-1352458512459290">
<title>MS groups</title>
<p>Among the 40 MS patients studied, there were 32 females and 8 males with a mean age at onset of 33.4 ± 12.2 years. Their baseline EDSS before starting IFN-β treatment was 3.1 ± 2.3. Half of these patients (18/36) showed lesions compatible with Barkhof brain MRI criteria.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1352458512459290">12</xref></sup> Sixteen percent (4/25) showed cord lesions longer than 3 VBs. Of those, one had spinal cord involvement both centrally and peripherally, with 4 VBs in length; and the other three had spinal cord lesions peripherally, with 4–5 VBs in length. All these four patients fulfilled the Barkhof brain MRI criteria from the beginning, with an absence of anti-AQP4-antibody.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1352458512459290">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1352458512459290">22</xref></sup> Presence of cerebrospinal fluid oligoclonal bands (CSF-OCB) was found in 53.6% (15/28).</p>
<p>Two of the 14 patients were anti-AQP4 positive. One had spinal cord lesions less than 3 VBs and fulfilled Barkhof’s brain MRI criteria. The other had deep white matter lesions typically seen in MS (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1352458512459290">Table 1</xref>).</p>

<title>The NMO/NMOSDs group</title>
<p>There were 27 patients who were initially identified as having MS, but later satisfied the diagnosis for NMO/NMOSDs instead, who were treated with IFN-β. Of these, 22 were female and 5 male, with the mean age at onset of 36.8 ± 14.2 years and a baseline EDSS of 4.0 ± 2.5. Among these, 33.3% (8/24) showed lesions that were compatible with Barkhof’s MRI criteria and 16.7% (3/18) had the presence of CSF-OCB. Spinal MRI lesions longer than 3 VBs were found in 88.9% (24/27) and the presence of serum AQP4-antibody was found in 84.6% of them (11/13) (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1352458512459290">Table 1</xref>).</p>
<p>Fifteen patients (55.6%) were treated with IFN-β for more than 2 years. Their pre-treatment and post-treatment ARR were 1.57 and 1.67, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1352458512459290">Figure 1</xref>).</p>
<p>The percentage of patients who had a reduction in post-treatment relapses of at least 30%, 50% or remained relapse-free were 40% (6/15), 33.3% (5/15), and 20% (3/15), respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1352458512459290">Figure 2</xref>). The average time to first relapse was 8.2 months. Four patients (26.7%) were stable and three (20%) had a decrease in EDSS score. The other eight patients (53.3%) had an increased EDSS score (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1352458512459290">Table 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1352458512459290">Figure 3</xref>). Of those, five patients (33.3%) had disability progression by the end of the second year of treatment.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-1352458512459290">
<title>CIS group</title>
<p>Because the decision to receive IFN-β treatment in patients with CIS depends on the patient’s choice after strategizing with the doctor, this group was analyzed separately. There were six patients with CIS who received IFN-β treatment for more than 2 years. Four had no further attack at the end of the study, while the other two had one attack each, with a good recovery.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-1352458512459290">
<title>Adverse drug reactions</title>
<p>Based on all of the 73 patients who received IFN-β treatment, the most common local reaction was erythema at the injection site (14/73; 19.2%) and the most common systemic reaction was flu-like symptoms (26/73; 35.6%) (See <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1352458512459290">Table 4</xref>).</p>

<p>Five patients (6.8%) discontinued IFN-β treatment due to adverse drug reactions. Three of those patients, two MS and one NMO/NMOSDs, could not tolerate the flu-like symptoms, so they stopped IFN-β treatment. In addition, one patient with NMO developed severe skin and soft tissue necrosis which required debridement; this led to drug discontinuation. The last one had persistent elevated transaminitis (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1352458512459290">Table 4</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Our study demonstrated that IFN-β treatment was efficient in Thai MS patients who had continuous treatment for at least 2 years, with a reduction in ARR by 52.8%, whereas no significant changes were found in patients with NMO/NMOSDs. Our findings also showed that the NMO/NMOSDs group had a lesser presence of CSF-OCB and more CSF pleocytosis, as compared to the MS group, which is similar to previous reports.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1352458512459290">11</xref></sup> There was a trend toward younger age at onset in the MS group. A higher baseline EDSS before starting IFN-β treatment in NMO/NMOSDs patients implied relatively more severe disease. The mechanism may be associated with IL-17/IL-8 axis activation with severe inflammation, demyelination and the extent of acute axonal injury in NMO lesions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1352458512459290">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1352458512459290">24</xref></sup> Similar to a previous report, optic nerve, brainstem and spinal cord were the common locations for attacks in Thai MS patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1352458512459290">5</xref></sup> Bilateral ON was more commonly seen in this study; however, most patients in the MS group still had asynchronous presentations or simultaneous onset, but with more severity in one eye. Interestingly, 16% of our Thai MS patients had spinal cord lesions longer than 3 VBs, whereas approximately 30% of our NMO/NMOSDs patients had brain MRI that fulfilled Barkhof criteria. There were two MS patients who had overlapping clinical characteristics between MS and NMO: Their initial brain MRI showed ovoid lesions perpendicular to the ventricle, with an absence of anti-AQP4-antibody, but had spinal cord lesions extending over three VBs. Both had poor recovery. Therefore, caution should be made in applying diagnostic criteria in Thai patients, as overlapping features of MS and NMO exist in some patients.</p>
<p>For Thai MS patients who received IFN-β treatment for more than 2 years, their ARR significantly decreased, with an absolute risk reduction of 52.8%. This emphasizes the results of the previous studies both from Western and other Asian countries: IFN-β has efficacy for MS treatment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1352458512459290">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1352458512459290"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1352458512459290"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1352458512459290">4</xref></sup> Increased EDSS scores were found in 53.3% of our NMO/NMOSDs patients who were treated with IFN-β. This finding was similar to other reports on the worsening of symptoms in NMO patients who were given immunomodulatory treatment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1352458512459290">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1352458512459290">25</xref></sup> Interestingly, six NMO/NMOSDs patients showed a significant reduction in relapse rate: All of these patients had spinal lesions more than three VBs. No one received treatment with steroids, apart from during the time of relapse. One patient had been treated with azathioprine for 5 years and then stopped the medication, due to severe headache, before switching to IFN-β 2 weeks later. No other immunosuppressant was given. The benefit of azathioprine for prevention of relapses may be prolonged for years, in that patient; however, the response in the rest of the patients may be due to genetic background or some other unknown mechanism. There were seven patients in the MS group who did not respond to the IFN-β treatment. Two patients (patients 3 and 4, see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1352458512459290">Table 3</xref>) received a sub-optimal dose, due to side effects of myalgia and transaminitis, and another two (patients 6 and 7, see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1352458512459290">Table 3</xref>) had spinal cord lesions longer than three VBs. Therefore, several reasons for a poor response might be assumed. The MS patient with a slightly younger age at onset (Case 2, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1352458512459290">Table 3</xref>) had typical MS presentations, but poor responses. This observation was similar to that of Waubant et al., who demonstrated that compared with non-responders, responders are older and have longer disease duration.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1352458512459290">26</xref></sup> The other two (Cases 1 and 5, in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1352458512459290">Table 3</xref>) continued to have relapses and disability progression during the treatment.</p>
<p>A fluctuation in treatment response for those receiving IFN-β therapy in the first few years is mentioned as deriving either from inherently immunogenic factors which may influence efficacy, or from an association with the development of antibodies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1352458512459290">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1352458512459290">28</xref></sup> There were 14 MS patients who received IFN-β treatment for less than 2 years. Three who were currently on the medication continued to remain relapse-free until the end of the study (average duration of treatment 10.5 months). Two showed no efficacy within the first year, so they decided to stop treatment. The remaining nine patients stopped medication due to other reasons, such as: patient preference, financial problems, being lost to follow-up and being unable to tolerate the side effects.</p>
<p>The number of patients who had reductions in relapse rate of at least 30%, 50% and no relapse was obviously higher in the MS group (84.6%, 84.6% and 57.7%, respectively) compared to the NMO/NMOSDs group (40%, 33.3% and 20%, respectively). Also, time to first relapse after IFN-β treatment was 7.7 months longer in MS patients. More MS patients had stable or decreased EDSS scores at 2 years after initiation of IFN-β treatment (69.2%). These findings emphasized that IFN-β had benefit in Thai MS patients by reducing the exacerbations, prolonging time to first relapse, and minimizing the number of patients with disability progression. Notably, the ARR reduction of 52.8% in our study was higher than that seen in previous studies,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1352458512459290">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1352458512459290">3</xref></sup> because we were comparing the ARR between post-treatment and pre-treatment, not with placebo, as in previous trials. In addition, diagnosis of MS in our study was based on the revised McDonald criteria of 2005, which may have led to earlier treatment and therefore, more benefit.</p>
<p>IFN-β was quite well-tolerated. Five patients stopped treatment due to adverse reactions. One patient (1.4%) had skin necrosis, leading to treatment discontinuation.</p>
<p>Our study had some limitations. Firstly, the number of patients was small. Secondly, we may have misdiagnosed some patients who had ambiguous clinical features between MS and NMO, as being a MS patient; however, a longer follow-up could disclose the correct diagnosis. Thirdly, there might be some selection bias for treatment options, as the patient coverage by different healthcare policies posed a great impact on access to higher-cost treatments. Finally, we do not have data on neutralizing antibody, IFN-receptor polymorphisms and pharmacogenomics in the Thai population, which may have an effect on the responses in our Thai MS patients. A larger study and more research on responses to interferon are needed.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Although Thai MS patients had some clinical presentations that were different from Western MS, IFN-β treatment still showed it had efficacy when its use continued for at least 2 years. Its benefits were seen in decreasing exacerbation rates, prolonging time to first relapse, and in stabilizing or decreasing progression of the disease, while creating generally tolerable side effects. In contrast, we found that giving IFN-β treatment to NMO patients may lead to a worsening of clinical attacks in most, but not all, of these patients.</p>
