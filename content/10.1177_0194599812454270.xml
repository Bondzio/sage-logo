<body>
<p>Thank you for your Letter to the Editor in reference to our article. Although your points are well taken, I cannot agree completely with your assessment of the utility of thermoplastic mandibular advancement devices.</p>
<p>My experience in treating hundreds of patients with both thermoplastic and custom titratable mandibular advancement devices (MADs) is that patients more readily accept initial treatment with thermoplastic devices over custom devices because of their low cost and the ease of the fitting process. Indeed, many patients find the thought of spending between $500 and $5000 at the dentist (depending on their insurance coverage) on a device they are not sure they will like to be a significant deterrent. Although long-term tolerability and compliance with thermoplastic devices are unquestionably lower than for custom devices, initial efficacy figures of 77.2% for classical surgical cure (apnea-hypopnea index [AHI] &lt;20 and 50% reduction) and 52.0% for cure (AHI &lt;5) should not be so unceremoniously discounted.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0194599812454270">*</xref></p>
<p>In many patients, even those who have developed compliance-affecting issues such as discomfort or diminishing fit with a titratable thermoplastic device (TPD), I have observed that initial resolution of sleep problems with TPD is more commonly a significant incentive for patients to pursue additional treatment, rather than an experience leading to unjustified negative generalizations concerning the effect that can be expected later with a custom MAD.</p>
<p>In principal, I agree with your statement that one should be careful about recommending MADs that show low efficacy and adherence to patients with obstructive sleep apnea-hypopnea syndrome seeking non–continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) treatment. However, it should be reiterated that although oral appliances are considered an appropriate first-line alternative for patients with mild to moderate sleep apnea, an inclusion criterion for the use of mandibular advancement devices in our study was previous failure of both CPAP and surgery (ie, patients with difficult to control obstructive sleep apnea who would otherwise go untreated). Although statistically significantly better than the rate for TPD, the 6-month adherence rate of 50.9% for custom MADs in our study could hardly be considered ideal. However, this does not automatically mean that a trial of either device should not be recommended for patients who have exhausted other treatment options.</p>

<p>Please note that the statement “First, the results indicate that the overall treatment success with the custom MAD was twice as high as with the thermoplastic MAD (89.5% vs 44.7%),” is a misquotation of the results of our study. These figures do not appear anywhere in our article or accompanying tables.</p>
