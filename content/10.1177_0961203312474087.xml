<title>Objective</title>
<p>Our aim was to estimate annual health care resource use and medical costs associated with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) in a large US managed care health plan.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Methods</title>
<p>Subjects at least 18 years of age and with claims-based evidence of SLE (ICD-9-CM 710.0x) were identified from a health plan database. Subjects were matched on the basis of demographic and clinical characteristics to unaffected controls. Resource use and costs were determined during a fixed 12-month period. A generalized linear model (GLM) was used to adjust costs for demographic and clinical characteristics.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Results</title>
<p>In total, 1278 newly diagnosed SLE subjects were matched to 3834 controls, and 10,152 subjects with existing SLE were matched to 30,456 controls. Health care resource use was significantly higher among SLE subjects than matched controls, including average annual numbers of ambulatory visits, specialist visits, and inpatient hospital stays (all <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001). SLE subjects had significantly higher overall mean annual medical costs than matched controls (newly diagnosed: $19,178 vs. $4909; existing: $15,487 vs. $5156; both <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001). Evidence of specific organ involvement including renal failure and central nervous system complications, were each associated with increased costs (both <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001).</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Subjects with SLE have high resource use and medical costs relative to controls.</p>

<p>Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic autoimmune disease thought to be mediated by B cell dysregulation and production of autoantibodies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0961203312474087">1</xref></sup> The clinical manifestations of SLE are heterogeneous, and multiple organ systems may be affected.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0961203312474087">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0961203312474087">5</xref></sup> Mortality associated with SLE has decreased in recent decades, and the 10-year survival rate has recently been estimated at about 90%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0961203312474087">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0961203312474087">7</xref></sup> Female gender, African-American ethnicity, and Asian ethnicity have all been linked to increased SLE susceptibility.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0961203312474087">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0961203312474087">10</xref></sup> Epidemiological studies have estimated the incidence of SLE in the US at 1.5–5.1 cases per 100,000 individuals (1950–2001) and the prevalence of SLE in the US at 42–150 cases per 100,000 individuals (1989–2001).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0961203312474087">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0961203312474087">16</xref></sup> We have estimated a more recent overall age- and gender-adjusted incidence rate of SLE at 7.22 cases per 100,000 person-years (2003–2008), and prevalence of SLE at 102.94 per 100,000 individuals (2008) in the US.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0961203312474087">17</xref></sup></p>
<p>Previous studies have investigated resource use and economic burden of SLE in the US, and estimates of the average annual health care costs for subjects with SLE have ranged from about $12,000 to about $24,000.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0961203312474087">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0961203312474087">22</xref></sup> Estimates of the cost of SLE in the US vary, likely due to differences in patient populations and differing methodologies among studies. Generally, costs appear to be higher in subjects with more disease activity and in those with major organ complications.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0961203312474087">23</xref></sup> None of the previous studies have separated the SLE subjects into those with newly diagnosed disease and those with existing disease when evaluating resource use and costs. In this study, we used a claims database associated with a large national managed care organization to determine the resource utilization and costs associated with adult SLE in the US. These were determined for both newly diagnosed subjects (those without prior diagnoses indicative of disease) and those with already existing disease. Resource use and costs of both groups were compared with resource use and costs in populations of unaffected individuals.</p>

<sec id="sec3-0961203312474087"><title>Study design and subject identification</title>
<p>This study used a proprietary managed care organization (MCO) claims database affiliated with OptumInsight. Eligible subjects were enrollees consisting of approximately 35 million commercially insured members with medical and pharmacy benefits during the study period from 2003–2008 (and approximately 14 million total covered lives per year). The MCO provided full insurance coverage for physician, hospital, and pharmacy services. Individuals covered by the health plan were from geographically diverse regions of the United States. Previous studies have validated the use of claims-based algorithms to identify disease in a database affiliated with this MCO, and we have previously described identification of patients with SLE using this database.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0961203312474087">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0961203312474087">24</xref></sup> Although the use of such an algorithm to identify patients with SLE in this database has not been validated, studies in other databases have demonstrated that claims-based algorithms could identify patients with lupus nephritis and other chronic medical conditions (such as arthritis).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0961203312474087">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0961203312474087">26</xref></sup></p>
<p>The earliest date of service of a medical claim with a diagnosis code for SLE from 01 January 2003 through 31 December 2008 that satisfied the inclusion criteria was defined as the index date for the newly diagnosed SLE cohort. The following criteria were used for inclusion of newly diagnosed subjects: 1) the subject was at least 18 on the date of service (index date); 2) the subject was continuously enrolled with medical and pharmacy benefits for 24 months prior to and 12 months following the date of service; 3) in the 12 months following the date of service the subject had <italic>either</italic> 3a) evidence of at least one inpatient claim with a SLE diagnosis (ICD-9-CM 710.0x) <italic>or</italic> 3b) two or more office or emergency room visits (combinations allowed) at least 30 days apart, but not more than 365 days apart, with a diagnosis code for SLE (where the first visit occurred during the same calendar year as the date of service); 4) the subject had no claims with a diagnosis for SLE in the 24 months prior to the date of service; and 5) the subject had no claims for antimalarials, systemic corticosteroids, methotrexate, azathioprine, or mycophenolate mofetil for 12 months prior to the date of service. Existing SLE was captured for each calendar year between 2003 and 2008 using the same inclusion criteria as for newly diagnosed SLE, with the exception of requirement numbers 4) and 5) above, and only required 12 months of continuous enrollment prior to the service date. An index date for subjects with existing disease was assigned randomly from all qualifying service dates between 2003 and 2008. An instance of existing SLE required that the date of service occur in the calendar year of interest. Subject information in the database was reviewed back to the year 1999, and subjects with evidence of SLE from 2000–2002 (per the above criteria) were excluded from the cohort of newly diagnosed subjects (but not from the existing disease cohort).</p>
<p>Age, gender, and geographic region (Northeast, South, West, or Midwest) were captured from enrollment data based on the SLE claim associated with the earliest of all qualifying service dates. Comorbidities were identified based on the presence of diagnosis and/or service codes on medical claims during the one year prior to (but not including) the index date. A Quan–Charlson comorbidity score was calculated using pre-index comorbidities.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0961203312474087">27</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-0961203312474087"><title>Matching</title>
<p>SLE subjects were matched via stratified matching to controls, which consisted of commercial health plan enrollees without evidence of SLE. To be eligible for selection, controls were required to be age 18 or older as of the year of index date, to have at least one office visit from 01 January 2003 through 31 December 2008, to have continuous enrollment with medical and pharmacy benefits for at least 24 months during 2003 through 2008, and to have no diagnosis claims for myositis (ICD-9-CM 710.3, 710.4, 728.81), systemic sclerosis (ICD-9-CM 710.1x), or SLE (ICD-9-CM 710.0x) between 2003 and 2008. The requirement to have no diagnosis claims for other connective tissue disorders was imposed in order to avoid a confounding effect on the results, as they tend to overlap with SLE and can be misclassified. For controls, an index date was selected randomly from among all dates within each subject’s enrollment period in such a way to ensure that the subject would have at least one year of pre- and post-index enrollment. For example, consider a control subject with a 30-month enrollment period; the index date for this subject would be randomly chosen from the ‘middle’ 6 months of their 30-month enrollment period. This process would guarantee that a subject would be continuously enrolled for 12 months pre- and post-index, and hence maximized the number of case-control matched pairs that satisfy the enrollment criterion. SLE subjects were matched via stratified matching to eligible controls in a two-step process. In the first step, SLE subjects were matched to controls using a ratio of 1:5 based on the following strata: index date ( ± 6 months); age ( ±5 years); gender; geographic region; and length of time on insurance ( ±5 years). In the second step, SLE subjects were matched to the subset of controls selected in the first step using a ratio of 1:3, based on the pre-index Quan–Charlson comorbidity score ( ±1.0). Subjects that could not be matched to five controls in step 1 or to three controls in step 2 were excluded. To check the quality of the match, bivariate comparisons of comorbid conditions (between SLE subjects and controls) were performed using logistic regression. The correlated nature of the matched data was accounted for using generalized estimating equations (GEEs) assuming an exchangeable correlation matrix. Reported <italic>p</italic>-values were based on Wald tests. Also, we performed an empirical comparison between all SLE patients identified and those that we were able to match, and we found that characteristics between the groups were similar.</p>

<sec id="sec5-0961203312474087"><title>Resource utilization and costs</title>
<p>Health care resource utilization and costs were measured for the one year post-index period (including the index date) for each subject. Health care resource utilization was operationalized as the numbers of the following: ambulatory visits, emergency department visits, and inpatient admissions. The average length of all inpatient stays was also calculated. Evidence of services rendered by specific physician specialties (rheumatologist, dermatologist, neurologist, or nephrologist) was captured. Evidence of use of selected procedures (diagnostic services or durable medical equipment) was determined; these procedures may have occurred during ambulatory visits, emergency department visits, or inpatient admissions. Medications that could be used to treat SLE were identified from pharmacy claims (using National Drug Code (NDC) code bundles) and medical claims (using appropriate Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System (HCPCS) codes submitted by individual providers which use the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA)-1500 or Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS)-1500 formats or for facility services submitted by institutions, which use the Uniform Bill (UB)-82, UB-92, UB-04, or CMS-1450 formats). Health care costs were computed as the combined health plan and patient paid amounts; in addition, payments from Medicare (or other payers) were estimated based on coordination of benefits information obtained by the health plan, and these estimates were incorporated into the total paid amount. The following cost variables were calculated: total costs, pharmacy costs, medical costs. Medical costs were further broken down into ambulatory costs, emergency services costs, inpatient costs, and other medical costs. Procedures, drug dispensings, and doctor visits that occurred during an inpatient admission were included in the costs for that admission (the same applied to costs incurred during an emergency department or ambulatory visit). Costs were adjusted to 2009 US$ using the annual medical care component of the Consumer Price Index.</p>
<p>Bivariate comparisons of resource utilization and costs were compared between SLE subjects and controls using logistic regression for binary variables and a general linear model for continuous variables. The correlated nature of the matched data was accounted for using GEEs with an exchangeable correlation matrix. Reported <italic>p</italic>-values for both types of variables were based on Wald tests and did not adjust for other covariates. In addition to the bivariate comparison, overall total health care costs were also modeled with a generalized linear model (GLM) using a gamma distribution. The natural logarithm of the mean overall total health care cost was modeled as a linear function of indicator variables for cohort (case vs. control), gender (male vs. female), evidence of renal failure, evidence of osteoporosis or avascular necrosis, evidence of central nervous system involvement (psychosis or seizures), evidence of cardiovascular involvement, evidence of use for each of the following select medications (antimalarials, corticosteroids, methotrexate, azathioprine, cyclophosphamide, mycophenolate mofetil, or rituximab) and categorical index year, age, and region. GEEs with an exchangeable correlation structure were used to account for correlation of matched observations. Wald theory significance tests and confidence intervals were reported for the GEE estimates.</p>

<sec id="sec9-0961203312474087" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this retrospective claims-based analysis of a diverse sample of subjects with adult SLE, we found average annual post-index costs (inclusive of both pharmacy and medical costs) were $19,178 for subjects newly diagnosed with SLE and $15,487 for subjects with existing SLE. Compared with unaffected controls, average annual costs of SLE subjects were approximately three to four times higher, and after adjusting for patient characteristics and comorbid conditions and/or organ-specific complications, the cost ratios of SLE subjects to controls were about 2:1. Because the GLM adjusts for comorbid conditions, the cost ratio predicted by the GLM may not be as clinically meaningful as the average annual unadjusted costs. By adjusting for organ involvement likely due to SLE, the cost ratio expresses the differential cost for lupus patients vs. non-lupus patients, without adding the costs of organ involvement. As SLE patients in the real world often have other comorbid conditions or organ involvement, the cost ratio alone therefore likely underestimates the true cost of SLE. However, the cost ratio does provide a way of understanding the cost across the spectrum of disease in absence of variables for severity (for example, if a patient has SLE and renal disease, then one would need to consider the cost ratios of both the SLE variable and the renal disease variable to understand how much such a patient would cost).</p>
<p>These results demonstrate that subjects with SLE incur high medical costs compared with unaffected controls. Inpatient costs (annual average = $9504 per subject) appeared to be the single largest component of medical costs among newly diagnosed subjects, whereas ambulatory costs were the largest component of costs for subjects with existing disease (annual average = $5921 per subject). A potential explanation for this could be that newly diagnosed patients present to physicians with uncontrolled and more active disease or flares, which triggers a more aggressive treatment strategy requiring inpatient admission.</p>
<p>Measures of health care resource utilization were compared between SLE subjects and matched controls during the post-index period. In general, health care resource utilization and numbers of claims for medications were higher among both newly diagnosed and existing SLE subjects than matched controls. Whereas newly diagnosed SLE subjects tended to have slightly higher average numbers of visits to health care providers than existing SLE subjects, subjects with existing SLE tended to have slightly higher average numbers of medication claims than newly diagnosed subjects. This may be because incident subjects require a more intensive work-up for diagnosis and to initiate appropriate management. Over half of existing SLE subjects had claims for antimalarials and systemic corticosteroids. Evidence of claims for systemic corticosteroids was associated with significantly higher overall medical costs, whereas evidence of claims for antimalarials was associated with significantly lower overall medical costs. These results suggest that use of steroids may be a surrogate for more severe disease and antimalarials alone may be a surrogate for milder disease.</p>
<p>A high burden of comorbidities was observed among SLE subjects, particularly among subjects with existing SLE. Rates of renal failure, neuropsychiatric disease, and cardiovascular disease were significantly higher among existing SLE subjects than controls. These serious complications have previously been reported to affect individuals with SLE.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0961203312474087">4</xref></sup> Multivariate analysis performed in the present study demonstrated that evidence of renal failure, neuropsychiatric disease, atherosclerosis-related conditions, and cardiovascular disease were each associated with an increase (by about two- or threefold) in overall health care costs. Therefore, as anticipated, organ involvement or presence of complications of disease among SLE subjects likely has an important impact on overall health care costs.</p>
<p>Several previous studies have examined the costs of subjects with SLE in the USA. A retrospective study by Carls et al., using administrative claims data from 2000–2005 in commercial enrollees, found that SLE subjects had mean annual medical expenditures of $19,502, as compared with $7264 among matched controls (2005 dollars).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0961203312474087">20</xref></sup> The current study is similar in design to the study by Carls et al. and the results are similar with those of the Carls group;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0961203312474087">20</xref></sup> however, we examined costs in both newly diagnosed SLE subjects and SLE subjects with existing disease, as opposed to just newly diagnosed/newly active subjects. Li et al., in a retrospective study using Medicaid data from 1999–2005, reported mean annual medical costs of $16,089 in the first year following diagnosis of SLE and $23,860 five years after diagnosis (2006 dollars).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0961203312474087">18</xref></sup> Whereas Li et al. studied a sample of Medicaid subjects,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0961203312474087">18</xref></sup> the sample in the present study was comprised of commercially insured members in a MCO, which may have better access to care and therefore could be healthier than the Medicaid population. Poor access to care in Medicaid patients may lead to uncontrolled disease in the long term and higher costs, opposed to findings from the present study in a commercially insured population, where existing patients appeared to have slightly lower costs. Panopalis et al. reported mean annual direct costs of $12,643 (2004 dollars) for a cohort of SLE subjects, and this is lower than our report and other estimates based on administrative data.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0961203312474087">18</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0961203312474087">20</xref></sup> There are methodological differences between studies, as estimates of costs in Panopalis et al. were based on patient-reported utilization of health care services in the past year and subject to recall bias,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0961203312474087">19</xref></sup> whereas cost estimates in the present study were based on actual costs incurred based on medical and pharmacy claims data.</p>
<p>Previous studies have also reported on health care resource utilization associated with SLE. Li et al. and Carls et al. both reported that outpatient care represented the largest portion of overall annual costs among existing SLE subjects, whereas Panopalis et al. found that acute care hospital admissions accounted for the largest share of costs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0961203312474087">18</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0961203312474087">20</xref></sup> In the present study, we found that inpatient services were the largest contributor to annual costs in the newly diagnosed subjects, but ambulatory costs represented the largest portion of costs among subjects with existing disease. Yelin et al. performed a survey among a population of SLE subjects in a US health maintenance organization plan to estimate annual resource utilization.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0961203312474087">21</xref></sup> They found that 37.8% of subjects had an emergency department visit, 18.4% had a hospital admission, 18.4% had a nephrologist visit, and 27.3% had a dermatologist visit. We found that a similar proportion (34.73%) of subjects with existing SLE had an emergency department visit and dermatologist visit (24.37%), but a higher proportion was hospitalized (25.23%) and a lower proportion had a nephrologist visit (6.04%). Yelin et al. observed 52.3% of patients utilized antimalarials and 44.4% used oral steroids. We observed slightly higher use of these medications in subjects with existing SLE (antimalarials, 56.93%; systemic corticosteroids, 55.14%). Thus, type of coverage (commercial insurance vs. Medicaid), study design (claims vs. patient-reported vs. survey), subject identification methodology (newly diagnosed vs. existing vs. newly active) all could potentially influence reporting of resource use and costs.</p>
<p>Limitations related to claims data should be considered when interpreting the results of this study. The algorithm used to identify SLE patients in this study was not validated, and we could not ensure that a patient had SLE according to ACR classification criteria or identify the severity (mild, moderate &amp; severe) of disease in patients identified. It is possible that some subjects were misclassified as SLE patients and included in the study population; if these subjects had less expensive conditions, it may have underestimated the costs of SLE. Also, not excluding all connective tissue disorders (such as rheumatoid arthritis or fibromyalgia) from the control group may have underestimated the incremental costs of the SLE group. Because we were not able to obtain entire medical histories for subjects in the study, some patients with longstanding quiescent disease that became active (newly active) were misclassified as newly diagnosed rather than as existing SLE patients. Future studies in which subjects’ medical charts are reviewed could help validate the claims-based patient identification algorithm used here. Use of additional subject inclusion criteria, such as a requirement that subjects had a prescription for an SLE medication, could also improve specificity of subject selection. The findings from this study are most applicable to understanding disease costs in a managed care population, and the findings here may not be generalizable to other populations.</p>
<p>In addition, some questions that could not be answered in this study could be investigated in future studies. Indirect and intangible costs (such as costs due to lost time at work) were not evaluated in this study, but they likely contribute substantially to the economic burden associated with SLE. Effects of other mediators (such as compliance, socioeconomic status, or ethnicity) on SLE costs were not assessed here, and these could also be investigated in future studies. Another area that could be addressed in future research includes determining the economic burden of SLE among pediatric patients.</p>
<p>In conclusion, presence of adult SLE was associated with substantial resource use and a high economic burden in this large managed care population, relative to controls unaffected with SLE. Inpatient costs were the largest driver of costs among newly diagnosed subjects, and ambulatory costs were the largest cost driver among subjects with existing SLE. Evidence of organ involvement/serious complications and evidence of selected medications were associated with increased costs. These findings should lead to an improved understanding among health care providers and decision makers of the costs and resource use associated with adult SLE. The costs reported in this study are higher than annual costs reported for other autoimmune/inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, further underscoring the societal burden imposed by SLE.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0961203312474087">28</xref></sup></p>
