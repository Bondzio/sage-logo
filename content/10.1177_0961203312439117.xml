<p><bold>Background:</bold> The risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD), microangiopathy and prevalence of atherosclerotic plaques are increased in Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE). As systemic endothelial dysfunction is one of the earliest signs of these vascular outcomes in the general population we assessed skin microvascular endothelial function in SLE patients. <bold>Methods:</bold> Endothelial function in skin was tested with local application of acetylcholine (inducing endothelium-dependent vasodilatation) and any concomitant increase in skin perfusion was measured with Laser Doppler Fluxmetry (LDF) in 84 SLE-patients (83% women, mean age 47 years) and 81 age and sex matched controls. Common carotid intima-media thickness (cIMT) and plaque occurrence were also determined using B-mode ultrasound. <bold>Results:</bold> There were no significant differences in skin microvascular endothelial function between SLE-patients and controls. In the SLE group, endothelial function did not vary in relation to skin manifestations, Raynaud's phenomenon, nephritis or plaque occurrence. In SLE patients with CVD, however, endothelial function was impaired. <bold>Conclusion:</bold> Skin microvascular endothelial function is associated with CVD but not with early signs of atherosclerosis in SLE-patients. The endothelial function is not different in SLE-patients as compared to controls.</p>

<sec id="sec1-0961203312439117" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>In the 1970s, Urowitz and co-workers described for the first time the bimodal pattern of Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE), indicating that after the initial manifestations of SLE per se, complications such as cardiovascular disease (CVD) may develop.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0961203312439117">1</xref></sup> Since then, many studies have described factors which contribute to increased morbidity and mortality in CVD for patients with SLE<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0961203312439117">2</xref></sup>. Furthermore, accelerated atherosclerosis has been reported in SLE, more as increased prevalence of atherosclerotic plaques than as a generally increased intima-media thickness (IMT) which appears to be unchanged<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0961203312439117">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0961203312439117">3</xref></sup> or even decreased according to one major report.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0961203312439117">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>A combination of traditional and non-traditional risk factors appears to account for the increased risk of CVD in SLE. Among traditional risk factors, hypertension, renal disease and dyslipidemia are especially implicated, while the role of smoking is less clear. Among non-traditional risk factors, anti-phospholipid antibodies (aPLs) are of importance, predisposing to both arterial and venous thrombosis. Available data thus indicate that there are differences in CVD risk factors among SLE-patients as compared to the general population.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0961203312439117">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>Endothelial dysfunction has been reported to be related to CVD risk in the general population in many studies. Commonly used methods include flow-mediated dilatation (FMD) of the brachial artery.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0961203312439117">5</xref></sup> In early reports, a significant association was demonstrated between coronary artery endothelium-dependent responses to acetylcholine (ACh) and flow-mediated vasodilatation in the brachial artery, suggesting that the latter, non-invasive method could be of importance in assessing CVD risk.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0961203312439117">6</xref></sup> The role of endothelial function in microvasculature is less clear. However, vascular responses to ACh – which induces endothelium-dependent relaxation of vascular smooth muscle – have been determined by Laser Doppler Fluxmetry (LDF) in the skin circulation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0961203312439117">7</xref></sup> and yielded interesting results. For example, in young people with known risk factors for accelerated CVD later in life (hypertension, low birth weight, folate deficiency, diabetes and obesity), impaired microvascular endothelial function has been found.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0961203312439117">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0961203312439117">9</xref></sup> In addition, endothelial function of the skin microvasculature has been found to correlate to that in the brachial artery.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0961203312439117">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>The aim of this study is to investigate skin microvascular endothelial function in SLE patients and to assess any association between cutaneous endothelial function in SLE and early atherosclerosis and/or CVD.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec2-0961203312439117" sec-type="methods"><title>Patients and methods</title>
<p>In all, 84 patients (83% women) of the 114 patients with SLE according to 1982 revised ACR criteria<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0961203312439117">11</xref></sup> and who had participated in the SLEVIC (SLE Vascular Impact Cohort) study, and 81 of the 122 sex and age matched population based controls were included in this sub study. Baseline characteristics such as age, sex, disease duration, IMT and presence of plaque did not differ between those who participated in this study and those who did not. Of the SLE-patients 52% were treated with chloroquine, 61% with glucocorticoids and 9.5% with lipid lowering medication at the time for inclusion in the study. Antihypertensive medication was distributed to 43% as follows: angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE)-blockers 25%, angiotensin receptor-blockers (ARBs) 4%, beta-blockers 15%, Ca-antagonists 13%, diuretics 10%.</p>
<p>Details of the study protocol have been described previously.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0961203312439117">3</xref></sup> Briefly the SLE activity was determined with the Systemic Lupus Activity Measure (SLAM) and also with Systemic Lupus Erythematosus diseases activity index (SLEDAI). Organ damage was determined using the Systemic Lupus International Collaborating Clinics (SLICCs) damage index.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0961203312439117">3</xref></sup> Information regarding manifest CVD, defined as a history of ischaemic heart disease cerebrovascular accidents, peripheral vascular disease or claudication, was obtained by history taking and chart review as well as information about Raynaud’s phenomenon and nephritis. The investigations included laboratory assays, ultrasound examination of the carotid arteries and LDF.</p>
<sec id="sec3-0961203312439117"><title>Assays</title>
<p>Blood samples were collected between 07:30 and 10:00 after an overnight fast. The biochemical variables were determined by standard laboratory methods. Serum and cells were separately prepared in the laboratory before storage at −80°C. Insulin resistance was assed by calculating the homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) using the formula fasting insulin (µU/ml) fasting glucose (mmol/L)/22.5.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec4-0961203312439117"><title>Carotid B-mode ultrasonography</title>
<p>The right and left carotid arteries were examined with a duplex scanner (Sequoia, Siemens Acuson, Mountain View, Ca, USA) using a 6 MHz probe/transducer as described.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0961203312439117">3</xref></sup> The far wall of the common carotid artery (CCA), 0.5 to 1.0 cm proximal to the beginning of the carotid bulb, was used for measurements of the intima-media thickness (IMT). The IMT was defined as the distance between the leading edge of the lumen-intima echo and the leading edge of the media-adventitia echo. The mean values of the IMT and lumen diameter within the 10 mm long section were calculated.</p>
<p>Carotid plaque was defined as a localized intima-media thickening of greater than 1 mm and at least a 100% increase in thickness compared with adjacent wall segments. Plaque was screened for in the common, internal and external carotid arteries. Plaque occurrence was categorized as the absence of plaque, the presence of unilateral plaque, and the presence of bilateral plaque.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec5-0961203312439117"><title>Laser Doppler Fluxmetry</title>
<p>The studies were conducted in a dedicated microvascular measurement facility with stable ambient temperature (23 ± 1°C), and with no detectable circulating draught, with subjects lying supine and with both arms comfortably beside the body. Prior to the start of flux recordings, subjects acclimatized to room temperature for 20 minutes, during which the skin was prepared for the measurements. The subjects were asked to refrain from smoking on the day of study, and not to eat or drink coffee or tea for at least 8 hours before the investigation.</p>
<p><italic>Acetylcholine (ACh) iontophoresis</italic>. Our protocol was based on previously published protocols.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0961203312439117">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0961203312439117">10</xref></sup> An electrode iontophoresis chamber (with 30 mm total diameter, 8 mm height, and inner drug chamber diameter of approximately 10 mm) was attached to the dorsal side of the non-dominant hand between fingers 1 and 2, using a double-sided adhesive disc. The chamber held the laser probe vertically enabling the skin perfusion to be measured directly over the site of drug application. An indifferent electrode was attached to the forearm, 15 cm from the probe. The chamber was filled with 2% acetylcholine solution, 0.1 ml (ACh, acetylcholine chloride diluted in sterile water, Sigma-Aldrich, UK), which induces vasodilatation via endothelial release of nitric oxide. A PeriIont System 480-1 provided the direct current for iontophoresis. A thermostatic probe holder helped to stabilize the skin temperature at 32°C. Iontophoresis allows charged substances to cross the skin by means of a small electrical current. After a baseline recording of 2 minutes, ACh was transferred to the skin using an anodal current of 0.1 mA for 20 seconds. A cumulative dose-response curve was created by repeating iontophoresis of ACh six times at 60 s intervals between doses. The flux response to ACh was continuously recorded for 5 minutes following the final 6th stimulation dose. A Laser Doppler(LD) instrument (Periflux 5010 wavelength 780 nm) was used to measure perfusion changes during vascular provocations (Perimed AB, Stockholm, Sweden). The LD signal is proportional to the number and velocity of moving blood cells in illuminated superficial skin microvessels. The LD output is semi quantitative and expressed in perfusion units (PUs).</p>
<p>The study was approved by the Karolinska Institute research ethics committee and is in accordance with the Helsinki Declaration. All subjects gave informed consent before taking part in the study.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec6-0961203312439117"><title>Statistical methods</title>
<p>Determinations were dichotomized or determined as continuous variables as indicated. Data are presented as means (with 95% confidence intervals, CIs) or medians (with interquartile ranges, IQRs) depending on their distribution. Comparisons between groups were made with the Mann-Whitney U-test, median test or Student’s t-test. In order to evaluate any association between potential risk factors for atherosclerosis general linear models and analysis of covariance were used. To get a more normal distribution LD data were log-transformed. The univariate correlation between vascular response and continuous variables was assessed by Spearman correlation coefficient test. STATISTICA 9 was used for the statistical analyses.</p></sec></sec>
<sec id="sec7-0961203312439117" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title>
<p>The characteristics of the 84 patients and 81 controls are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0961203312439117">table 1</xref>. The frequency of hypertension and CVD was significantly higher in patients compared with controls and there were also significant differences in HOMA-IR, C-reactive protein (CRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and homocysteine levels. The lipid profile was significantly different in SLE-patients compared to controls: cholesterol (p = 0.05) and low density lipoproteins (LDL) (p = 0.004) were lower whereas triglycerides (TG) was higher (p = 0.044).

<p>As endothelial dysfunction is considered to precede atherosclerosis and most of the studies with LDF with significant results have been evaluated in younger people we further analysed LDF only in younger individuals. A cut-off level of 45 years or younger resulted in a group of 39 patients without CVD (except 1) and 27 controls. In this younger subgroup similar results were obtained to those in the larger group (data not shown). Similarly, excluding individuals with CVD did not change this finding (data not shown).</p>
<p>Next we looked at the SLE patient group and analysed whether MSPR differed between subgroups of patients. It was evident that patients treated for hypertension and those with CVD had significantly lower MSPR than those not treated for hypertension and those without CVD, respectively, as shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0961203312439117">table 3</xref>.

<p>The main finding in this report is that we could not determine any significant difference in endothelial response to ACh iontophoresis, measured by LDF, between SLE-patients and controls. Our finding confirms two smaller previous studies which also failed to find a difference in microcirculation determined by LDF as a measure of endothelial function in SLE patients as compared to controls.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0961203312439117">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0961203312439117">13</xref></sup> These findings thus imply that microcirculatory dysfunction is not a feature of SLE-patients as compared to controls. However, larger studies are needed to completely rule out false negative results due to small sample size.</p>
<p>LDF has also been analysed in other rheumatic diseases, with varying results. In rheumatoid arthritis (RA), microcirculation was preserved among newly diagnosed patients,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0961203312439117">14</xref></sup> though the situation for patients with longer disease duration is not known. In fibromyalgia, microvascular circulation was impaired,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0961203312439117">15</xref></sup> which was also the case in ankylosing spondylitis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0961203312439117">16</xref></sup></p>
<p>Previous studies on endothelial function as an early sign of CVD showed a correspondence between invasive and non-invasive methods. In 1995 Anderson et al. described a positive correlation between coronary vasoconstriction produced by ACh, as a marker of damaged endothelium, and impaired FMD in the brachial artery.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0961203312439117">6</xref></sup> Hansell et al. (2004) described a correlation between FMD and LDF after ACh ionthoforesis in healthy individuals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0961203312439117">10</xref></sup> though this finding was not confirmed in a later study.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0961203312439117">17</xref></sup></p>
<p>ACh is a vasodilator agonist used in studies to stimulate endogen production of Nitric oxide (NO). In the coronary artery ACh may lead to vasoconstriction of the smooth cells.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0961203312439117">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0961203312439117">19</xref></sup> ACh applied on the skin stimulates production of prostanoids and re-polarization factor.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0961203312439117">20</xref></sup> The cutaneous blood flow measured by LDF is regulated by endothelial, neuronal and humoral factors. ACh increases the endothelial production of NO, but the iontophoresis is produced by a current which has been reported to stimulate the neuronal mechanisms.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0961203312439117">20</xref></sup> However, the low current used in this case did not induce such an effect.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0961203312439117">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0961203312439117">9</xref></sup> Localization and dimension of the iontophoreses probe may also influence the results.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0961203312439117">7</xref></sup> Using our protocol, unspecific neurogenic vasodilatation in response to the current used for iontophoretic stimulation is unlikely, because we found no perfusion change during repeated iontophoresis with NaCl. Anodal iontophoresis must be used for longer periods with higher current strength and more concentrated ACh solutions to elicit axon reflexes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0961203312439117">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>The most commonly used method to determine endothelial function is FMD, and many if not all studies indicate that by use of this method, an impaired endothelial function is implicated in SLE.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0961203312439117">21</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0961203312439117">24</xref></sup> Other studies including our own could not determine a difference,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0961203312439117">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0961203312439117">26</xref></sup> though in our study, only individuals without previous CVD were included. However, in line with an impaired endothelial function in SLE studies exist using other techniques, but with similar results.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0961203312439117">27</xref></sup></p>
<p>We recently reported that atherosclerosis, as determined by prevalence of atherosclerotic plaques, is increased in SLE.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0961203312439117">3</xref></sup> Accordingly, in this study based on the same patient cohort but smaller, since not all patients were investigated with LDF, the prevalence of plaques was raised among SLE patients. IMT in general was not raised in our study in accordance with another large study,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0961203312439117">2</xref></sup> and was even decreased in one study.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0961203312439117">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>We and others also demonstrated that CVD in SLE is indeed associated with increased atherosclerosis, which does not exclude that some SLE patients develop CVD also as a consequence of thrombosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0961203312439117">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0961203312439117">28</xref></sup> However, we could not determine an association between atherosclerosis measurements and LDF, indicating that microvascular dysfunction is not an important sign of atherosclerosis which occurs mainly in large arteries.</p>
<p>In general, a combination of traditional risk factors, such as dyslipidemia, hypertension/renal dysfunction, and non-traditional risk factors, including inflammation (CRP), characterize SLE in relation to CVD. A novel finding from our group is that natural antibodies against phosphorylcholine (anti-PCs) are implicated in SLE and SLE-related CVD.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0961203312439117">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0961203312439117">29</xref></sup> In the SLE group, previously reported differences between patients with and without Raynaud's disease, as well as smokers, could not be confirmed. Whether this is related to the size of the study and statistical power could be determined in a larger SLE-study.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0961203312439117">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0961203312439117">13</xref></sup> Furthermore, we could not detect any association between medication, including chloroquine, and LDF. The only difference in response was between patients with and without CVD and with or without hypertensive medication, both groups having less favourable LDF-responses. This finding indicates that there is a disturbance also in the microvasculature in SLE-patients with CVD. We also found negative correlation between pack years and maximum skin perfusion response (MSPR), a finding in line with previous reports.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0961203312439117">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0961203312439117">13</xref></sup> Measurement of blood flow in the microcirculation as a response to ACh iontophoresis has yielded interesting results, when used in some studies on children (and mothers). This method has the advantage of being easy to use and also non-invasive. In literature associations between low birth weight, low maternal folate and impaired ACh response have been determined.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0961203312439117">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0961203312439117">30</xref></sup> Also in patients with diabetes a correlation between artery stiffness and impaired response to ACh in microvascular bed has been determined.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0961203312439117">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>In conclusion, we did not find a different endothelial function in SLE-patients as compared to controls. Skin microvascular endothelial function is associated with CVD but not with early signs of atherosclerosis in SLE-patients.</p></sec>
