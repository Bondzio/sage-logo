<p>There are beliefs and practices that can appear to non-believers to be idiotic beyond comprehension, and these are not infrequently to be found among those whom many would classify as fundamentalist extremists. Nachman Ben-Yehuda opens this book, <italic>Theocratic Democracy</italic>, with some examples. One of these is how Cohanim (Jews of the priestly lineage) flying out of Israel’s Ben-Gurion International Airport were advised to seal themselves into plastic bags as protection from contamination by the <italic>tum’ah</italic> (impurity emanating from the dead) in a cemetery over which the flight path would take them. As Ben-Yehuda (p. xii) comments, ‘Why or how the <italic>tum’ah</italic> could enter a high-altitude, sealed and pressurized aircraft, and then be incapable of entering a plastic bag within the aircraft, is not entirely clear.’</p>
<p>The consequences of ultra-orthodox beliefs can, however, go far beyond merely offering harmless amusement for non-believers. It can be frustrating for visitors and secular inhabitants alike that there is no public transport (even in plastic bags) available in Israel during Shabbat; it can be experienced as an outrageous violation of the rights of citizenship for Israelis who do not want to be involved in a religious ceremony that they have to leave the country to get married; it can be terrifying for those who find themselves being brutally beaten because they are considered to have transgressed some diktat of the <italic>Haredi</italic> community.</p>
<p>This is a book about some of the beliefs, practices and influences of Israeli <italic>Haredim</italic>, ultra-orthodox Jews who have grown from roughly 1 percent of the population in 1948 (the year of Israeli independence) to around 11 percent by the turn of the century. Although there are notable variations in the beliefs and practices to be found among <italic>Haredim</italic>, their lifestyle can be described in general terms as one that is rigidly and totally controlled by their understanding of the Word of God. Strict rules determine what they should wear, what they can eat, where they can live, whom they can marry, what schools they can attend, what they can be taught, what rituals they must perform and, perhaps most significantly, what they can think. Reports about the abuse of women are not uncommon, yet if a woman complains that she has been raped she faces shame and possible excommunication, which would involve her being shunned and cut off from her family and the only life she has known – and, perhaps, fearful that eternal damnation awaits her.</p>
<p>It is sometimes surprising for gentiles to discover that ultra-orthodox Jews are virulently opposed to the Zionist movement that resulted in Israel freeing itself from the British mandate. That, they believe, was a task that should have been left to the Almighty. The misfortunes that befall Jews are, it has been claimed, the result of the sins of the Jews themselves: terrorist activities would cease if women were more modest, and ‘the Jewish victims in the Shoah were reincarnated souls of people who were sinners in their previous lives’. Nonetheless, thousands of <italic>Haredim</italic> rely for survival on state benefits, funded by the taxes of non-orthodox Jews; they themselves are too occupied with studying the Talmud to be in gainful employment – furthermore, their studies can excuse them from taking part in the military service that is compulsory for other Jews.</p>
<p>Not that the <italic>Haredim</italic> confine themselves to passively studying Scripture or determining the minutiae of life in their own community. They believe it is their right and their duty to enforce their practices on the rest of the Jewish population, be these ‘ordinary’ orthodox, conservative, reformed or secular Jews. There are, moreover, numerous theocratic underground groups that have existed since the time of the founding of the state, and that have advocated and used ‘direct action’ as part of their attempts to convert Israel into a Jewish theocracy. ‘Modesty Guards’, vigilantes sometimes referred to as the <italic>Haredi</italic> secret service, maintain that they have a rabbinical legitimacy to use violence. Their objectives include preserving the sacredness of the Shabbat, opposing television, the Internet and video, ensuring modesty of dress and preventing male–female intermingling (with separate seats for men and women in buses) and any kind of illicit sex (including homosexuality). To such ends, they may engage in counselling, intimidation or violence, usually in the form of beatings, and they have been held responsible for more than one death.</p>
<p>Thousands of <italic>Haredim</italic> have demonstrated on a main thoroughfare, hurling stones and used diapers with human secretions at the police and calling them ‘Nazis’; large amounts of broken glass have been planted in places where soccer has been played on the Shabbat; cars driven on the Sabbath have been burned; a note attached to a grenade on a deli door read ‘those who sell pork meat in the holy land will die’; a sex shop in Tel Aviv has been blown up; and there have been plans to bomb the Dome of the Rock in Jerusalem. The story is told of a <italic>Haredi</italic> woman who was severely beaten by the Modesty Guards for giving refuge to a friend who wanted to divorce her abusive husband. Another story is of a <italic>Haredi</italic> man who had committed adultery; as the result of severe threats, his lover was reportedly persuaded to lure him to a forest where his sex organ was squashed and he was beaten to death.</p>
<p>The methodology employed for this research involved a constructionist perspective, which drew on a content analysis of a selection of <italic>Haredi</italic>, non-<italic>Haredi</italic> religious and secular newspapers on all items related to <italic>Haredi</italic> non-conformity and deviance for the period 1948–98. This resulted in 168 reports that could be said both to reflect and to have constructed a major component of the Israeli <italic>Kulturkamph</italic>. Ben-Yehuda is aware of the limitations and possible pitfalls of such an approach, and he also points out that, despite the wealth of stories presented in the media, these are likely to represent no more than a minuscule proportion of those that the police know about – let alone what is actually happening in the community. Nevertheless, he makes a convincing argument that this was the best available means of accessing material, especially the ‘out there’ common knowledge of what is going on. Furthermore, supplementary material was gained through direct observation of various public events and through interviews with former <italic>Haredim</italic> and others with direct knowledge of the <italic>Haredim</italic>.</p>
<p>Of course, what counts as ‘extreme’ and what as ‘liberal’, ‘normal’ or even ‘natural’ is relative to place and time. History reveals all too clearly that one person’s taken-for-granted sacred truth is another person’s ridiculous gobbledygook rubbish. Israel has long been a land of paradoxes and contradictions; one can find ancient and modern; squalor and elegance; richness and poverty; fertility and sterility; sacred and secular – and a theocratic democracy.</p>
<p>Many people’s immediate reaction might be that a theocratic democracy is an oxymoron – but democracy allows the extremist, and Israel has survived as a theocratic democracy for over sixty years. Ben-Yehuda argues that theocrats and democrats should be seen not as discrete entities, but as two diametrically opposed ends of a single continuum: ‘the two opposing symbolic-moral universes depend on the other for the very definition of their boundaries’ (p. 200). Within the Israeli context, at one end of the continuum we find democratic themes such as free and regular elections, more than one party, changes of regimes, separation of authorities and diffusion of power. At the other end we find theocratic themes concerning issues such as marriage, divorce, food, public transportation, geographic separation of communities, conversion to Judaism, and power and influence in the political scene.</p>
<p>There are, of course, constant tensions and constant compromises: the non-<italic>Haredi</italic> majority have increasingly found themselves subjected to laws imposed on them against their wills by the <italic>Haredi</italic> minority. A 2001 survey revealed that most Israelis wanted public transportation on Shabbat, civil marriages, that yeshiva students should be drafted and that businesses should be allowed to open on Shabbat if they wanted. At the same time, the <italic>Haredim</italic> are constantly thwarted in their endeavours to create a pure theocratic state. It has been shown over and over again that this is an explosive situation, possibly as threatening to the future of Israel as the geopolitical tensions of the region. Ben-Yehuda’s conclusion is that the conflict which arises within such a theocratic democracy ‘can be managed, mitigated and handled, but it cannot be “solved” at a reasonable social price’ (p. 211).</p>
<p>That, however, does not mean that we cannot learn more about the beliefs and practices that can feed into such conflicts, and recognize the processes that result from such beliefs and practices. <italic>Theocratic Democracy</italic>, which deservedly received the 2011 Distinguished Book Award of the American Society of Criminology’s Division of International Criminology, goes a long way in enlightening our understanding of the situation in contemporary Israel. It is a fascinating and informative book. To say that it raises more questions than it answers is not to condemn it, but to recommend it.</p>
