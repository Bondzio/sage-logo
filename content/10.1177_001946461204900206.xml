<p>This fine work has emerged from the realisation over a decade ago that ‘the flag was a distant, marginal object for Indian historiography, whose concerns lay elsewhere’ (p. 311). This realisation has led Arundhati Virmani into a rigorously researched and finely textured exploration of the transformation of a ‘mere piece of coloured cloth’ (p. 184) into a potent political symbol, even focus of idolatry, over a century of so from 1902 into our times. As with so much else in colonial India, the history proper of the Indian national flag begins with a handful of British men who first broached the need for a distinctive banner to represent India during the coronation ceremonies of Edward VII in 1903 in London (Chapter 1). Nothing much came out of this, although Virmani’s exploration shows the display here as well of the colonial penchant for ordering, classifying and singularising a diverse field of pennants and colours and emblems that had historically been pressed into service among rulers, mighty and petty, in the subcontinent. Most revealing is her point that British administrative and scholarly reflections led to the association of certain colours with certain religious communities—red for Hindu, green for Muslim—as well as with certain symbols (the lotus, or the crescent moon). This colonial penchant is picked up by the earlier fashioners of the flag in Bengal and the Indian diaspora around the heady days of the <italic>swadeshi</italic> movement (1905–1907) when a range of ‘failed’ experiments with flagging the nation were attempted by figures such as Sister Nivedita and Madame Cama (Chapter 2). Gandhi looms large in the history of the <italic>tiranga</italic>, his fundamental contribution being the shift away from sectarian symbols such as the lotus or the crescent moon to the spinning wheel. Yet at the same time, it is also clear from Virmani’s analysis that the Mahatma was compelled to take on the flag by other players—such as Pingali Venkayya, N.S. Hardikar—whose authorship of the ‘<italic>swaraj</italic>’ or Gandhian flag, and its popularisation through various secular rituals such as ‘the Flag Day’ celebration, is meticulously documented in Chapters 3 and 5. The year 1931 is another significant date when the three colours, order and symbol of ‘the national flag’ were authorised by the Congress party after a vigorous national debate: the chapter in which this is discussed, ‘Colours for a New Nation’, is one of the most innovative parts of this book as it leads us into a rich exploration of the semiotic, ritual and affective associations of various colours—red, saffron, ochre, green, white, black and blue—in the Indian symbolic landscape (Chapter 4).</p>
<p>Almost as soon as the <italic>tiranga</italic> with the spinning wheel came to claim for itself the capacity to represent the nation, it was challenged by the mono-colour green flag of the Muslim League which eventually morphed into the white-and-green flag of the state of Pakistan (Chapter 7), as well as by the flags of other groups who felt left out of the symbolic economy of the Congress Party’s tricolour (Chapter 8). In contrast to the many complex discussions, even rancour, over the <italic>tiranga</italic> that marked the 1920s and 1930s, the debate in the Constituent Assembly over the national flag was relatively straightforward with little or no challenge to the substitution of the <italic>chakra</italic> for the <italic>charka</italic>, with no change in either the colours or their order (Chapter 8). Ironically, the decades following 1947 led to the imposition of a ‘regime of restraint’ on the flag with all manner of constraints placed on its use and celebration by India’s citizenry, including the formulation of a fairly draconian ‘flag code’, which has only recently been questioned (Chapter 9). Almost a hundred years after discussions about the need for a distinctive Indian flag surfaced in 1902 in elite colonial circles, the Supreme Court of India in January 2004 ‘recognized that the right to fly the national flag freely on all days was a fundamental right of citizens’ (p. 303).</p>
<p>This rigorous work offers us more than a history of the flag, important though that is. It is also a sustained attempt to engage, as a historian, with the economy of emotions—passions ranging from love and attachment to rancour bordering on hatred—which lies at the heart of the creation of the nation as an imagined community of shared sentiments. The author takes pains to draw out the affective registers in which attachment to the flag developed over the course of a century, and hence charts new ground in essaying for us an ‘emotional’ history of India, a history that takes seriously claims such as Nehru’s that when we see our flag, it produces ‘a tingling in our veins’ (p. 204). Virmani also attempts to write the history of a material object—one that also turns into a potent symbol, a focus for a new innovative rituals, and repository of values—although she uses a rather conventional approach to chart its biography as a linear, almost teleological unfolding. In fact, this reader is struck by the fact that the author has not reflected at all on the evocative ‘bazaar’ image that adorns her book’s cover that possibly charts for us an alternate history of the flag in a decidedly un-linear manner—1931, 1907, 1906, 1916, 1921, 1947, if we read from left to right!—and one which sees it emerging in dialogue with the figure of Bharat Mata (Mother India) and the map of India on which she is seated, connections that Virmani hardly explores in this study. I wonder what the history of the flag might look like if the visual claims of this image—and many others like it—are taken seriously. Finally, because this book is undoubtedly going to become the authoritative new history of the Indian flag, a few infelicities that have crept in should be flagged, such as the erroneous claim that red is the colour favoured by Brahmin/Hindu widows in south India (p. 118, 129); the confusing dates offered for the commencement of Flag Day celebrations (87, 90, 162–63), and the incorrect manner in which the illustration that appears in the colour plate I is reproduced. These quibbles aside, it appears that the Indian <italic>tiranga</italic> has finally—and successfully—found its critical historian, and an empathetic chronicler, in Arundhati Virmani.</p>
