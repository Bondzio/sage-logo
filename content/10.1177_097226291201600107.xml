<p>Economic development has always taken place in capitalist and mixed economies amidst various social conflicts and the hue and cry of politicians. Any development process involves the exploitation of natural and human resources. Development brings in profitability and surplus generation in an economy but the trickle down effect to the bottom of the pyramid may not happen immediately. Rather such trickle down effect is observed after a sufficient lag period. However the immediate challenges of a society lie in the various disturbances of livelihood caused by any initiative towards economic development. The issues that crop up during the transition phase are the real challenges of development.</p>
<p>This problem is even more pronounced in extractive industry. This industry causes destruction and exploitation of natural resources. Land is the major requirement of such industry causing relocation and rehabilitation of people. The social conflict begins here. Not only that, the extractive industry creates environmental hazards like ground water contamination and pollution, leading to various health problems.</p>
<p>Various books on extractive industry have addressed the issues of sustainable development, gender bias, Corporate Social Responsibility, etc. This book addresses the case of extractive industry from a different perspective. The book presents research papers exploring in their own ways, the hypothesis that conflict over resource extraction may lead to progressive institutional change. The studies are based on extractive industries in various economies of South America. They present in a subtle manner, the relationship between social conflicts, institutional changes and role of political economy during an economy’s development process. On one hand, there are case studies which show that pressures from various stakeholders have led to policy reforms on the extraction industry. This has in turn led to successful institutional reforms. On the other hand, some case studies in the book identify missed opportunities of progressive change. Various studies on the political economy challenges and threats posed by the development of such industry have been discussed very well in the book.</p>
<p>The book has been divided into three broad sections:</p>
<list id="list1-097226291201600107" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Political economies of extraction</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Conflicts, transformation and institutional change</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Conclusions and Comparisons</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>The chapters in the first section analyze at length, country studies on the relationship of political economy and extractive industry, putting emphasis on the governance issue of extractive industry and the evolution of uneven social movements and political mediation of various South American states. The analyses of political economy covers comprehensively all the major issues. The second chapter identifies the political economy challenges like trade off between investment attraction and long run development, management of exchange rate, environmental well-being and similar such features in Peru, Bolivia and Ecuador in discussing the management of extractive industries. Based on their empirical studies of these three countries, the authors have shown that the various capacity building exercises in mitigating each such political economy challenge may lead to various possible institutional forms in terms of fiscal institution, central and local government, various agencies, advisory committees, civil society organizations and NGOs. Following these analyses, this paper identifies the gaps in the various governmental initiatives in all the three countries despite their differences in history, geological resources and political economy. The third chapter presents a description of political and social movements of these three countries and analyzes how these political intermediation have deeply affected the extractive industry.</p>
<p>The second section is the crux of the book, trying to explore the relation between social conflicts and institutional changes. There are seven chapters that have explored this relationship in the mining industry and oil and gas extraction sector. Each study is unique in analyzing a range of social conflicts that led to various kinds of institutional changes in terms of some social movement or evolution of some new legal framework to mitigate the social conflicts. Overall this section covers almost all kinds of possible institutional changes that various South American economies have come across.</p>
<p>The first paper in this section is presented as chapter four of the book. It begins by presenting the ‘resource curse’ debate in the literature of social science and extractive industry. A. Bebbington in this chapter analyzes the social conflict in the mining industry in Peru with respect to a mining project named Rio Blanco. Rio Blanco project has been cited as a case study where institutional changes have occurred through coordination, learning and institutional innovation. The fifth chapter analyzes the conflicts in the mining industry of Peru from 2005 to 2008. New conflicts had emerged around rent, distribution of profits and mineral transfer. The conflicts had emerged between the local community and local authorities, between various levels of government and between administrative boundaries of neighbouring local governments.</p>
<p>Chapter six presents an analysis of social conflicts in Ecuador that led to an anti-mining movement against the State and multinational mining companies. The opening up of the mining industry has been the central issue of the mining policy debate in the country. In order to maintain the so-called national sovereignty, the local people’s interests affected by mining activities of Canadian MNCs were completely neglected. The authors conclude that institutional reform depends on the extent of regulations on MNC capital by the state and civil society organizations. D. Preston has presented another case study on mining in Pilcamayo Basin of Bolivia in chapter ten. Rural household responses to mining activities were analyzed. Responses were found to be indifferent towards mining due to the perception that rural farming is a function of weather and soil and not contaminated water. The earnings of households depend on seasonal migratory jobs for most part of the year and therefore the community is not well aware of the local health hazard issues that arise due to water contamination. To a reader it may seem odd that the author has selected such a sample where the rural respondents are indifferent towards mining. But Preston shows a case where absence of social conflict did not lead to institutional reforms.</p>
<p>Chapters seven, eight and nine analyze social conflicts in the hydrocarbon and oil mining industries. Chapter seven presents a case study on Chaco region of Bolivia, chapter eight presents the case of Ecuadorian Amazon in oil frontier, and finally, chapter nine presents the case of Camisean gas project in Peruvian Amazon. The seventh chapter discusses how the Bolivian government’s policies towards hydrocarbon expansion to generate state revenue on one hand and giving sovereign rights to indigenous land to the Guarani of Bolivian Chaco on the other hand, came in conflict with each other and deviated from their earlier policy of hydrocarbon expansion. In chapter eight, Laura Rival analyzes how social and ecological conflicts may lead to public policy debate. The chapter focuses on a protected area of Yasuni National Park beset with conflict between oil development and biodiversity protection that in turn led to a strategic innovative policy of protecting the park through a formation of fund. Chapter nine shows the conflict between local social movements and international NGOs surrounding hydrocarbon extraction. B. Pratt’s chapter shows that though indigenous movements are better organized at present to get some benefits, yet they lack the capacity to accrue any major benefits. The author further shows the case of missed opportunities due to a lack of state failure in recognizing the welfare needs of the citizens and lack of civil society organizations’ integration for productive welfare reforms.</p>
<p>The last section is a combination of a critical appraisal of these research papers and a concluding remark on the papers. These two chapters consolidate the various studies, compare them and finally caution the readers about the over-enthusiasm of the hypothesis that the social conflict will lead to progressive institutional changes.</p>
<p>This book has a subtle combination of dealing with practical social problems of development and rich academic insights. The complex development and welfare challenges in the emerging and underdeveloped economies of Latin America, that have implications for institutional changes, are well presented. In the process, it exemplifies the case of social conflict in South America showing that the same research work can be replicated for other developing and emerging economies of the world.</p>
