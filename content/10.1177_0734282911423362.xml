<abstract>
<p>The article introduces a new anxiety scale, called the LAOM (Lestvica anksioznosti za otroke in mladostnike [The anxiety scale for children and adolescents]) for measuring self-reported multidimensional anxiety. The scale has been developed with a special focus on the school setting, using one sample from an elementary school which is representative of fourth- and eighth-grade students in Slovenia (<italic>N</italic> = 10,427) and two secondary samples from secondary schools (<italic>N</italic> = 1,406; <italic>N</italic> = 3,253) which are representative of final-year secondary school students in Slovenia. The exploratory (PCA) and confirmatory analyses (CFA) were performed on separate samples for the elementary and the secondary school students. The CFA confirmed that the items on the scale formed three factors which were related to the higher order factor. The structure was stable over different age groups. The scale demonstrated adequate internal consistency and sensitivity. Validity tests are presented in their preliminary forms and will be elaborated upon in future research.</p>

<p>Childhood and adolescence are crucial developmental stages in terms of the development of problems linked to anxiety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0734282911423362">Lowe, &amp; Raad, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0734282911423362">Stallard, 2009</xref>). Anxiety is defined as a multidimensional response with a focus on the emotional, cognitive, and behavioral domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0734282911423362">Lowe &amp; Raad, 2008</xref>). Some researchers have added the physical domain to this list (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0734282911423362">Carr, 1998</xref>). The emotional aspect of anxiety consists of negative feelings, most commonly referred to as fear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0734282911423362">Craig &amp; Dobson, 1995</xref>). The individual is not usually aware of the reasons behind this fear and the negative feelings they experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0734282911423362">Rowan &amp; Eayrs, 1987</xref>). The behavioral domain offers us the opportunity to actively respond (e.g., withdrawal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0734282911423362">Stallard, 2009</xref>); restlessness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0734282911423362">Huberty, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0734282911423362">Silverman &amp; Treffers, 2001</xref>), and clinging on to familiar people and situations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0734282911423362">Silverman in Treffers, 2001</xref>). The cognitive domain includes worries and other cognitive problems, such as problems with decision making, attention, memory, cognitive distortions, oversensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0734282911423362">Craig &amp; Dobson, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0734282911423362">Huberty, 2005</xref>), and negative self-talk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0734282911423362">Craig &amp; Dobson, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0734282911423362">Huberty, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0734282911423362">Silverman &amp; Treffers, 2001</xref>). The physiological domain prepares the body to respond by increasing the activity in the autonomous nervous system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0734282911423362">Stallard, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>In the present study, we refer to the dimensional approach of measuring anxiety where anxiety is understood as a dimension, ranging from low to high intensity. This approach, which is frequently used in psychological theories of anxiety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0734282911423362">Kotov, Schmidt, Lerew, Joiner &amp; Ialongo, 2005</xref>), is valid and reliable for deriving conclusions based on gender and age differences, uses less expensive and simpler methods for gathering data from nonclinical samples and offers proof that anxiety is multidimensional and hierarchically structured (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0734282911423362">Olatunji &amp; Cole, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0734282911423362">Silverman &amp; Treffers, 2001</xref>). The most common dimensions of anxiety which can be found in the literature are emotional, cognitive, and physiological (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0734282911423362">Olatunji &amp; Cole, 2009</xref>). Anxiety can also be classified as state or trait anxiety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0734282911423362">Huberty, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0734282911423362">Lamovec, 1988</xref>). State anxiety exists in a transitory emotional state that varies in intensity and fluctuates over time, and it is connected to the level of stress in an individual’s life (Endler &amp; Kocovski, 2010; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0734282911423362">Grös Anthony, Simss, &amp; McCabe, 2007</xref>). Trait anxiety refers to a stable susceptibility or a proneness to being in an anxious state on a frequent basis. This disposition to experience state anxiety is described as a personal trait (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0734282911423362">Grös, et al, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0734282911423362">Kendall, Finch, Auerbach, Hooke &amp; Milkula, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0734282911423362">Hedberg, 1972</xref>). State and trait anxiety are positively related, and when anxiety is severe, prolonged, and frequent, it can turn into an anxiety disorder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0734282911423362">Huberty, 2005</xref>). There are at least six components of trait anxiety: social evaluation, physical danger, ambiguity, self-disclosure, separation, and daily routines. There are also at least two components of state anxiety: cognitive-worry and autonomic-emotional (Endler &amp; Kocovski, 2010).</p>
<p>Anxiety can be measured with physiological measures, behavioral observations, and self-report measures such as projection techniques and questionnaires. In clinical settings, clinical interviews are also frequently used to assess anxiety disorders. Self-report measures offer us the opportunity to assess anxiety in a given moment and to monitor it over time. Questionnaires and scales, as opposed to projection techniques, offer a greater level of objectivity, validity and reliability and are easier to use. For the review of commonly used measures for measuring anxiety in school-based populations, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0734282911423362">Lamovec (1988)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0734282911423362">Reynolds and Richmond (1978)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0734282911423362">Kendall (1998)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0734282911423362">Silverman and Treffres (2001)</xref>. According to the author’s knowledge, none of these scales have been designed to measure anxiety specifically in the setting of elementary and secondary schools. In schools, scales that are based on teacher ratings and peer ratings are also commonly used. Research has shown that the correlation coefficients between teachers’ and children’s evaluations are around 0.20 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0734282911423362">Epkins, 1993</xref>) and that the correlation coefficients between parents’ and children evaluations are between 0.27 and 0.59 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0734282911423362">Silverman &amp; Treffers, 2001</xref>). Similarly, classmates have been found to be unreliable when evaluating others who are similar to themselves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0734282911423362">Epkins, 1994</xref>).</p>
<p>The aim of the present study is to develop a psychometrically solid measure of self- reported multidimensional anxiety for use in schools. The items were based on all three domains of anxiety: emotional, behavioral, and cognitive. When developing the scale, we focused on anxiety in the nonclinical population, specifically elementary and secondary school students. There are two reasons why we decided to develop a new measure. The research literature (Ollendick, 1989, cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0734282911423362">Silverman &amp;Treffers, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0734282911423362">Widoe, Martins &amp; McNeil, 2006</xref>) shows that anxiety measurement is culturally biased. Intercultural comparisons often show significant differences in the structure of different measures of anxiety (Weisz &amp; Eastman, 1994, cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0734282911423362">Silverman in Treffers, 2001</xref>). Therefore, measures should ideally be developed in the surroundings in which they will be used. The other reason is our particular focus on the school setting. This scale is part of a research project aimed at evaluating the role of anxiety in schools and its relation to levels of achievement.</p>

<title>LAOM</title>
<p>Based on preliminary analyses in a sample of elementary school students (<italic>N</italic> = 300), we selected 21 items from the original 60 items. The original items were not a part of any other anxiety measures and are based purely on the signs of anxiety as listed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0734282911423362">M. Kocmur (1999)</xref>. The items measuring these signs are put into school context. The PCA of the original scale based on three different criteria (Kaiser-Guttmann criteria; Cattells’ scree test and parallel analyses) showed three components (emotions [<italic>E</italic>], worries [<italic>W</italic>] and decisions [<italic>D</italic>]). The items that were reliable (with their removal, the scales’ reliability would not increase), sensitive (high Q), and highly loaded (above .350) on these first three components were kept. The scale is a Likert-type scale (1 = <italic>never</italic>; 2 = <italic>rarely</italic>; 3 = <italic>sometimes</italic>; 4 = <italic>frequently</italic>; 5 = <italic>always</italic>) and is reliable (α<sub><italic>E</italic></sub> = .879; α<sub><italic>D</italic></sub> = .872; α<sub><italic>W</italic></sub> = .747).</p>

<sec id="section4-0734282911423362">
<title>STAI</title>
<p>The STAI (State Trait Anxiety Inventory) was developed by Spielberger, Gorsuch, and Lushene (1970, cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0734282911423362">Lamovec, 1988</xref>). The translated version of STAI-X2 (in translation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0734282911423362">T. Lamovec, 1988</xref>) is the commonly used measure for anxiety assessment in Slovenia. The norming sample consisted of psychology students (<italic>M</italic> = 47). It consists of 20 items on a four-point scale (1 = <italic>almost never</italic>; 2 = <italic>sometimes</italic>; 3 = <italic>frequently</italic>; 4 = <italic>almost always</italic>). It is reliable (test–retest coefficients with a time interval of 104 and in 20 days were 0.27 and 0.54 for men and 0.73 and 0.86 for women; for state anxiety they were 0.83 and 0.93 and for trait anxiety they were 0.86 and 0.92) and valid (<italic>r</italic><sub>MAS</sub> = 0.75; <italic>r</italic><sub>IPAT</sub> = 0.85) for measuring state and trait anxiety. The sensitivity coefficients range between 0.46 and 0.61 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0734282911423362">Hedberg, 1972</xref>). In our preliminary sample, the scale was shown to be reliable (α = .90).</p>

<title>Sample and Procedure</title>
<p>The scale was administered together with the TIMSS study (Trends in International Maths and Science Study). The TIMSS collects a rich array of background information which is interesting for our further research on factors relating to anxiety. The sampling process was adapted to the TIMSS in an elementary school population and to the TIMSS Advanced in a secondary school population. The target population for the TIMSS comprised fourth- and eighth-grade students (Sample 1) and for the TIMSS-Advanced, the target population was students in the final year of secondary school who were entering university (Sample 2 and Sample 3; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0734282911423362">Japelj Pavešić, Svetlik, Kozina, &amp; Rožman, 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0734282911423362">2009</xref>). Sample 1 consisted of 10,501 elementary school students, of whom 5,268 were female and 5,209 were male. Sample 2 consisted of 1,406 students, of whom 774 were male and 632 were female. Sample 3 consisted of 3,343 students, of whom 1,660 were female and 1,743 were male. Sample 1 had two age modules, nine years and 13 years, and Samples 2 and 3 had one age module of 19 years. The administration took place in a classroom setting following the TIMSS administration. The administrators were psychology students who were trained in administration, had basic psychometric knowledge, and were well aware of the importance of anonymity and the need for the participants to answer all of the items in the scale. There was no time limit for completing the scale.</p>

<title>Data Analysis</title>
<p>In Sample 1, the data were randomly split in half. The first half was used for the PCA and the second half for the CFA. In light of the expectation that several components of anxiety would be correlated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0734282911423362">Lamovec, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0734282911423362">Silverman &amp; Treffers, 2001</xref>), we used Oblimin rotation when conducting the PCA. To choose the number of final components, we used a combination of different criteria: Kaiser-Guttmann criteria; Cattells’ scree test and parallel analyses. The CFA was conducted with a structural equation program for data analysis to determine the adequacy of fit of the model proposed by the PCA. This technique solves a series of hypothesized regression equations to generate an estimated covariance matrix. This estimated matrix was then compared with the observed sample covariance matrix to determine whether the model fitted the data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0734282911423362">Byrne, 1998</xref>). The accuracy of the fit was evaluated using the χ<sup>2</sup>statistic, which gets smaller as the model fit improves. As the χ<sup>2</sup>statistic tends to be biased when using large samples, we used additional fit indexes: a comparative fit index (CFI), a Tucker Lewis index (TLI), a standardized root mean square residual (SRMR), and a root mean square approximation (RMSEA). Akaiki’s information criterion (AIC) was used to compare the fit of parallel models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0734282911423362">Byrne, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0734282911423362">Hu &amp; Bentler, 1999</xref>). To examine validity, we calculated the Pearson correlations between the scores from the LAOM and the STAI-X2. Based on our primary goal, which was to measure trait anxiety, we used the STAI-X2. As the samples used were elementary and secondary school students, STAIC would be appropriate but unfortunately, it is not translated and adapted for our language yet and the lack of instruments to measure children anxiety is one of the reasons for the construction of the new scale. Nevertheless, the STAI is normed in adolescents sample, therefore the use is valid in secondary school samples. Reliability was examined with measures of internal consistency (Cronbach’s α). All statistical analyses were carried out using SPSS v.18 and Mplus (Muthen &amp; Muthen, 1999).</p>

<title>Validity</title>
<p>The correlation matrix of the anxiety items in the first half of sample 1 (<italic>N</italic> = 5236) was subjected to PCA and Oblimin rotation (KMO = 0.963; χ<sup>2</sup>[210] = 6.119; <italic>p &lt;</italic> .001). The Kaiser-Guttmann criteria revealed three components which explained 53.19 % of the total variance, Cattells’ scree test revealed one principal component which was not followed by an obvious break in the eigenvalues function, and the parallel analysis showed a three-component solution. According to two out of the three methods used, we retained three principal components.</p>
<p>The results show that the scale measures <italic>E, W</italic>, and <italic>D. E</italic> consists of fear, tension, despair, and other negative emotions. <italic>D</italic> consists of difficulties in decision making and paying attention. <italic>W</italic> consists of worries and fears which are mostly related to external situations, authority, and school.</p>
<p>For Sample 2 (<italic>N</italic> = 1,406), the PCA and the Oblimin rotation (KMO = .944; χ<sup>2</sup>[210] = 1.348; <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001) revealed three components accounting for 55.1% of the total variance. Cattells’ scree test showed a one or three-component solution. Parallel analyses revealed a three-component solution. In the same way as in Sample 1, the scale measures <italic>E, W</italic>, and <italic>D</italic>. Overall, the content of the components was the same in both samples. Nevertheless, some of the items were related to different components in different samples. As our aim was to develop a scale to measure anxiety in elementary and secondary school students, in the final version, only the items that were loaded on the same components in both samples were kept. The final version consisted of 14 items. Factor loadings for both samples are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0734282911423362">Table 1</xref>.</p>

<p>The components were significantly related in both samples. In Sample 1, the correlation coefficients were: <italic>r<sub>EW</sub></italic> = .56; <italic>r<sub>ED</sub></italic> = .45; and <italic>r<sub>DW</sub></italic> = .34, and in Sample 2 they were <italic>r<sub>EW</sub></italic> = .52; <italic>r<sub>ED</sub></italic> = .48; and <italic>r<sub>DW</sub></italic> = .33. To test the assumption that the components in both samples would be highly related because of one underlying general component of anxiety, we used a second-order PCA for Sample 1 (KMO = 0.718; χ<sup>2</sup>[3] = 1.457; <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001) and Sample 2 (KMO = 0.718; χ<sup>2</sup>[3] = 1.457; <italic>p &lt;</italic> .001). As an input, we used the total number of items in each of the components. In Sample 1, the component loadings ranged from 0.764 to 0.877, and the second-order component accounted for 66.70% of the total variance. In Sample 2, the component loadings ranged from 0.872 to 0.926, and the second-order component accounted for 80.27% of the total variance.</p>
<p>The structure was analyzed with CFA for the second half of Sample 1 (<italic>N</italic> = 5265) and Sample 3 (<italic>N</italic> = 3343). Each item was constrained so that it loaded only to one factor using the results from the PCA from the first half of Sample 1 and from Sample 2. The model was designed to reflect the hierarchical structure of the three factor model (3F). As the PCA for both samples indicated a strong first component, a one factor model (1F) was also considered. The factor loading matrix was, in the 1F model, set to reflect loadings on one factor only.</p>
<p>The minimum fit function χ<sup>2</sup> test was significant (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .001) on both samples and in both models (Sample 1: 4F: χ<sup>2</sup>[74] = 1527.598, 1F: χ<sup>2</sup>[77] = 2926,894; Sample 3: 4F: χ<sup>2</sup>[74] = 1150,957, 1F: χ<sup>2</sup>[77] = 3004.239), which was expected given that the study was based on a very large sample (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0734282911423362">Hu &amp; Bentler, 1999</xref>). Other indicators, however, indicated that the hierarchical 4F model was a better fit (Sample 1: CFI = 0.946, TLI = 0.933, RMSEA = 0.062, SRMR = 0.033; Sample 2: CFI = 0.941, TLI = 0.928, RMSEA = 0.066, SRMR = 0.036 ) compared to the 1F model (Sample 1: CFI = 0.893, TLI = 0.874, RMSEA = 0.085, SRMR = 0.046; Sample 2: CFI = 0.841, TLI = 0.812, RMSEA = 0.107, SRMR = 0.060) and a slightly better fit overall for Sample 1. The models were also compared using AIC indexes indicating that the 4F model was a better fit (Sample 1: AIC = 196338.192; Sample 3: AIC = 96287.808) compared to the 1F model (Sample 1: AIC = 197731.488; Sample 3: AIC = 97009.156) in both samples.</p>

<p>The sensitivity of the scale was analyzed using descriptive statistics, sensitivity coefficients (correlation coefficients between the items and the corrected component scores), and the method of high and low groups on Sample 1 and Sample 3. The method of high and low groups meant dividing the samples into three groups according to the 33rd and 66th percentile on the component sums and comparing the mean values for each item between these groups. All of the mean differences were significant (<italic>p &lt;</italic> .001) with effect sizes (η<sup>2</sup>) in Sample 1 ranging from 0.280 to 0.555 and in Sample 3 from 0.328 to 0.612. The sensitivity coefficients were adequate in both samples (Sample 1: <italic>r</italic><sub>E- average</sub> = .64; <italic>r</italic><sub>D-average</sub> = .55; <italic>r</italic><sub>W- average</sub> = .53; sample 3: <italic>r</italic><sub>E- average</sub> = .64; <italic>r</italic><sub><italic>D</italic>- average</sub> = .56; <italic>r</italic><sub><italic>W</italic>- average</sub> = .54).</p>
<p>To test congruent validity, we administered the LAOM and the STAI-X2 together in the preliminary analyses (<italic>N</italic> = 300). The scales were significantly related (<italic>p &lt;</italic> .001). The highest correlation coefficient was established between the STAI-X2 and <italic>D</italic> (<italic>r</italic> = .42), followed by the coefficients between the STAI-X2 and <italic>W</italic> (<italic>r</italic> = .24), and between the STAI-X2 and <italic>E</italic> (<italic>r</italic> = .23).</p>
<p>As an additional test of validity, we tested for age and gender differences. The theory states important age and gender differences in anxiety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0734282911423362">Silverman &amp; Treffers, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0734282911423362">Stallard, 2009</xref>). The two-way ANOVA showed significant age and gender differences and the significant effect of interaction and was followed by one-way ANOVA separately for age and gender comparisons. The ANOVA (of Samples 1 and 3) showed significant (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .001) age differences (<italic>M</italic><sub>sample3</sub> &gt; <italic>M</italic><sub>sample2</sub> &gt; <italic>M</italic><sub>sample1</sub>) on the level of general anxiety and all three components (.052 &lt; <italic>η<sup>2</sup></italic> &lt;.94) and significant gender differences (<italic>p</italic> &gt; .001) for all of the components and the general level of anxiety in the eighth-grade students (<italic>M</italic><sub>females</sub> &gt; <italic>M</italic><sub>males</sub>; .005 &lt; <italic>η<sup>2</sup></italic> &lt; .014) but not in the fourth-grade students in Sample 1 or in Sample 3 (<italic>p</italic> &gt; .05).</p>

<p>For Sample 1, Cronbach’s α was adequate: α<sub><italic>E</italic></sub>= .862; α<sub><italic>D</italic></sub> = .708; and α<sub><italic>W</italic></sub>= .714. The same was established for Sample 3: α<sub><italic>E</italic></sub>= .878; α<sub><italic>E</italic></sub>= .732; and α<sub><italic>E</italic></sub>= .717. The reliability would have increased when one item from Sample 3 was deleted. As the difference in α would have been small (.002), we left the scale in its original form. The reliability would have also increased with the deletion of one item in Sample 3. With the deletion of these items, only two items would have been left for <italic>D</italic>, and therefore the items were kept as part of the scale.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The structure was first revealed in the preliminary analyses, and then confirmed in the present study using PCA and CFA. Our structure revealed two out of the three domains of anxiety: emotional (<italic>E</italic>) and cognitive (<italic>D</italic> and <italic>W</italic>). These components were present in both the elementary and secondary samples, and were significantly and positively related. The highest coefficients were found between <italic>E</italic> and <italic>W</italic>, followed by <italic>E</italic> and <italic>D</italic>, and then finally the coefficients between <italic>D</italic> and <italic>W</italic>. Second-order PCA followed by CFA confirmed one higher order factor of anxiety.</p>
<p>This multidimensional structure is congruent with other research results indicating that, at least in childhood, anxiety is multidimensional (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0734282911423362">Lowe &amp; Reynolds, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0734282911423362">Olatunji &amp; Cole, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0734282911423362">Reynolds &amp; Richmond, 1978</xref>). The different components of anxiety in childhood lead to different problems in adolescence and adulthood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0734282911423362">Olatunji &amp; Cole, 2009</xref>). Therefore, having a multidimensional evaluation of anxiety is crucial when investigating the development of anxiety over time and when planning an intervention. Most of this research is based on the use of the RCMAS scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0734282911423362">Reynolds &amp; Richmond, 1978</xref>) which measures worry/oversensitivity, physiological arousal, concentration, and the common factors of general anxiety. The RCMAS structure was found to be stable in different nonclinical samples of children, adolescents, and adults over a period of time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0734282911423362">Lowe &amp; Reynolds, 2000</xref>), and also in clinical samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0734282911423362">Olatunji &amp; Cole, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0734282911423362">White &amp; Farrel, 2001</xref>). The three-component structure was proven to be better compared to a one-factor structure and even a five-factor structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0734282911423362">White &amp; Farrel, 2001</xref>). The LAOM and the RCMAS show similar multidimensional and hierarchical organization, but there are some significant differences as well. For example, the oversensitivity section of the factor of worry/oversensitivity is congruent with the LAOM Factor <italic>E</italic>, and concentration is similar to our Factor <italic>D</italic>. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0734282911423362">Reynolds and Richmond (1978)</xref> put worry and oversensitivity in the same factor, and in our sample, <italic>W</italic> and <italic>E</italic> are highly correlated in both the elementary and the secondary school samples. Therefore, the possibility of a common factor is opened up for future research.</p>
<p>When conducting CFA, we tested the fit of the hierarchical 3F model and the 1F model. According to the limits set by Hu and Bentler (1998), the CFI, the TLI, the RMSEA, and the SMRMR CFA confirmed a three-dimensional hierarchical structure of anxiety in samples 1 and 3. Compared to the 1F model, the 3F model showed a better fit according to all of the fit indexes in both samples. The models were also compared using AIC indexes. The differences were not large, but indicated that the 3F model was a better fit. The results show a slightly better fit for the elementary school sample, possibly due to the fact that the preliminary analyses were conducted using an elementary school sample. CFA also confirmed the hierarchical structure of anxiety measured by the LAOM, which is in line with the findings of other authors who have researched the structure of anxiety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0734282911423362">Olatunji &amp; Cole, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0734282911423362">White &amp; Farrell, 2001</xref>). As the three-factor structure of our scale is thought to measure a common underlying construct of anxiety, the participants’ scores can be added together to obtain a total score, which indicates the participants’ overall level of anxiety in a school setting.</p>
<p>After defining the structure of the scale, we focused on its psychometric properties. Our results for both samples showed adequate internal consistency. Similar coefficients of internal consistency to ours were found in studies using the RCMAS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0734282911423362">Reynolds &amp; Richmond, 1978</xref>). Cronbach (1991, cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0734282911423362">Reynolds &amp; Richmond, 1978</xref>) evaluated coefficients of around .80 as adequate when measuring anxiety. High coefficients of internal consistency are important because other researchers will need to use a smaller sample size to detect meaningful differences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0734282911423362">DeVellis, 1991</xref>). We will conclude with validity which is, in a way, the most important psychometric property, as it establishes whether or not the scale actually measures anxiety as it was intended to. When developing the items of the scale, we included the characteristic features of all three anxiety domains (emotional, behavioral, and cognitive) to ensure the content validity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0734282911423362">Bucik, 1997</xref>). The construct validity was first tested according to the stability of the structure in both samples and with the convergent validity. The proof of convergent validity is a significant correlation between the LAOM and the STAI-X2. However, the coefficient was not high enough for us to say that both scales measure the same construct. Using the score for the LAOM, only 12% of the score for the STAI-X2 can be explained. A more detailed look shows us that the coefficients are higher between the cognitive components and the STAI-X2 when compared to the coefficients between the emotional components and the STA-X2. This offers additional support for the findings of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0734282911423362">Kendall et al. (1976)</xref>, that the STAI-X2 measures the cognitive domain of anxiety. Another point that we came across in the analyses of the structure is that the LAOM could be a measure of state anxiety. Our aim was to develop a multidimensional scale for measuring trait anxiety. Nevertheless, the content of the factors could indicate that the LAOM is more of a measure of state anxiety, for example, EMAS (Endler Multidimensional Anxiety Scales; developed by Endler, Edwards &amp; Vitelli, 1991, cited in Endler &amp; Kocovski, 2010) measures state anxiety and identifies two dimensions of the scale: cognitive and emotional. It could be that the students in our samples were more under the influence of state anxiety and not trait anxiety which could also be due to students having TIMSS test before completing the scale. To test weather our measure is a state or a trait measure, we intend to use test–retest method. High coefficients found using this method indicate trait measure (Zuckerman, 1976, in: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0734282911423362">Matthews, Deary, &amp; Whiteman, 2009</xref>). Nevertheless, the state and trait anxiety are positively and significantly related, therefore our scale has practical value for measuring anxiety in school setting as a state and as a trait measure.</p>
<p>Additionally, the sensitivity was adequate for detecting meaningful differences between students with different degrees of anxiety and its components. The validity was also tested with significant gender and age differences which are in accordance with the literature indicating important age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0734282911423362">Silverman &amp; Treffers, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0734282911423362">Stallard, 2009</xref>) and gender differences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0734282911423362">Chaplin, Gilham, &amp; Seligman, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0734282911423362">Silverman &amp; Treffers, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0734282911423362">Stallard, 2009</xref>). The search for validity will continue in our future research through the addition of related factors in a school setting and with the use of TIMSS data as well.</p>
<p>The study has several limitations. Given that the LAOM is a recently developed measure, additional studies are needed to provide further evidence of its reliability and validity. At his moment, the results are representative for three populations in Slovenia: fourth-grade elementary school students, eighth-grade elementary school students, and students in the final grade of secondary school. The application of the scale to other contexts in addition to schools is not of interest, as our aim was to develop a specialized scale for use in schools. Another possible limitation is the use of self-report methods. Nevertheless, some studies have shown that the construct validity of self-reports is superior to the validity of other measurement approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0734282911423362">Howard, 1994</xref>). Even with these limitations, the present data have adequate psychometric properties to enable the further development of the scale and its practical use in schools. The scale is easy to use, concise, and offers a measure with which to monitor anxiety in schools. We suggest the use of the scale as a screening tool to detect more anxious individuals and then continue with the more anxious individuals on more individual and clinical level.</p>
