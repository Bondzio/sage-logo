<p>Braided textile composites can be proper candidates for orthopedic applications due to their high structural load capacity. In a previous study, we used the 3D finite element method (FEM) to model a braided textile composite made up of poly <sc>l</sc>-lactic acid/bioactive glass (PLLA/BG). Micromechanical analysis showed that, in a volume fraction of reinforcement (V<sub>f</sub>) of 45% ± 1% (Mean ± SD), the elastic modulus and tensile strength of the composite were similar to those of the cortical bone. In the present study, PLLA/BG braided textile composite samples were fabricated with a V<sub>f</sub> of 45%. The bonding between matrix and reinforcement improved as a result of using aminopropyl silane. The prepared samples were subjected to tension and bending tests. Results showed a good agreement between FEM and experimental results. Bending modulus and bending strength yielded acceptable values similar to those of the cortical bone. It may be concluded that the PLLA/BG braided composite is a good candidate for load-bearing orthopedic applications.</p>

<sec id="sec1-0021998311431997" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Bone plates are usually used in long bone fracture fixation. Conventional bone plates are made of metals such as stainless steel, Co–Cr alloys, and titanium alloys. The major shortcoming of metal implants is their modulus of elasticity that is much higher than that of cortical bones and that causes stress shielding. This phenomenon is responsible for bone atrophy and osteoporosis under the plate.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0021998311431997">1</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0021998311431997">7</xref></sup> Another problem associated with the use of metal plates is their corrosion and/or accumulation of metallic particles in the vicinity of the implant that may alter osteoblast behavior even at sub-toxic levels, or at distant body parts including draining lymph nodes with likely allergic reactions in the spleen and liver.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0021998311431997">9</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0021998311431997">12</xref></sup> Moreover, metal devices cause artifacts in X-Ray radiography and magnetic resonance imaging, leading to visualization difficulties to monitor tissue regeneration.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0021998311431997">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0021998311431997">8</xref></sup> Therefore, a metal bone plate has to be removed via a second surgery after healing, especially in pediatric therapies. This has several risks such as infection, removal problems of jammed implants, implant migration, and the associated extra health care costs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0021998311431997">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0021998311431997">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0021998311431997">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0021998311431997">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>Polymer matrix composites are proper candidates to overcome the above shortcoming.<sup>2</sup> Taiton et al.<sup>3</sup> used a carbon/epoxy composite bone plate to observe that a good external callus developed which led to the union of the fractured bone.<sup>3</sup> Bradly et al.<sup>4</sup> showed that healed bone strength was related to plate stiffness. Healed bones, which were treated with plates having stiffness values of about 10–25% of stainless steel exhibited a much higher strength than those treated with stiffer composite plates.</p>
<p>Demands for high quality composite materials have focused attention on braiding. Braided textile composites are suitable for orthopedic applications because of their high structural load capacity under multiple loading conditions. For example they were proposed for some orthopedic applications such as prosthetic intervertebral disc, anterior cruciate ligaments etc.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0021998311431997">13</xref></sup> In braided textile composites, reinforcement yarns are continuously braided at a braiding angle. A wide range of mechanical properties can be achieved by controlling the volume fraction (<italic>V</italic><sub>f</sub>) and local and global arrangements of the fibers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0021998311431997">2</xref></sup> Hang et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0021998311431997">14</xref></sup> reported that by increasing the gap space between reinforcement yarns (decreasing the volume fraction of the reinforcement) effective modulus would be decreased. This manner was also observed for ultimate tensile strength of the braided composites. The effect of braiding angle on the mechanical properties of the braided composites was also investigated by Potluty et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0021998311431997">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0021998311431997">16</xref></sup> Results revealed that bending and torsional modulus would be increased by decreasing the braiding angle.</p>
<p>Another example of biomedical application of braided composites, braided carbon/PEEK composite bone plates, were fabricated and tested by Fujihara et al. Fujihara et al. studied the mechanical behavior, especially the elastic modulus and bending properties (due to their more important role in the healing process), of a braided Carbon/PEEK composite bone plate. Their study revealed that maximum bending strength of bone plate was achieved at small textile angles (less than 15°) and that it failed due to debonding of fibers. Their manufactured bone plate shows a bending stiffness about 70% of similar stainless steel bone plates.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0021998311431997">5</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0021998311431997">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>In addition to textile angles, volume fraction of the reinforcement has an important effect on the mechanical properties of composites. In our previous work, the volume fraction of the reinforcement in a partially resorbable composite was optimized using 3D FEM. The composite consisted of bioglass fibers (BG) with a braided structure and a braiding angle of 15° embedded in a poly <sc>l</sc>-lactic acid (PLLA) matrix. Results from micromechanical analysis showed that for volume fractions of 45%, the elastic modulus of the bone plate neared that of cortical bone. In this study, perfect bonding between the two phases was assumed for FE analysis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0021998311431997">17</xref></sup></p>
<p>Studies have shown that interphase also plays an important role in the overall composite properties and performance. It directly influences the ability of the matrix to transfer the load to the reinforcing fibers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0021998311431997">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0021998311431997">19</xref></sup> Coupling agents chemically react with both matrix and reinforcement, so that the matrix is bonded unto the encapsulated reinforcement. Organofunctional silanes, as coupling agents, are the most widely used in glass reinforced materials.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0021998311431997">20</xref></sup> An important parameter in the selection of silane is compatibility between silane functional groups with the polymer and reinforcement of the composite.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0021998311431997">21</xref></sup> In the case of PLLA/BG composites, γ-aminopropyltriethoxy silane could be a suitable coupling agent.</p>
<p>Silicon (Si) is the center of the silane molecule which contains an inorganic functional group, here amino, with a function group, here ethoxy. The functional group (amino) will be attached to the polymer matrix while the ethanol group will be attached to an inorganic material. As a result, the organic and the inorganic materials are tightly bound together upon heating.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0021998311431997">22</xref></sup></p>
<p>The present study aims to carry out experimental measurements of tensile and bending properties of PLLA/bioglass braided composites in order to assess the loading capability of the composite to be used as a bone plate. Tensile test was performed on both silane-treated and nontreated composite samples in order to evaluate how critical the role of coupling agent in mechanical properties is. The experimental results are then compared with those predicted by finite element method obtained in our previous work.</p></sec>

<p>The materials used include PLLA used as the composite matrix and bioactive glass fibers as the reinforcement. PLLA with an average molecular weight of 200,000 and an inherent viscosity of 3.3–4.3 dL/g was supplied by Boehringer-Ingelhaim Co. Germany (RESOMER® L 210 S). BG fibers (13-93) were purchased from MO-SCI Corp. BG composition was SiO<sub>2</sub> 53 wt%, Na<sub>2</sub>O 6 wt%, K<sub>2</sub>O 12 wt%, CaO 20 wt%, P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> 4 wt%, and MgO 5 wt%. γ-Aminopropyltriethoxy silane (APS) used as a coupling agent was purchased from Aldrich Co.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec4-0021998311431997"><title>Surface treatment of bioactive glass fibers</title>
<p>Matrix-reinforcement bonding was optimized to its near perfect level. A hydrolyzed APS solution was prepared by adding APS (1 wt%) to a solution consisting of 95 wt% ethanol and 5 wt% water. The BG fibers were dipped into the solution for 2 h and dried at ambient temperature before heating at 110°C for 10 min. The surface structure change of glass fibers before and after APS treatment was investigated using Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR-ATR) spectroscopy. A Bomen (Hartman &amp; Braun) MB-100 series FTIR spectrometer was used and the measurement range was from 400 to 4000 cm<sup>−1</sup>.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec5-0021998311431997"><title>Samples preparation</title>
<p>The required braided textures were fabricated with a braiding angle of 15°. Two types of samples were prepared: one with treated BG fibers and another with untreated ones. Then, a composite layer was prepared using the hand layup process. PLLA was dissolved in chloroform (10%w/v) for 4 h before being transferred to a PTFE mold. Bioglass texture was laid on the polymer layer and the mold was filled with PLLA. The fiber volume fraction in both cases was 45% ± 1% (mean ± SD). The layers were hot pressed (HP) at 130°C under 150 MPa for 40 min and slowly cooled in the mold in order to allow high crystallinity to form in the matrix structure. Based on the devised space for HP process, the single layers dimensions after the process were 60, 10.5, and 0.8 mm, in length, width, and thickness, respectively. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0021998311431997">Figure 1</xref> shows a single layer of the composite. Single layers were characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis to evaluate the crystallinity before and after hot pressing. Philips Expert MPD was used for this purpose employing Cu Kα radiation (at 40 kV, 30 mA and λ = 1.542 A°) with a secondary crystal monochromator. Data were collected over the range of 2θ = 10–80° using a step size of 3°/min.

<p>Five samples of each type of composite (treated and nontreated) were prepared according to ASTM D638-92. Tension test was performed using Hounsfield H50KS universal test machine at room temperature at a cross-head speed of 1 mm/min. The length, width, and thickness of the specimens were 60, 10.5, and 0.8 mm, respectively base on the stainless steel mold dimensions. Load–elongation data were recorded to determine the tensile strength and elastic modulus of the samples.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec8-0021998311431997"><title>Bending properties</title>
<p>Samples were prepared for bending test by placing three single layers (consisting of treated reinforcement fibers) in a stainless steel mold, with standard dimensions of Dynamic Compression Plate (DCP) of Osteosyntheses Co. The mold had six pins and braided fabrics were inserted into these projections to form holes in the bone plate without breaking the fabric. A pressure of 150 MPa was applied to the mold at 130°C until complete consolidation was achieved. The specimens were then allowed to cool slowly in the mold. According to the designed stainless steel mold for HP process after the process the length, width, and thickness of the specimens were 103, 10, and 3 mm, respectively.</p>
<p>The Hounsfield -H50KS- Universal test machine was used to conduct the static three-point bending test at room temperature and at a cross-head speed of 1.0 mm/min in accordance with ASTM D790. The plate was positioned in such a way that it was supported on the concave side and loaded on the convex side, as this setup would yield a lower moment carrying capacity. From the load–deflection curve, the bending modulus <italic>E<sub>b</sub></italic> and bending stress <italic>σ<sub>b</sub></italic> were derived using the classical beam theory as follows:

<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0021998311431997">Figure 4</xref> shows the representative stress–strain curves for both types of composites prepared. It is clearly seen that the silane coupling agent can greatly affect composite ultimate strength and elastic modulus. The fracture edge of the sample (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0021998311431997">Figure 1b</xref>) revealed that the applied load may be transferred to fiber yarns, fracturing the specimen due to fiber rupture. The bi-functional silane molecules act as a link between the PLLA and the bioactive glass fibers by forming a chemical bond with the surface of the glass through a siloxane bridge, while its organo-functional (amino) group bonds to the polymer matrix. This co-reactivity with both glass and polymer via covalent primary bonds gives rise to molecular continuity across the interface region of the composite. Moreover, using the silane coupling agent causes an interphase to form, which is completely different from the bulk matrix material. This region tends to have a higher modulus and tensile strength compared to the bulk matrix so that loads could be transferred from the matrix to the reinforcement via the interphase region to yield the highest values of modulus and strength.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0021998311431997">21</xref></sup>

</p>
<p>The average longitudinal strength and elastic modulus of the composite with silane coupling agent were 194 ± 3 MPa and 22.1 ± 0.2 GPa, respectively. These values are nearly the same as those of a cortical bone.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0021998311431997">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0021998311431997">27</xref></sup> According to Bradly et al., the strength of a healed bone depends on plate stiffness. They recommend a stiffness value of about 10–25% of stainless steel in order for a treated bone to obtain a much higher strength. Experimental results of the PLLA/BG bone plate used in this study shows that it satisfactorily meets Bradly et al.’s condition.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0021998311431997">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>The composite without fiber treatment showed a tensile strength of 121.7 ± 1.5 MPa and an elastic modulus of 14.3 ± .24 GPa, a value that lies in the lower range of the value recorded for a cortical bone (12–20 GPa).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0021998311431997">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0021998311431997">27</xref></sup> These results indicate a weak bonding between the two phases of the composite; hence, loads failed to completely transfer from matrix to fiber.</p>
<p>A comparison was carried out between the experimental results obtained from the present study and those predicted by FEM in our previous study,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0021998311431997">17</xref></sup> which verified the FEM results. In our previous work, the optimum volume fraction of the reinforcement required for having desirable values of elastic modulus and longitudinal strength in the PLLA/BG braided composite was determined by performing a micromechanical finite element analysis (A detailed description of the modeling and analysis is provided therein.). Briefly, a portion of a single layer of the composite, i.e. a representative volume element (RVE), was defined to suit a braided angle of 15° using the ANSYS software. A 10-node solid element 92 was used for meshing each constituent. Perfect bonding (gluing) was assumed between the tows and the matrix. On their interface, the size of the elements was set such that the interfacial reinforcement and matrix nodes would combine properly. Potluri et al. reported that ‘the response of an RVE to a given load is dependent on its position within the overall composite structure, RVE will have different boundary conditions depending on its through-thickness position’.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0021998311431997">16</xref></sup> In the previous study single layer RVE conditions were imposed.

<p>Finite element analysis was then performed on different models considering different <italic>V</italic><sub>f.</sub> responses of the model to a longitudinal small strain (10<sup>−6</sup>).

<p>To investigate the longitudinal tensile strength of the composite, a RVE with a <italic>V</italic><sub>f</sub> = 45% was modeled and boundary condition was applied on the <italic>Z</italic> = 0 and <italic>Z</italic> = −<italic>a</italic> faces (similar to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0021998311431997">Figure 5</xref>).

The load amplitude increased gradually until the stress in the RVE exceeded the stress limit of tow or matrix (initiation of failure). The global stress value was then computed for this particular force value and designated as the longitudinal tensile strength of the plate. This is because the plate is made from the same layer with a relative angle of 0° and perfect bonding between the layers was assumed. This procedure was also used by Potluri et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0021998311431997">16</xref></sup> to obtain mechanical parameter of a nonorthogonal textile composite. The tensile strength of RVE was determined at 202 MPa, which is almost the same as (or even greater than) the strength of the cortical bone in human radius (150 MPa).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0021998311431997">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0021998311431997">27</xref></sup></p>

<p>A difference of less than 5% is obviously observed between the predicted values and experimental results for the treated fiber composite, while it is about 40% for nontreated composites. This means that surface treatment of reinforcement can improve the bonding between the two phases to the near-perfect condition. Thus, the PLLA/BG composite is suitable for use in load-bearing orthopedic applications. Interface bonding and voids in the structures could be responsible for the difference between experimental and predicted values for the silane-treated group. The voids in the composite structure might lie either within the matrix or at the interface. Those lying at the interface play a more important role in diminishing the mechanical properties rather than those within the matrix. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0021998311431997">Figure 6</xref> shows the SEM image of a cross section of the PLLA/BG treated composite. It is clearly seen that there is a near perfect bonding between the reinforcement and the matrix; however, there are some small voids in the structure.

</p>
<p>Depending on such manufacturing process parameters as temperature, time, and polymer inherent viscosity, a lower volume fraction of voids is expected to be achieved in the composite structure. Porosity in the treated composite samples was determined using the follow equation:

<p>This would give a void content of about 8.2%. This void content may have been responsible for the difference between FEM and experimental results. It may be claimed that the model is capable of acceptably predicting the mechanical behavior of the composite as confirmed by the experimental assays. Therefore, the FE predicted results can be usefully employed in bone plate design.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec12-0021998311431997"><title>Bending properties</title>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0021998311431997">Figure 7</xref> illustrates the relation between bending stress and bone plate deflection for treated samples. The bending stress increased up to the maximum stress beyond which it dropped and the initial fracture became visible at the tension side in all the specimens. The clear edges of the fractured specimen indicate that stress may be applied to the fiber yarns rather than to the interface; hence, the highest modulus and strength were obtained because of the high load carrying capacity of the fiber yarns. Kim et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0021998311431997">21</xref></sup> reported appreciable improvements in flexural strength of composites containing silane-treated fibers, particularly those fabricated by compression molding.
<fig id="fig7-0021998311431997" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><p>Bending stress vs deflection of the treated-PLLA/BG composite bone plate.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0021998311431997-fig7.tif"/></fig>
</p>
<p>Based on the classical beam theory, the bending strength and the bending modulus of the bone plate were calculated to be 53 ± 3.3 MPa and 15 ± 0.6 GPa, respectively. According to Yuehuei et al., these same values for the human forearm (radius) bone are about 40 MPa and 7 GPa, respectively. Although the value for the bending modulus of the proposed composite bone plate (PLLA/BG) is twice that of the human cortical bone, its stiffness is nearer to that of the cortical bone than to either stainless steel or PEEK/Carbon composite.</p>
<p>Much effort has been put into developing composite compression plates that could be used as replacements for metal plates. These efforts have, however, been mainly focused on UD laminates and discontinuous short fibers used as reinforcement. Not only do these bone plates typically fail to yield the mechanical properties required, they are also too thin to be applied in load-bearing sites. This results in either weak bonding at the matrix-reinforcement interface or breakage of the fibers due to drilling or screwing holes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0021998311431997">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0021998311431997">12</xref></sup> Braided composite compression plates were proposed for load-bearing applications as a remedy. Fujihara et al. fabricated a PEEK/Carbon fiber braiding compression plate that both enjoyed the required mechanical properties and was thin enough to be suitable for clinical applications.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0021998311431997">5</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0021998311431997">7</xref></sup> However, the bending stiffness of the PEEK/Carbon fiber composite bone plate was about 40–90% that of stainless steel compression plate, which is far higher than that of the cortical bone. It must be mentioned that the bending modulus of a compression bone plate has a close relationship with the bone healing process such that its value should be close to that of the cortical bone in order to stimulate bone healing.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0021998311431997">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>Fujihara et al. reported bending stiffness values of about 0.9 and 1.3 Nm/deg, respectively, for PEEK/Carbon braided composite bone plates 3.3 and 3.8 mm thick. The same value for a stainless steel bone plate 3.8 thick was about 1.6 Nm/deg.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0021998311431997">5</xref></sup> It was 0.71 Nm/deg for PLLA/BG braided composite bone plate. The bending stiffness of the proposed composite bone plate is less than 50% of stainless steel bone plate and it is near to that recommended by Fujihara et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0021998311431997">5</xref></sup> Therefore, the manufactured composite bone plate is capable of tolerating the bending force in this region and thus improving the healing process due to low bending stiffness.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0021998311431997">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>The bending stiffness and the elastic modulus of the PLLA/BG braided compression plate proposed in the present study was shown to be approximately the same as those of the cortical bone with proper bending and tensile strength.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0021998311431997">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0021998311431997">27</xref></sup> Results show that the PLLA/BG braided composite has suitable mechanical properties making it applicable as fracture fixation plates in orthopedic applications. Since the plate size matches standard compression plates and also because it has the required mechanical properties, it can be suitably used for certain load-bearing sites, such as in the forearm region. More experiments are required to investigate other aspects of its biocompatibility.</p></sec></sec>
<sec id="sec13-0021998311431997" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Single layers of braided textile composite consisting of PLLA as the matrix and bioactive glass (BG) as the reinforcement were fabricated. The volume fraction of the reinforcement was 45%. Results of the tensile test revealed that the mechanical properties of the prepared samples were approximately similar to the values predicted by the finite element method using the APS coupling agent. In other words, the bonding between the two phases was near perfect bonding. The good agreement found between FEM results (in our previous work) and the experimental data obtained here indicated that the fiber volume fraction of the composite was properly predicted by the FE method as also verified by experimental data. Therefore, the data predicted by the model could be used for bone plate design purposes.</p>
<p>The elastic modulus and tensile strength of the composite samples were high enough and almost the same as those of cortical bone. It can, therefore, be claimed that the PLLA/BG composite bone plate can adequately support fracture sites. The fracture edge of the samples revealed that the applied load was properly transferred to the fiber yarns, making it possible to achieve the highest modulus and strength values. Bending stiffness and bending strength of the composite bone plate were almost equal to those of the cortical bone, thereby stimulating the healing process.</p>
<p>Based on the above advantages, the proposed composite bone plate may be recommended as a suitable candidate for orthopedic load-bearing applications.</p></sec>
