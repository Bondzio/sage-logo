<sec id="sec1-1363460712466013"><title>Elena Martellozzo, <italic>Online Child Sexual Abuse: Grooming, Policing and Child Protection in a Multi-Media World</italic>, London: Routledge, 2012; 172+xii pp.: ISBN 13: 978-0415618212, £64.39 hbk</title>
<p><italic>Online Child Sexual Abuse</italic> seeks to extend the terrain of public debates about its subject matter. Grounded in extensive and detailed fieldwork at the Metropolitan Police, the book offers unique insights into the dynamics of online grooming and policing. At the same time, it provides a useful overview of academic and policy debates in this field.</p>
<p>The first five chapters establish a framework for research on online child sexual abuse. Chapter 1 develops definitions of relevant concepts: childhood, sexual offending, consent, child sexual abuse, paedophiles, paedophilia, and so forth. Chapter 2 then moves into more complex terrain, summarising and synthesising a broad range of interdisciplinary perspectives on child sexual abuse. In this context, the chapter clearly outlines extant knowledge and knowledge gaps, addresses poorly understood phenomena, such as female child sexual abuse, and ties general debates in the area to more specific issues of online abuse. In an equally systematic manner, chapter 3 delves into the terrain of young people’s internet use. It maps risks in social networking and other online activities and sketches extant knowledge about young people’s risk-taking behaviour and their potential exposure to sexual victimisation. Chapter 4 summarises legal definitions of online child sexual abuse and legislation on indecent images and online grooming. Finally, chapter 5 explores findings of a number of international police operations – Operation Cathedral and Operation ORE – and academic and policy research into dynamics of online grooming. This chapter highlights salient risks and possible responses, as well as the as yet poorly understood nature of online grooming and child sexual abuse.</p>
<p>The book’s final three chapters then present the author’s ethnographic work with the Metropolitan Police High Technological Crime Unit and Paedophile Unit. These chapters document a wealth of materials, including notes from participant observation, transcripts of online conversations between undercover police officers and individuals they observed, and in-depth interviews with members of the Metropolitan Police. Through these materials, the chapters vividly document both online grooming and the policing tactics used to counter it. Chapter 6 focuses on the dynamics of sex offenders’ online interaction and risk assessment in online surveillance operations. Chapter 7 in turn looks at constraints within these surveillance operations. These range from technological limitations to the difficulties faced by police officers in successfully inserting themselves into chat rooms and impersonating children. Chapter 8 summarises the book’s discoveries and briefly situates them in broader debates about gender, sexuality, and power.</p>
<p><italic>Online Child Sexual Abuse</italic> is an important addition to its field. It is written in a lively and accessible style, clearly directed at both academic and professional audiences. Indeed, both practitioners and scholars will find much of interest in the text. To begin with, it is remarkable for its unprecedented level of first-hand insight into the policing of online grooming. To date, Elena Martellozzo’s access to and understanding of the respective operations of the Metropolitan Police have not been matched. Her work stands out for its originality and its well-crafted, concise yet deep, portrayal of a highly sensitive and complex subject matter. Moreover, Martellozzo’s work is notable for its skilful synthesis of extant research on child sexual abuse and its policing. Newcomers to these debates will find <italic>Online Child Sexual Abuse</italic> to be a valuable introduction, and experts will appreciate it for its ability to bring together sometimes disparate strands of enquiry to offer a fresh take on the problem of online abuse.</p>
<p>It should be noticed that that this is a book conscious of its limitations. Its primary concern is to offer a detailed empirical analysis of the in many ways still uncharted terrain of online child sexual abuse. It does not seek to develop new theoretical perspectives on its subject matter, and it does not pay much attention to current debates about the role the policing of child sexual abuse plays in the consolidation of the neoliberal punitive state. The text does review extant theories, and it does touch upon the work of Loïc Wacquant and other scholars who have commented on the politics of child sexual abuse. A more strongly theoretically and politically motivated discussion of online child sexual abuse would have added an interesting layer of complexity. Nonetheless, on its own terms, the book manages to stand out from a crowded field. <italic>Online Child Sexual Abuse</italic> can be recommended without reservations.</p>
