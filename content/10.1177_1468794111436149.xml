<title>Rapid but complete? Qualitative essentials</title>
<p>These two titles are drawn from the Left Coast Press catalogue and they form part of their nascent <italic>Qualitative Essentials</italic> books series. As such, they are positioned as succinct but comprehensive introductions to key themes in qualitative inquiry. Mayan’s book represents a broad overview of the qualitative research process through from theory, design and inception to ethics, writing and representation. Kaler and Beres focus more specifically on the potentially awkward – although vitally important – issue of managing interpersonal relationships in the course of undertaking qualitative fieldwork. As the authors of both texts acknowledge, it would be a stretch to claim that these guides are exhaustive or comprehensive. That said, they each provide a solid grounding in their respective topics.</p>
<p>Mayan’s <italic>Essentials of Qualitative Inquiry</italic> enters a very crowded marketplace insofar as it is a ‘how-to’ guide aimed at newcomers to qualitative inquiry. One may well ask what sets this apart from the other introductory texts that currently line our bookshelves. For example when planning a lecture that introduces students to the qualitative research process, my instinctive reaction is to reach for something like Silverman’s <italic>A Very Short, Fairly Interesting and Reasonably Cheap Book about Qualitative Research</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1468794111436149">2007</xref>). However, part of this has to do with my own disciplinary leanings towards sociology and the fact that I am most likely to be teaching students of this discipline. A real strength of Mayan’s book, then, is that she sets out to introduce the principles of qualitative research ‘regardless of discipline’ (p. 7) and in this regard, she is very successful. Reading this book, it is not difficult to see how it will appeal to students on a range of academic courses, but beyond this it is also pitched appropriately for those outside of academia looking for a crash course in qualitative methods. Allied to this, it is refreshing to see an introductory text that does not begin with an overzealous defence of/apology for qualitative methods or a rehearsal of familiar debates about how they differ from quantitative approaches. Mayan gets straight down to business – she introduces what qualitative inquiry entails, deals swiftly with her ‘qualitative annoyances’ (common misperceptions of what it is) and then gets on with it, so to speak.</p>
<p>Her central trope is the importance of ‘methodological coherence’ – ensuring congruence between epistemology, ontology and method, etc. In the opening chapter she sketches this out and uses the idea of the ‘armchair walkthrough’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1468794111436149">Morse, 1999</xref>) to create a guide for thinking about ‘the methodological trajectory of an entire research project’ (p. 13). In the discussions that follow (chapters 2 through 6) she fleshes this sketch out with more detailed reflections on theory and method; research questions, choice of respondents and sample sizes; strategies for data collection; and techniques for data analysis. Running through these discussions is the idea that these separate phases of the research process should match one another. Taking care not to be overly prescriptive, she stresses that this is the key to rigorous qualitative research and this point is underlined in Chapter 7. The remainder of the book deals with a number of important issues such as the politics of funding proposals (Chapter 8), the practicalities of ethics (Chapter 9) and issues of writing and representation (Chapter 10). The chapters are well organized insofar as they begin with a synopsis and end with a useful summary and exercise. Additionally, there are a few appendices that may or may not be interpreted as useful illustrations of (parts of) the qualitative research process. As a whole, this book hangs together rather well and I was particularly impressed by the chapters towards the end of the book in which Mayan introduces issues that are not always broached in introductory texts. The very fact that she addresses them is a symptom of her pragmatic approach and essentially, this is what sets her book apart from similar titles.</p>
<p>In contrast to Mayan’s book, Kaler and Beres’ <italic>Essentials of Field Relationships</italic> is not aimed at novice researchers nor does it purport to be a how-to guide. Aimed at readers with at least some experience of methods and the research process, this text explores the ‘social connections that researchers develop over the course of their research with participants and other stakeholders’ (p. 7). In common with Mayan, Kaler and Beres do not preoccupy themselves with methodological debates; preferring instead to delve into the practicalities of qualitative inquiry. This is to be applauded. They start from the position that qualitative fieldwork is necessarily characterized by multiple – often complex – field relationships and that the successful negotiation of these can make or break a research project. The discussions that follow introduce the reader to the various issues that need to be considered ahead of, during and to a lesser extent, after the fieldwork. These include the issues associated with entering and leaving the field (Chapter 2), the maintenance of relationships in the field and issues of researcher identity (Chapters 3 and 4), the social requirements of data collection (Chapter 5), and the real-world practise of research ethics (Chapter 6). Running through all of these discussions is the sense that this is not a blueprint that demands to be followed; rather the emphasis is on giving the reader the benefit of the authors’ experiences such that they are better equipped to consider these issues in situ. The concluding chapter reiterates this as well as stressing the importance of expecting the unexpected, thinking reflexively and being prepared to make ‘game time’ decisions (p. 109) that may change the direction of the research trajectory.</p>
<p>Kaler and Beres approach to their subject matter is a lot less rigid than the treatment that Mayan gives to hers. While I do not say this as a criticism of Mayan’s book, it is certainly a real strength of Kaler and Beres’ and their flexible approach represents a realistic but gentle introduction to the complexities and actualities of carrying out qualitative research. Again, the individual chapters are well organized and introduce a range of relevant topics pitched at just the right level for those who are embarking on qualitative fieldwork for the first time. They are also peppered with ‘lessons from the field’ sections in which the authors and other seasoned researchers offer brief asides drawn from a broad range of projects in which they reflect on some of the issues and difficulties that they have faced or resolved in the course of carrying out their own fieldwork. These are very useful and help bring the discussions to life; however, I would have liked to see a line or two that contextualizes each excerpt, not least because I think that this would be beneficial to students reading the book. This is a minor gripe and another minor criticism is that there are a couple of notable omissions. First, Kaler and Beres do not say much about managing relationships with – and responsibilities to – respondents after the fieldwork has been completed, nor do they address attendant issues of writing about and representing them. Second, they do not really engage with the relationships that we as researchers have with our various funders. As we enter a climate in which qualitative researchers are likely to be pursuing ‘non-traditional’ sources of funding, some reflection and advice would have been welcomed. This is nevertheless an important book insofar as it cracks open the black box of field relationships and, as such, delves into a subject that is all too often taken as given in introductory qualitative texts (and courses). Moreover, it does a very good job of doing so.</p>
<p>Both of these texts make use of friendly, almost conversational, writing styles to engage with their readers. Both draw on extensive experiences of conducting qualitative research and teaching qualitative methods with the emphasis on distilling this to offer concise and practical introductions. I must admit that on first reading, I found some of the material a little blunt. For example, despite her efforts not to be overly prescriptive, I found Mayan’s approach to be rather too rigid for my tastes. However, on further reflection, I conceded that her commitment to methodological coherence is laudable and that her framework is a very useful guide for student projects. Similarly, at first glance, I thought that Kaler and Beres’ advice on sexual relationships in the field – simply: ‘don’t’ (p. 51) – obscures a more complicated set of issues. But again, on reflection, I realized that this is exactly what I would say to a student who sought my advice on this matter. I have already noted that a strength of these books is their practical and direct approach. Inevitably this comes at the expense of depth, subtlety and methodological debate, especially given the confines of a short book. So yes, these books are indeed ‘rapid’ and ‘succinct’ but they are never going to be ‘comprehensive’ and ‘complete’ – nor should we expect them to be. They are, however, very good and it would be somewhat glib to criticize on the grounds that they don’t do x or that they lump y and z together. My inclination, then, is to view these as invitations to explore qualitative research methods (Mayan) or research relationships (Kaler and Beres) in more depth and detail. Their appeal in this regard would be strengthened by the addition of annotated bibliographies or suggestions for further reading. They are also excellent teaching resources and I have no hesitation in recommending both texts for this purpose. Finally, a notable strength of both books is that they are not tied to particular disciplinary approaches and, as such, represent lively and accessible introductions to the qualitative research process.</p>
