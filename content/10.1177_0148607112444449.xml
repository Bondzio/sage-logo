<p><italic>Background</italic>: Despite the numerous disease conditions associated with vitamin D deficiency in the general population, the relationship of this deficiency to outcome in critically ill patients remains unclear. The objective of this study is to determine the burden of vitamin D deficiency in intensive care unit (ICU) patients and determine if it is associated with poor patient outcomes. <italic>Methods</italic>: The authors conducted an analysis of samples collected from a prospective study of 196 patients admitted to a medical/surgical ICU in a tertiary care hospital. They measured serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D at admission and up to 10 days following admission and followed patients prospectively for 28-day outcomes. <italic>Results</italic>: Of analyzable patients, 50 (26%) were deficient (≤30 nmol/L) and 109 (56%) were insufficient (&gt;30 and ≤60 nmol/L). Baseline 25(OH)D levels decreased significantly in all patients after 3 days in the ICU and remained significantly lower through 10 days (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .001). 25(OH)D status was not significantly associated with 28-day all-cause mortality (hazard ratio [HR], 0.89; 95% confidence interval, [CI] 0.37–2.24). Higher levels of 25(OH)D were associated with a shorter time-to-alive ICU discharge (HR, 2.11; 95% CI, 1.27–3.51). 25(OH)D-deficient patients showed a nonstatistically significant trend toward a higher infection rate (odds ratio [OR], 3.20; 95% CI, 0.784–13.07; <italic>P</italic> = .11) compared with patients with sufficient levels of 25(OH)D. <italic>Conclusions</italic>: This study demonstrates significant decreases in vitamin D status over the duration of the patient’s ICU stay. Low levels of vitamin D are associated with longer time to ICU discharge alive and a trend toward increased risk of ICU-acquired infection.</p>

<title>Clinical Relevancy Statement</title>
<p>Vitamin D deficiency has been associated with a myriad of disease conditions in the general population. However, the impact of vitamin D deficiency on outcome in critically ill patients remains unclear. Although studies have described a high burden of vitamin D deficiency in this population and suggested a correlation with adverse outcomes, few studies have addressed specific outcomes. Furthermore, the usefulness of obtaining vitamin D levels in critically ill patients is not clear because most studies have evaluated pre–intensive care unit (ICU) vitamin D levels, and no large studies to date have trended vitamin D levels during the ICU stay. We confirm in this study that vitamin D deficiency is common in this population and is associated with a longer ICU length of stay, may increase the risk of ICU-acquired infections and pneumonia, and may be associated with elevated organ failure scores. In addition, we describe the trend of vitamin D status during the stay of patients in the ICU and demonstrate that there is a statistically significant decrease in the levels of vitamin D. These results add to the growing fund of knowledge concerning the association of vitamin D deficiency with adverse outcomes in the critical care population and indicate that further research is warranted in defining whether vitamin D supplementation is beneficial and what is the optimal dose and timing of vitamin D in this population.</p>

<p>Vitamin D deficiency in the critically ill patient was observed more than 20 years ago, primarily in hypocalcemic patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0148607112444449">17</xref></sup> Recent studies in normocalcemic critically ill patients have suggested a very high burden of vitamin D deficiency in this population and suggested a previously unrecognized contribution of deficient states to non-calcium-related consequences.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0148607112444449">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0148607112444449"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0148607112444449"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0148607112444449"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0148607112444449"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0148607112444449"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0148607112444449">24</xref></sup> However, to our knowledge, no large studies have specifically addressed vitamin D status trends through the duration of stay in the intensive care unit (ICU). Critically ill patients are at an especially high risk for many of the disorders that vitamin D deficiency may be associated with. Yet, evaluation of 25(OH)D status is rarely performed in the critical care setting.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0148607112444449">25</xref></sup></p>
<p>The hypothesis of this study is that vitamin D status in ICU patients is significantly decreased at admission and continues to decrease throughout their hospital stay. Furthermore, we hypothesize that vitamin D deficiency is associated with poor patient outcomes, particularly longer ICU stay and greater risk of infection.</p>

<title>Materials and Methods</title>
<p>The original purpose of the prospective observational study was to evaluate a diagnostic marker for sepsis in critical illness. This trial was conducted at the Kingston General Hospital, a tertiary care, mixed medical-surgical ICU,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0148607112444449">26</xref></sup> and 2 other hospitals. In the original study, 597 patients were enrolled at the 3 sites. However, additional blood was collected and available for analysis only from patients at the Kingston General Hospital site, which included 203 total patients, and this is the cohort studied in this report. Here we report a secondary analysis of the serum samples collected in this study evaluating the relationship between 25(OH)D levels and clinical outcomes. The patients were enrolled over the period of 1 year from October 2002 to October 2003. Research ethics boards from Queen’s University approved the protocol for the original study; informed consent was obtained from next of kin before enrollment. The inclusion criteria of the patients included all consecutive patients 18 years and older who were expected to stay more than 24 hours in the ICU and were enrolled within the first 24 hours of ICU admission. Only patients admitted for overdoses were excluded from the study. The study protocol at Kingston General Hospital included blood sample collection daily for a maximum of 10 days. Serum samples were also collected and stored at −80°C prior to analysis.</p>
<sec id="section4-0148607112444449">
<title>Data Collection</title>
<p>Demographics, past medical history, and medications were obtained from the patients’ charts and included age, race, sex, body mass index (BMI; determined prior to ICU admission or estimated as pre-ICU dry weight [in kg] divided by height [in cm] squared in the ICU on admission), season of admission (summer admission was defined as admission between June 21 and September 22 of the year of the study), admission category (cardiovascular, respiratory, neurological, metabolic, gastrointestinal, hematologic, sepsis, postoperative), and comorbidities (coronary artery disease, hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes, renal disease, liver disease, cancer). Necessary variables were recorded to calculate Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0148607112444449">27</xref></sup> and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) scores<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0148607112444449">28</xref></sup> at admission. Clinical outcomes were assessed at 14 and 28 days. No patients were lost to follow up for the 14- or 28-day clinical end points. Outcomes recorded included mortality, time-to-alive ICU discharge, and infection status. The diagnosis of ICU-acquired infection was defined as infection present after 48 hours of ICU admission. Suspected infection was defined by the presence of a new positive culture result or initiation of new antibiotics after 48 hours of ICU admission. The charts of all patients with suspected infections were reviewed by 2 independent blinded physicians using standardized definitions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0148607112444449">29</xref></sup> Adjudicators then met to determine the presence or absence of infection. In case of discrepancy, the physicians would meet and resolve the issue by reanalyzing the chart. Given the uncertainty around the absolute diagnosis of a new infection, we used standard definitions of “probable” and “possible” for each type of infection, where probable reflected a higher degree of probability, in the opinion of the adjudicator, that infection was present compared with possible infection. This adjudication technique has been validated and published in previous large clinical ICU trials.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0148607112444449">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0148607112444449">31</xref></sup> The max SOFA score was calculated as the worse score for each organ component over the patient’s ICU stay. The delta SOFA score was determined by subtracting the maximum SOFA score from the admission total SOFA score. As vitamin D insufficiency has been associated with an increased susceptibility to pulmonary infections,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0148607112444449">32</xref></sup> the subgroup of patients with ICU-acquired pneumonia &gt;48 hours after admission was analyzed separately.</p>
<p>Serum was collected on the day of ICU admission (within 24 hours of ICU admittance) and daily for 10 days while in the ICU. All samples were stored at −80°C for future analysis and did not undergo more than 1 freeze-thaw cycle before running assays. Serum 25(OH)D levels were assessed using a radioimmunoassay (RIA) method (DiaSorin, Antony, France) at The Children’s Hospital Clinical and Translational Research Center Core Lab in Denver, Colorado, at baseline and with samples from days 3, 5, 7, and 10 (when available). This laboratory participates biannually in the Vitamin D External Quality Assessment Scheme to ensure the analytical reliability of the 25(OH)D assay. The coefficient of variation for the 25(OH)D RIA assay is 0.046. Samples were run in 4 batches according to the day after admission. The following 25(OH)D values were used for deficient, insufficient, and sufficient patients according to previously reported subgroups: sufficient, &gt;60 nmol/L; insufficient, &gt;30 to ≤60 nmol/L; and deficient, ≤30 nmol/L,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0148607112444449">19</xref></sup> which are similar to the recent Institute of Medicine report cutoffs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0148607112444449">33</xref></sup></p>

<sec id="section5-0148607112444449">
<title>Statistics</title>
<p>For baseline SOFA scores, multiple regression was used to calculate adjusted least squares means using PROC GLM in SAS Version 9.2 (SAS Institute, Inc, Cary, NC) between 25(OH)D groups. In all multivariate models, we controlled for age, gender, BMI, and APACHE II score. Ethnicity was not included in the analysis because 201 of the 203 patients were white. Except for gender, all covariates were continuous. Logistic and proportional hazards models used Wald tests and confidence intervals. To assess the change in 25(OH)D status over the patient’s stay in the ICU, the PROC MIXED function was used in SAS to run a mixed model regression. 25(OH)D status was expressed as a categorical variable, and a multivariate Cox proportional hazard ratio model was used to identify variable association with time to ICU discharge or mortality. The PROC PHREG function in SAS was used to calculate the hazard ratios for time-to-alive ICU discharge and mortality variables. Patients who died were censored because their time to recovery was unknown. Because a 1-nmol/L increase in 25(OH)D is not clinically relevant, we represented a 1-unit increase as a 30-nmol/L increase in 25(OH)D levels for hazard ratio estimates. This unit selection scales the hazard ratio estimates but does not have any effect on the statistical significance. The <italic>P</italic> value for this analysis was determined using a type 3 Wald test. Logistic regression was used to model probable and possible ICU-acquired infections in the 25(OH)D groups using the PROC LOGISTIC function in SAS Version 9.2. The Student <italic>t</italic> test (unpooled [Satterthwaite]) was used to compare the means of baseline 25(OH)D between patients with and without pneumonia. The SAS Version 9.2 statistical package was used for all analyses. Means (SD) are reported. All tests were 2-sided, and <italic>P</italic> &lt; .05 was considered significant. A statistical trend was considered <italic>P</italic> &lt; .20.</p>

<title>Patients and 25(OH)D Status</title>
<p>In the original study, 203 patients were enrolled at Kingston General Hospital. However, baseline serum samples were not available for analysis in 7 patients. Thus, a total of 196 patients on admission day were included in this analysis. Of the 196 patients analyzed, 66 (33.7%) were admitted as postoperative patients and 130 (66.3%) were admitted for medical reasons. The primary admission categories, including cardiovascular, respiratory, neurological, metabolic, gastrointestinal, and hematologic disorders, were not statistically different between the groups (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0148607112444449">Table 1</xref>). Comorbid conditions existing prior to ICU admission, including coronary artery disease, hypertension, diabetes, renal disease, liver disease, or cancer, were not significantly different between the groups. In addition, APACHE II scores, presence of sepsis on admission, and baseline SOFA scores were similar between the 25(OH)D groups (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0148607112444449">Table 1</xref>). Furthermore, there were no significant differences in mean parenteral nutrition (PN) and enteral nutrition (EN) over ICU length of stay between the groups.</p>

<p>The mean ± SD time-to-alive ICU discharge for all patients in the study population was 7.5 ± 8.5 days.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Here we report an observational study evaluating the relationship between vitamin D deficiency and clinical outcomes in an unselected, heterogeneous critically ill patient population. This study showed that a significant number of ICU patients had inadequate vitamin D status (82% of patients were insufficient or deficient) on admission. In addition, this is the first study to describe a significant decrease in 25(OH)D levels from admission 25(OH)D levels as early as 3 days after admission and as late as 10 days. Our data also demonstrate a high incidence (39.1%) of sufficient patients becoming insufficient during their stay. We did not observe an association between baseline 25(OH)D status and 28-day all-cause mortality, but 25(OH)D-deficient patients stayed significantly longer in the ICU, tended to develop more organ failure, and tended to experience a higher number of infections, particularly pneumonia, compared with sufficient patients.</p>
<p>The outcomes associated with inadequate 25(OH)D status seen in this study corroborate the findings of a recent smaller study (n = 41) by Lee et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0148607112444449">19</xref></sup> that showed that 93% of patients had inadequate baseline 25(OH)D levels. However, little is known about the measurement of 25(OH)D status during a patient’s duration of stay. Only 1 smaller study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0148607112444449">21</xref></sup> (12 patients) indirectly evaluated 25(OH)D status beyond admission levels in the ICU, and to our knowledge, no studies have demonstrated a significant decrease in 25(OH)D status during the patient’s stay. In our study, we show a significant decrease in 25(OH)D levels over the first 3–10 days in the ICU in the sufficient and insufficient groups but no changes in patients who are already deficient. The explanation for this acute decrease in 25(OH)D in the sufficient and insufficient groups is not clear but could be due to changes in vitamin D binding protein (VDBP), which approximately 85% of 25(OH)D is bound to.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0148607112444449">34</xref></sup> VDBP is decreased in ICU patients and has been shown to be a predictor of ICU mortality.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0148607112444449">35</xref></sup> Another recent study demonstrated that ICU patients with sepsis and worse outcomes had significantly lower levels of VDBP compared with those without sepsis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0148607112444449">20</xref></sup> A decrease in VDBP may be due to decreased protein synthesis or increased clearance of VDBP in ICU patients with liver, renal, or intestinal diseases. However, because VDBP concentrations are much higher than 25(OH)D and VDBP has a high affinity for vitamin D metabolites, reduced levels of VDBP often result in lower total 25(OH)D but do not affect free concentrations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0148607112444449">36</xref></sup> The VDBP relationship should be considered in any future studies examining the acute changes in 25(OH)D observed in this study.</p>
<p>In our study, we did not observe an association with 28-day all-cause mortality and 25(OH)D status. This is in contrast to a recent study by Braun et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0148607112444449">24</xref></sup> that evaluated preadmission vitamin D levels and found vitamin D deficiency to be significantly associated with 30-, 90-, and 365-day mortality. However, the prior study was limited by selection bias and measurement of vitamin D status up to 365 days prior to ICU admission. The lack of association of vitamin D status with mortality in our study may be due to our study being underpowered. We were not able to run a power analysis a priori because the relationship of vitamin D to mortality was not the initial end point of the trial at conception, but post hoc power analysis suggests that this study did not have the power to detect small differences in mortality or infection rates between the groups (data not shown). Therefore, the failure to demonstrate statistically significant differences in mortality as well as infection rates in this study should not be interpreted as evidence for lack of a true difference. In fact, the magnitude of the association with infection and vitamin D levels is quite large (OR, 1.7–3.2), but we lacked statistical precision because of our limited sample size.</p>
<p>The data presented here are the largest thus far to report an increased time-to-alive ICU discharge associated with admission vitamin D deficiency. Our study also suggests a hypothesis for the observed increased time-to-alive ICU discharge. We used a very rigorous adjudication process to determine the presence or absence of infection and a rigorous definition of pneumonia. Our observation of increased infection rates and decreased organ function may be factors associated with vitamin D deficiency that could contribute to prolonged time-to-alive ICU discharge and poorer outcomes in ICU patients. This potentially could be due to the role vitamin D has on the immune system. In line with this, a recent report found significantly lower levels of the endogenous antimicrobial peptide cathelicidin (LL-37) in critically ill patients who were vitamin D deficient, suggesting a role for vitamin D in maintaining innate immunity to infection in the ICU.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0148607112444449">20</xref></sup> Furthermore, 1,25(OH)D has been shown to have a stimulatory effect on the innate immune system by increasing interleukin-1 (IL-1) production and stimulating monocyte proliferation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0148607112444449">37</xref></sup> Without these important innate immune system stimulating effects, patients may be more susceptible to ICU infections. On the other hand, sufficient levels of vitamin D have been associated with lower rates of autoimmune disorders, and it may be that adequate levels of vitamin D are necessary to regulate overactive, pathologic inflammatory immune responses.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0148607112444449">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0148607112444449">14</xref></sup> Therefore patients may be more susceptible to pathologic, overactive immune responses to common ICU infections.</p>
<p>Limitations to this study include a relatively small sample size and confounding variables that could not be accounted for in our multivariate analysis. For instance, the observed vitamin D deficiency in this study could be due to a number of confounding causes, including the fact that many patients have limited exposure to UV-B light during chronic disease and often have significant dietary alterations, and the calcium–parathyroid–vitamin D axis may be disrupted in critical illness, so a consideration of PTH and Ca levels should be considered in future studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0148607112444449">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0148607112444449">38</xref></sup> Although our study suggests an association between inadequate vitamin D levels and poor patient outcomes, this does not mean vitamin D is the direct cause of the poor outcomes. It is possible that the conditions leading to poor outcomes cause a decrease in vitamin D levels, which are reactionary and not causal. More studies are needed to determine if there is direct causality between admission vitamin D status and patient outcomes. Furthermore, although there was not a statistically significant difference in the rates of infection and pneumonia, the significant differences in baseline levels of 25(OH)D between infected and noninfected patients suggest an association that this study may not have had the power to observe in actual infection rates.</p>
<p>A recent report from the Institute of Medicine (IOM) points out that cutoffs for vitamin D deficiency have not been systematically developed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0148607112444449">33</xref></sup> The cutoffs used for this study to define sufficient, insufficient, and deficient groups were selected according to recently published articles on vitamin D in ICU patients to allow for across-study comparison in ICU patients. Our cutoffs, although not exactly matching, are similar to the IOM report that suggests 25(OH)D levels &lt;50 nmol/L (&lt;20 ng/mL) are insufficient for bone health.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0148607112444449">33</xref></sup> However, the cutoff values set for other concerns, such as bone health in the general population, may not be applicable to the critically ill population. Therefore, without sufficient evidence for the appropriate sufficient/insufficient cutoffs in this select ICU population, we decided on the cutoffs used in this article for cross-study comparison to other ICU vitamin D studies.</p>
<p>Another consideration that adds to the challenge of setting hard cutoff values for vitamin D is the various assays available to measure 25(OH)D. The major assays used include the RIA method used in this study, electrochemiluminescence (ECLIA) methods, and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), which is often considered the gold standard.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0148607112444449">34</xref></sup> Some studies have suggested that RIA and ECLIA methods underestimate or overestimate levels of 25(OH)D because of how they measure the major forms of 25(OH)D found in the blood.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0148607112444449">34</xref></sup> This is a potential limitation of this study. However, reports are inconsistent, and the RIA method used in our study has been demonstrated in many studies to correlate with other assay methods, including HPLC,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0148607112444449">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0148607112444449">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0148607112444449">40</xref></sup> even after long-term storage at −80°C.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0148607112444449">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0148607112444449">42</xref></sup> Future studies of vitamin D in the ICU also need to consider the assay method, and proper laboratory standardization should be ensured to avoid a bias in the levels.</p>
<p>The findings of this study highlight the need for further studies to evaluate the optimal dose of 25(OH)D levels in critically ill ICU patients. Unfortunately, a limitation of our study was not being able to examine differences in vitamin D intake between groups during the ICU stay, although general nutrition intake was not significantly different between the groups. It cannot be assumed that the dose used to correct a healthy individual will be sufficient to correct a critically ill patient. The current American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition recommendation for hospitalized patients of 200 IU of vitamin D daily, which is intended for maintenance and not repletion, has been shown to be insufficient to normalize vitamin D levels.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0148607112444449">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0148607112444449">44</xref></sup> Recently, a small study demonstrated that serum 25(OH)D levels in critically ill patients may be normalized by the oral administration of larger doses (two 60,000 IU doses) of vitamin D.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0148607112444449">21</xref></sup> Furthermore, a recent small study using a single oral dose of 540,000 IU of vitamin D<sub>3</sub> in critically ill patients demonstrated a significant increase in serum 25(OH)D levels without adverse effects.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0148607112444449">45</xref></sup> However, the optimal dosing of vitamin D required to both normalize the deficiency observed in the ICU setting and potentially have a favorable effect on infection and other outcomes is unknown and requires further study. It will be vital, prior to any large clinical outcome trial, to first conduct a well-designed dosing trial to ensure that sufficient doses of vitamin D are administered to correct the deficiency observed in many ICU patients. In addition, these dosing studies will have to consider the form of vitamin D repletion because it is available in various forms (ergocalciferol vs cholecalciferol) and various routes depending on location (no intravenous vitamin D is available in the United States).</p>
<p>In conclusion, in this study, we demonstrate that 25(OH)D insufficiency is very common in the ICU (82% of patients) and is significantly associated with longer time-to-alive ICU discharge, a trending toward increased organ failure, and a nonsignificant trend toward a higher number of infections. In addition, we report for the first time that 25(OH)D levels continue to significantly decrease through the duration of a patient’s ICU stay. Further research defining whether vitamin D supplementation is beneficial and what is the optimal dose of vitamin D in this population is warranted. In addition, future studies with larger sample sizes are required so that potential differences regarding mortality, infection, and immune status can be further evaluated.</p>
