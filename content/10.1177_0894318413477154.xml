<p>Healthcare systems have cocreated an environment in which the vast majority of nurses in staff positions have not been expected to lead for quality healthcare services.

<p>The most rewarding aspect of being a nurse leader surfaces from time spent working with others, mentoring them to do what they want to do and to be who they want to be. There is leader capacity in all nurses—some have formal titles and some lead in more informal ways, but one thing that is certain is that where any leader chooses to focus is where a difference will be made; it is where possibilities flourish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0894318413477154">Zander &amp; Zander, 2000</xref>). Unfortunately, for many decades healthcare systems have been built in ways that cocreate environments in which the vast majority of nurses in staff positions in particular have not been expected to lead for quality healthcare services. Both the nature of their work and the busyness of their schedules have prevented staff nurses from being available to generate ideas and to lead innovations in patient care and quality work environments. It has been assumed that staff nurses are limited as leaders because they are <italic>just</italic> staff nurses. This assumption must be challenged. There is a critical need in healthcare to focus on cultivating formal leaders by mentoring nurses, risking being available to possibility, and trusting that nurses can be leaders from where they stand if given the opportunity. Formal leaders in nursing must create multifaceted systems and processes to cultivate the leadership capacity in all nurses. It is possible, and when it happens the result is that new knowledge is created, innovation happens, and the context and practice of nursing is enriched.</p>
<p>The purpose of this paper is to illuminate how <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0894318413477154">Parse’s (1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0894318413477154">2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0894318413477154">2008a</xref>) leading-following model guided the enrichment of the context and practice of nursing in a large academic health science center by helping leaders to cultivate nurses’ capacity to lead research projects that address patient-centered care and quality of work-life.

<title>A Nursing Theory-Based Leading-Following Model</title>
<p>The humanbecoming leading-following model developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0894318413477154">Parse (1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0894318413477154">2008a</xref>) can be used in any situation where opportunities for leading-following arise. It provides “a guide to living leading-following with a focus on human dignity and freedom where power is with the constituents of situations” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0894318413477154">Parse, 2008a</xref>, p. 369). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0894318413477154">Parse (2008a)</xref> said that “<italic>leading-following is deliberately innovating with potent engaging in persistently pursuing excellence</italic> [italics in original]; it is an indivisible, unpredictable, everchanging situation” (p. 371). The essences and processes of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0894318413477154">Parse’s (2008a)</xref> leading-following model, shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0894318413477154">Figure 1</xref>, are used here to describe how this nursing theoretical perspective guided leaders in a multi-site teaching hospital to provide opportunities for staff nurses to lead research projects.</p>

<title>Deliberately Innovating</title>
<p>The first essence of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0894318413477154">Parse’s (2008a)</xref> leading-following model, “<italic>deliberately innovating is committing to a vision with vigorous energizing”</italic> (p. 371), highlights the notion of <italic>deliberately innovating</italic> in leading-following. Exploration of the processes of deliberately innovating, <italic>committing to a vision</italic> and <italic>vigorous energizing</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0894318413477154">Parse, 2008a</xref>) helps to clarify the meaning of leading-following in this model.</p>
<p><italic>Committing to a vision</italic> is “being passionately present to something of value” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0894318413477154">Parse, 2008a</xref>, p. 373). Being passionately present means staying true to the vision in all that is said and done in leading-following situations. The presence that leaders and followers bring to their roles, “how [they] show up, how [they] connect, how [they] speak, listen, act—every move [they] make . . .combine to create the impact [they] have” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0894318413477154">Halpern &amp; Lubar, 2003</xref>, p. 4). When leaders and followers are passionately present it is contagious and it cocreates the vigorous energizing necessary for the deliberate innovation to become a reality.</p>
<p><italic>Vigorous energizing</italic> is “an enlivening commingling that arises with arousing the imagination of others about what could be, while intensifying the intrigue by forging a path for realizing the possibilities with the innovation” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0894318413477154">Parse, 2008a</xref>, p. 373). Vigorous energizing means taking responsibility for making connections with others, putting a focus on building relationships by listening to what others are saying about what is important to them, engaging others in dialogue, and reflecting about what is happening in light of opportunities and limitations. Vigorous energizing happens with quiet moments of encouragement and with subtle or not so subtle actions and words that exemplify commitment to the vision. It is cocreated among leaders-followers in ways unique to each leading-following situation. At its core, leading-following “is about the interaction, the connection, the relationship between . . .leaders and the people [they] lead” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0894318413477154">Halpern &amp; Lubar, 2003</xref>, p. 8) and the more leaders-followers know about one another, the greater will be their ability to do great things together, to take risks, and to be comfortable with ambiguity in the persistent pursuit of excellence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0894318413477154">Parse, 2008a</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section3-0894318413477154">
<title>Potent Engaging</title>
<p>The second essence of the leading-following model, “<italic>potent engaging is willingly risking in living with ambiguity”</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0894318413477154">Parse, 2008a</xref>, p. 371), highlights the notion of <italic>potent engaging</italic> in leading-following. The processes of potent engaging are <italic>willingly risking</italic> and <italic>living with ambiguity. Willingly risking</italic> is “daringly venturing forth, which is advancing on the edge when the way is not precisely clear …. It involves playing with possibilities about what could be, and abandoning the secure in favor of shifting patterns in the situation” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0894318413477154">Parse, 2008a</xref>, p. 373). <italic>Living with ambiguity</italic> is “abiding with vague potentials and propelling with the not-yet-fully-known explicitly to untangle the knots of obscurity” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0894318413477154">Parse, 2008a</xref>, p. 373). It is “<italic>moving with the vague</italic>” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0894318413477154">Parse, 2008a</xref>, p. 372); that is, making decisions, and boldly venturing forth despite the impossibility of knowing all of the possible consequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0894318413477154">Parse, 2008a</xref>).</p>
<p>In leading-following, willingness to risk is what separates great leaders from good leaders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0894318413477154">Zane, 2009</xref>) and it cocreates opportunities. If leaders cocreate opportunities to do something that no one else will do, it sets them apart from others. Great leaders move forward with opportunities despite restrictions that are both known and unknown. They risk acting on ideas before the path has cleared—knowing only that in leading-following, as in life, nothing is black and white—there are only continuously changing shades of grey. In leading–following situations guided by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0894318413477154">Parse’s (2008a)</xref> model, both leaders and followers participate in taking risks and moving with the not-yet known in the persistent pursuit of excellence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0894318413477154">Parse, 2008a</xref>). Willingly risking and living with ambiguity are lived while revering others and vigilantly attending to what is happening in leading-following situations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0894318413477154">Parse, 2008a</xref>).</p>

<title>Persistently Pursuing Excellence</title>
<p>The third essence of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0894318413477154">Parse’s (2008a)</xref> leading-following model, “<italic>persistently pursuing excellence is revering others with vigilantly attending</italic>” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0894318413477154">Parse, 2008a</xref>, p. 371), highlights the notion of <italic>persistently pursuing excellence</italic> in leading-following. The processes of persistently pursuing excellence are <italic>revering others</italic> and <italic>vigilantly attending</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0894318413477154">Parse, 2008a</xref>). <italic>Revering others</italic> is “honoring the uniqueness of individuals by not expecting each person to contribute to the vision in exactly the same way” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0894318413477154">Parse, 1997</xref>, p. 109). Honoring uniqueness means being available to possibilities suggested by individuals, being flexible with how and when persons contribute to pursuing the vision, and trusting persons to do their best. This requires leaders and followers to acknowledge and act on the belief that everyone has a part to play in cultivating the vision and that everyone cocreating the situation has the wisdom to contribute to the pursuit of excellence in a meaningful way. Honoring uniqueness “happens with vigilant attending to others, as persons seek to be unique and at once like others who are living the vision” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0894318413477154">Parse, 2008a</xref>, p. 373).</p>
<p>The second process of persistently pursuing excellence, <italic>vigilantly attending</italic>, means “cautiously witnessing with wisdom the emergence of ideas and programs and heeding with graciousness the surprises that unfold with the inevitable uncertainty that accompanies new endeavors” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0894318413477154">Parse, 2008a</xref>, p. 373). Cautiously witnessing involves being focused on what is happening, giving persons full attention, setting up systems and structures to watch progress with discreetness, contributing with wisdom and judiciousness, and being patient with what is unfolding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0894318413477154">Parse, 2008a</xref>). Success in any leading-following opportunity takes time, patience, flexibility, and courage. It takes standing still — unmoving, <italic>holding up the mirror</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0894318413477154">Parse, 2011</xref>), and considering who you are as a leader and a follower, what you want to stand for, and how you will show up, build relationships, live a commitment to a vision, take risks, and live a reverence for others. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0894318413477154">Parse (2008b)</xref> emphasized that nurse leaders must carve out with others the things worth pursuing. She offered:
<disp-quote>
<p>Start by planning together. Be flexible. Meet people with a spirit of availability. Reach across personal boundaries to find common ground. Acknowledge the worth of others’ ideas. Recognize loyalty. Appreciate that if you think you can or can’t, you are right. Remember that all you have is who you are. Take time for silent reflection. (p. 281)</p>

<title>A Research Culture</title>
<p>Cultivating the capacity to lead and the spirit of inquiry among all nurses is worth pursuing. The essences of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0894318413477154">Parse’s (2008a)</xref> leading-following model (<italic>deliberately innovating, potent engaging</italic>, and <italic>persistently pursuing excellence</italic>) guided the development of a research culture that fostered leadership development and a spirit of inquiry among nurses in a large multi-site teaching hospital. A research culture is “a community of professionals dedicated to excellence in the pursuit of the knowledge necessary to enhance health and quality of life. It propagates an attitude of discovery and innovation” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0894318413477154">Parse, 2007a</xref>, p. 197). Such a culture is cultivated through cocreating an infrastructure, providing education and mentorship, committing resources, and disseminating achievements. Cocreating an infrastructure is assembling qualified and energetic professionals to inspire and drive the research enterprise. Cocreating an infrastructure included building a team of dedicated research leaders (a director of research, research chairs, clinician scientists, research coordinators, innovation project managers, and university-based faculty) and enlisting the help and support of unit-based leadership teams (nurse managers, advanced practice nurses, educators) who themselves may not be familiar with the research process. Providing education and mentorship entails planning programs for nurses to learn about and be supported in leading research endeavors. Committing resources means offering research funds that are accessible to both novice and seasoned researchers. Finally, disseminating achievements involves drawing attention to what is being accomplished and celebrating the successes. The annual nursing research challenge described next is an example of <italic>deliberately innovating, potent engaging</italic>, and <italic>persistently pursuing excellence</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0894318413477154">Parse, 2008a</xref>) by creating a research culture to engage staff nurses as leaders of their own projects.</p>

<title>Nursing Research Challenge and the Humanbecoming Leading-Following Model</title>
<p>The nursing research challenge was a deliberate innovation that was intended to put a focus on cultivating nurses’ spirit of inquiry. It was designed to foster excitement about leading research projects among nurses who had little or no previous research experience so that they could contribute to achieving the vision of a research culture. The envisioned culture is one where nurses are at the forefront, leading research and innovation that enhances nursing knowledge and improves health and quality of life for patients, nurses, and other health professionals. The nursing research challenge began in 2006 and was held annually. Each year, all nursing units at a 3-site academic health science center were invited to send a group of nurses (group sizes range from 2-10) to participate. The research groups attended two workshops–one 2-day proposal development and writing workshop, and one follow-up day approximately 6 weeks later. The groups were predominantly comprised of and led by nurses in staff positions, but advanced practice nurses, nurse managers, and other interdisciplinary professionals often participated as team members. Each group was asked to indicate a broad area of interest at the time of registration. Participation was limited to 10 groups on a first-come-first-served basis. Participants attended the initial 2-day workshop where they had the opportunity to work with an expert in quantitative and qualitative research and interpersonal relationships. The participants learned about various research methods and with the expert’s guidance selected a specific phenomenon to study that was relevant to their practice. They then worked together with their group members to: create a research question related to their topic of interest, select an appropriate research method to answer the research question, and outline the content of a full research proposal. The groups had 6 weeks to develop their proposals before attending the second workshop to present their progress to their peers. The proposal presentations were judged and the group with the best developed study received first prize ($5000). Three or 4 runner-up prizes ($2500 each) were also awarded. All funds were used to assist with the costs of conducting the research project. (No funds were distributed until the study received approval from a research ethics board). During proposal development, all groups had assistance from the Director of Nursing—New Knowledge and Innovation, the expert consultant, a research coordinator who guided the research ethics approval process and provided ongoing coaching, and other research experts as necessary to facilitate proposal development and implementation.</p>
<sec id="section7-0894318413477154">
<title>Committing to a Vision and Vigorous Energizing</title>
<p><italic>Committing to a vision</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0894318413477154">Parse, 2008a</xref>) for cultivating the spirit of inquiry among staff nurses through the nursing research challenge requires <italic>being passionately present</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0894318413477154">Parse, 2008a</xref>), making connections with persons across the organization, sharing the idea of a nursing research challenge with confidence, emphasizing the possibilities that can arise when nurses lead their own research, committing resources to provide funding to the winning teams, and creating an infrastructure to support the novice research teams and to promote the nursing research challenge as an opportunity for staff nurses to lead projects that would ultimately contribute new knowledge and innovation to healthcare delivery.</p>
<p>Committing to a vision wherein the spirit of inquiry among staff nurses was cultivated required talking with participants about what is possible (particularly before the initial 2-day workshop), “inspiring the moment” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0894318413477154">Parse, 2008a</xref>, p. 372), and encouraging collaboration to develop project ideas and lead teams. The nursing research challenge workshops were opportunities for all participants to <italic>clarify their intentions</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0894318413477154">Parse, 2008a</xref>) by engaging in intense discussions and coming to an agreement about what phenomenon they wish to study, what they want to know about the phenomenon, and what method would best help them find out what they want to know. By the end of the first 2-day workshop, the groups had shared their research study outlines with one another, received input from their colleagues and from the expert workshop facilitators, and expressed a strong commitment to completing their proposals and attending the follow-up workshop to compete for funding. Each year, the nursing research challenge winners from previous years were invited to the workshops to talk about the progress of their studies. This is one of their opportunities for <italic>contemplating the beauty</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0894318413477154">Parse, 2008a</xref>, p. 372) of what they created. The nurses presented completed studies, studies in progress, and stories about the trials and tribulations of being leaders of novice research teams in a large academic health science center.</p>
<p>Presentations by former nursing research challenge winners (the alumni group) also served to further <italic>arouse the imagination</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0894318413477154">Parse, 2008a</xref>) of and energize the newer participant groups. The <italic>enlivening commingling</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0894318413477154">Parse, 2008a</xref>, p. 372) of alumni groups with the new participant groups helped all to see what “<italic>forging a path</italic>” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0894318413477154">Parse, 2008a</xref>, p.372) was like. Being engaged in a competition represented a “<italic>vigorous energizing”</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0894318413477154">Parse, 2008a</xref>, p. 372), in that the competitive nature of the research challenge cocreated the energy and enthusiasm that the participant groups required to write a research proposal in 6 weeks. This energy and enthusiasm was also noticed by other nurses in the hospital setting. In several instances, other nurses helped the research teams by covering for them, completing tasks associated with the proposal writing, and later in the process, by assisting with participant recruitment. Nurse managers engaged in the competitiveness and often provided team members with some time to work on their project. The competitive aspect of the program was successful in “<italic>intensifying the intrigue</italic>” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0894318413477154">Parse, 2008a</xref>, p. 372) of the nursing research challenge. Excitement about the competition was sustained over 6 years, resulting in a waiting list of teams who wanted to participate but could not because they were not among the first 10 teams to register.</p>
<p><italic>Vigorous energizing</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0894318413477154">Parse, 2008a</xref>, p. 372) was critical to the leading-following process once the research teams began preparing for the rest of their research journey. During this time it became very important to provide support and encouragement, to offer mentorship, to focus on opportunities and challenges in implementing their research studies, and to celebrate milestones (such as, ethics approval, recruitment of the first participant, completion of data-gathering or data analysis, first presentations, publications, and others) along the way. All nurses who participated in the nursing research challenge have taken a chance and committed to their own vision of completing a study, when they did not really know all that it entailed. They took a risk to engage in something new.</p>

<title>Willingly Risking and Living with Ambiguity</title>
<p>The nursing research challenge was a process of <italic>daringly venturing forth</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0894318413477154">Parse, 2008a</xref>) for all leaders-followers engaged in the process. Leaders and followers had to <italic>advance on the edge</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0894318413477154">Parse, 2008a</xref>, p. 372), creating and embracing an innovative program that had not been done previously and that persons in academic centers and formal research positions did not value and did not think was possible. Until now, there have been no published reports of extensive programs that engage staff nurses in leading their own research studies—only many references to the barriers associated with nurses conducting research. It was a risk to engage staff nurses in research—a risk that they may not follow through with conducting the studies. In the beginning, it was impossible to predict how much support the participants would need or exactly what kinds of challenges would arise. Many challenges surfaced. Some groups lost their data, misplaced consents, forgot to renew their ethics approval, dealt with critical illnesses of team members, had difficulty recruiting an adequate sample, needed help finding additional funding sources for their study, had to overcome extreme nervousness when presenting for the first time, and many other challenges. None of the challenges were insurmountable and in most cases they cocreated opportunities that strengthened the work and the team. In all cases, the research teams have learned that taking the risk to participate (when some of their colleagues chose not to) has set them apart from others, and has led to opportunities to present at local and international meetings and conferences, to lead change initiatives on their unit related to issues that surfaced on their research journey, and to become resources for new research teams. They have become comfortable “<italic>moving with the vague”</italic> and have talked about “<italic>glimpsing the paradoxical</italic>” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0894318413477154">Parse, 2008a</xref>, p. 372) in that what they often thought were restrictions to leading their own studies actually turned out to be the opportunities that they needed to be successful. One nurse who participated on a research team that has had the study published (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0894318413477154">Thomas, Riggs, &amp; Stothart, 2013</xref>) was convinced that she could not write a report. She struggled as the team pulled together the manuscript. However, she later realized that she could write and went on to write a proposal of her own to compete for a 6-month research and innovation fellowship that she was awarded. The support of her research team members and mentors honored her unique ways of contributing to the process while attending to what had to happen to move the study to completion.</p>

<title>Revering Others and Vigilantly Attending</title>
<p>The nursing research challenge brought together groups of nurses with unique talents and different ways of contributing to the work of the teams. The importance of <italic>revering others</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0894318413477154">Parse, 2008a</xref>) in the leading-following process that happened as the teams moved through the research journey was critical. The most successful teams learned to be flexible with how and when various members contributed to the research study. In some cases they divided the work so that different members were involved more intensely than others at different times –meaning that the investigators who were most responsible for crafting the proposal or getting ethics approval were not necessarily the same persons who recruited participants, completed the data-gathering, conducted the analysis, or wrote the report. In most cases, the participants had preferences about how they wanted to be involved and they developed trust among themselves and were all expected to do what they chose. The notion of <italic>trusting the integrity</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0894318413477154">Parse, 2008a</xref>) of team members was critical to honoring the contributions of all team members and to embracing new ideas as they arose. Revering others happened with vigilantly attending to what was happening in the research teams. The leaders and formal mentors of the nursing research challenge groups revered the knowledge and contributions of the teams, while <italic>guarding with wisdom</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0894318413477154">Parse, 2008a</xref>) the scientific and ethical integrity of the research process. Providing education and mentorship to the groups included one-on-one coaching as well as creating ongoing opportunities for the nurses to learn about and to be supported in research endeavors. Also, a variety of workshops on proposal writing, critical appraisal of research, writing for publication, data analysis, ethics, and research methods were designed to build individuals’ and groups’ knowledge and confidence about leading research projects. The research challenge groups had opportunities to disseminate and share their projects and to learn from others by presenting their work at annual nursing research days. As formal leaders in this situation, the mentors have learned to follow the lead of the teams concerning how closely they need to be involved in each of the studies. In some cases the teams wanted close attention, while in other cases the teams were very independent and the mentors learned to <italic>heed with graciousness</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0894318413477154">Parse, 2008a</xref>), <italic>beholding with discreetness</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0894318413477154">Parse, 2008a</xref>) the work and progress of the groups. The progress has been remarkable. Putting a focus on developing nurses as leaders and cultivating their spirit of inquiry has made a difference.</p>
<p>In the first 6 years of the nursing research challenge (2006-2011) more than 400 nurses participated in the competition. Together, they were responsible for the generation of 31 nursing theory-guided research studies about a wide-range of topics including:</p>

</list>
<p>In 2011, the nursing research challenge studies were at various stages including proposal development (<italic>n = 10</italic>), awaiting ethics approval (<italic>n</italic> = 4), data-gathering (<italic>n</italic> = 6), data-analysis (<italic>n</italic> = 3), and completed (<italic>n</italic> = 7). One group decided not to complete its study. Of the completed studies, five have been presented and manuscripts for publication are in progress, and three have been published (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0894318413477154">Evans, Bell, Sweeney, Morgan, &amp; Kelly, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0894318413477154">Salvador, Buco, Wang, &amp; Howell, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0894318413477154">Thomas et al., 2013</xref>). In addition, almost all of the groups reached at least the data-gathering stage and presented pieces of their work in either oral or poster format at local, national, and international venues (such as in Toronto, Ottawa, Montreal, Edmonton, Beijing, Singapore, Cancun, and others).</p>
<p>Several of the research groups have been responsible for practice changes on their units. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0894318413477154">Thomas and colleagues (2013)</xref> conducted a qualitative descriptive study of the meaning of changing expectations for persons who had had their surgery cancelled on the day of surgery. The findings of their study contributed new understanding about what this experience is like for patients and their families at a large surgical program where annually 400 to 500 surgeries are cancelled and rescheduled after patients have arrived at the hospital on the day of surgery. The themes from the research were shared with the surgical team (nurses, physicians, anesthetists, and others) who said that they had never heard patients’ perspectives in this way. Subsequently, the nurses who conducted the research led the surgical team to redesign the processes associated with surgical cancellations. The redesigned process includes steps that address what they heard from their research participants. For example, the changes included letters being given to patients at their pre-operative visit that indicate the possibility of their surgery being cancelled, a streamlined re-booking process that begins before patients leave the surgical waiting area, and a change in how and what information is communicated to patients and families (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0894318413477154">Thomas et al., 2013</xref>). Another group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0894318413477154">Khorshidi et al., 2010</xref>) conducted a quasi-experimental study on the effect of patient-centered teaching on anxiety and satisfaction for those undergoing elective angioplasties. There were no significant changes, but the nurse researchers learned, from several interview questions included in the data-gathering process, that the participants wanted more information about how to care for themselves post-discharge. The nurses led the design of a follow-up education program, and they were writing a proposal for a new study to evaluate it.</p>
<p>The nurses who led both of the above studies have contributed to improving the quality of care in their areas of practice. They are now recognized as leaders among their colleagues and among formal leaders in the organization, and they have been sought to be mentors for new nurse-led research teams. Some nurses who have led nursing research challenge studies have moved on to formal leadership positions and others have begun to pursue their undergraduate or graduate degrees. The vast majority of the over 400 nurses who participated remain in staff roles and continue to provide patient care while leading initiatives from where they stand.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The leading-following model developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0894318413477154">Parse (1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0894318413477154">2008a</xref>) provided a meaningful guide for cultivating nurses’ capacity to lead research that addressed patient-centered care and quality of work-life. Cultivating leaders with a spirit of inquiry arises with “deliberately innovating with potent engaging in persistently pursuing excellence” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0894318413477154">Parse, 2008a</xref>, p. 371). This process is lived out in committing to a vision with vigorously energizing, willingly risking amid ambiguity, and revering others with vigilantly attending (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0894318413477154">Parse, 2008a</xref>). The nursing research challenge is a testament to the fact that staff nurses are not <italic>just</italic> staff nurses. When formal nurse leaders are guided by a theoretical perspective that reveres individuals’ desires and abilities, the context and practice of nursing is enriched.</p>
