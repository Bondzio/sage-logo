<abstract>
<p>Different composites were prepared from natural rubber/styrene butadiene rubber blends (50/50) using fixed 40 wt% content of silica, high-abrasion furnace carbon black, clay and titanium dioxide. The obtained composites were vulcanized using gamma irradiation up to 250 kilogray. The effect of fillers and irradiation dose on the mechanical properties such as tensile strength, tensile modulus at 100% elongation, elongation at break and hardness have been investigated. The %gel content and swelling number as physical properties, scanning electron microscope have been carried out as a function of absorbed dose for the blend and composites. The nature and particle size of filler and irradiation dose have a great effect on the mechanical properties. All studied properties of filled blend were enhanced; the reinforcing ability of the filler increased in the order of Hisil &gt; high-abrasion furnace carbon black &gt; clay &gt; titanium dioxide. Scanning electron microscope studies of filled blend and unfilled blend have been carried out. The variation in properties was correlated with the morphology of the system.</p>

<sec id="sec1-0731684412440515" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>The use of blends of rubber is widespread, the purpose being to obtain a balance of properties, including cost, which one elastomer alone cannot give. The commercial importance of polymer blends is increasing since the performance of polymers can be improved by simple blending of commercially available polymers in order to fulfill industry needs for high-performance materials.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0731684412440515">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0731684412440515">2</xref></sup> Synthetic rubbers may therefore be blended with natural rubber (NR). These compounds are capable of forming a chemical link between these dissimilar rubbers to produce a new product exhibiting enhanced properties.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0731684412440515">3</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0731684412440515">7</xref></sup> It is known that incorporation of filler into a binary polymer immiscible blend can affect the phase separation due to the interaction of the individual components of the blend with the filler surface.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0731684412440515">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>Fillers are known to play a functional role such as improving the stiffness of surface finish of polymer. Moreover, its addition to polymers is a means of achieving new combinations of properties and expanding their range of applications.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0731684412440515">9</xref></sup> Fillers are divided into reinforcing and nonreinforcing types depending on whether they enhance the properties of compound or act simply as extenders. The important parameters that control the mechanical behavior of filled polymer blends are the physicochemical properties of the constituents, polymer–filler interactions, particle shape and their aggregation, particle dimensions and the distribution and dispersion of filler in each phase of the blend.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0731684412440515">8</xref></sup> Blends reinforced with fillers generally show an increase in modulus, hardness, tensile strength (TS) and abrasion and tear resistance, as well as resistance to fatigue and cracking. In some incompatible polymer blends, compatibilization can be achieved by the addition of large amount of filler.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0731684412440515">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0731684412440515">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>NR possesses good dynamic and mechanical properties and behaves as crystallizable polymer under strain conditions due to orientation of the polymer chain that occurs. Styrene butadiene rubber (SBR) is an easily processable, hard and flexible rubber. Blends of fixed ratio (50/50) by weight were used; fillers such as silica, high-abrasion furnace (HAF) carbon black, clay and titanium dioxide (TiO<sub>2</sub>) were used. Silica and carbon black are known to represent the most widely used reinforcing filler in rubbers. Silica which is white powder known to be one of the most efficient nonblack reinforcing fillers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0731684412440515">9</xref></sup> Clay act as a mineral filler in many polymeric systems and TiO<sub>2</sub> is an important industrial pigment additive because it provides a high level of hiding power and brightness at low loading levels.</p>
<p>Vulcanization by ionizing radiation such as gamma ray or accelerated electrons of rubber-based compounds have its efficiency specifically in nonusage of additive such as accelerators and activators which are necessary for classical vulcanization methods. Moreover, the application of this method in vulcanization of NR/SBR blends filled with different types of fillers, namely Hisil, HAF carbon black, clay and TiO<sub>2</sub>, has not been reported before.</p>
<p>The present work focuses mainly on the effects of these fillers as well as irradiation dose on different mechanical and physical properties. Moreover, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) studies on fractured surfaces of unfilled as well as filled blends have been carried out.</p></sec>

<p>The TS as a function of irradiation dose for NR/SBR (50/50) blend and its composites are depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0731684412440515">Figure 1</xref>. From this figure, it can be seen that the values of TS of unfilled blend slightly increased with the increase of absorbed dose up to 150 kGy and then slightly decreased. The increase in TS values may be due to the limited cross-linking density which is ascribed to the resonance stabilization and the protective effect of phenyl groups of SBR rubber;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0731684412440515">12</xref></sup> whereby, the decrease in TS values may be due to the degradation process.
<fig id="fig1-0731684412440515" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Effect of irradiation dose on tensile strength of natural rubber (NR)/styrene butadiene rubber (SBR) blend filled with different fillers.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0731684412440515-fig1.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>It can be seen that TS values increased with absorbed dose significantly for filled composites with respect to the values of unfilled and unirradiated ones. The increase in the TS values with irradiation dose may be attributed to induced cross-linking by irradiation, as well as interface linking between filler and matrix rubber. Moreover, it is very important to notice that the values of TS of composites at the same irradiation dose increase with the addition of filler. From the data obtained in this figure, the reinforcing capacity of the fillers follows the order
<disp-formula id="disp-formula3-0731684412440515"><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0731684412440515-eq3.tif"/></disp-formula></p>
<p>This order of reinforcing capacity of fillers is particularly shown for doses higher than 100 kGy, apparently due to synergistic effect between dose and filler capacity.</p>
<p>This indicates that both silica and HAF carbon black fillers have experienced reinforcing character to the NR/SBR blend; however, the nature of the reinforcing is different for both the fillers. In the case of silica, its reinforcement is attributed specifically to the adhesion type of interaction between the amorphous fillers and the polymer macromolecules. Moreover, in case of HAF carbon black, its reinforcement is attributed to the presence of active groups on its surfaces which participated in physical as well as chemical bond formed at the interface between the filler and rubber matrix. On irradiation<sup>13</sup> its particles were found in the form of aggregates and agglomerates forms. It has been reported that small particle size of the fillers is of prime importance in elastomer reinforcement, whereas, the chemical nature of filler appears to be of secondary importance. The dependence of reinforcement on particle size has been observed in the particle size range of 10–100 nm.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0731684412440515">14</xref></sup> The relatively very small particle size of the particles of Hisil, (∼20 nm) ∼150 m<sup>2</sup>/g, is far below the size of about 100 nm, which is always considered as a high upper limit for particulate fillers to start acting as reinforcing filler.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0731684412440515">15</xref></sup> The size of silica particle is less than the distance between cross-link sites of ∼50 nm; hence, it allows for high adhesion to take place and hence high reinforcement is attained.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0731684412440515">16</xref></sup></p>
<p>In the case of HAF carbon black, particle size of the particles of HAF is (0.04 µm) ∼80 m<sup>2</sup>/g.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0731684412440515">14</xref></sup> The presence of different active centers on its surface participate in the formation of chemical as well as physical bonding between the filler and the matrix molecules; thereby, improving the TS of the blends. However, the surfaces of carbon black filler act as stress homogenizers allowing slippage and redistribution of stress among polymer chains. They also serve to deflect or arrest growing cracks.</p>
<p>In the case of clay-filled systems, particle size of the particles of clay is 2 µm, the increase in TS values with respect to unfilled and irradiated composites may be due to the intercalation and the exfoliation between the polymer matrix and clay.</p>
<p>Among the different filled systems, TiO<sub>2</sub>-filled blends exhibit the least TS values. This is due to the weak semi-reinforced nature of TiO<sub>2</sub>. Here, TiO<sub>2</sub> acts merely as an extender. Particle size of the particles of TiO<sub>2</sub> is 12 µm.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec14-0731684412440515"><title>Tensile modulus at 100% elongation</title>
<p>In this investigation, the tensile modulus has been reported at 100% elongation and referred to as <italic>M</italic><sub>100</sub>. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0731684412440515">Figure 2</xref> illustrates the variation of <italic>M</italic><sub>100</sub> values as a function of irradiation dose for the NR/SBR vulcanizates as well as its composites.
<fig id="fig2-0731684412440515" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p>Effect of irradiation dose on tensile modulus at 100% elongation of natural rubber (NR)/styrene butadiene rubber (SBR) blend filled with different fillers.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0731684412440515-fig2.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>It may be observed that the values of <italic>M</italic><sub>100</sub> for NR/SBR blend as well as its composites increased with the incorporation of fillers and with irradiation dose up to 250 kGy. The increase followed the same trend as TS, that is
<disp-formula id="disp-formula4-0731684412440515"><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0731684412440515-eq4.tif"/></disp-formula></p>
<p>Moreover, it may be observed that the increase of <italic>M</italic><sub>100</sub> with irradiation is semi-linear and appreciable for all samples. The order given above is attributed to the nature of the filler and the extent of its participation in the value of <italic>M</italic><sub>100</sub> of composite which is known to be additive in nature.</p>
<p>The ‘structure’ state prevails in Hisil as well as HAF carbon black; whereby, particles of the filler adhere strongly to each other in the form of aggregates. This state of aggregation is expected to exist under the condition of measurement of <italic>M</italic><sub>100</sub>,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0731684412440515">17</xref></sup> that is, extension up to 100%. Hence, the contribution from aggregates, which represents a separate solid phase in the composite, would be expected to be appreciable. Apparently, the number of particles of Hisil in its aggregates is larger than those of carbon black in its aggregates and hence the higher values of <italic>M</italic><sub>100</sub> for composites loaded with Hisil. It is also possible to assume that the adherence of the particles to each other in case of Hisil is larger than in case of HAF carbon black.</p>
<p>On the other hand, both clay and TiO<sub>2</sub> do not exist in this aggregate state and their particles are distributed separately in the rubber matrix and hence its limited contribution to the value of <italic>M</italic><sub>100</sub>.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec15-0731684412440515"><title>Elongation at break</title>
<p>The third mechanical property that has been followed up is the %<italic>E</italic><sub>b</sub>, the variation in %<italic>E</italic><sub>b</sub> with absorbed dose is illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0731684412440515">Figure 3</xref>. It may be observed that the value of %<italic>E</italic><sub>b</sub> of unirradiated samples lie higher with respect to corresponding ones of irradiated compositions and the magnitude of these latter values has decreased after irradiation with the lowest dose of irradiation, namely 50 kGy. For all compositions, the value of %<italic>E</italic><sub>b</sub> encounters again a noticeable decrease on irradiation up to 250 kGy. As shown previously in TS results, the decrease in %<italic>E</italic><sub>b</sub> values is in the following order
<disp-formula id="disp-formula5-0731684412440515"><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0731684412440515-eq5.tif"/></disp-formula>
<fig id="fig3-0731684412440515" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p>Effect of irradiation dose on elongation at break of natural rubber (NR)/styrene butadiene rubber (SBR) blend filled with different fillers.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0731684412440515-fig3.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>This order is the reverse of the one given in case of TS measurements; however, it is an expected one as the higher the extent of linking, whether physical or radiation-induced cross-linking, the higher the resistance to elongation, this may be due to stiffening of the matrix by Hisil and HAF and hence the lower the attained value of %<italic>E<sub>b</sub></italic>. Hence, the data obtained from %<italic>E<sub>b</sub></italic> measurements offer further confirmation to the ones obtained from TS measurements.</p>
<p>Accordingly, both Hisil and HAF carbon black have acted clearly as reinforcing fillers; whereas, clay showed semi-reinforcing behavior and TiO<sub>2</sub> a limited one.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec16-0731684412440515"><title>Hardness</title>
<p>For all tested samples, the hardness increased in a semi-linear way with increase in absorbed dose up to 250 kGy as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0731684412440515">Figure 4</xref>. The hardness of the blend NR/SBR increase slightly for unfilled blend but more significantly for filled composites.
<fig id="fig4-0731684412440515" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><p>Effect of irradiation dose on hardness of natural rubber (NR)/styrene butadiene rubber (SBR) unfilled blend and filled ones with different fillers.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0731684412440515-fig4.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>On the other hand, the incorporation of Hisil, HAF carbon black, clay and TiO<sub>2</sub> as fillers played a significant role in elevating the values of hardness, when compared for unirradiation or at same irradiation doses. Here again, the values of hardness attained by composites follow the order
<disp-formula id="disp-formula6-0731684412440515"><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0731684412440515-eq6.tif"/></disp-formula></p>
<p>Apparently, the particle shape and the filler–matrix adhesion played the effective role in determining its contribution to the hardness value. In this respect, both silica and HAF carbon black are characterized by existing in its ‘structure’ state as well as very high adhesion to the matrix. Clay, on the other hand, exist in a ‘platy’ form which possess low adhesion to matrix.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0731684412440515">18</xref></sup> Moreover, TiO<sub>2</sub> exist in powder form which causes weak adhesion to the matrix.</p></sec></sec>

<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0731684412440515">Figure 5</xref> illustrates the variation in %gel content of different samples, that is, the insoluble part of rubber composition in boiling benzene as a function of the dose of irradiation of unfilled as well as filled NR/SBR blend with different types of fillers. It may be observed that the absorbed dose of 50 kGy was sufficient to induce three-dimensional cross-linking, that is, gel formation in unfilled as well as filled NR/SBR blend. Over the whole range of irradiation, the NR/SBR blend attained the lowest values of %gel content; whereas, the Hisil-filled blend showed the highest %gel content. It can also be observed that %gel content values for NR/SBR blend and filled one with the four different fillers increase progressively with increasing the irradiation dose from 50 to 250 kGy. The extent of increase depends on the type of filler and irradiation dose. This increase can be attributed to the possibility of phase as well as interphase radiation-induced cross-linking as a result of the formed free radicals in NR, SBR and filler. Apparently, the semi-reinforcing property of clay and TiO<sub>2</sub> has manifested itself in %gel content measurements and that the role played by interface-interaction between filler particles and elastomer-matrix, under the effect of irradiation, is a significant one. The data of %gel content for Hisil and HAF carbon black composites indicate clearly that their reinforcing capacity may be correlated with their ability to contribute significantly to %gel content and the latter property may be attributed to the intrinsic properties of these two fillers as discussed before.

<p>The gel fraction data of Hisil-filled blend were analyzed using the Charlesby–Pinner equation to determine whether cross-linking or chain scissions were more prevalent during the irradiation process. According to Charlesby and Pinner,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0731684412440515">21</xref></sup> sol fraction (<italic>S</italic>) is calculated from gel fraction (1 – gel fraction) and described in terms of radiation dosage (<italic>D</italic>) applied to the sample as follows
<disp-formula id="disp-formula7-0731684412440515"><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0731684412440515-eq7.tif"/></disp-formula>
where μ<sub>1</sub> is the degree of polymerization based on the average-number molecular weight and <italic>p</italic><sub>o</sub> and <italic>q</italic><sub>o</sub> are relative quantities indicating the sensitivity of chain scission and cross-linking to irradiation. The Charlesby–Pinner plot produced a straight line as displayed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0731684412440515">Figure 6</xref>. The relative value of <italic>p</italic><sub>o</sub>/<italic>q</italic><sub>o</sub> is obtained from extrapolating the data to infinite dose (1/D ∼ 0). From the intercept (<italic>p<sub>o</sub></italic>/<italic>q<sub>o</sub></italic>) and the slope (1/<italic>q<sub>o</sub></italic>), the relative values for <italic>p</italic><sub>o</sub> and <italic>q</italic><sub>o</sub> were calculated and found to be 0.017 and 0.09, respectively. These values indicate clearly that the yield of cross-linking is predominant over chain scission during irradiation.

<p>The variation of SN values as a function of irradiation dose for unfilled NR/SBR blend, as well as filled NR/SBR blend with different fillers, is depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0731684412440515">Figure 7</xref>. As expected, raw NR/SBR blend has attained the highest values of SN values over the whole irradiation range and the values of SN for all samples decrease with increasing the irradiation dose up to 250 kGy. The latter effect may be attributed to increased magnitude of cross-linking with increased dose of irradiation.

<p>Moreover, the data given in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0731684412440515">Figure 7</xref> also indicated that NR/SBR blends filled with reinforcing fillers, namely Hisil and HAF carbon blacks, have attained, as expected, the lowest values of SN over the whole range of irradiation. On the other hand, composites filled with TiO<sub>2</sub> and clay have attained SN values higher than the above two cases. The order of the variation values of SN attained by different composites at the same irradiation dose is the same as in case of TS results but in reverse manner over the whole range of irradiation. For the sake of comparison, this order is as follows
<disp-formula id="disp-formula8-0731684412440515"><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0731684412440515-eq8.tif"/></disp-formula></p>
<p>This order is practically the reverse of the one attained by TS values at the same irradiation dose. The factors that participated in increasing the TS values, namely radiation-induced cross-linking as well as interface linking between matrix and filler, are the same which stay behind the decreasing order given above. This is due to the fact that increasing of linking is accompanied with decreasing of spacing between components of composite and hence decreasing of swelling number (SN).</p></sec></sec>

<p>The effect of different fillers on the morphology of NR/SBR blends has been followed up by SEM.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0731684412440515">Figure 8</xref> shows the SEM micrographs of the fracture surface of NR/SBR blends subjected to dose of 150 kGy, before and after loading with 40 phr of different fillers. In general, it can be observed that irradiation improved the compatibility as there is no phase separation and continuous matrix can be observed. In case of unfilled blend, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0731684412440515">Figure 8(a)</xref>, tiny, widely separated white particles observed due to ZnO ingredient with its limited content of 5 phr. On the other hand, SEM micrographs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0731684412440515">Figure 8</xref>(b)) show closely and comparatively large white ‘structures’ of filler Hisil that exists in the form of aggregates, which adhere closely to surrounding continuous polymeric matrix and hence indicating its reinforcing capacity as a filler. Similarly, such particle shape occurs in case of HAF carbon black as can be seen from micrograph (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0731684412440515">Figure 8</xref>(c)). The aggregates of HAF carbon black are apparently covered with tiny layer of polymeric matrix due to chemical as well as physical bonding between filler and matrix indicating again the reinforcing character as a filler. In case of NR/SBR blend loaded with clay, it may be observed in micrograph (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0731684412440515">Figure 8</xref>(d)) that clay exist in a ‘platy’ form accounting for its semi-reinforcing character. Micrograph (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0731684412440515">Figure 8</xref>(e)) for the fractured surface of blend loaded with TiO<sub>2</sub> indicates its existence as a separate relatively large particle, and not widely separated, indicating its limited reinforcing character.
