<title>Deafness and mental health</title>
<p>In Australia, people who use Australian Sign Language (Auslan) as their preferred mode of communication are commonly referred to as belonging to the Australian Deaf community.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1039856212458981">1</xref></sup> Auslan became formally recognized as a community language in Australia in 1991<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1039856212458981">2</xref></sup> with the term coined by Johnston in 1989.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1039856212458981">3</xref></sup> The Australian Deaf Community is described as a network of people who share a language and culture and a history of common experiences.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1039856212458981">4</xref></sup> This paper refers predominantly to people who are Deaf (culturally Deaf individuals who are users of Sign Language), as opposed to people who are ’deaf’ (those with audiological loss). Although more homogenous than the audiologically deaf population, the Deaf population of Australia is acknowledged to be heterogeneous in their social and educational experiences and communication preferences. Literacy levels and fluency in Sign Language also vary.</p>
<p>Conflicting data exists in relation to the prevalence of mental illness in the Deaf population.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1039856212458981">5</xref></sup> At a minimum, Deaf people experience a prevalence of mental illness equal to that of the hearing population.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1039856212458981">1</xref></sup> An Australian study of Deaf children and adolescents described them as frequently expressing feelings of isolation and loneliness, low self-esteem, difficulty in forming a sense of self, difficulty sustaining friendships, and being teased or bullied at school.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1039856212458981">6</xref></sup> A 2006 study of Australian Deaf adolescents indicated that clinically significant emotional and behavioral problems in deaf adolescents were higher than that of the general population.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1039856212458981">7</xref></sup> Some literature suggests that Deaf people have higher rates of suicidal ideation and/or attempts than hearing counterparts, and that this is often coupled with higher incidence of abuse.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1039856212458981">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1039856212458981">9</xref></sup> A recent meta-analysis of literature suggests that Deaf people may have a greater likelihood of experiencing symptoms of anxiety and depression and may be more vulnerable to experiencing psychiatric disorders.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1039856212458981">5</xref></sup> A number of factors may contribute to this, including increased social isolation and emotional vulnerability leading to higher risk of abuse; communication issues with family, particularly in a family experiencing deafness for the first time; and poor educational opportunities and limited social expectations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1039856212458981">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>Deaf mental health consumers often describe the experience of societal marginalization and invalidation. The vast majority of Deaf people are the sole Deaf individual in their family of origin, their school, neighborhood and place of work. Deaf adults often experience an invalidating environment through limited family and societal communication and learning. ‘Deaf people do not overhear their families discussing coping with emotions and few have direct conversations with family members about emotions and coping.’<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1039856212458981">9, p.402</xref></sup></p>

<title>Australia’s specialist deafness and mental health sector</title>
<p>For many within the mainstream mental health sector, the idea that the mental health care of Deaf people differs from that of hearing people, is surprising. The common assumptions are that Deaf people experience the same mental illnesses as hearing people, that they manifest in the same way, and that those conducting assessments and providing treatment do not require particular expertise other than the use of a Sign Language interpreter.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1039856212458981">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1039856212458981">12</xref></sup> Indeed, without sufficient understanding of Deaf cultural considerations and understanding of best practice when communicating with Deaf individuals, there is high potential for misdiagnosis of mental disorders.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1039856212458981">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1039856212458981">5</xref></sup> A growing recognition of the mental health care of Deaf people as a clinical discipline has been forming over the last half of the twentieth century, through clinical research, the development of specialized services and programs for Deaf mental health service consumers and programs for clinicians to develop skills in this area.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1039856212458981">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1039856212458981"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1039856212458981">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>While specialist services for Deaf and hearing impaired mental health consumers are reasonably well established in many countries (e.g. Austria, UK, USA), this sector is in its infancy in Australia.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1039856212458981">16</xref></sup> Currently, while there are some referral and support networks established in large urban areas for Deaf children, there are no comprehensive specialist mental health teams for this population.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1039856212458981">17</xref></sup> To date, Queensland’s State-wide Consultation Service-Deafness and Mental Health is the only specialized service for the adult Deaf population within Australia.</p>

<title>Dialectical behavior therapy</title>
<p>Dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) is a form of therapy developed by Linehan<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1039856212458981">18</xref></sup> and is considered to be a well validated approach for individuals with borderline personality disorder (BPD) and those with chronic suicidal ideation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1039856212458981">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1039856212458981"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1039856212458981">21</xref></sup> Since its original inception, DBT has been adapted for a variety of different settings and client groups. It has been adapted and found useful in adolescent populations,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1039856212458981">19</xref></sup> elderly depressed individuals, families and couples.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1039856212458981">9</xref></sup> It has been modified for inpatient settings<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1039856212458981">21</xref></sup> and for use with clients with eating disorders and for individuals with BPD with comorbid substance misuse disorders.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1039856212458981">9</xref></sup> An important aspect of DBT is the use of validation strategies which are said to be associated with treatment retention.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1039856212458981">9</xref></sup> Four core skills modules are taught in a classroom setting: mindfulness, interpersonal effectiveness, distress tolerance and emotional regulation. Recent work by the Deaf Wellness Centre, University of Rochester has focused on the modification of DBT for Deaf individuals.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1039856212458981">9</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1039856212458981" sec-type="methods">
<title>Method</title>
<p>A DBT informed pilot program was implemented with a small group of four Deaf outpatient mental health service consumers who gave written consent (using an interpreter) to participate and assist in the cultural adaptation of the DBT manual. The program was developed in consultation with the Deaf community via representation of Queensland’s peak Deaf and hearing impaired organizations and consumer and carer representatives on a steering committee.</p>
<p>Participants had been diagnosed (by the team psychiatrist) with depression with borderline personality traits (<italic>n</italic>=2), depression (<italic>n</italic>=1) and panic disorder (<italic>n</italic>=1). Literacy levels varied within the group from post-graduate university level to junior high school. While none of the participants had been exposed to Auslan prior to commencing school, all members were considered to be at least moderately fluent Auslan users.</p>
<p>The program was conducted over a nine-month period with a total of 23 group sessions provided in Auslan with the assistance of two interpreters. Individual weekly counseling sessions were offered with individual email support made available to participants (in lieu of telephone counseling). The consumers struggled with issues of asserting themselves within the dominant hearing society and an inability to understand and cope with overwhelming emotions during periods of stress. The treating team considered that a DBT informed group therapy program may be useful in assisting the participants to develop the skills of, interpersonal effectiveness, emotional regulation and crisis management.</p>
<p>The project team comprised a psychiatrist with extensive experience in both deafness and mental health and DBT, a nurse counselor, a clinical nurse specialist, two professional Auslan interpreters and a project officer (research). The team worked with the participants to adapt DBT material to suit the target audience. The resources developed by Linehan for DBT were amended to suit the needs of the Australian Deaf mental health consumers who participated. These modifications have not been endorsed by Marsha Linehan and as such the therapy was ‘DBT informed’ rather than a strict adherence to the original program.</p>

<title>Adapting health information for a Deaf audience</title>
<p>The Deaf community of Australia uses Australian Sign Language as their predominant mode of communication. This means for the majority of signing Deaf people English is at best a second language.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1039856212458981">1</xref></sup> As nearly all health education materials are produced in English, and from a hearing cultural perspective, Deaf people often face great difficulty in accessing and understanding information they need. Many Deaf people also miss out on information garnered through overhearing events and interactions around them, particularly in non-signing home environments and at school.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1039856212458981">22</xref></sup> This lack of incidental learning throughout the lifespan intensifies the fund of information deficit common to the Deaf community.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1039856212458981">15</xref></sup> Modification to the materials used in DBT thus needed to reflect these linguistic, cultural and knowledge gap concerns.</p>
<p>A robust model for successfully adapting DBT for a Deaf audience has been described by Pollard.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1039856212458981">15</xref></sup> This adaptation used by the University of Rochester’s Deaf Wellness Center involves a rigorous system of translation and cultural adjustment. The product includes DVD resources in American Sign Language and visual resources that cater for higher and lower levels of English literacy.</p>
<p>The DBT informed pilot program described in this paper, made similar efforts to adapt materials to the Australian Deaf community context. Key learning points in the materials were identified and an Auslan ‘script’ was created with supplementary information to address the common Australian Deaf knowledge gaps and sociocultural experience. The ASL DVD was reviewed by a Deaf person fluent in Auslan and ASL and one of the participants prior to the group. The research group reviewed other resources that had been adapted by the Rochester group prior to the group, and during the group participants gave feedback on the material. Visual resources were created by use of diagrams, pictures and limited text as well as medium level English literacy resources. Resources included culturally appropriate examples, and additional information to scaffold learning around any knowledge gaps in the group. It has been identified that future iterations of the DBT informed program should include video resources with Australian Sign Language. A DBT informed therapy manual is currently in development to assist therapists when working with Deaf mental health consumers. It is important to note that this pilot program was not verified by Behavioral Tech, LLC, the organization formed by Marsha Linehan for the provision of training in DBT.</p>

<sec id="section10-1039856212458981">
<title>Evaluation</title>
<p>Formal evaluation of therapeutic programs for Australian Deaf mental health consumers can be challenging. The current dearth of assessment tools which are valid for this population results in a limited range of quantitative options. A review of literacy levels for Australian Deaf adults indicated that levels are often in the lower primary school age range.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1039856212458981">23</xref></sup> As such, the use of routine pen written assessment instruments is, in many cases, considered to be inappropriate for use with Deaf mental health consumers, even when administered with a sign language interpreter.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1039856212458981">24</xref></sup></p>
<p>Recent work undertaken in Australia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1039856212458981">24</xref></sup> has resulted in the development of the Outcome Rating Scale (ORS-Auslan), which at the time of writing is the only consumer rated outcome measure deemed to be suitable for Deaf consumers. The ORS-Auslan is used routinely in the service. This pilot program utilized the ORS-Auslan at commencement of each session, as well as a brief session rating scale (SRS-Auslan) at the end of each session. Each week participants were asked to score, out of 10, a rating for their personal well being, their family and close relationships, their social or work situation and their overall sense of well being.</p>
<p>Three approaches were utilized by the treatment team in evaluating the effectiveness of a DBT informed approach. The first was the use of the ORS-Auslan to monitor individual progress and the SRS-Auslan to monitor therapeutic alliance at each session. Secondly, feedback and suggestions for improvement was elicited at the completion of each session from participants using the SRS-Auslan tool. Finally, feedback sessions including all team members occurred each week, as well as at seven weeks post program completion when a questionnaire was used to gather qualitative data.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1039856212458981" sec-type="results">
<title>Findings</title>
<p>Of the four participants, three (75%) completed the whole program of 23 sessions. One participant withdrew after 12 sessions due to the commencement of full time employment. Of the remaining three, average attendance was 21.3 sessions (range 19–23). Overall feedback indicated that the program was well received and resulted in positive outcomes for the participants. In the seven week post completion feedback session, all of the participants were able to identify specific skills that they were using, and could explain the usefulness of the skill in certain situations and everyday life. One of the participants described how the program impacted on their functioning as follows:<disp-quote>
<p><italic>DBT was useful for me as I learned different skills that I can use to deal with situation calmly and rationally. For example, when I am angry I can stop myself from reacting and go for a walk to calm myself down and use mindfulness to get rid of the negative thoughts</italic>.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>While ORS and SRS data was collected, as mentioned previously, consent to participate in the program did not include permission to publish these results. This data was used to monitor individual progress throughout the program.</p>
<p>A high level of Deaf cultural awareness is required for those who intend to provide therapeutic programs to this population. A requirement for the inclusion of Deaf culturally relevant experiences in group activities and role plays, such as ways to be assertive with hearing individuals, was identified by both participants and team members. While the project team are considered to have a reasonable level of Deaf cultural awareness, delivery of therapeutic programs by Deaf clinicians would be highly beneficial.</p>
<p>The project team identified that a more intensive approach to clinician training would be an important consideration in the delivery of future therapy programs. This is consistent with the results of an Australian DBT study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1039856212458981">20</xref></sup> which indicated an association between the level of clinicians DBT training and patient outcomes.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-1039856212458981" sec-type="conclusions">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>In our experience, a DBT informed therapy approach complements individual narrative therapy for Deaf mental health consumers. DBT has been a useful therapy for people who have experienced invalidating developmental environments. This pilot study has shown it is a therapy that can be adapted for Deaf mental health consumers who frequently describe invalidating experiences.</p>
<p>Further work for this group includes plans to develop a DBT informed skills manual and handouts that have been tailored to meet the needs of this target group. The potential need for dual resources for higher and lower English and Auslan literacy levels is a future consideration for the delivery of programs for this population. The development of program resources in Auslan, using a DVD format, is a future aspiration.</p>
<p>Further research may include comparisons of therapeutic approaches for the Deaf population. Objective measures of skill attainment that are culturally valid will need to be developed to prove this empirically.</p>
