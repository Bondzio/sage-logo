<abstract>
<p>Taking issue with Hobson and Lawson’s rejection of the historical turn, this article argues that what is at stake in the turn is the type of knowledge of politics International Relations scholars should produce, and the relationship between theory and practice. The relevant issues are not, then, exhausted by answering the question ‘What is history in International Relations?’; instead, the turn forms part of a wider movement in the social sciences away from neo-positivism and its deficient vision of history. The article follows one line of thought on non-neo-positivist International Relations and its relationship to history that seeks to emphasise the centrality of historical knowledge to political <italic>praxis</italic> understood as practical wisdom or <italic>phronēsis</italic>. However, while a turn is thus to be welcomed, because the impact of International Relations knowledge lies ultimately in the relationship between the academy and politics, the stakes of the historical turn lie beyond International Relations, adequately historical or not.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Recent years have witnessed a proliferation of reflections on the relationship between International Relations (IR) and H/history.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0305829812445232">4</xref></sup> This ‘historical turn’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0305829812445232">5</xref></sup> has seen scholars assess IR’s historical consciousness,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0305829812445232">6</xref></sup> advocate dialogue with international historians,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0305829812445232">7</xref></sup> lobby against interpretive closure of historical events,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0305829812445232">8</xref></sup> rediscover the historical orientation of the English School,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0305829812445232">9</xref></sup> identify narrative as an inherent feature of explanation,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0305829812445232">10</xref></sup> consider the assumptions about temporality embedded in different IR theories,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0305829812445232">11</xref></sup> examine IR’s historiography,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0305829812445232">12</xref></sup> and outline the potential of historical sociology,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0305829812445232">13</xref></sup> to name just a few of their varied contributions. Most of the debate’s participants support a historical turn. As Duncan Bell observes, ‘History, in its various manifestations, plays an essential, constitutive, role in shaping the present’; in mainstream IR, he goes on, ‘this has often been disregarded’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0305829812445232">14</xref></sup> Moves to bridge the ‘eternal divide’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0305829812445232">15</xref></sup> between the two disciplines are thereby widely viewed as welcome.</p>
<p>In a powerful statement in this journal, however, John Hobson and George Lawson argue that no historical turn is, in fact, necessary, since IR is already intensely historical.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0305829812445232">16</xref></sup> They support this claim by constructing a four fold typology of modes of historical analysis in IR, consisting of ‘history without historicism’ (e.g. Neorealism), ‘historicist historical sociology’ (e.g. constructivism), ‘traditional history’ (diplomatic history) and ‘radical historicism’ (deconstructionism).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0305829812445232">17</xref></sup> Each of these, they suggest, is a valid approach to historical study. Taking a specific ‘turn’ therefore can have no other effect than to privilege one of the ways IR scholars already ‘do’ history without warrant. IR should instead embrace the pluralistic character of historical scholarship within its boundaries.</p>
<p>With this important debate ongoing,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0305829812445232">18</xref></sup> in this article I ask ‘What is at stake in the historical turn?’ Addressing myself specifically to Hobson and Lawson, I argue that what is at stake is the very type of knowledge of international politics IR scholars should aim for, and hence the relationship between theory and practice in international affairs. Like other contributors, I show that the surge in interest in history in IR must be understood as part of a wider movement in the social sciences as a whole away from neo-positivism<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-0305829812445232">19</xref></sup> – a broad philosophical position on human knowledge and its creation that views deductive analysis of empirical sense-data as the sure road to <italic>scientific</italic> truth, as opposed to knowledge gained through argumentation, belief, faith and so on, equated with non-science.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-0305829812445232">20</xref></sup> Neo-positivism’s dominance in the human sciences has clear disciplinary consequences, one of which is to relegate history to a storehouse of context-free ‘data’ and historical knowledge to second-class status. Hobson and Lawson’s call for a pluralistic world of historical approaches therefore elides the crucial fact that <italic>there is much more at stake in the historical turn than different ways of ‘doing’ history</italic>. Also at issue is the type of knowledge of contemporary international politics IR scholars should produce – specifically, decontextualised and general versus particular and contextual – and what role historical analysis itself – of whatever variety – should play in its creation. Hobson and Lawson’s scheme is not rejected, but further questions are raised that necessitate a move beyond it.</p>
<p>In making such a move, I trace a strand of thought in recent social theory associated with the work of Hans Georg Gadamer,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-0305829812445232">21</xref></sup> one that has sought to restore to a position of prominence within the social sciences a different type of knowledge than the objective generalisable knowledge associated with neo-positivism – namely, practical knowledge, or what Aristotle called <italic>phronēsis. Phronēsis</italic> is defined in explicit contrast to <italic>technē</italic>, or technical know-how, and <italic>epistēmē</italic>, scientifically reproducible knowledge. The importance of history for <italic>phronēsis</italic> lies in the way in which <italic>phronēsis</italic> is a type of knowledge oriented towards acting in a just, wise and appropriate manner in specific historical contexts, unlike the generalisable and context-free knowledge directed to instrumental action that is the domain of neo-positivism. <italic>Phronēsis</italic> is therefore better nurtured by historicist and interpretive approaches to the study of politics than the technical and scientific modes utilised by neo-positivists.</p>
<p>Taking this line of thought to its logical conclusion, however, highlights that the stakes of the historical turn ultimately lie beyond IR and the social sciences, in the relationship between academic knowledge production and the world of politics. This is because there is no final <italic>philosophical</italic> answer to the question of what type of knowledge IR scholars should aim for, and therefore no answer based on whether disciplinary IR is adequately ‘historical’. The theory–practice relationship is as much a <italic>practical</italic> as a <italic>theoretical</italic> or <italic>philosophical</italic> problem, being primarily concerned with how expertise is created in a given polity, the dominant forms of knowledge and the structural links between knowledge producers and political power. These issues can – and indeed should – be studied by the social sciences, but cannot in the end be resolved by them.</p>
<p>I first demonstrate that the diversity of perspectives evident in the debate each stem from a desire to move beyond the conception of history held by neo-positivism. Placing the turn within wider discussions over the philosophy of science in IR, a second section shows that what is at issue is thus the nature of political knowledge itself. A third section explores the relationship between history, theory and <italic>phronēsis</italic>, and assesses how a greater sensitivity to history would inform a more ‘phronetic’ IR. A fourth section suggests, however, that such a turn leaves the crucial issue of the relation of IR theory to international political practice untouched. A short conclusion recapitulates the article’s main points and highlights avenues for further discussion.</p>

<sec id="section2-0305829812445232">
<title>The Historical Poverty of Neo-Positivism</title>
<p>Dissatisfaction with the relationship between IR and H/history is at base a reaction against the impoverished conception of ‘history’ characteristic of neo-positivism – which still dominates IR, particularly in the US.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-0305829812445232">22</xref></sup> For neo-positivists, history is a repository of decontextualised ‘data’ against which hypothetical propositions can be tested. For Bruce Bueno de Mesquita, ‘history is primarily a laboratory by which to test both [social scientists’] claims about how variables are associated with other and their propositions about causation’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-0305829812445232">23</xref></sup> Christopher Thorne is less tactful when he calls Clio, the muse of History, ‘IR’s call girl’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-0305829812445232">24</xref></sup> Scholars have sought to correct the IR–H/history relationship, therefore, because the deficiencies of this history-as-data-set position are manifold, as are its disciplinary consequences.</p>
<p>The importance of neo-positivism in the historical turn has remained hidden, however, because the original target was not neo-positivism itself, but the dominance during the 1980s and early 1990s of Realism, particularly Waltzian Neorealism,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-0305829812445232">25</xref></sup> which has frequently been considered coterminous with ‘science’ and ‘positivism’. The initial impetus for a turn, then, was a call for dialogue between historians and political scientists<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-0305829812445232">26</xref></sup> spurred by the failure of the dominant theories to predict the end of the Cold War<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn27-0305829812445232">27</xref></sup> – and in the case of Neorealism to conceive of its possibility.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn28-0305829812445232">28</xref></sup> The debate thus began over empirical and theoretical issues, like how to explain international change, with metatheoretical reflection coming only later. Hobson and Lawson’s contribution is critical in that regard. They make plain that while problematic in many respects, Neorealism represents <italic>a valid theory of history and historical change</italic>,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn29-0305829812445232">29</xref></sup> and is not in that sense ‘ahistorical’. The real target of the turn, therefore, and the approaches with truly deficient historical sensibilities, remain those underpinned by neo-positivism.</p>
<p>Before justifying this contention, however, it is imperative to make two points. First, the history-as-data-set position is not an arbitrary choice on the part of philosophically naive neo-positivists. It follows directly from the central tenets of neo-positivism as a set of commitments drawn from the philosophy of science – imported into political science in specific historical circumstances for progressive political purposes<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn30-0305829812445232">30</xref></sup> – and as a set of scholarly conventions. Second, and consequently, Hobson and Lawson’s attempt to settle the historical turn by posing the logically prior question of ‘What is history in IR?’, which elides the fundamental issue of the relationship between neo-positivism and history, does not exhaust the issues at stake.</p>
<p>As Jackson has shown,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn31-0305829812445232">31</xref></sup> neo-positivism is based on two core commitments – ‘mind–world dualism’ and ‘phenomenalism’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn32-0305829812445232">32</xref></sup> – according to which the world exists independently of our minds, and the problem of knowledge creation is about finding direct experiential proof of hypothesised causal connections in it. For neo-positivists to be satisfied that they have uncovered, for instance, the causes of great power wars requires the formation of hypotheses such as ‘great power wars begin when state A feels threatened by State B’, which can then be operationalised through the derivation of observable indicators of threat perception and the start of wars. These indicators are tested against data from the great power wars that have occurred hitherto, often using statistical techniques to back up assertions of the existence of correlations considered sufficiently significant to suggest causality.</p>
<p>The use of history as a data set is thus deeply bound up with the neo-positivist understanding of scientific knowledge and the nature and purpose of theory. But this understanding of history does not hold for other approaches and methodologies, like critical realism, historical sociology and the various forms of ‘reflectivist’ theorising.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn33-0305829812445232">33</xref></sup> For critical realists, for example, who also believe in the mind-independent world and the merits of objective social science<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn34-0305829812445232">34</xref></sup> historical narratives that illustrate the effects of, say, a Hobbesian ‘culture of anarchy’,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn35-0305829812445232">35</xref></sup> can prove their arguments about the relations between causal mechanisms – here ideational international structures that predispose states to self-help – and observed outcomes – i. e. conflict. There are therefore alternative understandings of science, and its relationship to history, than that which views the former as the data-generator for the latter.</p>
<p>It is of course important to acknowledge that scholars working within the neo- positivist tradition would no doubt accept that they must radically oversimplify the very nature of ‘history’ and uniqueness of knowledge of the past in their work – just as many formal modellers acknowledge the necessary simplification of the models they create. Yet what they would also likely acknowledge is that such simplification is a necessary price to pay in order to reach adequately scientific conclusions in their research.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, that price is high. To be clear: <italic>there is no straightforward and uncontroversial answer to the question ‘What is history?’</italic> None is presupposed here. But what can be said with some certainty is that ‘history’ is not a ready-made data set. ‘History’ is constructed through remembering certain aspects of the past while forgetting others.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn36-0305829812445232">36</xref></sup> Paraphrasing Robert Cox, like theory, history too is always <italic>for someone</italic> and <italic>for some purpose</italic>;<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn37-0305829812445232">37</xref></sup> it is always bound up with present political purposes and projects.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn38-0305829812445232">38</xref></sup> Historical writing is also dependent on the availability of sources and subject to their biases, and its value is underpinned by cultural modes of remembrance that view the meaning of past events as worth remembering, which is of relatively recent origin.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn39-0305829812445232">39</xref></sup> In addition, as philosophers such as Collingwood and Oakeshott make clear,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn40-0305829812445232">40</xref></sup> what history <italic>is</italic> is very much the result of the practices of those who write it. Once again, it is not necessary to give a final answer to the question ‘What is history?’ to state that the history-as-data-set conception at the heart of neo-positivism is intensely <italic>ahistorical.</italic></p>
<p>The use of history as a repository of facts for theory testing thus leads to a number of serious analytical problems for the neo-positivist: like secondary selection bias,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn41-0305829812445232">41</xref></sup> as scholars choose to back up their arguments with the work of historians who implicitly share their understanding of the events; primary selection biases and the danger historians themselves face of repeating only what they uncover in the particular archives they consult;<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn42-0305829812445232">42</xref></sup> and the tendency to limit international history to the states system after 1648,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn43-0305829812445232">43</xref></sup> and to reify a particular European experience.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn44-0305829812445232">44</xref></sup> Moreover, these problems are not easily avoided. As Ido Oren has shown, the naturalistic methods associated with neo-positivism <italic>create</italic> historical facts at the same time as they use them as data.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn45-0305829812445232">45</xref></sup> The popular ‘democratic peace thesis’, Oren notes, rests on a reading of the meaning of ‘democracy’ <italic>back into history</italic>, thereby ordering the historical record in such a way as to lead to clear contemporary lessons.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn46-0305829812445232">46</xref></sup></p>
<p>The indirect consequences of the prominence of the history-as-data-set position is the ‘eternal divide’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn47-0305829812445232">47</xref></sup> it has helped create between IR and History, which reflects a widespread view that History and IR enjoy a division of labour whereby historians raid the archives in search of new evidence while political scientists use their hard work to test their own theories.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn48-0305829812445232">48</xref></sup> History and IR, then, are considered to do very different things. Bridging the divide has proved more difficult than initially expected,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn49-0305829812445232">49</xref></sup> therefore, as efforts have come up against a seemingly endless list of binaries largely deemed characteristic of IR as a social science, on the one hand, and History, on the other, including ‘explanation’ versus ‘understanding’, ‘nomothetic’ versus ‘idiographic’ approaches, ‘explanation’ versus ‘interpretation’, and ‘causation’ versus ‘constitution’, which has entrenched rather than dissolved the divide.</p>
<p>Hobson and Lawson therefore avoid these dichotomies by asserting that there are more ways of conceiving history than the history-as-data-set position that underpins neo-positivism.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn50-0305829812445232">50</xref></sup> Their categories – ‘history without historicism’, ‘historicist historical sociology’, ‘radical historicism’ and traditional history – usefully distinguish the different historical modes in IR, and allow the authors to note that ‘answers to the question “What is history in IR?” will necessarily vary according to where the researcher sits on this continuum of understandings of how to do historical research. Until we recognise this point, we shall be talking at cross purposes, indeed speaking different “historical” languages.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn51-0305829812445232">51</xref></sup></p>
<p>Yet, while Hobson and Lawson are correct that there are numerous answers to the question ‘What is history in IR?’, the pluralism they espouse avoids the more fundamental issue of the type of knowledge of international politics IR as a discipline should produce. Indicative here are the disparities in the value given to different forms of historical analysis in IR that Hobson and Lawson identify, such that only two of the modes can be considered mainstream within the discipline: constructivism and ‘history without historicism’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn52-0305829812445232">52</xref></sup> Of greater importance, however, is that it is not clear whether constructivism and history without historicism are by necessity adequately ‘historical’ either, because both Neorealism, neoliberal institutionalism and mainstream constructivism are typically used as sources of hypotheses that are then tested in history, in accordance with neo-positivist research practices. Even the notion of historical ‘process-tracing’ is typically used to trace the effects of causal mechanisms in single case studies in a way that is similar to the testing by large-N statistical methods.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn53-0305829812445232">53</xref></sup></p>
<p>Thus, while their contribution is invaluable, Hobson and Lawson do not succeed in negating the need for a historical turn in IR on the basis of a new taxonomy of the meaning of history in IR scholarship. The historical turn is not simply a turn <italic>towards</italic> some clearly identifiable forms of ‘history’, but a turn <italic>away</italic> from a set of methodological commitments associated with neo-positivism – commitments that necessarily <italic>entail</italic> but are not entirely coterminous with a particular and impoverished vision of history. We must go beyond their typology in order to understand the fundamental stakes of the historical turn. The next task, then, is to ask why the commitment to <italic>ahistoricism</italic> has been held so strongly in IR, before an alternative form of political knowledge can be outlined.</p>

<title>International Relations, the Philosophy of Science and the Cartesian Anxiety</title>
<p>If the poverty of neo-positivism’s vision of history is very real, as are its disciplinary consequences, what has prevented neo-positivism’s replacement with forms of political inquiry that try to overcome the problems associated with gaining adequate knowledge of the past? In short, downplaying the problems associated with history and historical knowledge in IR, and the social sciences in general, has been a way of easing what Richard Bernstein calls the ‘Cartesian anxiety’:<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn54-0305829812445232">54</xref></sup> a sense of deep foreboding that follows from the either/or choice between ultimate objective foundations upon which competing claims to knowledge of the social and political world can be rationally judged – under the umbrella of social <italic>science –</italic> and an acceptance of relativism, the view that our knowledge can only be deemed true within particular frames of reference, such as a historical context – associated with non-science.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn55-0305829812445232">55</xref></sup> What is at stake in the historical turn, then, is nothing less than the nature of science itself and its relationship to knowledge when it comes to the study of politics. The historical turn, therefore, must be viewed as a part of and not separable from the recent turn to the philosophy of science in IR.</p>
<p>The issues the turn raises are consequently numerous, as the many contributions to the ‘second great debate’ attests: these include the role of the observer in research (Is the scientist objective, or is s/he an active part of the scientific process?);<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn56-0305829812445232">56</xref></sup> the notion of theory and cumulative knowledge; the relation of theory to practice (What is theory and when and how should it be ‘applied’?); the role played by method; the nature of truth; and the place of philosophical foundations in political science.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn57-0305829812445232">57</xref></sup> These questions have been debated at length within IR recently, as scholars have drawn on the philosophy of science in search of answers to them, in order to widen IR’s scientific imagination. It is impossible to review these contributions here.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn58-0305829812445232">58</xref></sup> Instead, I will trace one line of thought in recent social theory on these issues, one that has particular prescience in relation to history, in order to assess the light it sheds on the history and philosophy of science turns.</p>
<p>This line of thought begins from Richard Bernstein’s interpretation of recent social theory, which he views as going ‘beyond objectivism and relativism’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn59-0305829812445232">59</xref></sup> As Bernstein notes, like the other binaries that have emerged during the debate over a historical turn, the ‘objectivist–relativist’ dichotomy which often frames the debate over the meaning of science in the social sciences is in fact an entirely false one, and obscures as much as it reveals.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn60-0305829812445232">60</xref></sup> Neither genuine objectivism nor pure relativism are, in fact, philosophically tenable, and are hence inappropriate means of distinguishing ‘science’ from ‘non- science’, and more useful from less useful knowledge when it comes to politics.</p>
<p>The indefensibility of pure objectivism is uncontroversial: the scientist is always conditioned by his or her social location. For us here this refers to his or her historical context, but an array of other social factors also have greater and lesser impacts on scientific research – including nationality, age, scientific culture, generation and so on.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn61-0305829812445232">61</xref></sup> The inherently social bases of science and changes in scientific knowledge was, then, Thomas Kuhn’s key insight.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn62-0305829812445232">62</xref></sup> He showed that whether in periods of revolution of scientific thought or settled periods characterised by ‘normal science’, all discoveries were made in relation to the work of others. The attempt to step outside of the social context of scientific research is doomed to failure. Objectivism is therefore better thought of as an <italic>ideal</italic>, as sociologists in particular, from Max Weber to Pierre Bourdieu, have made clear to great effect.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn63-0305829812445232">63</xref></sup></p>
<p>The rejection of relativism is significantly more controversial, but relativism too is incoherent as a philosophical notion regarding the nature of truth claims. According to Bernstein, relativism is the:
<disp-quote>
<p>conviction that when we turn to the examination of those concepts that philosophers have taken to be the most fundamental – whether it is the concept of rationality, truth, reality, right, the good, or norms – we are forced to recognize that in the final analysis all such concepts must be understood as relative to a conceptual scheme, theoretical framework, paradigm, form of life, society or culture.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn64-0305829812445232">64</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The core of relativism, then, is the idea that claims to truth are to be judged against the particular conceptual scheme – such as a historical era – in question, and not against some universal or transcendental standard. Relativism can take cultural, moral or epistemological forms, and has been advocated by thinkers like Paul Feyerabend,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn65-0305829812445232">65</xref></sup> and often applied to others like Richard Rorty<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn66-0305829812445232">66</xref></sup> and, crucially, Kuhn himself.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn67-0305829812445232">67</xref></sup> It is not to be equated with scepticism: the sceptic denies the possibility of knowing truth at all, while the relativist merely suggests that all truth is relative to a particular social space, cultural milieu, historical period and so on;<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn68-0305829812445232">68</xref></sup> skepticism should also not be equated with subjectivism, since one can be a subjectivist – and believe in the primacy of subjective personal experiences of the world – and not a relativist, and vice versa.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn69-0305829812445232">69</xref></sup></p>
<p>Pure relativism of whatever form, however, is a position few if any contemporary philosophers of science defend, not least because the truth of the relativist position breaks down as soon as its claim to validity is brought into question: ‘implicitly or explicitly, the relativist claims that his or her position is true’, yet the ‘relativist also insists that since truth is relative, what is taken as true may also be false’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn70-0305829812445232">70</xref></sup> Since it cannot be true and false at the same time, ‘One cannot consistently state the case for relativism without undermining it.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn71-0305829812445232">71</xref></sup> A pure relativist position is thus ultimately a contradiction.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn72-0305829812445232">72</xref></sup> Even Rorty, who often appears to be a prominent defender of relativism, is largely ‘concerned to show that relativism is the epithet misapplied to pragmatism by [philosophical] realists’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn73-0305829812445232">73</xref></sup></p>
<p>The upshot of dissolving the objectivist–relativist binary is that the association – direct or implied – by neo-positivist scholars that non-neo-positivist IR knowledge claims are ‘relativist’ is not only unfounded, but intellectually pernicious. Non-neo-positivists may be more comfortable with historically and culturally bounded understanding than neo-positivists, but no one argues that when it comes to social science, ‘anything goes’:<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn74-0305829812445232">74</xref></sup> truth claims must be backed up with evidence, even if it does not fit the neo-positivist mould, while systematic research is still undertaken, even if it falls short of neo-positivist understandings of ‘rigour’ and avoids questions of ultimate ‘foundations’. We should therefore dismiss the association of non-objectivist knowledge with relativism and the downgrading of its prestige.</p>
<p>Specifically in relation to history, this task entails accepting the consequences of our inescapable embeddedness in certain historical contexts and historiographical traditions. The neo-positivist history-as-laboratory position should be replaced with a vision of social science that accepts the essentially hermeneutic aspect to all scientific work Kuhn stressed – in other words, one that recognises the historically conditioned nature of not only world politics itself, but also the concepts and methodologies IR scholars themselves use to study it. To cite Bell again, we need an approach that can let us grasp the way in which ‘History, in its various manifestations, plays an essential, constitutive, role in shaping the present.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn75-0305829812445232">75</xref></sup> This conclusion raises, however, the fundamental issue of both the historical turn and the wider movement beyond neo-positivism in the human sciences: what <italic>type</italic> of knowledge is this non-neo-positivist scientific knowledge? It is to that issue we now turn.</p>

<sec id="section4-0305829812445232">
<title>History, Political Knowledge and <italic>Phronēsis</italic></title>
<p>Characterising non-neo-positivist social science and understanding its relationship to history can begin by noting that since non-neo-positivist knowledge rejects the belief in objective timeless knowledge, and is therefore inherently tied to present political contexts, it is also by necessity <italic>practical</italic> in nature. As such, the links between the historical turn and the ‘practice’ turn in IR<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn76-0305829812445232">76</xref></sup> come into full relief. Both rest on a rejection of core aspects of neo-positivism and a reconsideration of the nature of theory and practice and their relation to one another.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn77-0305829812445232">77</xref></sup> Revisiting the theory–practice divide therefore sheds further light on the stakes of the historical turn.</p>
<p>Our common-sense understanding of the relationship between theory and practice mirrors that held by neo-positivists, and views practice as a form of action characterised by the <italic>application</italic> of knowledge learnt from theory.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn78-0305829812445232">78</xref></sup> This follows from the neo- positivist notion of scientific knowledge: if hypotheses drawn from abstract sets of propositions are confirmed in objective, repeated and rigorous tests, they can be assumed to hold in application. Whether that knowledge is applied is not the concern of theory itself. But this view of the theory/practice relation is partial: ‘One of the classical functions of theory’, Bernstein notes, ‘was supposed to be its practical efficacy – its ability to help distinguish appearance from reality, the false from the true, and to provide an orientation for practical activity’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn79-0305829812445232">79</xref></sup> This sounds odd to our modern ears because of the distinction we make between theory, practice and action. Theory is supposed to provide knowledge when used in practice; again, the decision to apply it is not a function of theory. Thus, this ‘modern conceptual revolution has led to a forgetfulness about the classical – especially the Aristotelian – understanding of politics and praxis’, Bernstein goes on:
<disp-quote>
<p>The discipline of politics was once conceived of not as a theoretical study of how the political system works, but as a discipline that has as its <italic>telos</italic> a practical end: the leading of a good and just life in the polis. For many social scientists this conception of politics, however noble and inspiring, now seems apocryphal.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn80-0305829812445232">80</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>What was lost in IR with the rise to disciplinary hegemony of neo-positivism certainly was the link between international theory and the <italic>problems</italic> of international politics;<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn81-0305829812445232">81</xref></sup> the <italic>ends</italic> of international politics were not deemed the proper site of <italic>theoretical</italic> inquiry within the social science of IR. Yet, the theoretical concerns of IR scholars have mirrored international affairs closely:<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn82-0305829812445232">82</xref></sup> consider the emergence of neoliberal institutionalism amid fears of US decline,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn83-0305829812445232">83</xref></sup> or the birth of Realism at the onset of the Cold War.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn84-0305829812445232">84</xref></sup> Indeed, in the latter case, the relationship between theory and practice was explicit: as Nicholas Guilhot has shown, the participants in the 1954 Rockefeller-funded conference on international relations meant precisely to foster the emergence of a body of international theory – and non-scientific theory at that – to guide public policy.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn85-0305829812445232">85</xref></sup> Neo-positivism’s strong position, then, has weakened the traditionally intimate association between theory and practice as theory has moved away from practice towards the creation of knowledge ‘for its own sake’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn86-0305829812445232">86</xref></sup></p>
<p>However, according to Aristotle, whom Gadamer draws on at length,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn87-0305829812445232">87</xref></sup> a narrow focus on the means of political behaviour leaves out much that should be the proper concern of the scholar of political <italic>praxis</italic> properly understood, namely, the ends of (international) political life.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn88-0305829812445232">88</xref></sup> Following Gadamer’s recovery of an Aristotelian understanding of <italic>praxis</italic> is therefore instructive.</p>
<p>In his <italic>Ethics</italic>, Aristotle distinguishes the intellectual virtue of <italic>phronēsis</italic> – usually translated as ‘prudence’ or ‘practical wisdom’ – from <italic>epistēmē</italic> – scientific knowledge – and <italic>technē</italic> – technical, skill-based, knowledge. Aristotle even grants <italic>phronēsis</italic> a higher standing when it comes to the conduct of politics, because <italic>phronēsis</italic> is the type of knowledge which takes both the ends and the means of political life into account.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn89-0305829812445232">89</xref></sup> Whereas <italic>epistēmē</italic> is characterised by an understanding of what is universal and <italic>is</italic> by necessity,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn90-0305829812445232">90</xref></sup> what is able to be demonstrated as such from first principles, <italic>phronēsis</italic> is a form of knowledge in which no such first principles can be assumed to exist. It is concerned with what is context-dependent and particular, rather than what is abstract and universal. The <italic>phronimos</italic>, the one who exercises this practical wisdom, as Aristotle tells us, is he or she ‘who is able to deliberate rightly about what is good and advantageous for himself; not in particular respects, e.g. what is conducive for good health, but what is conducive to <italic>the good life generally</italic>’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn91-0305829812445232">91</xref></sup> He goes on to cite Pericles as such an individual who understood what it meant to practise good management of the state.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn92-0305829812445232">92</xref></sup></p>
<p>Some illustrations help to clarify the nature of <italic>phronēsis</italic>, how it differs from technical knowledge and its relationship to history. First, translated as ‘prudence’, <italic>phronēsis</italic> has made a strong reappearance in IR recently through a recovery of the early Realists like E.H. Carr and Hans Morgenthau.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn93-0305829812445232">93</xref></sup> These scholars were less interested than their Neorealist successors in formulating timeless laws to test in the laboratory of history than in nurturing prudential statecraft within a particular ‘tragic’ reading of human nature and history.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn94-0305829812445232">94</xref></sup> In the case of George Kennan, the need to contain Soviet influence around the world followed from a careful historical assessment of the Russian tradition of international engagement.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn95-0305829812445232">95</xref></sup> Beyond these early Realists, Machiavelli is another key reference, with the Italian political philosopher drawing throughout <italic>The Discourses</italic> and <italic>The Prince</italic> on specific instances of Roman history as examples of prudent and imprudent political action.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn96-0305829812445232">96</xref></sup></p>
<p>Second, practical knowledge is often invoked as characteristic of jurisprudence. Both Gadamer and Friedrich Kratochwil note how judges use good judgement within the particular context of the case to reach their conclusions.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn97-0305829812445232">97</xref></sup> In so doing, they ‘do’ history, and in different ways: they emplot the case within a narrative to discern its rights and wrongs; they turn to history in the form of relevant legal precedents; and they deliberate between the particular need for justice and the universal aspects of setting precedents. Again, the issue of what history <italic>is</italic> is less important than what the historical sensibility <italic>does</italic> when thinking about what can be gleaned from the past about present political concerns. Beyond jurisprudence, in politics too it is often practical understanding of the particular situation faced that is the type of knowledge required.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn98-0305829812445232">98</xref></sup> Abstract theoretical understanding of political institutions, for example, is far from irrelevant, but it must reside alongside a nuanced appreciation of the rules of the political game and the ability to judge correctly the best course of action.</p>
<p>A third illustration is drawn from the work of Clausewitz. In his reading of the second book of <italic>On War</italic>, Jon Sumida shows how Clausewitz puts forward a practical notion of theory in relation to the teaching of future generals.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn99-0305829812445232">99</xref></sup> Because it cannot be known ahead of time what mix of conditions will face the general in his capacity as decision-maker, it is only through the exposure to a large number of historical examples that the future general can hope to perform well in the field.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn100-0305829812445232">100</xref></sup> Abstract technical knowledge of the forces under his command and the topography of the battlefield mean less at that instant than the ‘genius’ that some leaders display, a notion remarkably similar to Aristotle’s <italic>phronimos</italic>, who understands in a tacit and largely unconscious way how to act wisely in a given situation in light of the historical predicament in which s/he finds her/himself.</p>
<p>The relevance of the distinction between <italic>phronēsis</italic> and <italic>epistēmē</italic> in relation to the ‘Second Great Debate’ in IR needs little elaboration. A recovery of <italic>phronēsis</italic> has the potential to provide a unifying theme to the calls for a turn to the historical by giving name to the type of knowledge of international affairs that many scholars working in the ‘classical approach’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn101-0305829812445232">101</xref></sup> have sought from a return to history: it is by necessity contextualised, playing off particular and universal, or idiographic and nomethetic forms of understanding, in the search for good political judgement, while not identical to the work of historians themselves. Not surprisingly, for these reasons <italic>phronēsis</italic> has gained interest from non-neo-positivist social scientists beyond IR.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn102-0305829812445232">102</xref></sup></p>
<p>What does ‘phronetic’ IR look like in more practical terms? A brief comparison of two recent publications is instructive. Charles Kupchan<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn103-0305829812445232">103</xref></sup> and William Wohlforth<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn104-0305829812445232">104</xref></sup> both take up the issue of the effects of shifts in the global balance of power on great power politics. But while Kupchan’s contribution can be considered to foster <italic>phronēsis</italic>, Wohlforth’s seeks more traditional neo-positivist-style knowledge claims, and therefore remains within the realm of <italic>epistēmē/technē</italic>.</p>
<p>Kupchan asks how once bitter enemies can become friends. Developing an abstract description of the stages through which zones of war within international anarchies become zones of stable peace within international societies, he assesses the suitability of that framework in a wide variety of narrative case studies, from Anglo-American rapprochement during the late 19th century to the rise and demise of Senegambian confederation during the 1980s.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn105-0305829812445232">105</xref></sup> What is important here is not Kupchan’s argument itself, but rather that his aim is not to ‘test’ his framework in a historical data set, but to develop a greater understanding of the processes of pacification among potential rivals through historical study. Crucially, Kupchan is able to conclude with a clear ethical finding relevant to the contemporary post-American world: ‘Stable peace <italic>is</italic> possible. Enemies <italic>do</italic> become friends. When international societies form, they succeed in transforming the world and enabling states to escape geopolitical rivalries that have so darkened the course of history.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn106-0305829812445232">106</xref></sup></p>
<p>Wohlforth, by contrast, asks whether unipolarity promotes peace among the major powers, and whether the return of multipolarity will increase the likelihood of war. Drawing on the social psychology of status conflict, he argues that ‘Unipolarity … generates far fewer incentives than either bipolarity or multipolarity for direct great power positional competition over status.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn107-0305829812445232">107</xref></sup> His concern, then, is to develop and test hypotheses concerning the workings of causal mechanisms of actor propensity to seek to translate material power into social status, again with implied relevance for the post-American world. But this time the findings have less apparent ethical-moral implications: because ‘status competition is more likely to plague relations between leading states whose portfolios of capabilities are not only close but also mismatched’,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn108-0305829812445232">108</xref></sup> Wohlforth concludes that ‘With two or more plausible claimants to primacy, positional competition and the potential for major power war could once again form the backdrop of world politics.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn109-0305829812445232">109</xref></sup></p>
<p>This necessarily brief comparison shows that what is important in the recovery of <italic>phronēsis</italic> is not the truth or otherwise of scientific work: both Kupchan and Wohlforth are doing social science and my aim is not to critique the work of either. Rather, it is to show that there are nonetheless different <italic>types</italic> of knowledge of international politics equally scientific approaches can aim to produce: one more contextual and directly relevant to current problems, the other abstract and with less clear lessons for policy. Importantly, they use history in different ways, one (Kupchan) more adequately historical than the other (Wohlforth).</p>
<p>This contrast leads on to a final critical point concerning Aristotle’s three intellectual virtues and the urgent need to recover <italic>phronēsis</italic> for our present predicament. For Gadamer, the contrast Aristotle draws between <italic>phronēsis</italic> and <italic>epistēmē</italic> is not as important as the one he makes between <italic>phronēsis</italic> and <italic>technē</italic>, or between practical and technical forms of knowledge. Gadamer views <italic>technē</italic> as a far more frightening threat to modern life than he does science.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn110-0305829812445232">110</xref></sup></p>
<p>In order to understand Aristotle’s conception of <italic>technē</italic> and why Gadamer views it as a threat, it is important to clarify the distinction Aristotle draws between production or making (<italic>poiēsis</italic>) and acting. Both <italic>phronēsis</italic> and <italic>technē</italic> are practical virtues, but whereas <italic>phronēsis</italic> is invoked in the particular sense of activity directed towards living well in the <italic>polis, technē</italic> is a productive state concerned with bringing an object into being, be it a building or a piece of artwork. Acting and making are therefore different in crucial respects: <italic>phronēsis</italic> is fundamentally about acting upon the existing world, not bringing a new world into being. Yet, since it is abstract in nature, technical knowledge does not deliberate over ends in the same way as <italic>phronēsis</italic>. As the type of knowledge of one skilled in a particular craft, moreover, <italic>technē</italic> can be learned and forgotten; as the exercise of proper moral and practical judgement, <italic>phronēsis</italic> cannot. What concerns Gadamer, then, is that ‘Where there is techne, we must learn it and then we are able to find the right means.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn111-0305829812445232">111</xref></sup> The existence of this type of knowledge portends his greatest fear: the domination of Method over contextualised, practical and moral knowledge, which inheres only in acting well as the situation requires. Under the dominance of <italic>technē</italic>, politics becomes little more than ‘social mechanics’.</p>
<p>Before we conclude that this means that we must reject neo-positivist work like that of Wohlforth in its entirety, however, it is important to heed Bernstein’s warning that ‘despite contemporary transformations of the meaning and scope of the practical and the technical, the point that we need to be aware of is this: the danger for contemporary <italic>praxis</italic> is not <italic>technē</italic>, but domination (<italic>herrschaft</italic>)’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn112-0305829812445232">112</xref></sup> It just so happens that the contemporary threat most clearly comes from <italic>technē</italic>. In other words, it would be as worrying if <italic>phronēsis</italic>, or ‘horse sense’ in Leo Strauss’s terms,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn113-0305829812445232">113</xref></sup> dominated political life. The rejection of the claim that <italic>technē</italic> and <italic>epistēmē</italic> are the only valuable forms of knowledge within social science does not, then, do away entirely with the importance of abstract knowledge in either politics or other spheres of life. The use of scientific polling data in modern democratic elections is the most obvious case here. Information gained through polling is a crucial part of political strategising, from the actual content of policies, to the rhetoric used to sell it. Politics is replete with examples of abstract and generalisable data underpinning practical political judgements. But acknowledging with Stephen Toulmin that ‘It is one thing to <italic>perfect</italic> an instrument; it is another to ensure that it is <italic>put to use</italic> in just, virtuous, or even rationally discriminating ways’,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn114-0305829812445232">114</xref></sup> the important question raised is not whether scientific and technical knowledge can be useful, but how, when and for whom? How is a judicious balance between objective knowledge and the use of more contextual political judgement in decision-making to be struck?</p>
<p>In light of these remarks, we can now state that what is at stake in the historical turn is nothing less than the need for a (re)turn to the practical aspects of political action, and to <italic>phronēsis</italic> as a form of knowledge that places historical understanding as central. If the quality of our political and moral life is not to suffer, and if we are to come together to address the very great problems of our age, we must defend within the discipline of IR a concern for <italic>phronēsis</italic>, together with a space for the exercise of phronetic IR that is its prerequisite. In Bernstein’s words, which are still prescient:
<disp-quote>
<p>at a time when the threat of total annihilation no longer seems to be an abstract possibility but the most imminent and real potentiality, it becomes all the more imperative to try again and again to foster and nurture those forms of communal life in which dialogue conversation, <italic>phronēsis</italic>, practical discourse and judgment are concretely embodied in our everyday practices.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn115-0305829812445232">115</xref></sup></p>

<title>The Limits of Phronetic International Relations</title>
<p>While this recovery of <italic>phronēsis</italic> reaffirms the importance of practical knowledge alongside scientific and technical forms of understanding of politics, the above quote also reveals that <italic>phronēsis</italic> as a tacit form of ‘knowing-how’ is situated within practical contexts that are structurally separate from the spheres within which theoretical or scientific knowledge is created: be it in academia, think-tanks, the media and so on. It thereby betrays the fact that at the same time as the historical turn leads us to question the strict <italic>conceptual</italic> separation of theory and practice, the logical end point of the historical turn in IR at the recovery of the notion of <italic>phronēsis</italic> also highlights another aspect of the theory–practice binary: namely, the <italic>structural</italic> relationship between practical political knowledge in international affairs and knowledge about international politics generated outside the political world. Crucially, this issue ultimately takes the turn beyond IR itself, whether adequately historical or not.</p>
<p>The existence of a structural divide between the world of politics and the world in which politics is studied has bedevilled discussions of post-positivist social science because most philosophers and social scientists have sought theoretical rather than practical answers to the problems it poses.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn116-0305829812445232">116</xref></sup> Gadamer himself is vague on the proper place of technical knowledge in his philosophical hermeneutics. As Bernstein notes:
<disp-quote>
<p>There is a fundamental unresolved ambiguity in Gadamer’s philosophy concerning the social sciences. … Sometimes … he writes as thought they are like underdeveloped natural sciences, implying that it is essential for us to realize their ‘limited relevance,’ because they never tell us how they are to be applied. <italic>Phronēsis</italic> is always required to apply the results of the social sciences. But at other times he writes as if all the social sciences, when properly understood, are to be assimilated to practical philosophy as a model of the human sciences.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn117-0305829812445232">117</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Although Gadamer is explicit in his warning against Method – ‘The search for method (…as a set of permanent, unambiguous rules) needs to be abandoned’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn118-0305829812445232">118</xref></sup>–he does not discriminate when and where technical knowledge is appropriate from when it is not. Bernstein’s assessment that ‘<italic>technē</italic> without <italic>phronēsis</italic> is blind, while <italic>phronēsis</italic> without <italic>technē</italic> is empty’,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn119-0305829812445232">119</xref></sup> is similarly vague. These authors are therefore left with the open question of how best to position technical skill alongside practical wisdom, knowing only that neither must entirely dominate the other.</p>
<p>What has been frequently overlooked, however, is that the question of the relationship between theory and practice in this sense is not a theoretical one that can be given a final answer through philosophical reflection. Rather, the relationship between the different forms of knowledge Aristotle delineates is a practical issue of how what John Gunnell refers to as ‘first order’ and ‘second order’ discourses are arranged with respect to each other.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn120-0305829812445232">120</xref></sup></p>
<p>For Gunnell, science and politics are first-order discourses that construct their objects of inquiry through their practices. Science makes intelligible the natural world for humans through its classificatory schemes and analytical categorisations. In a similar way, political practices also construct the world through the enacting of political activities. By contrast, philosophy and social science are second-order discourses – that is, they are discursive spaces and sets of institutionalised practices that exist by dint of reflecting upon first-order practices such as science and politics. To make this distinction clearer, it can be pointed out that conceiving of politics without higher-order discussions of it, such as political science, is difficult, but far from impossible; conceiving of the existence of political science without politics as a practice is, by contrast, unthinkable.</p>
<p>The upshot of Gunnell’s important argument is that the relationship between the knowledge produced by the disciplines, such as IR, and the social world they study, here international politics, is essentially a <italic>sociological</italic> and not a <italic>philosophical</italic> one. It revolves around the particular practical relationship between the sites within which knowledge of politics is produced – the academy, think-tanks, the media and so on – and the political world. It rests on issues like how separate the academy is to the political sphere. What function do academics fulfil: are they critical voices or rationalisers of the governmental line? Are scholars listened to or ignored? And which disciplines hold the most weight in political argumentation?<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn121-0305829812445232">121</xref></sup> Crucially, such relationships vary dramatically over time and between countries. Recently, for example, in a number of Western countries the rise of think-tanks with more direct links to politics than the academy has been a noted feature of the political landscape, changing the bases within which legitimate knowledge for politics and about politics is produced.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn122-0305829812445232">122</xref></sup></p>
<p>The proper relationship between theoretical and practical knowledge, therefore, cannot be answered in any final way simply by moving from one discipline to another, or from one order of discourse to another, in search of ultimate foundations for knowledge claims. As Gunnell notes, ‘Only when the metatheoretical search for transcontextual certainty is abandoned and the problem of relativism is dissolved can social science confront in an authentic manner the issue of its cognitive and practical relationship to politics.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn123-0305829812445232">123</xref></sup></p>
<p>The links between the ‘ivory tower’ and politics are particularly relevant in relation to the historical turn because scholars have so frequently sought a solution to IR’s historical poverty through the metatheoretical work of both various philosophers and methodologists of history. Indeed, my own investigation began in a similar way, drawing on the work of philosophers Bernstein and Gadamer in particular, which proves the strength of the tendency within post-positivist IR to look to philosophy in particular for some ultimate grounding for knowledge, even when the response from philosophy has been to give up on ultimate grounds. Yet, acknowledging that the theory–practice divide in IR and social science is a practical and not merely philosophical issue shows that the relevant issues opened up by the historical turn ultimately cannot be resolved <italic>by</italic> or <italic>within</italic> IR, nor by social science, History or philosophy.</p>
<p>The foregoing comments are not meant to suggest that an IR more sensitive to history and the historicity of international politics is not to be desired, rather that there are few reasons to believe that less ‘scientistic’ and more humanist approaches to the study of international relations automatically bring with them a more efficacious and just global political order. That depends on the actions of decision-makers themselves, and secondarily on the practical relationships between the creators of knowledge and its consumers in the political world. There are thus opposite dangers to those posed by <italic>technē</italic> and <italic>epistēmē</italic>: namely, elitism and an unwarranted faith in the faithful use of history in political judgement. Once again, ‘history’ must not be equated with ethics, since there is nothing at all to stop historical examples being used for evil ends.</p>
<p>Indeed, Aristotle believed that since the <italic>activity</italic> of politics was not to be conflated with knowledge generated from the <italic>study</italic> of political science, young men were unfit to study political science since prudence cannot be taught but only acquired over time.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn124-0305829812445232">124</xref></sup> This aspect of practical wisdom has led philosophers themselves to criticise <italic>phronēsis</italic> for its inherent elitism,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn125-0305829812445232">125</xref></sup> and the reliance on the good judgement of individuals can also be criticised as leaving the door open to populism. There is almost a belief that only some individuals will be naturally predisposed to display the kind of practical wisdom appropriate for politics, while others will not – that there is in any generation the <italic>phronimos</italic>, like Pericles. For Clausewitz, too, there seems to be implicit in his argument concerning history and theory a particular sociology of the relationship between the production of knowledge and its contextualised use in the training of the general, particular to the elite German military academies of his era. This forgets that the meaning of history is not fixed, and that history is not the same as ethics; there is no guarantee that deep immersion in history will naturally lead to practical wisdom.</p>
<p>However, before we are tempted to return to the sure world of <italic>technē</italic> and <italic>epistēmē</italic>, it is important to recall that there is no <italic>philosophical</italic> answer to the dangers of elitism that emerge with a call to <italic>phronēsis</italic>, just as there is no sure defence against the dominance of any form of technical knowledge or the misuse of historical understanding. While unable to achieve that task alone, an IR more sympathetic to non-neo-positivist and hence more historically sensitive modes of political analysis can surely help more than an IR that seeks only technical political knowledge.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>This article has taken issue with Hobson and Lawson’s rejection of the historical turn by arguing that the stakes of the historical turn stem from neo-positivism’s collapse of history and historical knowledge into a storehouse of context-free ‘data’, and not from a need finally to answer the question ‘What is history in IR?’ The seemingly disparate voices in the ongoing conversation about IR and history are united by a shared desire to exorcise the ‘Cartesian anxiety’ that arises from an acknowledgement of the impossibility of timeless objective knowledge and the false fear of the ‘spectre of relativism’ if we acknowledge the inherent historicity of all human understanding. The turn to history is, then, part of a wider attack on the Cartesian edifice to which the neo-positivist-dominated human sciences remain trapped, particularly in their centre of gravity in the United States. To that end, I contend that it is to be embraced. The turn is one element of a debate over the discipline’s core nature and status beyond this Rubicon, a direct confrontation with the question of what IR <italic>is</italic> – of what type of knowledge claims it can make – when objectivism and relativism are rejected.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn126-0305829812445232">126</xref></sup> In short, the historical turn begs the question ‘[W]hy do we study international politics and what purposes does the discipline of IR serve?’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn127-0305829812445232">127</xref></sup></p>
<p>Taking that line of thought to its conclusion, the article showed that the historical turn is about nurturing <italic>phronēsis</italic> or <italic>practical wisdom</italic> as a valid type of knowledge about how to address problems of international political <italic>praxis</italic>, and particularly to highlight its ineluctably historical, contextual and timely character. Yet, there remained something discomforting about that conclusion that necessitated questioning the potential of even a more historically aware ‘phronetic’ IR to really ‘matter’. Consequently, I probed further into the notion of <italic>phronēsis</italic> and found issues that lie beyond the realm of IR as a social science, in the practical relationship between the spheres of political knowledge creation and the political world itself. Acknowledging that what is at issue in the historical turn lies beyond IR, however, does not simply replace philosophical relativism for a sociological variety. We are instead warned to desist from seeking ultimate solutions to the problems posed by our rejection of objective knowledge in IR in the discipline of History, the philosophy of history or the philosophy of science, even as we draw on those resources to better understand the puzzles of international political life.</p>
