<abstract>
<p>Parenteral nutrition (PN) is a relatively recent life-saving development in medicine but brings with it a range of new potential complications. Much of our knowledge about the signs and symptoms of individual micronutrient deficiencies comes from observations of patients receiving PN, and an example of this is the pivotal paper by Velez and colleagues published in <italic>Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition</italic> in 1985. This case report was the first published study to identify acute thiamine deficiency with cardiopathy and metabolic acidosis occurring in adult patients receiving vitamin-free PN. Although the importance of thiamine has been recognized since the late 19th century, it is still unclear exactly what dose is required for full repletion of a deficient patient, and further research would be useful to elucidate this question.</p>

<title>Prevailing Belief System</title>
<p>Stanley Dudrick, in his brief history of parenteral nutrition (PN), recalls the strong prevalent belief in the 1960s that “feeding entirely by vein [was] impossible; even if it were possible, it would be impractical; and even if it were practical, it would be unaffordable.”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0884533611433332">1</xref></sup> But by 1967, safe nonreactive central venous catheters, stable nutrition formulations, and aseptic techniques had been developed to make this amazing therapy a reality, and throughout the 1970s, its use spread widely. There was considerable variation in the management of parenterally nourished patients, however, with some facilities using standard glucose/amino acid solutions and others compounding their own solutions for each individual patient. The management of micronutrient additives similarly differed, with a range of strategies, including the routine addition of standard vitamin and trace element doses to the PN, separate intravenous (IV) infusion, and individually adjusted micronutrient dosing.</p>
<p>By this time, all the vitamins, minerals, and trace elements required for life had been identified, but in the developed world, the highest-risk patients are those with generalized nutrition problems due to alcoholism, eating disorders, or gastrointestinal diseases, in whom multiple deficiencies most often coexist along with protein and/or energy depletion, alcohol toxicity, infections, and electrolyte abnormalities, making it difficult to identify the signs and symptoms of any one deficiency. The introduction of PN introduced a novel situation, the possibility of an isolated micronutrient deficiency in an otherwise adequately nourished patient, who is receiving the full requirements for macro- and micronutrients except for one individual omission due to clinician error. This led to a sharp increase in knowledge regarding the clinical signs and symptoms of deficiencies in essential fatty acids, copper, zinc, chromium, and biotin, all of which were reported in published cases throughout the 1970s.</p>

<title>Unique Scientific Contribution</title>
<p>Velez et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0884533611433332">2</xref></sup> were the first to report acute thiamine deficiency with cardiopathy and metabolic acidosis occurring in parenterally nourished adults, with their account of 3 cases all related to the administration of vitamin-free PN solutions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0884533611433332">Figure 1</xref>). (There had been 2 previously published cases concerning children.) These reports were soon followed by others.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0884533611433332">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0884533611433332">6</xref></sup> In the case of Velez et al, the standard parenteral solutions at their hospital were issued without added vitamins, and these were to be ordered separately to minimize the risk of overprescribing and potential toxicity. The 3 patients they discuss received PN from which the vitamins were accidentally omitted for a prolonged period.</p>

<p>Velez et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0884533611433332">2</xref></sup> point out that at the time of writing their report, standard medical textbooks did not mention thiamine deficiency as a differential diagnosis for metabolic acidosis. This has certainly changed now, with thiamine supplementation having become a regular part of emergency departments’ admission care for any patient who could be thought at risk, and thiamine deficiency is now prominent in the lists of possible causes of metabolic acidosis in medical textbooks and online resources.</p>

<title>Validation</title>
<p>The role of thiamine in metabolism has been well understood for more than 50 years. It allows pyruvate to enter the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, serving as a coenzyme in the oxidative decarboxylation reaction that converts pyruvate to acetyl coenzyme A. Without thiamine, anaerobic metabolism predominates, rapidly leading to metabolic acidosis as lactate starts to accumulate. Thiamine also appears to be involved directly in nerve impulse conduction and some other neurology processes, in addition to its metabolic role, which affects the nervous system along with all other body systems.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0884533611433332">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>Prior to the 1980s, knowledge of thiamine deficiency related to grossly inadequate or unbalanced diets, as well as alcoholism. The World Health Organization defines 3 syndromes of adult thiamine deficiency, with recommended management focused on famine conditions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0884533611433332">8</xref></sup>: the more chronic thiamine deficiency with peripheral neuropathy (formerly known as dry beriberi), acute thiamine deficiency with lactic acidosis (formerly known as wet beriberi), and, more severely, fulminant thiamine deficiency with cardiopathy (shoshin beriberi—<italic>shoshin</italic> means “sudden collapse” in Japanese), which involves tachycardia, shortness of breath, and circulatory collapse. Wernicke encephalopathy is another acute deficiency state, primarily involving thiamine’s neurological role, possibly as a result of genetic predisposition. It is characterized by acute confusion, ataxia, and motor abnormalities of the eye and can progress to Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome (with psychosis and irreversible neurological deficits) if not treated. The occurrence of Wernicke encephalopathy during PN was already well documented prior to the Velez et al publication.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0884533611433332">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0884533611433332">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>The body has minimal thiamine stores other than in the liver—no more than about 30 mg in total—and thiamine has a half-life of 2–3 weeks, so tissues with a high metabolic demand (such as the heart and nervous system) can become thiamine deficient in only a few weeks if supply is inadequate.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0884533611433332">7</xref></sup> Thus, in published cases, acute thiamine deficiency has occurred about 2 or 3 weeks after starting PN without thiamine.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0884533611433332">14</xref></sup> Signs and symptoms may appear in a shorter time if the patient is already deficient or has increased losses or malabsorption, increased expenditure (eg, due to fever), or exposure to large doses of carbohydrate or thiamine antagonists. Sources of possible thiamine antagonists include caffeine, some antioxidants found in foods, 5-fluorouracil chemotherapy, and thiaminases (found in raw fish and some probiotics). In the cases reported by Velez et al,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0884533611433332">2</xref></sup> acute symptoms developed in the patients on vitamin-free PN after 2 weeks (1 patient), 10 days (1 elderly patient, who subsequently died), and after only 1 week (a middle-aged man who reported a heavy intake of caffeine-based stimulants prior to admission). Exploratory laparotomy was performed in 2 of the patients and planned for the third, as all 3 had severe metabolic acidosis, which raised the suspicion of intra-abdominal pathology, as well as tachypnea, hypotension, and weakness.</p>
<p>The thiamine doses used to resuscitate these 3 patients varied, including 3 IV doses of 100 mg each, 2 doses of 100 mg (1 intramuscular and 1 IV), and a single intramuscular dose of 300 mg followed by daily supplementation. None of the patients were given any vitamins in the PN they had received. No biochemistry is reported, so it is not possible to assess the level of thiamine deficiency or any coexisting metabolic derangements in any of the patients to compare the amounts required for repletion. In their discussion, Velez et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0884533611433332">2</xref></sup> mention other patients who developed signs of thiamine deficiency while receiving PN that included a standard micronutrient additive meeting the Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) for thiamine (providing 1–3 mg/d), noting that this dose may not be sufficient for patients whose needs are increased. It has been suggested that thiamine deficiency should be suspected in such patients even if they are receiving thiamine, as high-risk patients such as these may need at least 250 mg daily to prevent problems.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0884533611433332">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>Once a patient has demonstrated signs of deficiency, the recommendations vary widely, and all are based on “expert opinion” level of evidence. For example, Kiramura et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0884533611433332">14</xref></sup> suggest that a rapid IV dose of 100 mg thiamine should be followed by 100 mg/d, given as a continuous IV infusion; intramuscular administration should be avoided, and the patient should be monitored in intensive care because instability can persist for hours after the thiamine is instituted. Hawes et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0884533611433332">15</xref></sup> suggest that such doses are excessive. Velez et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0884533611433332">2</xref></sup> recommend 100 mg thiamine hourly until “a satisfactory clinical and biochemical response is achieved,” but they do not describe what such a response would look like. Disappearance of deficiency symptoms may be delayed or temporary, or patients may require additional doses after the initial period. Ascertaining a patient’s thiamine status is not straightforward. Many facilities perform only indirect tests, such as erythrocyte transketolase activity or urinary thiamine excretion, rather than direct tests of blood thiamine diphosphate level. Even direct tests may be inaccurate if blood samples are incorrectly handled as they need to be frozen or analyzed immediately after collection and protected from light.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0884533611433332">16</xref></sup> Along with thiamine, intracellular electrolytes (phosphate, magnesium, and potassium) should also be replaced to normal levels as these are all cofactors in various related metabolic processes.</p>
<p>One notable aspect of these case reports is the absence of an organization-level response to the death of a patient occurring due to error. Current systems for accreditation of healthcare facilities require quality assurance processes to be in place and adequately documented, and in today’s hospital environment, such a patient death would be a “sentinel event” that would trigger an official review of contributing factors and associated procedures. If the reported incident occurred today, the hospital’s policy of providing PN without vitamins would be reassessed in light of potential deficiency risks, checks might be put in place to ensure that the vitamin prescription cannot be omitted, and other members of the healthcare team would be alerted to the issue so that a multidisciplinary approach to safety could help to prevent subsequent occurrences. These case reports highlight the value of the current focus on quality and safety, and they show how much progress has been made in this area.</p>

<title>Future Considerations</title>
<p>The case reports of acute thiamine deficiency occurring during PN helped to change practice and increase awareness of this issue. However, for thiamine and some other micronutrients, it is still unclear exactly what doses are needed for repletion of a patient showing signs of deficiency. Most of the current recommendations are based on observational studies that mostly did not measure the patients’ vitamin status or report any other biochemistry, making it difficult to assess the effectiveness of the doses given and establish strong recommendations for the future. There may be variability between different supplement forms, and the instability of many vitamins means that a dose given as a continuous infusion may be less effective than the same dose given over a short time, further confounding the interpretation of case reports. A final consideration is that thiamine does not function in isolation, so monitoring and replacement of key electrolytes and trace elements is an essential part of managing thiamine deficiency that needs attention. Further well-designed studies would be useful to establish a more evidence-based approach to patients with acute micronutrient deficiencies.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>PN saves lives. Many people survive today only because of the availability of IV nutrition, and many people with intestinal failure will require PN for the rest of their lives. But PN can also kill, not just because of its invasive nature but also because of the patient’s complete metabolic dependence on correct therapy. Thiamine deficiency, refeeding syndrome, and overfeeding are examples of what can go wrong when this is not ensured. The pivotal paper of Velez et al,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0884533611433332">2</xref></sup> despite its limitations, is a reminder that powerful clinical resources such as PN need close attention and care to ensure that they translate into benefits for our patients.</p>
