<abstract>
<p>Markus Scholz and Thomas A. C. Reydon discuss the approach known as generalized Darwinism and make a number of comments and criticisms. This reply demonstrates that a number of their statements are inaccurate and misleading. It is important to examine the accounts of generalized Darwinism carefully, including what its proponents say about its explanatory limitations. Scholz and Reydon raise an important question concerning the definition of populations or species, but overlook the additional persistence of this problem in biology. This definitional problem is important but it does not invalidate generalized Darwinism.</p>

<body>
<p>I am grateful to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0170840613485862">Markus Scholz and Thomas A. C. Reydon (2013)</xref> for their thoughtful comment on my article on ‘Understanding Organizational Evolution’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0170840613485862">Hodgson, 2013</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0170840613485862">1</xref></sup> But they are sometimes unclear and insufficiently precise, both in characterizing generalized Darwinism and in developing their own position. There are also some mistakes and formulations that may mislead readers, so I welcome the opportunity here for further clarification. They make an important point concerning the definition of populations or species. But instead of undermining generalized Darwinism, it points to a necessary clarification of one of its key concepts.</p>
<p>On a strong point of agreement, Scholz and Reydon concur with my argument ‘that the notion of “evolution” is widely used in organization science without authors being sufficiently clear on what exactly they mean by this term’. This is important and worth stressing.</p>
<p>But unfortunately they do not practise what they preach. Having questioned a Darwinian usage, they then use the term ‘evolution’ frequently, <italic>without explaining what they mean by the word</italic>. Phrases appear such as ‘evolutionary thinking’, ‘evolutionary processes in the social domain’, ‘other evolutionary lines of investigation’, ‘proper evolutionary explanations’, ‘Evolution in the strict sense’ and so on. Especially if a Darwinian notion of ‘evolution’ is sidelined from the social domain, their use of the e-word is even more perplexing. Quite simply, the unaided e-word has little firm meaning other than ‘change’. Phrases such as ‘proper evolutionary explanations’ are mere hand-waving unless the meaning is made clear. They should either define what they mean, or drop the e-word.</p>
<p>My co-workers and I retain a broad meaning for the e-word (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0170840613485862">Aldrich &amp; Ruef, 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0170840613485862">Aldrich et al., 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0170840613485862">Hodgson &amp; Knudsen, 2010</xref>). When we write of <italic>Darwinian</italic> evolution we mean something more specific. Darwin himself rarely used the e-word and there is no Darwinian copyright on its usage. Our argument is that once we specify an abstract ontology involving populations of entities with particular characteristics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0170840613485862">Hodgson &amp; Knudsen, 2010</xref>, pp. 32–7), then Darwinian processes involving variation, selection and replication (or inheritance or retention) are bound to occur. Having specified this abstract ontology, we find that it applies to populations of social organizations as well as biological organisms. Hence we claim that organizational evolution is Darwinian. This result provides an overarching meta-theoretical framework for raising research questions and developing domain-specific theoretical explanations.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0170840613485862">Hodgson and Knudsen (2010</xref>, ch. 3) show that other approaches are inadequate when addressing the evolution of such population systems. The seminal text of modern ‘evolutionary economics’ by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0170840613485862">Richard Nelson and Sidney Winter (1982)</xref> develops a theory of the evolution of business organizations. Remarkably, they are obliged to use the principles of variation, selection and replication, even though they fail to describe this framework as Darwinian. So far, there is no alternative framework. Simply using the word ‘evolutionary’ does not point to one.</p>
<p>Scholz and Reydon also address the so-called ‘neo-Schumpeterian’ approach of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0170840613485862">Nelson and Winter (1982)</xref> and the ‘continuity hypothesis’ of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0170840613485862">Ulrich Witt (2004)</xref>. They write that ‘Hodgson and collaborators strongly oppose both these views.’ This is wrong, and contradicts the published record.</p>
<p>First, although we have raised a few detailed problems within <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0170840613485862">Nelson and Winter’s (1982)</xref> approach, overall we have given it strong support (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0170840613485862">Hodgson, 1999</xref>, chs. 7–8; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0170840613485862">Hodgson &amp; Knudsen, 2010</xref>, pp. ix, 40, 82, 84, 95, etc.).</p>
<p>Second, we also support the ‘continuity hypothesis’. Witt’s mistake is to see it as a rival to generalized Darwinism. In fact there is no logical inconsistency between the two. We clearly declare that the continuity hypotheses is ‘valid’ and could enhance a Darwinian approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0170840613485862">Hodgson &amp; Knudsen, 2010</xref>, p. 57), that we ‘fully agree with this broad ‘hypothesis’’ (p. 58) and that it is ‘entirely compatible with Darwinian principles’ (p. 238). One wonders whether they have read our book carefully.</p>
<p>Commenting on these three identified schools of evolutionary economics, Scholz and Reydon write further:
<disp-quote>
<p>Of these three approaches, only generalized Darwinism rests on the assumption that evolutionary processes of the same sort as are found in the biological realm actually occur in the social world. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0170840613485862">Scholz &amp; Reydon, 2013</xref>, p. 994)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This at best is misleading. We have taken great pains to explain that generalized Darwinism does <italic>not</italic> rest on the claim that social and biological evolution are the same or similar (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0170840613485862">Hodgson &amp; Knudsen, 2010</xref>, pp. 9, 10, 23, 26, 31, 37–40, 44, 76–77, 84, 106, 116, 132, 153, 218–19). Consider the following selection of many statements in this vein:
<disp-quote>
<p>The claim that social and biological evolution are different at the level of detail is important and true… (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0170840613485862">Hodgson &amp; Knudsen, 2010</xref>, p. 23)</p>
<p>…Clearly the detailed mechanisms of change are often very different, both within and between different types of system, in nature and in human society… (p. 31)</p>
<p>…To say that two sets of phenomena are similar in general terms does not imply that they are similar in detailed respects… (p. 38)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Here and elsewhere we insist that what is involved is ‘a degree of ontological communality at a high level of abstraction’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0170840613485862">Hodgson &amp; Knudsen 2010</xref>, p. 224) rather than sameness or similarity between the biological and social domains. When Scholz and Reydon refer to ‘evolutionary processes of the same sort’ in the social and biological worlds, they are unclear whether this ‘sameness’ is at the level of abstract communality or of detail. For us the difference is vital.</p>
<p>The foregoing relates to the question of what generalized Darwinism can and cannot explain. Starting from the very title of their comment, Scholz and Reydon question ‘the explanatory power of generalized Darwinism’. They say that generalized Darwinism is ‘insufficiently clear when it comes to name the actual explananda that are in focus’ and point to its ‘absence of clearly circumscribed explananda’. But all this suggests that generalized Darwinism sets itself up as a complete theory to explain specific phenomena. This again would be misleading.</p>
<p>Instead, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0170840613485862">Hodgson and Knudsen (2010</xref>, p. viii) point out that even in biology ‘Darwinism as such provides no single model or axiomatic system. Instead it is a meta-theoretical framework that stimulates further enquiry and provides a repository for contingent auxiliary theories and models.’ We insist (p. 26) that ‘Darwinism is an overarching theoretical framework, rather than a complete theory encompassing all the details.’ Darwinism cannot explain specific phenomena without the addition of auxiliary theories. ‘The meta-theoretical framework of Darwinism provides a way of inspiring, framing and organizing these explanations as well as providing key concepts and pointing to particular analytical methods’ (p. 40). Darwinism ‘provides a general framework in which additional and context specific explanations may be placed’ (p. 46). As with the core Darwinian principles in biology, much more must be added to develop the approach and apply it to specific phenomena. Once this is understood it can be appreciated that the scope for possible explananda is unlimited.</p>
<p>On the other hand, there have been significant attempts within generalized Darwinism to use relevant auxiliary theories and help develop theoretical explanations of concrete phenomena in the economic domain (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0170840613485862">Stoelhorst, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0170840613485862">Hodgson, 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0170840613485862">2011</xref>). Scholz and Reydon overlook this.</p>
<p>Scholz and Reydon rightly urge caution when developing and making claims for any theoretical approach. But careful interpretation and caution are also important for critics. It is also strange that they omit any discussion of the replicator–interactor distinction, which is central to prominent versions of generalized Darwinism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0170840613485862">Dollimore, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0170840613485862">Hull, 1988</xref>).</p>
<p>Having dealt with some of the imprecision in their comment, I now turn to an important criticism. Scholz and Reydon question whether organizational populations should be treated as ‘sharing a number of traits’. They claim that
<disp-quote>
<p>in evolutionary biology populations are conceived of as reproductive communities, i.e. systems of reproductively interconnected organisms. Biological populations are not defined as sets of organisms with a number of traits in common. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0170840613485862">Scholz and Reydon, 2013</xref>, p. 996)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This raises important but complex issues. Having emphasized similarity more than relatedness in our discussion of populations, I concede that this has to be reconsidered. But the reader might infer from Scholz and Reydon that in biology the definition of reproductive communities or species is straightforward. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0170840613485862">Ernst Mayr (1942)</xref> famously defined a species as a population of organisms that can reproduce with one another and that are reproductively isolated from other such populations. But this has not ended the debate in biology. On the contrary, there is an enduring controversy, currently known as ‘the species problem’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0170840613485862">de Queiroz, 2005</xref>). This has led to several rival definitions and to discussions of whether species are real or simply mental abstractions. Focusing on reproduction is complicated by the fact that living things reproduce in a variety of different ways, and a species definition that works for one set of organisms can be problematic for others. There are cases where members of different species can hybridize in special environments and produce fertile offspring. In practice, multiple definitions of species are still used in biology. Some involve statistical assessments of similarity, particularly regarding DNA.</p>
<p>The problem of defining populations (or organizational ‘species’) is also important for generalized Darwinism because the key concepts of variation, selection and replication rely on the notion of a population. In this context we need to consider questions of relatedness as well as similarity. But relatedness is at least as complex in the social world as it is in the biological.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0170840613485862">Hodgson and Knudsen (2010</xref>, p. 3) define diffusion as ‘a type of inheritance [or replication] where a copy of a replicator [e.g. routine] is established in a second interactor [e.g. organization]’. An example is where an organization copies successfully the routines of another, but this does not lead to the creation of a new organization. We argue (pp. 104–6) that diffusion is more important in human society than it is in biological evolution. Notably the principles of generalized Darwinism apply to both domains but they identify types of replication with very different prevalence. Nevertheless, replication via new offspring is found in both domains: new organizations are created via spin-offs or imitation (pp. 109, 175).</p>
<p>Given these possibilities, one option would be to define a species-population of organizations as a set where every member can potentially transfer a routine to or from at least one other member, by diffusion among existing organizations or by the creation of a new organization. This definition could widen the size of many organizational populations. This issue needs to be addressed by those developing generalized Darwinism. But just as the persistence of the species problem has not disabled evolutionary biology, a similar definitional problem does not stop generalized Darwinism in its tracks.</p>
