<abstract>
<p>During the compression of fibrous preforms for complex part geometries, a shear component of the reinforcement compaction stress is present in addition to the normal component. Consideration of the shear stress is required when modelling the forces experienced by mould tools used for liquid composite moulding processes, as they contribute significantly to the total clamping force required during reinforcement compression for high draw angle geometries. The friction coefficient between glass-fibre reinforcements and various mould surfaces has been evaluated. Processing parameters, such as mould closing speed, fibre volume fraction and number of layers of reinforcement, have little influence on the magnitude of the friction coefficient. The presented results validate the use of a simple friction model within liquid composite moulding process simulations.</p>

<sec id="sec1-0021998312441811" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Liquid composite moulding (LCM) processes have become an increasingly popular method for manufacture of fibre reinforced composite components, due to the improvement in part quality, reduction in cycle times, improved working conditions (through containing noxious chemicals in closed moulds) and reduced reliance on operator skill for product quality. Since becoming widespread in the 1980s, the rigid-tool resin transfer moulding (RTM) process has been the subject of considerable research, with many groups developing numerical simulation packages to monitor and optimise the filling phase of the process.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0021998312441811">1</xref><sup>–</sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0021998312441811">13</xref> This approach has led to reductions in fill times and improved part quality by reducing potential flow-speed-induced voids.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0021998312441811">14</xref><sup>,</sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0021998312441811">15</xref> However, as the limits of the capability of RTM were reached, the desire for greater reductions in cycle time, particularly in high-volume industries such as automotive, led to the development of the compression RTM (CRTM) process. While this technique creates the potential for greatly reduced cycle times, the evolving permeability during the compression phase of mould filling makes it a more complex process to model. Additionally, as the load experienced by the mould tools is a summation of the force required to compress the fibre bed and the force due to the internal resin pressure, the peak loads during this phase can be very high, as the resin is compressed in addition to the fibrous reinforcement. Therefore, accurate simulation of the local and global forces experienced by the moulds is a valuable design tool. Consideration of the local tooling stresses is also particularly important when considering RTM light, where local mould deflections can affect the local cavity thickness achievable.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0021998312441811">16</xref><sup>,</sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0021998312441811">17</xref> To date, little work has addressed this aspect; however, work undertaken previously at the University of Auckland has focussed on producing a simulation package capable of predicting flow front progression in addition to mould tooling forces during process cycles for both RTM and CRTM.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0021998312441811">18</xref><sup>–</sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0021998312441811">22</xref> This article has included improved modelling of the reinforcement compaction stress to include viscoelastic relaxation effects.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0021998312441811">23</xref><sup>,</sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0021998312441811">24</xref> Simulation development has focussed on complex non-planar components, where further experimental validation is required when considering the through-thickness and in-plane shear effects.</p>
<p>The total normal stress acting on mould surfaces is comprised of two components: the internally generated resin pressure and the stress due to the compaction of the fibrous reinforcement described above.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0021998312441811">22</xref><sup>,</sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0021998312441811">25</xref> This has been expressed previously using a one-dimensional consolidation approach, from Terzaghi's law<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0021998312441811">22</xref><sup>,</sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0021998312441811">25</xref><sup>–</sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0021998312441811">36</xref>

where σ<sub><italic>f</italic></sub> is the normal stress carried by the fibre preform and <italic>P</italic> the internally generated fluid pressure. When considering non-planar geometries, a shear component of the reinforcement compaction stress is present.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0021998312441811">22</xref> For some geometries, particularly those with low draw angles (i.e. shallow surfaces), the shear component of the stress may be small and can be neglected. However, for geometries with higher draw angles (i.e. steep surfaces), the shear component of the stress can be a significant component of the total force due to preform compaction. Kelly et al. have assumed that the shear stress component (τ) can be related to the normal component (σ<sub><italic>f</italic></sub>) of the total reinforcement compaction stress by a coefficient of friction (μ<sub><italic>f</italic></sub>)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0021998312441811">22</xref><sup>,</sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0021998312441811">37</xref>

</p>
<p>Very few studies have been presented in the literature on the evaluation of the coefficient of friction between dry fibrous reinforcements and mould surfaces. Morton and Hearle<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0021998312441811">38</xref> have studied the friction between fibres for a range of materials, including glass fibres. While they found that a linear relationship (as proposed in equation (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula2-0021998312441811">2</xref>)) was not the most accurate, they found it useful to express the magnitude of the friction under many conditions. Sokolov and Khudykh<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0021998312441811">39</xref> investigated the effect of lubrication on the friction between glass fibres and metallic surfaces by evaluating the coefficient of friction between a compact glass bushing and a metal roller. It was assumed that the compact glass would exhibit similar properties to glass fibres as the structures of each are very similar. A number of authors have considered the coefficient of friction between composite components and other, typically metallic, surfaces.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0021998312441811">37</xref><sup>,</sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0021998312441811">40</xref> The primary method for measuring the coefficient of friction employed for such materials is a double-shear pull-out test, where flat samples are compacted either side of a surface plate, and the force required to pull the surface plate out is measured. This method is simple to experimentally implement in standard physical testing machines. Schon<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0021998312441811">37</xref> used this approach to evaluate the coefficient of friction between aluminium and carbon-fibre/epoxy laminates to assess the forces carried by friction in bolted joints in aircraft structures. In such situations, a significant portion of the load is carried by friction between the manufactured laminate and the aluminium, so the coefficient of friction is a key factor in the design of the interface.</p>
<p>A number of authors<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0021998312441811">41</xref><sup>–</sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0021998312441811">43</xref> have evaluated coefficients of friction using a single shear method involving a sample placed on a rotating disc. A load is compressively applied to the sample, and the deformation of a cantilevered arm is measured to evaluate the coefficient of friction. The primary motivating factor for these works was to measure the effect on friction wear properties resulting from the addition of ceramic or other particles in metal–matrix composites, when compared to the unreinforced matrix metal. Titanium–matrix composites are a significant focus of such research due to their use in biomedical applications and minimising wear due to friction is an important consideration.</p>
<p>Preliminary work reported in the study of Kelly and Bickerton<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0021998312441811">22</xref> considered friction and shearing for a limited number of particular cases. The intention of this article is to carry out a comprehensive, in-depth study of the coefficient of friction between glass-fibre reinforcements and a variety of mould materials to provide data and trends which will be applicable to a wide range of applications. Tests were undertaken at a selection of pull-out speeds and fibre volume fractions. The number of layers of reinforcement per sample was varied, and both wet and dry reinforcement samples were tested. Determination of the coefficient of friction between glass-fibre reinforcements and mould surfaces, μ<sub><italic>f</italic></sub>, will therefore allow accurate prediction of the shear component of the stress required to compact the reinforcement. These shear stresses give rise to the shear component of the total clamping force exerted on non-planar mould LCM tools, allowing the total force to be calculated with greater accuracy.</p>

<p>When processing non-planar components using LCM processes, in addition to the normal component of the reinforcement compaction stress, a shear component is present. Individual regions of non-planar parts can be classified by the ‘draw angle’ – that is, the angle between the local part surface and a plane perpendicular to the mould closure (<italic>z</italic>) direction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0021998312441811">Figure 1</xref>). At low draw angles, the shear component may be neglected; however, at higher angles, the shear component of stress can be a significant portion of the total force required to compress a fibrous preform.

<p>The method used to determine μ<sub><italic>f</italic></sub> was a double-shear pull-out test. In this method, material samples were compacted either side of a plate. This plate was then pulled out from between the samples, inducing slip between the plate and the sample. As a known force was applied to compact the samples in the normal direction, and the force in the shear direction was measured, μ<sub><italic>f</italic></sub> was calculated from equation (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula2-0021998312441811">2</xref>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0021998312441811">Figure 2</xref> depicts the experimental facility used for pull-out testing. Two samples, 100 × 100 mm<sup>2</sup>, were compacted by a pneumatic ram, via 6-mm thick steel compression plates, either side of a plate representing mould surfaces. The ram acts via a spherical seat to ensure accurate alignment of the compression plates, giving a constant thickness across each sample. The compression plates are 6-mm thick steel, with negligible deflection from the load applied by the pneumatic ram. Each sample was attached to an aluminium backing plate with spray adhesive, to ensure no slip occurred at the outer surface. The rig was installed in an Instron 1186 universal testing machine. A constant velocity was applied to the surface plate, inducing initially shear deformation of the sample, followed by slip between the surface plate and the sample. Three different surface plates of same dimensions (100 × 400 mm<sup>2</sup>), were used: aluminium, acrylic and tooling gelcoat-coated aluminium plate. The aluminium and gelcoat plates were studied as these are common mould surfaces used for LCM processes. The acrylic plate was studied as an acrylic upper mould half is used in an ongoing study on non-planar geometry RTM and CRTM.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0021998312441811">44</xref> Altering the pressure from the pneumatic ram allowed the influence of changing <italic>V</italic><sub>f</sub> to be studied. Two laser gauges (Banner LG10A65PU) monitored the thickness of the samples during testing. The air pressure in the pneumatic ram was monitored using a pressure transducer (GEMS 1200 series).

<p>Three glass-fibre reinforcements were used in this study – a chopped strand mat (CSM), a plain weave fabric (PWF) and a non-crimp biaxial stitched fabric (BSF). The CSM was produced by Owens Corning, product code M705-450, with a nominal areal weight of 450 g/m<sup>2</sup> with a tolerance of ±10%. The PWF has a nominal areal weight of 800 g/m<sup>2</sup> and is produced by Lintex (product code WoviFab EWR800) and lineal weight of the fibre tows 2.26 g/m. The BSF has 0°/90° layers, a nominal areal weight of 825 g/m<sup>2</sup> (of which 10 g/m<sup>2</sup> is stitching yarn) and is produced by Haining Chengrudan Reinforcement Fabrics (product code LT800). The lineal weight of the fibre tows for the BSF was 1.67 g/m (weft) and 1.08 g/m (warp). Throughout all testing, 100 ×100 mm<sup>2</sup> samples were used. All three reinforcements are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0021998312441811">Figure 3</xref>.

</fig></p>
<p>The gelcoat used for the surface plate is Valspar 5003 Red tooling gelcoat. The gelcoat was applied either side of an aluminium plate and cured between two flat mould plates spaced apart to give constant thickness across the plate. For each side of the surface plate, the gelcoat target application thickness was 0.3 mm, over a primer undercoat (target thickness 0.1 mm). The average final achieved thickness of the gelcoated surface plate was 3.15 mm. The acrylic plate was produced by Palsun and was 4.5 mm thick. The aluminium plate had a thickness of 2.0 mm and was polished to achieve the same surface finish as typical machined and polished aluminium RTM and CRTM moulds.</p>
<p>For the lubricated reinforcement tests, a Newtonian mineral oil was used to saturate the samples. The oil used was Mobil Vacuoline, with a viscosity of 1.05 Pa·s at 20°C, measured using a Parr Physica UDS200 rheometer.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-0021998312441811" sec-type="methods"><title>Procedure</title>
<p>Samples were adhered to a backing plate (using Ados F2 spray-on contact adhesive) to ensure no slip between the outer layer of the sample and the clamping plates. A sample was then loaded either side of the surface plate and the desired compaction stress applied using the pneumatic ram. This pressure was then held for 5 min to allow for time-dependent compressive creep effects to die away, after which the surface plate was pulled out at constant velocity to a total draw distance of 60 mm. In general, no inter-layer slip occurred with the slip occurring between the sample and the surface plates; however, some exceptions to this occurred, as discussed in the Results section.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec6-0021998312441811"><title>Experimental programme</title>
<p>A wide range of cases were explored, the details of which are given in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0021998312441811">Tables 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0021998312441811">2</xref>. <italic>V</italic><sub>f</sub> was varied by adjusting the pneumatic ram pressure. Inter-layer effects were studied, the number of layers per sample was varying from 1 to 15. Pull-out speed ranged from 2.5 to 25 mm/min. The average mass per layer for all the tested samples is given in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0021998312441811">Table 3</xref>, along with the maximum and minimum masses of samples tested. The coefficients of variation indicate there is little sample to sample variability in areal mass and individual sample mass. The BSF exhibits significantly lower variation than either the PWF or CSM reinforcements, which corresponds well to visual inspection.

<p>In order to assess the force applied normal to the pull-out surface by the pneumatic ram, the ram was directly calibrated in the Instron 1186. The pressure in the ram was ramped and held at a series of constant values from 57 to 503 kPa, at approximately 56 kPa increments. A linear data fit was used to obtain the applied normal load at each time step for each experiment, as described by

<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0021998312441811">Figure 4</xref> presents measured μ<sub><italic>f</italic></sub> traces up to a draw distance of 6 mm (test 12). For each reinforcement, μ<sub><italic>f</italic></sub> rapidly climbs in the first 0.2 mm of draw, to approximately 0.11 for BSF and PWF and 0.13 for CSM. Beyond this point, the increase in μ<sub><italic>f</italic></sub> slows for each material. For CSM, μ<sub><italic>f</italic></sub> plateaus at approximately 0.17–0.18 after 1 mm of draw. For BSF, μ<sub><italic>f</italic></sub> reaches a maximum after 2 mm of draw, after which point μ<sub><italic>f</italic></sub> begins to drop. For the PWF, μ<sub><italic>f</italic></sub> does not completely plateau as with BSF, but the increase in μ<sub><italic>f</italic></sub> significantly slows after approximately 1.8 mm of draw. During the initial period of testing, elastic shear deformation of the samples is occurring. Beyond this point, slip is induced and the surface plate slides past the samples, indicating that the static friction condition has been overcome. For CSM, the plateau in μ<sub><italic>f</italic></sub> indicates that the kinetic μ<sub><italic>f</italic></sub> is very similar to the static case, as the μ<sub><italic>f</italic></sub> at the onset of sliding (i.e. from approximately 1-mm draw) is the same as the μ<sub><italic>f</italic></sub> after considerable sliding. For BSF, the drop in μ<sub><italic>f</italic></sub> after 2 mm of draw indicates that the μ<sub><italic>f</italic></sub> for the kinetic state is lower than the static μ<sub><italic>f</italic></sub> – that is, the force required to initiate slip is greater than the force required to maintain slip for this material. The principal difference between the BSF and the other reinforcements studied (other than architecture) was the presence of polyester yarn, used to stitch the layers of fabric together. The polyester will have a different μ<sub><italic>f</italic></sub> than the glass fibre, which is likely contributing to the difference in observed kinetic μ<sub><italic>f</italic></sub> when comparing BSF to CSM. The reinforcement architecture may also affect the drop in kinetic μ<sub><italic>f</italic></sub> experienced, as a ‘stick–slip’ condition occurs during this phase.

</fig></p>
<p>The difference in the draw distance at which the static friction condition is overcome between the different types of reinforcement is due to the variation in sample thickness. The sample thickness is a function of the areal weight of each material (as discussed earlier in `Aluminium surface plate' section). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0021998312441811">Figure 5</xref> depicts the average μ<sub><italic>f</italic></sub> response for the repeatability studies on each reinforcement as a function of the draw distance divided by the sample thickness (the normalised draw distance). The point at which the static friction condition is overcome occurs at the same normalised draw distance for each material, indicating that the shear stiffness of all reinforcements studied is very similar.

</fig></p>
<p>Under some manufacturing conditions, the kinetic friction condition may not be reached. This would occur in situations where the normalised draw distance is not great enough during mould closure to overcome the static μ<sub><italic>f</italic></sub>, such as where reinforcement thickness is high or draw angle is low. In such cases, use of the μ<sub><italic>f</italic></sub> values evaluated here would lead to overprediction of the shear component of the reinforcement compaction stress.</p>

<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0021998312441811">Figure 6</xref> depicts the repeatability studies undertaken on dry samples of each reinforcement (test 12). Similar studies for saturated samples are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0021998312441811">Figure 7</xref> (test 16). For the CSM case (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0021998312441811">Figure 6(a)</xref>), the μ<sub><italic>f</italic></sub> rapidly rises in each case and remains constant as draw distance increases. This behaviour indicates a close relationship between static and kinetic frictions in this case, as the μ<sub><italic>f</italic></sub> rapidly rises to a set value which remains constant as draw distance increases. Average μ<sub><italic>f</italic></sub> values were obtained by considering the μ<sub><italic>f</italic></sub> from a normalised draw distance of 0.3 onwards, excluding any erroneous results caused by damaged samples or inter-layer slip. The average μ<sub><italic>f</italic></sub> for the five-layer saturated samples (0.143, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0021998312441811">Figure 7(a)</xref>) was 22.7% lower than that for the dry ones, due to the oil lubricating the friction surfaces and allowing easier sliding of the surface plate across the samples.

<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0021998312441811">Figure 6(b)</xref> depicts the repeatability studies undertaken on dry samples of BSF. Again, repeatability is good, and μ<sub><italic>f</italic></sub> from a draw distance of approximately 8 mm onwards is constant in each case. The initial rise in μ<sub><italic>f</italic></sub> is slower than that for CSM, where an apparently almost instantaneous increase is observed, due to the difference in sample thickness, resulting from the variation in average areal mass of the reinforcements. There appears to be a higher coefficient of static friction than that of kinetic, indicated by the drop after the peak value is reached. As discussed in `Transient response' section, this is possibly due to the presence of the polyester stitching in the BSF. The saturated BSF samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0021998312441811">Figure 7(b)</xref>) exhibit greater oscillation in μ<sub><italic>f</italic></sub> than the CSM samples and the dry BSF samples. During testing, this oscillation was noticeable as a ‘stick–slip’ condition, as the sample shears, then the shear strain drops as it slips, and then shears again as it sticks on the surface plate. CSM does not exhibit this behaviour due to the random structure of the material. However, the higher oscillation observed for the saturated BSF over dry BSF is an unexpected result; it was expected that the saturated samples would exhibit less oscillation due to the lubricated surface between the sample and the surface plate. The average μ<sub><italic>f</italic></sub> for the dry BSF samples was 0.160, compared to 0.138 for the saturated BSF samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0021998312441811">Figure 7(b)</xref>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0021998312441811">Figure 6(c)</xref> depicts the repeatability studies undertaken on dry samples of PWF. The initial rise in friction coefficient is similar to that for CSM; however, the curves do not reach a constant value, rather the μ<sub><italic>f</italic></sub> continues to slowly increase. This behaviour indicates that the coefficient of static friction for PWF is lower than that for CSM (approximately 0.15 against 0.18 for CSM), while the coefficient of kinetic friction continues to increase. After approximately 30 mm of draw, the μ<sub><italic>f</italic></sub> is less repeatable, the repeated cases exhibiting a range of behaviour. One predominant feature observed is a cycling of the μ<sub><italic>f</italic></sub>. This is caused by the fibre tows sliding past each other as the individual layers begin to stick–slip at high draw distances. In addition, damage is occurring to portions of the samples towards the end of the test, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0021998312441811">Figure 8</xref>, contributing to the variation seen at high draw distances. The average μ<sub><italic>f</italic></sub> for the PWF samples was 0.198, compared to 0.141 for the saturated PWF samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0021998312441811">Figure 7(c)</xref>).

Averaged results are presented for those cases where repeatability studies were undertaken (5- and 10-layer dry samples and 5-layer saturated samples). These results reinforce the observations made for the CSM repeatability studies, with a constant μ<sub><italic>f</italic></sub> achieved early, and little transient response observed. The exception to this is the saturated three-layer sample, for which a sudden drop in μ<sub><italic>f</italic></sub> is experienced after a draw distance of approximately 8 mm. This was due to a problem with adhesion of this sample to the backing plate, leading to sliding between the sample and the backing plate after 8 mm of draw. The saturated samples also exhibit a lower average μ<sub><italic>f</italic></sub> than the dry ones (an average of 0.146 compared to 0.186 for the dry samples). This is a result of the test oil lubricating the friction surface between the sample and the surface plate (as expected).

The trend of a longer draw distance until the peak μ<sub><italic>f</italic></sub> is reached with an increasing number of layers is reinforced, with the single-layer case rising as rapidly as for the CSM cases. The average μ<sub><italic>f</italic></sub> for the dry samples was 0.167 and for the saturated was 0.143.

Dry samples of PWF exhibit more variability than either the CSM or BSF reinforcements. The single-layer case has a flatter curve than multiple-layer samples, closer to the results observed for the other reinforcements. However, there is no clear trend with the multiple-layer samples, the five-layer case consistently displaying higher μ<sub><italic>f</italic></sub> than either the 3- or 10-layer cases throughout the test. As for BSF and CSM, saturated PWF samples exhibit lower coefficients of friction than for the dry cases due to the lubrication provided by the test oil. The damage observed in the dry samples was not present for the saturated cases. Despite the less consistent response, the average coefficients of friction (0.183 dry and 0.144 saturated) were in the range observed for the other glass-fibre reinforcements.

<p>While some small variation exists between samples of varying number of layers, the magnitude of the variation is small and no clear trend is observed with increasing the number of layers per sample.

<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12-0021998312441811">Figure 12</xref> presents the effect on μ<sub><italic>f</italic></sub> of varying the normal force applied by the pneumatic ram pressure (effectively altering the <italic>V</italic><sub>f</sub>) and the pull-out speed, for each reinforcement (tests 1–9).

Dry samples are presented in each instance. Smoothing has been applied to reduce noise of the samples at the low pull-out speed (2.5 mm/min). In general, the pull-out speed does not appear to affect the steady-state response. However, with an increase in applied normal pressure, there appears to be a small decrease in the average kinetic μ<sub><italic>f</italic></sub> (0.190 for 101.3 kPa, 0.185 for 202.6 kPa and 0.173 for 455.9 kPa) for CSM. In addition, with increasing applied normal pressure, the transient response takes longer to reach the steady-state condition, particularly for BSF. This indicates that there is a greater shear strain occurring prior to the steady-state phase. In summary, fibre volume fraction and pull-out speed appear to have little effect on μ<sub><italic>f</italic></sub>.

<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13-0021998312441811">Figure 13</xref> presents μ<sub><italic>f</italic></sub> as a function of draw distance for dry and saturated CSM samples with the gelcoated surface plate (tests 19–26). For the dry samples, the behaviour is very similar to the aluminium surface plate, although the μ<sub><italic>f</italic></sub> is 14.1% higher, at an average of 0.211. However, the single-layer case deviates from the flat curve observed for the other cases, from approximately 12 mm on. This test was one of the last tests run on the gelcoat plate, and this plate had significantly suffered more wear than the other surface plates. This led to an increase in μ<sub><italic>f</italic></sub>, resulting in the sample partially adhering to the gelcoat surface. For the saturated tests, a drop in μ<sub><italic>f</italic></sub> is observed, as expected (to an average of 0.179). However, for all but the five-layer case, after a short draw distance (between 7 and 18 mm), there is a significant drop in the μ<sub><italic>f</italic></sub>. In each of these cases, the samples pulled off the backing plate at the point of drop off. It appears that this is caused by a combination of the samples partially adhering to the gelcoat and the test oil lubricating the adhesive bonding the samples to the backing plates. This effect was less evident for the five-layer samples, most likely as a result of these tests being the first run with the gelcoat plate. This is an important consideration when using gelcoated mould tools, indicating significant wear has occurred after relatively few cycles. However, as the adhesion to the backing plates observed occurs only after a significant draw distance (at least 12 mm), this occurrence will be rare as draw distances this high require very deep moulds with very high draw angles.

Unlike the gelcoat case (see previous section), the sample was not adhering to the surface plate, nor pulling off the backing plate, so this result is unexpected. The behaviour of the 10-layer sample is also interesting, as while constant, the μ<sub><italic>f</italic></sub> is much lower (average of 0.140) than the other samples (average of 0.205). The 10-layer cases were the first samples tested, and some damage did occur to the acrylic plate as testing progressed, which may explain this difference. The saturated cases exhibit more consistent behaviour, particularly in the initial stages of the tests. In each case, there was some slip between the backing plates and the sample, after approximately 6 mm for the single-layer case and 10 mm for the multiple-layer cases. This slip leads to the drop in μ<sub><italic>f</italic></sub> observed in each case.

<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0021998312441811">Table 5</xref> presents a summary of coefficients of friction for the studies presented here. In general, the μ<sub><italic>f</italic></sub> for dry CSM samples is consistent and independent of the number of layers or pull-out speed, the average coefficient being 0.184 + 3.4%/−5.9%. However, a small decrease of μ<sub><italic>f</italic></sub> is observed with an increase in normal pressure (increasing <italic>V</italic><sub>f</sub>). For dry PWF samples, the average kinetic μ<sub><italic>f</italic></sub> is very similar to that of CSM (0.183 + 3.7%/−1.7%), although the static value is slightly lower. This indicates that the binder present in CSM has little effect on the μ<sub><italic>f</italic></sub>. This is to be expected as both reinforcements are composed from the same material (glass fibre). However, the dry BSF samples exhibit a slightly lower overall μ<sub><italic>f</italic></sub>, most likely due to the presence of the polyester stitching yarn in this fabric (0.171 + 4.8%/−2.8%). For all fabrics, the μ<sub><italic>f</italic></sub> between saturated samples and the aluminium surface plate is very consistent at 0.143 + 2.5%/−3.2%. Results for the gelcoat and acrylic surface plates show an increase in μ<sub><italic>f</italic></sub> between the surface plate and the reinforcement when compared to aluminium.

<sec id="sec18-0021998312441811"><title>Example tooling force analysis</title>
<p>To illustrate the importance of the shear component of the total clamping force, a short series of simulations was undertaken using SimLCM.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0021998312441811">21</xref><sup>,</sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0021998312441811">22</xref> The simulation approach assumes that the friction force is independent of the area of contact (as described by Amontons' Second Law). While in reality, many tools will have regions of complex curvature, it has been assumed that the local shear forces are dependent on the properties of the local surfaces. The approach taken to evaluate the friction characteristics was using flat plates.</p>
<p>The test geometries were 200-mm square flat plates, inclined at angles of 0°, 20°, 40° and 60° from the mould closing direction. The simulation procedure used for all cases was compression of 10 layers of reinforcement to 3.5 mm, followed by a hold period of 200 s. CSM was used as the test material, utilising characterisation data obtained from previous studies<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0021998312441811">45</xref> for the viscoelastic reinforcement compaction model developed by Kelly.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0021998312441811">24</xref> A coefficient of friction of 0.1975 was used, being the average of the values for dry CSM against aluminium and acrylic. This value was chosen to represent a case using one aluminium and one acrylic tool surface, as SimLCM has only one input for the coefficient of friction. In each case, dry reinforcement was compacted to a final <italic>V</italic><sub>f</sub> of 0.40 at a constant compression speed of 5 mm/min. The cavity thickness was then held constant for 200 s to observe the predicted relaxation in reinforcement compaction stress. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig15-0021998312441811">Figure 15</xref> presents the results of the analysis; in all cases <italic>t</italic> = 0 s occurs at the completion of the compression phase.

<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig15-0021998312441811">Figure 15(a)</xref> depicts the total clamping force in the closing (<italic>z</italic>) direction for the angled plates when neglecting the shear component of the clamping force. As the inclination angle increases, the clamping force decreases – at an angle of 60°, the peak load in the <italic>z</italic>-direction is 54.3% lower than that of the uninclined plate. For the inclined plates, there is a lateral component of the clamping load present which is not contributing to the predicted load in the <italic>z</italic>-direction. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig15-0021998312441811">Figure 15(b)</xref> depicts the total clamping force in the closing direction for the angled plates incorporating the shear component of the clamping force. While the peak load decreases with increase in inclination angle, there is less decrease than when the shear component is neglected – at an angle of 60°, the peak load is 38.6% lower than that for the uninclined plate. Comparing the peak clamping force in the closing direction at 60°, 31.9% of the peak load is due to the shear component. At 40°, 14.2% of the peak clamping force is due to the shear component. These results highlight the importance of considering the shear component of the clamping force during process modelling. Neglecting this component can lead to significant underprediction of the clamping force experienced by mould tools.</p>

<sec id="sec19-0021998312441811" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title>
<p>This article has presented a series of experiments to determine the coefficient of friction between a selection of glass-fibre reinforcements and mould surface materials. A range of conditions were evaluated, including number of layers per sample, pull-out speed and fibre volume fraction. When considering the aluminium surface plate, both the CSM and PWF reinforcements exhibit very similar average μ<sub><italic>f</italic></sub> between dry samples and the surface plate of 0.184 and 0.183, respectively. This is to be expected as both materials are a form of glass-fibre reinforcement. However, the average μ<sub><italic>f</italic></sub> between dry BSF samples and the surface plate drops, due to the presence of the polyester stitching yarn at the friction surface, to 0.171. When saturated, the μ<sub><italic>f</italic></sub> between the samples and the surface plate is very consistent for all reinforcements, at an average of 0.143.</p>
<p>The average μ<sub><italic>f</italic></sub> for each surface plate is largely independent of the process parameters – pull-out speed, number of layers per sample, <italic>V</italic><sub>f</sub> and reinforcement. This validates the use of a simple friction model to account for the shear component of reinforcement compaction stress. It is therefore reasonable to use a single friction coefficient for a given material type (i.e. glass fibre) and mould surface.</p>
<p>A short series of example simulations was also presented on inclined plates. These tests highlight the importance of considering the shear component of the clamping force for inclined surfaces, particularly at higher inclination angles.</p>
