<p><italic>The Second Aggregate Report on Offender Management in Prisons</italic> was published in 2012 by Criminal Justice Joint Inspection following the findings of the HMI of Probation and HMI of Prisons. The purpose of the inspection was to assess the work being completed with prisoners in custody in reducing their risk of re-of-fending.</p>
<p>The report found that there was no consistency in the role of the Offender Management Unit (OMU) within the custodial setting, but praised some prisons for good practice in attending MAPPA meetings in the community and holding regular reviews of these cases. Where risk had changed, this was amended quickly in 83 per cent of cases. However, it was argued that limited progress had been made on the most significant criminogenic needs in half of the cases inspected.</p>
<p>It identified that some prisons were duplicating the sentence planning processes and this was therefore criticized for being ‘wasteful and confusing’ (p. 24). However, the majority of offenders were risk assessed and sentence planning boards were being carried out, but there was limited evidence that the prisoner was able to ‘participate meaningfully in the sentence planning process’ (p. 24).</p>
<p>The report highlighted that although offender supervisors were ‘enthusiastic’ (p. 15) in their role, some felt ‘inadequately trained’ (p. 15) with limited regular supervision from management in cases assessed as posing a high risk of serious harm. It stated that the demand for accredited programmes was not met and that prisoners were not always accessing the required interventions.</p>
<p>Having identified these points the report recommended that the National Offender Management Service (NOMS) reviews the needs of prisoners across the country and implements a greater variety of accredited programmes and other interventions that challenge offending behaviours and attitudes, and also ensures that the numbers of programmes offered are reflective of the prison population.  It made the further recommendation that the allocation of a prisoner to a specific prison could be based on that individual’s need for a type of intervention.</p>
<p>The report asks for clarification of the offender supervisor role within the custodial setting and recommends that the OMUs within prison are ‘a central place within the management and operational structure of prisons’ (p. 13). It highlights that each prisoner should have focused sentence plan objectives that aim to reduce the risk of re-offending on release and that these plans should be reviewed in line with any significant changes to the prisoner.</p>
