<p>In one of his articles, Fred Block has traced the history of the term “capitalism” and found some interesting facts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0094306112457657">Block 2000</xref>). While the term became popular early with opponents of capitalism and also radical academics, people in the business world saw it as tainted and did not like to use it. In the 1970s however, all of this changed; and from now on “capitalism” became a word with positive public connotations. It could suddenly be found in advertisements, in the business press, in the speeches of CEOs, and so on. “Most important, the fundamentally Marxian claim that capitalism as a system is global, unified, and coherent has been embraced by the apostles of neo-liberalism. This is their foundation for arguing that each nation has no choice but to engage in the same process of privatization, deregulation, and public-sector retrenchment if it expects to prosper in an increasingly competitive global capitalist system” (Block: 85).</p>
<p>Block’s essay appeared a decade ago, and if he had updated it today, he might have added that as the popularity of the term capitalism has continued in the public sphere, its use among social scientists has declined. Today’s sociologists, for example, tend to use such words as “the economy,” “the market,” “entrepreneurship,” “corporations,” and so on—but rarely “capitalism.”</p>
<p>But this tendency to ignore capitalism may be about to change. When the financial crisis hit the United States, many academics felt a need to take a new look at the theory of capitalism and see what it can add to understanding what is going on. By now, several years after the collapse of Lehman Brothers, you can find quite a few attempts by sociologists and other social scientists to revive the analyses of capitalism. The two works that will be reviewed in this essay belong to this group: a textbook on global capitalism by Miguel Centeno and Joseph Cohen, and a monograph on the recent history of capitalism in Germany by Wolfgang Streeck.</p>
<p>Since both of these works are very interesting to read and provide the reader with a number of important facts and arguments, I will describe each in some detail. I will also track how both of the authors try to theorize capitalism. Are we in for a revival of the classical theory of capitalism, that is, the Marxian idea that there is a capitalist mode of production, whose innermost law is that of accumulation (M-C-M)? Or will there perhaps be a sociologized version of this—a bit like the sociologists took the Marxist concept of class and turned it into “mobility” and “stratification”? Or maybe we are in for something totally new and exciting about capitalism?</p>
<p>Centeno and Cohen’s <italic>Global Capitalism</italic> is part of a recent series published by Polity Press, which also contains books on markets (Patrik Aspers), the state and the economy (Nina Bandelj), and money and credit (Bruce Carruthers and Laura Ariovich). All of these books are quick reads, rather short (175–200 pages), and aimed at the undergraduate textbook market.</p>
<p>But even if the book by Centeno and Cohen is a suitable choice for undergraduate courses, it also deserves attention in its own right as an attempt to nail down what global capitalism is. While there exist an enormous amount of books on globalization, the serious literature on global capitalism is much smaller. What exactly is global capitalism? When did it emerge? What is its future? And what effect has it had, so far? All of these are questions that Centeno and Cohen try to address.</p>
<p>Capitalism, according to the authors, is characterized by two institutions: private property and the market. Capitalism is also complex and contradictory; and it is described as a “deep institution” (p. 5). Early on in the book global capitalism is described as a form of capitalism that is “interconnected and networked across a variety of borders”; there also exist agreements regarding the rules of the game (p. 15).</p>
<p>Even if global capitalism first appeared in its characteristic form a few decades ago, it traces its origins many centuries before. The authors cite four turning points in its history: 1500 (European domination of the world), 1800 (innovations in technology, organizations, and the economy), 1945 (postwar U.S.-led domination), and 1989 (the fall of the Berlin Wall).</p>
<p>Global capitalism emerged in full force around 1990. It is especially linked to the ideological victory of capitalism, which took place around this time, and to the entrance of the Pacific nations into what had so far been a North Atlantic system. The authors also write, “what is new, and the reason why global capitalism is so novel, is the level of integration of economies, and the speed and force with which previously isolated events cross borders” (p. 35).</p>
<p>The three most important manifestations of global capitalism, according to Centeno and Cohen, are trade, finance, and consumption; and a separate chapter is devoted to each of these topics. These three chapters are then followed by another set of three chapters, which present the consequences of global capitalism. The authors focus on the effects of trade on inequality, on the effect of finance on governance, and on the effect of consumption on the environment.</p>
<p>These six chapters constitute the main body of <italic>Global Capitalism</italic>. They are all easy to read and very informative. The authors describe, for example, how international trade has accelerated since the birth of global capitalism in the 1990s and even overtaken the growth rate in GDP. When they discuss consumption, they tie it to marketing, including such phenomena as advertisement and market research. They also emphasize the importance of the absence of a global political order. “Capitalism,” they write, “may be practiced globally, but it is ruled nationally” (p. 124).</p>
<p>In discussing finance, Centeno and Cohen argue that it has become disassociated from the real economy and become a world of its own. Global capitalism has also had an important impact on the stratification between countries and inside countries. While capitalism has raised the level of living for many, it has hurt many individuals as well.</p>
<p>While <italic>Global Capitalism</italic> can be described as a fresh and well-written textbook, <italic>Re-Forming Capitalism</italic> by Wolfgang Streeck, is a detailed scholarly monograph. Its empirical focus is on the transformation that the German economy has gone through during the last twenty-five years. The way in which Streeck analyzes his case study, however, has implications that go well beyond the particular case of Germany.</p>
<p><italic>Re-Forming Capitalism</italic> is to my mind one of the best books on modern capitalism that has been written during the last few decades. In its theoretical part it takes on the hard task of trying to make sense of modern capitalism from a fundamentally novel perspective. The book is also very pleasurable to read. The chapters are short, and the author elegantly introduces the reader to his case study, and then theorizes it, drawing out its general implications for the analysis of modern capitalism.</p>
<p>Together with Peter Katzenstein, Streeck may well be the social scientist who knows the most about the political economy of post-war Germany. For several decades he has followed what goes on in German political and economic affairs, and this level of expertise comes through everywhere in the book and makes it extra rewarding to read.</p>
<p><italic>Re-Forming Capitalism</italic> takes “Model Germany” as its point of departure and follows it to its dissolution a few decades later. In the 1970s and 1980s Germany was widely seen as a model for the rest of the advanced industrial world. What made Germany so very attractive was its combination of low unemployment, a high degree of equality for the workers, and social peace. All of this came about under a form of welfare corporatism, in which capital, labor, and the state succeeded in coming to an agreement.</p>
<p>By the 1990s, however, things began to change and today “Model Germany” is gone. How and why this happened is the main empirical question that Streeck attempts to answer. His answer comes in three carefully-planned installments. In the first of these, he presents what happened in close empirical detail. Streeck, to be more precise, looks carefully at five sections: collective bargaining, intermediary organizations, welfare corporatism, public finance, and corporate governance.</p>
<p>In <italic>Modell Deutschland</italic>, collective bargaining covered large parts of the industry and was very centralized. Some twenty-five years later it covered fewer industries, many fewer workers and was local in nature. Parallel to this development, intermediary organizations changed as well. By the early 2000s, they had less power and fewer members than when “Model Germany” was around.</p>
<p>In the three remaining sectors that Streeck follows, similar changes took place as well. Welfare corporatism was hollowed out, a severe fiscal crisis developed, and German capitalist firms broke away from their tight community and often severed their traditional links to a bank.</p>
<p>Given all of this empirical evidence of the decline of “Model Germany,” Streeck asks in Part II of his book, how is one to interpret it? One answer would be to do so with the help of institutionalism; and this is also what Streeck sets out to do. He asks if the decline of the German model can be traced back to the dissolution of its institutions. And if so, how are we to understand the concepts of institution and institutional change?</p>
<p>Stated in this summary way, Streeck’s way of formulating his question may not seem either particularly interesting or novel. In my own view, however, this part of Streeck’s analysis is absolutely fascinating; and the reason for this has to do with the creative and ingenious way in which Streeck proceeds. To my mind, Part II is about as good as social science gets.</p>
<p>Streeck begins by making clear that the form of institutional change that is relevant in the case of the five different sections is one of <italic>gradual institutional change</italic>. Today this concept is mainly associated with the work of Kathleen Thelen, a collaborator and sometimes-co-author with Streeck. The key idea is that institutions typically change in a very slow and piecemeal fashion.</p>
<p>Streeck is also interested in the fact that all five sectors have moved in the very same direction all by themselves. He carefully establishes that there does not exist some exogenous factor(s) behind the development in the five sectors. From this he concludes that the only possible explanation is that the five sectors are part of a slowly changing institutional system. Institutions, he suggests in Chapter Nine, may be “self-undermining” and go through a “life-cycle.”</p>
<p>As a result of this slow institutional transformation, Germany has changed in a fundamental manner. It has gone from being the successful partnership of Model Germany to being something else, something that is considerably less organized. The disorganization that Germany has gone through, however, has not resulted in an atomistic social structure. Modern Germany is still co-ordinated, Streeck says, but in a different way. The co-ordination and organization of capitalism are, in other words, two different phenomena.</p>
<p>So far Streeck has drawn on the concepts of gradual institutional change and disorganization in order to capture the transformation of German society since the 1990s. Two additional factors that make the reading of this analysis so interesting now must be mentioned. One is the tentative and sophisticated way in which Streeck presents his arguments. The reader gets to follow each of his moves, many of which are refreshingly novel. The second is Streeck’s attempt to bring history, in a radical way, into the very core of his analysis.</p>
<p>In bringing history and a discussion of history into the analysis, Streeck draws on the formidable German historical tradition from Mommsen, Weber, and others. This means that he does not simply present the reader with historical facts, but uses history to sharpen the social science analysis and bring it to a higher level. With the help of historical data, he emphasizes the contingent and non-reversible nature of events; and he transforms stable social structures into uncertain processes. He also attacks the logic of rational choice, variable sociology and the “varieties of capitalism” approach.</p>
<p>When he refers to varieties of capitalism, Streeck primarily means the work with this title, as authored by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0094306112457657">Peter Hall and David Soskice (2001)</xref>. According to Streeck, their analysis is far too functionalistic, efficiency- and equilibrium-oriented. It also fails in its fundamental task, namely to analyze capitalism. “The ‘varieties of capitalism’ can see only the varieties [of national capitalism] but has literally nothing to say about capitalism” (p. 227).</p>
<p>By the end of Part II, the reader has been presented with an argument for an historically-oriented form of institutionalism, which gives full room to process and contingency. Streeck also refers to biological evolutionary theory as a model for what he has in mind. In this type of theory you take the heritage from the past into account as well as the need to survive, uncertainty as well as the fact that the environment keeps changing. What will happen is always unpredictable. “Evolutionary biology may help historical institutionalism develop a concept of history that is open but not determinate; intelligible without being teleological; and full of both critical junctures and path-setting constraints” (p. 183).</p>
<p>Through Parts I and II the reader has been told in asides that while an institutional analysis is absolutely crucial to understand the changes Germany has gone through, it is not enough. The institutional analysis has also to be linked to an analysis of capitalism. The goal is to go from “<italic>a general theory of institutional change</italic> to <italic>a historical theory of capitalist development</italic>” (p. 227; emphasis in the text). By the time readers get to Part III, they are eager to see what this historical theory of capitalist development will look like.</p>
<p>In Part III, and especially in the chapter “Bringing Capitalism Back In,” Streeck argues that what has brought about the change in the German political economy is a change in capitalism itself. Since the early 1990s, German capitalism has gone through a process from organized capitalism to a more liberal kind of capitalism. Institutions that were obligatory (“Durkheimian”) have slowly had to make place for more voluntary institutions (“Williamsonian”).</p>
<p>This change has not been orchestrated by some powerful actor, say the capitalist class. It has not been caused by globalization; and German unification only affected it by accelerating it. It has instead proceeded on a micro and meso level, as described in Part I with its analysis of the five sectors.</p>
<p>Once more Streeck resorts to his imagery of biological evolutionism. What has happened is not the result of a search for efficiency or the establishment of a new equilibrium. Germany’s development can much better be understood as being driven by the past and an attempt to deal with the uncertainty of the present, resulting in new social creations similar to what happened to the various species that Darwin analyzed.</p>
<p>To better understand modern capitalism Streeck suggests that we should use three theoretical building blocks. The first is that the actors in capitalism are typically unruly, restless, and opportunistic. The second is what is known as the Polanyian double movement or the idea that a push towards liberalization of capitalism tends to produce its opposite or attempts to protect society. The third is that capitalist development does not mean maximization or efficiency; it is instead the result of many actors following different interests, in an environment of uncertainty and in which unintended consequences are common.</p>
<p>Toward the end of his book, Streeck shows his distaste for contemporary capitalism, in Germany and elsewhere. The giant corporations are described as “predators” that have escaped from their “cages” (pp. 234–35). The short period after World War II, when historical conditions were such that the interests of the state, the workers and the capitalists to some extend were aligned, is now gone. “Capital today no longer needs the protective shell of the democratic nation-state, neither for political nor economic reasons” (p. 201).</p>
<p>The works by Streeck, and Centeno and Cohen agree on some points and disagree on others. While Streeck tends to underscore the negative sides of capitalism, Centeno and Cohen are more in the tradition of Adam Smith: capitalism does have its negative aspects but is fundamentally effective in raising the standard of living for the majority of the people. And while the emphasis in Streeck’s analysis is on the transformation of national capitalism, Centeno and Cohen suggest that a new form of capitalism has come into being, global capitalism.</p>
<p>Streeck, and Centeno and Cohen agree on the other hand that social science needs to return to the tradition of Marx-Weber-Schumpeter and analyze capitalism again. Streeck says that the working title of his book was “bringing capitalism back in,” and this also expresses the thrust of the analysis by Centeno and Cohen. Institutional analysis is useful and necessary—but it has to be wedded to an analysis of capitalism.</p>
<p>Both the book by Streeck and the one by Centeno and Cohen may signal a comeback for capitalism among sociologists. More generally, the current financial crisis has also made a number of social scientists feel that there is something missing in contemporary sociology and economics, and that a better understanding of capitalism is necessary.</p>
<p>But if the idea of a comeback for capitalism is easy to accept, the next question is harder. That is: <italic>what exactly is capitalism, and what form(s) does it take today</italic>? At the outset of this review essay I mentioned that the term capitalism has become common in the business press; and a turn to this type of analysis would not be very rewarding. Its mantra is simply that private property and free markets will create wellbeing.</p>
<p>The type of Panglossian assertions that one can find in the business press stands in sharp contrast to the hard-hitting analysis of capitalism that one finds in the work of Marx. In this type of analysis, economics, history, and sociology are all present and have been fused together in a synthesis that still lacks its equal. The problem with Marx’s model of capitalism is of course that few people today believe in economic laws that operate with iron necessity, a declining rate of profit and the like.</p>
<p>What type of analysis of capitalism should we then choose? What is sometimes forgotten is that there exists, besides the Marxian literature and the business literature, an enormous amount of social science works on capitalism that can be drawn on for inspiration. Before World War II, there are especially the works of Max Weber, Werner Sombart, Joseph Schumpeter, Karl Polanyi, and John Maynard Keynes. And after World War II, there is an even larger literature. Some of the major names include E.P. Thompson, Immanuel Wallerstein, Claus Offe, Fred Block, and Robert Brenner, and many, many other scholars could be mentioned as well.</p>
<p>Time has come, it seems to me, to start discussing this literature and use it to revive and re-construct the analysis of contemporary capitalism. Does there exist something that should be called global capitalism, as Centeno and Cohen suggest, and if so, exactly what characterizes it? Or is it rather the case, as Streeck seems to think, that there exist today a number of national capitalisms which all are moving in the direction of something new, maybe a coordinated but disorganized capitalism? Capitalism has made a comeback in the real world, and it is now up to social scientists to analyze it.</p>
