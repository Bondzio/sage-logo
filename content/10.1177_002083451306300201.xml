<p>63.1341 ABDOLLAHIAN, Mark A., <italic>et al</italic>. — <bold>Dynamics of cultural change: the human development perspective.</bold> <italic>International Studies Quarterly</italic> 56(4), Dec. 2012: 827–842.</p>
<p>The relationship between economic development, cultural change, and political liberalization is often explored through the lens of classic modernization theory. Under the human development perspective, economic prosperity acts as a catalyst for cultural development, leading to social values that favor liberalization, and thus promotes effective democracy. Using a systems dynamic approach, we formalize the dynamic causal structure specified in the human development perspective, develop a novel econometric procedure (Genetic Algorithm Nonlinear Least Squares) to estimate the parameters of highly nonlinear, continuous time models, and verify our formal model using five waves of data from the World Values Survey. Our results indicate that development is strongly nonlinear and path dependent: Economic progress is a necessary condition for successful secularization and expressive political behavior, which are antecedents for lasting democratic institutions.

<p>63.1342 ADAMS, James, <italic>et al</italic>. — <bold>Does collective responsibility for performance alter party strategies? Policy-seeking parties in proportional systems.</bold> <italic>British Journal of Political Science</italic> 43(1), Jan. 2013: 1–23.</p>
<p>J. Adams and S. Merrill [“Policy-seeking parties in a parliamentary democracy with proportional representation: a valence-uncertainty model”, <italic>Ibid</italic>. 39(3), 2009: 539–558; <italic>Abstr</italic>. 59.7009] developed a model of policy-seeking parties in a parliamentary democracy competing in a PR electoral system, in which party elites are uncertain about voters' evaluations of the parties' valence attributes such as competence, integrity and charisma. This article extends that model to situations where voters hold coalitions of parties collectively responsible for their valence-related performances, such as how voters evaluate governing parties' competence in handling issues like the economy, crime and foreign policy crises. Computations suggest the central substantive conclusions reported in Adams and Merrill extend to this generalized model, and that collective responsibility enhances coalition members' incentives to converge to similar policy positions but depresses their prospects of achieving their policy objectives.

<p>This study investigates circumstances that affect individuals' decisions of whether or not to flee their homes during civilian conflicts. Building on the “choice-centered” approach to studying forced migration, I test the argument that people make a decision to flee or stay even [in] highly dangerous circumstances. Using primary data collected through a public opinion survey in Nepal, I test a number of hypotheses regarding the impact of factors such as violence, economic opportunity, physical infrastructure or geographical terrain, and social networks on forced migration, providing an individual-level test of the choice-centered approach to studying forced migration. The empirical results are consistent with the major hypotheses developed in aggregate-level studies and provide better insights into the factors that affect individual-level behavior. [R, abr.]</p>
<p>63.1344 AHMED, Amel; SIL, Rudra — <bold>When multi-method research subverts methodological pluralism — or, why we still need single-method research.</bold> <italic>Perspectives on Politics</italic> 10(4), Dec. 2012: 935–953.</p>
<p>Focusing on multi-method research (MMR) that combines some type of qualitative analysis with statistical or formal approaches, we demonstrate that error-reduction and cross-validation are not feasible where methods are not sufficiently similar in their basic ontologies and their conceptions of causality. In such cases, MMR may still yield important benefits, but these can be readily obtained through collaboration among scholars specializing in single-method research (SMR). Such scholars often set the standards for the application of particular methods and produce distinctive insights that can elude researchers concerned about competently deploying different methods and producing coherent findings. Thus, the unchecked proliferation of multi-method skill-sets risks forfeiting the benefits of SMR and marginalizing idiographically-oriented qualitative research that fits less well with formal or quantitative approaches.

<p>This paper outlines a number of changes in social and political thought following the momentous events of 1989: the rise of post-modernism, identitarian politics and the transformation of notions of race into culture. It indicates origins for this drift in ideas to be found in the heritage of anti-Enlightenment polemics associated with political romanticism, in Europe as well as globally, in the 19th and 20th c. It then concentrates on the theme of civilization, and of the use of this term in international relations.

<p>“Strategic culture” is analyzed both in its context and as a special type of epistemology. It is based on accomplishments of historical sociology, perceptions of national character of national identity and path dependence. Its connection with political culture and especially with symbolic forms influenced by constructivism is interpreted from an epistemological point of view. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>This article is the first to present a broadly comparative, longitudinal analysis of the mutual influence between change in women's presence in parliaments and change in women's beliefs in women's ability to govern. I evaluate the relationship between change in the percentage of women in parliaments and change in the belief in women's ability to govern from the early 1990s to the mid-2000s across 25 developmentally and culturally diverse nations.

<p>63.1348 ALLEN, Nicholas; HEATH, Oliver — <bold>Reputations and research quality in British political science: the importance of journal and publisher rankings in the 2008 RAE [Research Assessment Exercise].</bold> <italic>British Journal of Politics and International Relations</italic> 15(1), Feb. 2013: 147–162.</p>
<p>This article analyzes the results of the 2008 Research Assessment Exercise (RAE). It demonstrates that the reputations of political science journals and scholarly publishers can explain the performance of institutions submitted to the RAE's Politics and International Studies sub-panel, and that there were also clear relationships between types of output and research quality. Outputs in top journals and with top presses were strongly associated with 4∗ quality and research excellence. Moreover, press and journal reputations appeared to have a greater impact than the type of publication. These findings should encourage policy-makers to consider more cost-effective and efficient ways of evaluating research. [R]</p>
<p>63.1349 ANSOLABEHERE, Stephen; MEREDITH, Marc; SNOWBERG, Erik — <bold>Asking about numbers: why and how</bold> <italic>Political Analysis</italic> 21(1), Winter 2013: 48–69.</p>
<p>Survey questions about quantities offer a number of advantages over more common qualitative questions. However, concerns about survey respondents' abilities to accurately report numbers have limited the use of quantitative questions. This article shows quantitative questions are feasible and useful for the study of economic voting. First, survey respondents are capable of accurately assessing familiar economic quantities, such as the price of gas. Second, careful question design — in particular providing respondents with benchmark quantities — can reduce measurement error due to respondents not understanding the scale on which more complex quantities, such as the unemployment rate, are measured. Third, combining quantitative and qualitative questions sheds light on where partisan bias enters economic assessments: in perceiving, judging, or reporting economic quantities. [R]</p>

<p>This paper examines critically the type of political participation advocated by each of the main recent conceptions of democracy. The conclusion is that, in varying degrees and for various reasons, all paint an unsatisfactory fit of political participation in the definition and quality of democracy. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>This paper is based on the premise that any worldview can be associated with one of the four basic paradigms: functionalist, interpretive, radical humanist, and radical structuralist. It argues that any view expressed with respect to globalization and state is based on one of the four paradigms or worldviews. It, therefore, discusses four views with respect to the nature and role of globalization and state which correspond to the four broad worldviews. The paper emphasizes that the four views expressed are equally scientific and informative; they look at the nature and role of globalization and state from a certain paradigmatic viewpoint.

<p>The 9/11 [2001] attacks on the US have motivated psychologists to advance counterterrorism and related operations through psychological principles and skills. They seek to legitimize adversarial interventions against targets by prioritizing societal welfare over traditional, individual-focused principles of psychological ethics. We distinguish adversarial operational psychology, which facilitates deceptive and coercive operations, from collaborative operational psychology, which optimizes personnel performance in high-risk operations. Our analysis finds that adversarial operational psychology is largely unsupported by the American Psychological Association Ethics Code, that its potential benefits are exceeded by the likelihood of irreversible harms, and that its military necessity is undemonstrated. We offer a three-factor framework for distinguishing between adversarial and collaborative operational psychology, and we recommend institutional separation of these roles so that professional psychologists do not serve in adversarial capacities.

<p>63.1353 AYSON, Robert — <bold>The complex stability of political equilibria.</bold> <italic>Political Science</italic> 64(2), Dec. 2012: 145–161.</p>
<p>This article explains how types of government, their foreign policy stances, the distribution of power between states, and international institutions can be regarded as four types of political equilibrium. With the help of findings from economics, game theory, biological sciences and complexity theory, it then examines the relevance of three successive levels of stability for these equilibrium types. The first level of stability refers to the preservation of a unique political equilibrium. The second refers to the capacity of the given political system to make a transition from one unique equilibrium to another. The third, complex stability, refers to patterns of oscillation between multiple simultaneous political equilibria. An attempt is also made to ameliorate the coordination problem which arises with multiple equilibria and comments are offered on the potential applications of these findings. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>The author reminds us what the term means: all of philosophy, the thinking of “beings as a whole”. Politics “after” metaphysics would, thus, spell out a politics “after” philosophy, having gotten over the thought of the totality of being. Or, more positively, it would be a politics that responds to the injunction to start thinking instead of philosophizing, with all the frictions this injunction causes when it comes across scientific, theological, and humanist modes of inquiry.

<p>This paper analyzes the evolution of public policies on nuclear energy from an international perspective highlighting an interesting sociological paradox: the opposition to nuclear power contributed to the development of the environmental movement; and at present, the promoters of this kind of energy include environmental arguments in their discourses, the fear of climate change and the reduction of CO2. Although the Kyoto Protocol does not accept this kind of energy as a clean development mechanism (CDM), its promotion is carried out on the basis of environmental objectives, so that the nuclear lobby is obtaining more social acceptation thanks to the environmental discourse in the last four decades. The nuclear policies at an international level are analyzed inside a wider research about the nuclear debate.

<p>63.1356 BAKKER, Ryan; POOLE, Keith T. — <bold>Bayesian metric multidimensional scaling.</bold> <italic>Political Analysis</italic> 21(1), Winter 2013: 125–140.</p>
<p>We show how to apply Bayesian methods to noisy ratio scale distances for both the classical similarities problem as well as the unfolding problem. Bayesian methods produce essentially the same point-estimates as the classical methods, but are superior in that they provide more accurate measures of uncertainty in the data. Identification is nontrivial for this class of problems because a configuration of points that reproduces the distances is identified only up to a choice of origin, angles of rotation, and sign flips on the dimensions. We prove that fixing the origin and rotation is sufficient to identify a configuration in the sense that the corresponding maxima/minima are inflection points with full-rank Hessians. However, an unavoidable result is multiple posterior distributions that are mirror images of one another. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>Proponents of global egalitarian justice often argue that their positions are compatible with the principle of self-determination, [but] object to one central component: that the borders of states (or other political units) are normatively significant for the allocation of rights and duties; that duties of justice and democratic rights should stop or change at borders. I propose an argument in defense of the normative significance of territorial boundaries that draws on a political interpretation of the principle of self-determination. The political interpretation is distinct from the two major approaches to self-determination: the national and the democratic. It challenges the position that political memberships and political borders are morally arbitrary; [and] it helps define the realm of permissible autonomy for self-governing political units, which does not ignore duties to nonmembers and outsiders.

<p>This text analyzes the definitions of the notion of “historicities”, explores how the social sciences in general and history in particular uses or could use it and considers what has been called “presentism”. While the definition is not at all fixed: historicity can be understood as how the players of a society or a community fit their present into a history, how they think of it as situated in a time that is not neutral but significant, by the conception they have of it, the interpretations they give and the accounts they make of it. Historicity implies a moving and changing consciousness of the past and the future, shaped by the present. It is thus important to emphasize the plurality of types of historicity and of their coexistence. The forms of dominant historicities and the resistance that can be brought to bear on them must also be considered. [R] [First article of a thematic issue on “Twentieth century historicities.

<p>The revolutions in the Arab world show that strong religion and liberal democracy are compatible: they are post-secular revolutions. As already the revolutions of 1989 proved in some respect, in contrast to the secular ideals of the French Revolution, revolution and religion can go hand in hand in a post-secular way. Analyzing the revolutions of 1989, J. Habermas speaks of “catching-up revolutions” which brought nothing new to the course of history. Yet after 9/11 [2001], he started to develop his idea of a post-secular society in which secular and religious citizens are equally entitled to make their arguments in a public sphere. Criticizing the early Habermas with the later, the article argues that the post-secular revolutions of 1989 and 2011 are preparing the ground for a post-secular democracy.

<p>British scholars have inquired how to assess the constitutional position of the local government in the UK and its effect for improving or hindering autonomy and democracy at the local level. This paper combines conceptual tools of continental public law and political science. It differentiates three concepts of territorial state configuration: territorial structure, territorial texture, and vertical diffusion of state authority. The confusion of these three dimensions has not only impaired an adequate assessment of the constitutional position of local governments, but the structural dimension has been under-theorized, thus distorting measurements of subnational authority. Moreover, scholars have underestimated structural constraints upon changes in the local government position within the polity. Finally, I plot selected countries in a Cartesian system, comparing them from the perspective of territorial structure and vertical authority diffusion. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>Recent research suggests that double taxation treaties (DTTs) increase bilateral FDI. However, entering such a tax treaty is not unambiguously favorable for both partners if their bilateral FDI positions are asymmetric. Due to the usual bias toward residence-based taxation in DTTs, net capital importers can face a considerable loss of tax revenues when entering these treaties. Nevertheless, there is an ever denser and growing global network of such treaties. This article argues that net capital-importing countries are caught in a prisoners' dilemma: Collectively, they would be better off refusing to sign DTTs, but each one has an incentive to sign DTTs to gain a competitive advantage. Countries will look toward and be influenced by the policy choices of other focal countries and will follow their DTT activity. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>IOs play a central role in most accounts of power in IR. However, our understanding of how IOs exercise power seldom moves beyond the traditional material — normative dimensions of power. We suggest that an important dimension to understand IO power is the contestation-integration dimension, where IOs can exercise power either by integrating countries into networks of cultural exchange or by contesting existing orders. By analyzing multilateral aid data and building on recent advances in our understanding of the effectiveness of IO anti-corruption work, we apply this framework to show how the contestation-ntegration dimension helps us understand the success or failure of anti-corruption strategies. We show that when IOs contest existing orders using governance rankings and aid conditionality, they suffer from ideational shortcomings, including lack of objective data and contested policy advice.

<p>Why do armed groups recruit large numbers of children as fighters, often coercively? The international community has tried to curb these crimes by shaming and punishing leaders who commit them. Are these policies effective and sufficient? The answer lies in more attention to the strategic interaction between rebel leaders and recruits. We adapt theories of industrial organization to rebellious groups and show how, being less able fighters, children are attractive recruits if and only if they are easier to intimidate, indoctrinate, and misinform than adults. This ease of manipulation interacts with the costliness of war crimes to influence rebel leaders' incentives to coerce children into war. We use a case study and a novel survey of former child recruits in Uganda to illustrate this argument and provide hard evidence. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>A large literature in IPE views individuals' trade policy preferences as a function of the income effects of economic openness. We argue that the expected environmental consequences of free trade play a noteworthy role for protectionist attitudes that has not been noted so far. We use unique Swiss survey data that contain measures of individuals' environmental concerns and different aspects of trade policy preferences to examine whether those who are more concerned about the environment also hold more protectionist trade policy preferences. Our results support this expectation. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>The mean majority deficit in a two-tier voting system is a function of the partition of the population. We derive a new square-root rule: for odd-numbered population sizes and equipopulous units the mean majority deficit is maximal when the member size of the units in the partition is close to the square root of the population size. Furthermore, within the partitions into roughly equipopulous units, partitions with small even numbers of units or small even-sized units yield high mean majority deficits. We discuss the implications for the winner-takes-all system in the US Electoral College. [R]</p>

<p>It is now widely accepted that the classic arguments regarding the “structural power” of business are too “structuralist”. Subsequent research has focused on a widening array of independent variables that shape the variability of such power. This paper extends this research tradition, arguing that structural power theory has given insufficient attention to governmental actors, typically the targets of such power. The paper argues that ideas and the ideational processes through which government and state leaders construct threat perceptions regarding structural power can be important in mediating such power. The literature on power typically argues that power shapes ideas and disciplines target subjects. This paper revises this logic by arguing that the ideas of target subjects can also shape power. The paper's arguments then are essentially constructivist. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>How do international organizations deal with the persistent challenge of uncertainty? Focusing on the case of IMF's conditionality policy, this article provides several key insights into international organization (IO) practices. It provides an account of the different forms that ambiguity can take in international organizations and develops an explanation for why institutional ambiguities appear and persist. Looking inside the IO black box, the study examines how interests, institutional culture, and legitimacy concerns shape actors' support for ambiguity, and how these preferences combine with broader structural factors to produce a predisposition toward institutional ambiguity. Finally, it points toward certain implications of organizations' tendency toward ambiguity, suggesting that this may play an important role in enabling institutional expansion. [R, abr.]</p>
<p>63.1369 BETZ, Timm — <bold>Robust estimation with nonrandom measurement error and weak instruments.</bold> <italic>Political Analy</italic>sis 21(1), Winter 2013: 86–96.</p>
<p>Two common problems in applications of two-stage least squares (2SLS) are nonrandom measurement error in the endogenous variable and weak instruments. In the presence of nonrandom measurement error, 2SLS yields inconsistent estimates. In the presence of weak instruments, confidence intervals and p-values can be severely misleading. This article introduces a rank-based estimator, grounded in randomization inference, which addresses both problems within a unified framework. Monte Carlo studies illustrate the deficiencies of 2SLS and the virtues of the rank-based estimator in terms of bias and efficiency. A replication of a study of the effect of economic shocks on democratic transitions demonstrates the practical implications of accounting for nonrandom measurement error and weak instruments.

<p>This article provides analytical principles upon which a new societal security dilemma can be constructed in order to conduct a more comprehensive analysis of actor responsibility. A new societal security dilemma framework can be built upon three principles: (1) a security dilemma results in violence depending on how the actors themselves interpret the political structure in which they interact with others; (2) what matters is how actors interpret security and which tools they choose to adopt to achieve security; and (3) identity is not exogenous to the politics of security. I argue that a new societal security, which reflects the politics of security, can provide a more comprehensive, dynamic, political, and realistic analysis of actor responsibility in societal-level confrontations.

<p>This article considers the extent to which Dialogue of Civilizations (DoC) initiatives, as alternative visions of post-secular world order, are likely to address insecurities that they identify; and points to other insecurities that are likely to remain unidentified and unaddressed in the process. In their present conception, DoC initiatives risk falling short of addressing the very insecurities they prioritize (the stability of inter-state order) let alone attending to those experienced by non-state referents, which they overlook. The article [shows] how projects of civilizational dialogue have bracketed civilization, thereby leaving intact the Huntingtonian notion of civilizations as religiously unified autochthonous entities.

<p>63.1373 BIRNIR, Jóhanna Kristín; SATANA, Nil S. — <bold>Religion and coalition politics.</bold> <italic>Comparative Political Studies</italic> 46(1), Jan. 2013: 3–30.</p>
<p>The literature holds that coalition-building parties prefer the policy distance of coalition partners to be as small as possible. In light of continued importance of religion in electoral politics cross-nationally, the distance argument is worrisome for minorities seeking political access because many minorities are of different religion [from that of] the majority representatives forming coalitions. We suggest plurality parties' objectives to demonstrate inclusiveness outweigh the concern over policy distance. We test their hypotheses on a sample of all electorally active ethnic minorities in democracies from 1945 to 2004. We find support for their hypothesis that ethnic parties representing minorities that diverge in religious family from the majority are more likely to be included in governing coalitions than are ethnic minorities at large.

<p>Voter turnout has consistently declined since the 1980s across a wide range of advanced democracies. Much of this decline appears to be the result of young people abstaining. We test two arguments for this trend. The first rests on the claim that the character of elections has changed, specifically that elections have become less competitive and that young people's propensities for voting are particularly negatively affected by this. The second maintains that recent generations have different values and that these value differences explain turnout declines. The authors test these two explanations using three different data-sets: (1) individual-level and election-specific data from 83 elections in eight countries since the 1950s, (2) longitudinal individual-level and district-level data from British elections for the period 1974–2005, and (3) panel data from American presidential elections.

<p>In policy analysis, it is usually assumed that the boundaries of “policy subsystems” (“policy sectors”, etc.) can be specified. Yet empirically, contested, ill-defined and overlapping boundaries are to be observed. Is this a marginal phenomenon or an anomaly occurring so systematically that it calls for further theoretical reflection? To support the latter claim, I pursue a corpus-assisted approach. The resource used is a corpus of parliamentary debates that covers all debates in the regional diet of North Rhine-Westphalia [Germany], 2005–2012. Based on the frequencies of fieldmarkers in subcorpora compiled according to a classification of debates, 24 policy fields can be compared based on a concentration measure and typified as being more or less concentrated. Time-series data can also be derived and facilitate the generation of hypotheses on trends of concentration or deconcentration. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>This article examines factors that explain cross-national variation in states' willingness to repress racist associations. Non-democratic regime history is the primary factor that predisposes a country toward repression. Yet three situational triggers also matter when accounting for the development and application of a state's provisions: (1) the immediate aftermath of the transition to democracy can spark new laws and bans; (2) ratifying UN provisions against racist organizations can prompt state action; and (3) spikes in high-profile racist events or steady increases in the influence of racist associations can generate the passage of new laws or the enforcement of existing legislation. Focusing on the combination of the one predisposing factor and the three situational triggers provides a systematic probabilistic explanation for cross-national variation in liberal democracies' stances toward racist associations.

<p>Strategic-cultural studies continue to proliferate, but scholars still cannot agree on fundamental matters like what a strategic culture is and what it does. This article examines the debates about strategic culture at the philosophical level — especially the debate between A.I. Johnston, who prefers a positivist approach, and C. Gray, who champions interpretivism — and finds that most conceptual models suffer from one of two general problems (and some models exhibit both). Existing models tend to be stated in a manner which is too coherent, meaning they can't account for occasional strategic-behavioral inconsistencies, and/or they suggest too much continuity and cannot thereby adequately account for changes in strategic policy over time. Instead, a model is offered which treats a singular strategic culture as containing multiple co-existing strategic subcultures. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>This article argues that governing knowledge plays a critical role at the border separating public administration from politics. The dichotomy between public administration and politics remains in spite of recurrent criticisms from both the scientific field and the evolution of public policies. The authors show that an approach in terms of knowledge mobilization is relevant in order to question the dichotomy between public administration and politics. They introduce articles that show the role of modes, actors, and possible effects of such a mobilization in the drawing of a border between the administrative and the political fields.

<p>This essay addresses the often neglected role of comparison in political thinking (both formal and everyday). It calls attention to the spatial reasoning of comparisons. It first discusses topological reasoning in debates over the scope and boundaries of the discipline of political theory, and reviews a variety of spatial imaginings found in substantive theoretical arguments, most notably in the field of comparative political thought. It then looks closely at three recent examples of thinking elsewhere by Anglo-American theorists: J. Rawls's <italic>The Law of Peoples</italic>, A. March's <italic>Islam and Liberal Citizenship</italic>, and J. Bowen's <italic>Islam, Law, and Equality in Indonesia</italic>. In these texts, Islam is taken to be the proximate elsewhere of political liberalism.

<p>The author explores the relation between democracy, liberalism, and metaphysics. He coins the term “negative theory”, modeled on negative theology, and argues that it is the best defense of democracy available. Rather than postulate a positive content of God, reason, or, indeed, democracy, negative theology and theory only state what these are not. Relying on an interpretation of Plato's <italic>Theaetetus</italic> and Rawlsian metaethical theory, the author then demonstrates that the negative approach imposes a circular structure on the thinking of its adherents, who must be ready not only to be skeptical but also to be skeptical of skepticism itself.

<p>If an experimental treatment is experienced by both treated and control group units, tests of hypotheses about causal effects may be difficult to conceptualize, let alone execute. We show how counterfactual causal models may be written and tested when theories suggest spillover or other network-based interference among experimental units. We show that the “no interference” assumption need not constrain scholars who have interesting questions about interference. We offer researchers the ability to model theories about how treatment given to some units may come to influence outcomes for other units. We further show how to test hypotheses about these causal effects, and we provide tools to enable researchers to assess the operating characteristics of their tests given their own models, designs, test statistics, and data.

<p>The new classical macroeconomics and mathematical finance have both failed to anticipate the present crisis or explain why it is so severe. They considered only pure market economies devoid of institutions and without concern for historical and structural transformations in contemporary economies. This opens the door to a political-economy analysis of the transformations in socio-political alliances since the demise of the Fordist growth regime. The shift toward market-based financial systems, financial liberalization, and globalization, gave unprecedented power to international financiers and has led to the current crisis. Controlling finance requires resolute action by public authorities and the pressure of citizen social movements. Financial re-regulation is closely related to the relative bargaining power of nation-states and international finance. International comparisons (e.g., North American and German capitalisms) suggest that this is a possible path. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>This article explores arguments for democratically arranged global governance. This issue entails many moral considerations, such as those of duties we owe to people living outside our borders. I explore several arguments that explore the ground and scope of justice by focusing on the characteristics of basic structure, the three most prominent being the coercion-based, the pervasive impact/all affected principles and the cooperation argument. Their critical assessment shows how none is able to refute the need for global application of duties of justice. Although global application of duties of justice does not necessarily entail global democracy, I argue that some kind of coercive power is required and that necessarily entails the need for democratic accountability.

<p>This paper analyzes the origins of economic development theory by focusing on the work of R. Prebisch. When he put forward his theoretical framework, he was faced with the challenges of creating a foundation for development policies in the context of the Cold War. Moreover, Prebisch was part of a social network and institutional setting that transformed his ideas into an influential theory. Economic theories do not rely on natural laws, but result from a historical and social context. Economists are not passive, isolated theoreticians; they are socialized and directly impact the issues on which they theorize. To strengthen the argument, archival research on the Prebisch Papers at the UN Archives as well as interviews from the UN Oral History Project are included. [R]</p>

<p>I argue that involvement in territorial disputes and group competition determine whether terrorist groups embrace an electoral strategy. Conflicts involving territorial disputes are more likely to see terrorist groups contest elections because electoral participation may aid in the creation of the independent or autonomous territory they desire. Increased group competition changes the number of actors, which impacts the level and distribution of resources (supporters, finance, and arms) involved in the conflict. When multiple terrorist groups compete, groups are motivated to participate in elections in response to new competitive pressures. This argument is tested using a large<italic>-n</italic> dataset of 89 terrorist groups in existence during the years 1968–2006 and a case study of Hamas's decision to contest elections.

<p>This article asserts that the link between peace and security and stabilization and development, as exemplified by the UN-mandated international presences in Afghanistan, is to be welcomed but that such an evolution is problematic for a number of reasons. One, the broader functions of the military in peace support raises questions for <italic>jus ad bellum</italic> such as determining whether the basis for the peace enforcement has been achieved, as states and their armed forces engage in stabilization and state-building initiatives. Two, the broader functions are problematic for <italic>jus in bello</italic> as the practical application of such initiatives is not easily incorporated into a body of law that was drafted primarily to deal with inter-state conflict and provides only limited guidance on internal conflict such as that in Afghanistan.

According to the model, this effect is compounded by entropy affecting the communication of rules and their results, limited discretion over rules and procedures, and non-ownership of rules. However, the model predicts that red tape will be mediated by communication from clients and within the organization. Bozeman's model is often cited in the literature, but it has not been subjected to comprehensive empirical verification. This study tests the model using data from a multiple informant survey of 136 upper-tier English local government authorities conducted in 2004 and several secondary sources. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>The mediums of space and the sea have many common characteristics. They are both common zones upon which armed forces cannot subsist. Due to their nature, these environments cannot be rendered into national possession. The inherent value of both mediums is to transmit communications. In particular, communications enabled by space-based assets are vital for digital societies. As such, these assets must be protected. However, using weapons to protect them is fraught with political peril. In this regard, it would be wise for spacepower strategists to consult the strategies of classical sea power theory to find important insights. There is a wealth of strategic knowledge to be considered here that would shed light on how to deal with threats in space, including the issue of orbital debris. [R]</p>

<p>Building on recent advances in international and comparative political economy, we propose a framework for the comparative study of [how] transnational integration regimes (TIRs) shape the development of regulatory institutions in emerging market democracies. The ability of TIRs to alleviate the supply-and-demand problems of institutional change in these countries depends in large part on [how] TIRs translate their purpose and power into institutional goals, assistance and monitoring. Integration modes can empower or limit the participation of a variety of domestic public and private actors to pursue and contest alternative institutional experiments. We illustrate the use of our framework via a brief comparison of the impact of the EU accession process on post-communist countries and the NAFTA on Mexico, with special attention to the development of food safety regulatory institutions.

Characteristics of this new international order include a growing number of countries actively involved in geopolitics; a representativeness of all continents on the global geopolitical scene; a diversity of available models for political and socioeconomic development; and an ever-growing importance of resource-rich countries and zones of energy export.</p>

<p>Many foreign aid agencies promote peace-building as a global policy objective. This paper considers how they have fared in practice in subnational, “peripherical” conflicts in Asia that have relatively low international profiles, using case material from Aceh in Indonesia, the Far South of Thailand, and Sri Lanka. Foreign aid has supported long-term economic growth in these countries but typically failed to address peace-building concerns or associated inequalities between ethnic groups. Many barriers limit the scope to promote peace-building, stemming from recipient governments' reluctance to accept external involvement and from aid agencies' own limitations. Those agencies that do address conflict concerns tend not to use technical peace-building tools or methodologies. Instead, they prioritize the root causes of conflicts, recognizing human rights protection and equality of opportunity as policy aims. [R, abr.]</p>

It then asserts an alternative ontology of (interdependent) human existence across borders and ecosystems, one that incorporates an ethically transformed state as a legal principle and an important means of cosmopolitan world order.

<p>The paper analyzes the impact of natural resource abundance on selected governance indicators.

The results show that exports of natural resources have, above all, led to an increase in corruption. This result is robust to both different model specifications and an alternative indicator for natural resource abundance. For other governance indicators, such as law-and-order and bureaucratic quality, we either find no results or results that lack robustness. [R]</p>
<p>63.1396 BUTUROVIC, Zeljka — <bold>Deep down: consequentialist assumptions underlying policy differences.</bold> <italic>Critical Review</italic> 24(2), 2012: 269–289.</p>
<p>A conditional survey establishes a preliminary case for believing that policy differences are to some extent driven by fundamental beliefs about empirical aspects of society and economics. The survey shows willingness in about a third of all respondents to shift their expressed policy preferences when asked a hypothetical question positing negative consequences of their initial preferences. This suggests that assumptions about the consequences of public policies may play as important a role in policy preferences, or a more important role, than do values, personality traits, or motivation. However, roughly a third of those with the strongest initial attitudes expressed even stronger attitudes — but in the same direction — when confronted with counterattitudinal hypotheticals. This may reflect attitude polarization of the sort encountered by previous researchers, such as Ch. Lord, <italic>et al</italic>.

<p>This article establishes our ability to accumulate knowledge in a field often characterized by changing empirical circumstances and changing theories. Theoretical and conceptual advance may be necessary to capture new developments, but must also be balanced with the need to build on what we already know. Periods of crisis may encourage us to upset that balance. They often encourage the idea that political change and behavior is unprecedented; that new policy-making circumstances are unique, or at least so different from the past that it is difficult to learn lessons from history and current theories. In short, the usual rules do not apply and, by extension, we need new theories that account for new practices. However, new tools need to be judged against our existing collection. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>While post-secularist thought rightly draws our attention to the profound discontinuities of our age, it is too preoccupied with certain specificities of contemporary Western discourse and practice to be able to make sense of the wider challenge-response dynamic that is integral to the current period of transition. This article examines the lacunae of post-secularity and avenues for further development of its insights by reference to four closely interlinked features of a rapidly transforming world order: (1) the transnational character of much religious discourse and practice; (2) the decline of the West and the corresponding shift in the economic and geopolitical center of gravity; (3) the complex relationship between the resurgence of religion and the wider phenomenon of identity politics; and (4) the emerging dialectic between conflictual and dialogical approaches to cultural and geopolitical pluralism.

<p>Drawing on a panel of 136 countries over the period 1982–2004, we study a tipping-point version of Vogel's “California Effect” in the context of the diffusion of human rights practices. Because human rights practices are often deeply embedded in a society's customs and political institutions, we expect that a high level of pressure from the importing countries is needed to bring about changes in an exporting country's human rights records. We find strong empirical support for this threshold effect; provided that the average level of respect for human rights in importing countries is sufficiently high, trading relationships can operate as transmission belts for the diffusion of human rights practices from importing to exporting countries.

<p>Moving from the paradoxes brought about by the goal of democratization, the paper offers an explanation of the power-sharing between international officials and local political actors. On the one hand, a democratic approach fosters self-determination, tends to grant sovereignty and independence to the target country and understands the international mandate as temporary. On the other hand, the goal of democratization entails the establishment of enduring neo-trusteeship, violating the sovereignty and independence of the states that suffer external intervention. The paper focuses on three case-studies — Bosnia, Kosovo and East Timor — to assess how those paradoxes result in conflicting attitudes by international officials, who concede and maintain political and executive powers creating an international-domestic power-sharing in the target country.

<p>J. Habermas's post-secular account is rapidly attracting attention in many fields as a theoretical framework through which to reconsider the role of religion in contemporary societies. This work goes beyond Habermas's conceptualization by placing the post-secular discourse within a broader genealogy of the relationships between space, religion, and politics. Drawing on the work of C. Schmitt, this article contrasts the artificial separation between private and public, religious and secular, state and church, and the logic of inclusion/exclusion on which modernity was established. Revisiting this genealogy is also crucial to illustrating, in light of Schmitt's political theory, the problems underlying Habermas's proposal, emphasizing its hidden homogenizing and universalist logic in an attempt to offer an alternative reflection on the contribution of religious and cultural pluralism within Western democracies.

<p>By 2025, the majority of the world's population is expected to belong to the consumer class, with disposable incomes of at least $10 a day. An industrial revolution must accompany this transformation, however, in order to serve the many unmet needs of the rising consumer class. This industrial revolution, unlike previous ones, will happen without any big technological breakthroughs as its anchors. Instead, innovative firms have to combine many small, mutually reinforcing business practices developed in recent decades to serve consumers in the emerging world. The coming industrial revolution and economic transformation cannot ignore the contextual factors that could trump innovation or make further growth unsustainable.

<p>Employing the governance, competence and relationship perspectives, this article discusses what factors will enhance a government's administrative efficiency and effectiveness, and how to improve an organization's performance. I found a number of factors, including organizational structure, management mechanism, resources and ability, and partnerships, that influence the first question. Regarding the second issue, I argue that compatibility, complementary natures, collaboration, knowledge-sharing, information technology, and effective governance are required to enhance the performance of an organization. The results will assist future researchers and serve as reference for practical applications. [R]</p>

<p>This study examines whether democracies are better able to maintain commitments, focusing on the abandonment behavior of states in times of war. It argues that democracies are better able to maintain their wartime commitments because of the effective veto players within democratic polities and the practice of and respect for institutionalized decision-making procedures. This argument is tested with a statistical analysis of the wartime commitment model and illustrated with a historical case study. As expected, this study finds that democracies are less likely to abandon their partners during war and shows that the effectiveness of veto-players is the important causal mechanism driving the main finding.

<p>This study integrates characteristics of e-voting technologies, political contexts, and behaviors with the technology acceptance model (TAM) to empirically examine how security principles, election types, and political ideology influence overall user intention to use an e-voting system. Structural equation analysis and Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression used on estimates of 228 surveys reveal that perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, accuracy, and confidentiality have direct and indirect impacts on intention to use e-voting. While usefulness has statistically positive effects on voters' intention to use e-voting in different effects of political election types, political ideology does not drive user's adoption of the e-voting system.

<p>63.1408 CHONG, Dennis; DRUCKMAN, James N. — <bold>Counterframing effects.</bold> <italic>Journal of Politics</italic> 75(1), Jan. 2013: 1–16.</p>
<p>Electoral campaigns and policy debates are dynamic processes that unfold over time. In the contest for public opinion, each side tries to frame issues to its advantage, but success also depends on developing effective responses to opposition frames. Surprisingly, scholars have paid little attention to the dynamics of counterframing. We explore how the timing and repetition of counterframes affect their success. Using an over-time experiment, we test several hypotheses that the best counter-framing strategy is contingent on the nature of audiences. Our results show that counterframing effects depend on the extent to which people hold strong or weak opinions. Thus, a uniformly successful communications strategy may be impossible as tactics that are effective on those with weak attitudes may be counterproductive on those with stronger viewpoints.

<p>This paper addresses questions of friendship and political community by investigating comradeship in the life of the soldier. Close attention to soldiers' accounts of their own lives, successes and failures shows that the relationship of friendship to comradeship, and of both to the success of the soldier's individual and communal life, is complex and tense. I describe, and explore the tensions between, two positions: (1) Becoming a soldier is a corrupting loss of individuality and moral sensitivity, and friendship is resistance to it. (2) Becoming a soldier is one form of flourishing, and comradeship is one of its constitutive virtues. I draw particularly on G. Orwell's account of basic training and fighting in the Spanish Civil War, and on T. O'Brien's account of basic training and fighting in Vietnam. [R, abr.] [See <italic>Abstr</italic>. 63.1670]</p>

<p>This paper debates Waltz's theory of international politics as a micro-economic model of international relations. It suggests that Waltz's model theoretical consistency requires assuming both internal and external functional indifferentiation of international actors: systemic shoving and shaping pressures are assumed to make states not only similar in their domestic functions, but also in the balancing logic of action by which they behave in international politics. Since balancing policies are ideal-typical behaviors of both great and small powers, then the notion of structure offered by Waltz lacks the differentiation of logic of action that market implies in economics. Accordingly, Waltz does not succeed in defining price and products in international politics. [Last], the paper revises Waltz's structural model, building on the idea of power exchange between security producers and security consumers. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>We develop and defend a distinction between two types of self-censorship: public and private. First, we suggest that public self-censorship refers to a range of individual reactions to a public censorship regime. Second, private self-censorship is the suppression by an agent of his or her own attitudes where a public censor is either absent or irrelevant. The distinction is derived from a descriptive approach to self-censorship that asks: who is the censor, who is the censee, and how do they interact? We label situations in which censor and censee are different agents as public self-censorship, and situations in which they are the same agents as private self-censorship. We demonstrate the salience of this distinction by analyzing the case of publication of Mohammed cartoons by the Danish newspaper <italic>Jyllands-Posten</italic>. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>This essay considers whether genocide is a neglected area of criminological inquiry. After a brief history of its evolution and definition, genocide is considered alongside other crimes against international law, including international human rights law (specifically, war crimes and crimes against humanity). The essay reviews contemporary perceptions of international crimes in established academic literature. Specific consideration is made of the incidence of genocide in Rwanda and the former Yugoslavia. Genocide is considered across three broad areas: as an issue of law (no crime without law); the nature of the offenders (state, agents of the state, and mass participation); and the nature of the phenomenon itself (with reference to Rwanda and Yugoslavia). Finally, this essay considers whether criminology has neglected genocide and suggests ways of improving academic engagement on this issue. [R]</p>

<p>During the 1970s and 1980s, political psychologists at the State University of New York at Stony Brook focused political scientists' attention on online processing. Borrowing from the new field of social cognition in psychology, they argued that voters' evaluations of candidates are the products of a summing up of reactions to happenings during a campaign. Later, these same scholars yet again borrowed from (a very changed) psychology, and argued that many people, especially the most politically sophisticated, try to confirm their current political evaluations — for example, by seeking out confirmatory evidence and dismissing evidence that challenges their attitudes. We ask whether online processing and motivated reasoning have the same or different implications for democratic governance, and whether the two empirical perspectives can be reconciled.

<p>Drawing on the insights of the current literature concerned with the institutions which fostered and supported the emergence of the IR discipline, this article reassesses the Australian contribution in the interwar years. Contrary to the received view, academies and institutions supported a recognizable IR, albeit in its formative stages. Even by the early 1920s there was a developing awareness that “international relations” was a discrete subject worthy of presentation in a specific curriculum. By the 1930s, IR teachers were familiar with the major methodological debates of the era in the UK and the US. While consistent attention was devoted to international organization, and “collective security” had its champions, the predominant view, in the terminology of the “first debate”, was neither idealist nor realist.

<p>Much of the research on epistemic communities has been limited to single case-studies in articles, rather than broader comparative works, and has focused narrowly on groups of scientists. It is often assumed, erroneously, that epistemic communities are comprised only of scientists, and that the utility of the concept for understanding IR is quite narrow. Consequently, an otherwise promising approach to transnational networks has become somewhat marginalized over the years. This article revisits the concept of epistemic communities and proposes specific innovations to the framework. In an increasingly globalizing world, transnational actors are becoming progressively more numerous and influential. Epistemic communities are certainly at the forefront of these trends, and a better understanding of how they form and operate can give us a clear demonstration of how knowledge translates into power.

<p>This article explores the issue of efficacy and propriety in reconstruction programming and draws from field work in Sierra Leone — a rare example of “success” for international partners in peace-building missions. Despite the euphoria over the mission in Sierra Leone, the peace-building operations were more about the mechanics of state-building than the local politics of building peace, and there was a distinct disconnect between the policy rhetoric and the policy practice. I argue that the pressing local concern of giving citizens a stake in government was not best served in the reconstruction project because the wider and more influential objectives of the peace-building mission were about meeting international goals, not local aspirations.

<p>Since the Enlightenment, theories of justice and, in particular, theories of human rights have been based on principles which are excludable for people with disabilities. The exclusion has not been resolved by contemporary theories of justice.

The inclusion of people with disabilities is an urgent theoretical challenge which must be faced in order to perform a sound reform of rules in legal practice. [R]</p>

<p>The author distinguishes three main interpretations of cosmopolitanism: empirical, normative, and practical or interactive. In the first reading, the term coincides with “globalization” on the economic, technical, and communicative levels. A different sense is stressed by normative thinkers like Kant, Rawls, and Habermas, who concentrate on a set of moral and/or legal norms governing international politics. Noting the is/ought dilemma, the essay introduces the meaning of practical interaction stressing the need for intercultural and intersocietal practical engagement and education.

<p>The past two decades have produced a bulky literature on religion and politics, with many writers influenced by J. Habermas's notion of “post-secularity”. The article explores two main directions in which the expression has been interpreted: one where religious faith is “secularized” by being adapted to modern secular discourse; and another where faith triumphs over secularity by expunging its modern corollaries. What surfaces behind this divergence is a version of the immanence/transcendence conundrum which accentuates a presumed contrast of language games in which one linguistic idiom is said to be more readily accessible than the other. In agreement with Ch. Taylor, this article challenges the assumption of an “epistemic break” between secular reason and “non-rational” religious discourse. Once this challenge is taken seriously, a new and more radical redefinition of “post-secularity” comes into view. [R, abr.] [See <italic>Abstr</italic>. 63.1498]</p>

<p>Using research on the initiative as a point of comparison, we consider how frequently and for what ends state legislators use the referendum. Akin to initiative use, we find that legislators are constrained by procedural hurdles in their ability to place referendums on the ballot. However, in contrast to research on the initiative, which emphasizes the role of interest groups as the drivers of initiatives, our analysis suggests that referendum use is motivated by partisan legislative majorities seeking to achieve a mix of political and policy goals.

<p>Trial by jury is under threat. This is particularly true in the context of terrorism. This article explores the benefits of trial by jury to civil society.

This article argues that the state of exception arising from states' responses to terrorism in fact demands the retention of trial by jury. [R]</p>

<p>Several theorists have recently advocated a move towards a more “pluralistic” approach to global distributive justice. This paper discusses the nature and merits of such a move. I distinguish several candidate forms of pluralism and show how three widely endorsed general approaches to distributive justice support those forms. I then vindicate the claim that current philosophical writing on global distributive justice in particular, by proponents of these three approaches among others, is at most weakly pluralistic in nature. I argue that this anti-pluralistic strain is both surprising in light of the theoretical consensus highlighted earlier and counter-intuitive on its own terms. I conclude with a set of explanations for the force that anti-pluralism about global distributive justice exerts upon us, despite its apparently weak rationale. [A]</p>

<p>This article re-examines the argument that targeted programs increase pro-incumbent voting by persuading beneficiaries to cast ballots against their first partisan choice. The evidence comes from the randomized component of Progresa, the pioneering Mexican conditional cash-transfer (CCT) program. Experimental data show that early enrollment in the program led to substantive increases in voter turnout and in the incumbent's vote share in the 2000 presidential election. The experiment also reveals that opposition parties' vote shares were unaffected by the program. Thus, the electoral bonus generated by CCTs may be best explained by a mobilizing rather than persuasive mechanism. These findings are difficult to reconcile with the notion that the electoral effects of CCTs are a result of prospective concerns triggered by threats of program discontinuation or endogenous program enrollment.

<p>In a world searching for stability, federations have flourished in situations of diversity, where flexibility and adaptability are required within the confines of national unity. Federations do not have the monopoly to accommodate diversity, but the essence of the philosophy that underpins federations is supportive of the existence of multiple identities, constitutional guarantees for power-sharing and self-rule, constitutionalism and judicial oversight. These are all attractive elements to many emerging democracies. This article investigates the reasons why federation has become so popular in young, developing democracies. The article concludes that the twin-characteristics of federations — constitutionally guaranteed “shared rule” and “self-rule” — are essential ingredients and building blocks in a world where many emerging democracies are yearning for stability.

Drawing on Koopmans and Statham, the contribution stresses an empirical focus on public spheres in which claims are located. The theoretically informed and empirically viable methodological approach of representative claims analysis (RCA) is therefore proposed to facilitate future inquiry.

<p>Discussions of weapons taboos have failed to take into account the possibility that prescriptive international and national norms of behavior may come into conflict.

An analysis of General G. Marshall's proposal to use chemical weapons against the Japanese in 1945 demonstrates that normative conflict can produce a readiness to violate weapons taboos. In these situations, state decisions to violate taboos may depend on the extent to which the perception of normative conflict is shared by other decision-makers and society more generally. [R]</p>

Taber and Lodge's results have far-reaching implications for empirical scholarship and normative theory; indeed, the very citizens often seen as performing “best” on tests of political knowledge, sophistication, and ideological constraint appear to be the ones who are the most susceptible to directional reasoning. However, Taber and Lodge's study, while internally beyond reproach, may substantially overstate the presence of motivated reasoning in political settings. That said, focusing on the accuracy motivation has the potential to bring together two models of opinion-formation that many treat as competitors, and to offer a basis for assessing citizen competence.

<p>63.1440 DUNNE, Tim; McDONALD, Matt — <bold>The politics of liberal internationalism.</bold> <italic>International Politics</italic> 50(1), Jan. 2013: 1–17.</p>
<p>The article considers internationalism and its status in political theory and IR, arguing that a variety of different configurations have taken hold in different historical moments. We then consider the coexistence of internationalism and imperialism as an illustration of how the ambiguities and tensions in liberal statecraft can be manifested. We consider the international normative order-building [since] 1945 and the critical issue of the resilience of liberal internationalism given the “crisis” identified with it. For all its dangers and dilemmas, we make the case for engaging the politics of liberal internationalism as a site in which normative and practical concerns of global politics meet, and in which the calls to protect the interests of national communities are mediated by the imperative of “purposes beyond ourselves”.

<p>This research note examines the relationship between economic development and gender equality. Drawing on the concept of the Kuznets curve, we hypothesize that the relationship between economic development and gender inequality is curvilinear, with three distinct stages. (1) Economic development enables greater female labor-force participation, increasing women's intrahousehold bargaining power [and] greater political and social recognition. (2) Labor-force stratification and gender discrimination encourage divergent male/female income trajectories, which lend traction to social resistance against burgeoning gender norms. (3) Gender equality again improves, as greater educational participation and technological advancement provide new employment opportunities for women, increase the opportunity costs of staying home, and encourage the evolution of new social institutions and norms that overcome prior discriminatory practices. The effect of economic development on gender equality is contingent on the level of development. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>The tension between immigration and redistribution has attracted increased attention in recent years. Many authors argue, based on economic self-interest theory, that there is a negative relationship between support for redistribution and preferred levels of immigration. Notwithstanding the role of economic self-interest, there is in fact a multitude of motivations that moderate the relationship between preferences for redistribution and attitudes toward immigration. A model of preferences for immigration shows that self-interested and strongly reciprocal individuals experience a tension between immigration and redistribution, while egalitarians do not experience this tension. Humanitarians express a general willingness to help those who are worse off, immigrants included, but this motivation does not affect their preferences for redistribution. [R]</p>

How (critical) norm research can regain its voice).</bold> <italic>Zeitschrift für internationale Beziehungen</italic> 19(2), Dec. 2012: 101–128.</p>
<p>Social science research cannot be neutral. It always involves the (re)production of social reality and thus has to be conceived as political practice. The article looks into constructivist norm research. We first argue that constructivist norm research is political insofar as it tends to reproduce Western values that strengthen specific hegemonic discursive structures. However, this particular political position is hardly reflected in norm research. Hence, [we] outline research strategies potentially useful in a reflective and critical norm research. We propose a critical research program based upon three central methodological steps that are inspired by post-structuralism: (1) the questioning of global hegemonic values; (2) the reconstruction of marginalized knowledge; and (3) the explicit reflection of one's own research perspective.

<p>During the period 1946–2004, 47% of dictators have been jailed, killed, or had to go into exile as a consequence of losing power. The possibility that such punishment occurs can shape and condition present-time decisions rulers make. This article investigates the factors which may affect the fate of outgoing dictators. I find that regime types determine, to a high extent, the fate of rulers, as regimes shape internal dynamics and incentives and decisively affect the way rulers are replaced. Due to the lack of regularized succession procedures and to the concentration of power and patronage-based loyalty, personalist leaders are more likely to be killed and to go into exile upon their exit than other autocrats.

<p>According to Gamson's Law, the allocation of cabinet portfolios in parliamentary democracies is proportional to the legislative seat-shares of the governing parties. However, portfolio-allocation departs systematically from perfect proportionality. This paper proposes a theory of portfolio-allocation that seeks to explain the variance in proportionality across different bargaining situations. It argues that the degree to which the coalition-formation process is characterized by uncertainty and complexity influences portfolio-allocation. In uncertain and complex bargaining situations, parties that otherwise would be in an advantageous bargaining position will have a difficult time exploiting their bargaining advantage. As a result, portfolio-allocation in such circumstances will be closer to proportionality. These patterns are observed in data on coalition-formation in 14 West European parliamentary systems in the period 1945–1999. [R]</p>

<p>This article highlights the significant contribution of Latin American scholarship to the further promotion and understanding of more “global” approaches to IR. It focuses on the immediate post-independence period and explores the internationalist perspective of A. Bello. His contribution to IR cannot be neatly accommodated within either accounts of the expansion of international society or revisionist post-colonial thought. As such it is neither fully “Western” nor “non-Western”. Analyzing his contribution under three interrelated headings — international law, the problem of order and international co-operation — it argues that Bello's work needs to be examined on its own terms. Above all it provides an illustration of why we need to take more seriously Latin American thought as part of a wider movement to internationalize IR. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>Why have states stopped issuing declarations of war? Declaring war was a norm of international politics for millennia, but now appears to have exited states' behavioral repertoires. I argue that the proliferation of codified <italic>jus in bello</italic>, the law of war governing belligerent conduct, has created disincentives for states to issue formal declarations of war. The increasing number of codified international laws that govern belligerent conduct during warfare has made complying with the laws of war extremely costly. One way for states to limit these costs is to avoid admitting they are in a formal state of war by refraining from declaring war. I test this claim, as well as others, using an original data set. I also discuss several cases of 19th and 20th c. wars that illustrate the logic of this argument. [R]</p>

<p>Studies undertaken to date suggest that the arms trade contributes substantially to global incidents of corruption. This prejudices purchasing and seller countries in financial and political terms, inasmuch as corruption corrodes democratic practice. A number of factors explain this infection, ranging from the secrecy imparted from involvement with national security protocols to opaque international networks that defy localized investigation. Key transactions, such as in South Africa, illustrate these concerns. While solutions are hard to find, a multinational arms trade treaty that includes corruption and bribery clauses would constitute a major step forward. [R]</p>

<p>The aim of this paper is to address the concept of <italic>citizenship</italic>, both from a theoretical and a political perspective, and its role in the promotion of a higher-quality democracy. “Active citizenship” is a key element for defining and thinking about democracies' quality. Several democratic traditions are reviewed (libertarian, culturalist, civic). The “humanist-civic” tradition, of theoretical origin, is the best way to give a foundation for a higher-quality democracy. Within the aforementioned tradition, the classic distinction between “conventional” and “non-conventional political participation” is critically analyzed. The concept of “social capital” is also studied which takes us to a definition of “civic participation” and “civic citizenship”, ready to be used as means to articulate a higher-quality democracy, where social and civic dimensions play a significant role.

<p>The paper revisits some classical Weberian passages and arguments with a view to identify and highlight theoretical “links” able to mediate between the interpretative polarities which have been confronting in the literature. The focus is on the nexus between science and politics, i.e., a foundational theme of the Weberian doctrine regarding ontology, knowledge, power and values. Such themes cut across a theoretical agenda which currently engages virtually all the neo-institutional schools in political science, i.e., the inquiry about the relationship between knowledge and political decisions, “puzzling” and “powering”, expertise and democracy.

<p>We examine and test the logic that outbidding among insurgent groups results in more suicide terrorism specifically and more terrorism of any type, which has become a popular argument in recent years. A global analysis of terrorism from 1970–2004 provides scant support for the notion that outbidding increases suicide terrorism. An extension of the argument to all types of terrorist attacks provides even less support. The logic of outbidding has received considerable attention in academic and policy circles in recent years. Similar to the argument that democratic occupation increases suicide terror, our lack of empirical support suggests that considerable cross-national work is still needed to understand suicide terror adequately. We suggest some reasons why this may be the case, drawing particular attention to the problem of overgeneralizing from a limited set of cases. [R]</p>

<p>Critics of non-uniformed “irregular” warfare argue that it is unfair both to non-combatants and to enemy “regulars”. I dispute this view by outlining the “problem of <italic>in bello</italic> justice”, which concerns how the leaders of a people forced to fight a just war should distribute risks within their own population. Insofar as all are the victims of aggression or unjust occupation, no citizens on the just side are morally liable to attack. But to benefit from the restraining effects of discrimination, some members must be rendered legally liable. Political leaders must therefore find the most appropriate distribution of the risk of harm. I identify normative considerations that must be taken into account. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>This article addresses the issues of validity and reliability in existing additive indices measuring the strength of executives. Many data efforts propose indices of presidential power based on a simple accumulation of a set of individual constitutional prerogatives allotted to the head of state according to the design proposed by M. S. Shugart and J. M. Carey <italic>[Presidents and Assemblies: Constitutional Design and Electoral Dynamics</italic>, Cambridge, 1992]. Despite the general acceptance of such measures of presidential power and their widespread use, empirical investigations to ascertain the degree to which existing indices measure a single latent construct, and are valid and reliable, were never conducted. I refute the assumptions of unimodality and unidimensionality underlying these indices, and challenge their usefulness in allowing researchers to differentiate between presidential, semi-presidential, and parliamentary institutional arrangements.

<p>Why do some states emerging from civil war take significant strides toward democracy while others do not? The existing literature comes to contradictory and puzzling findings, many of which, we argue, are driven by methodological problems. We examine the determinants of democratization in the short, medium, and long term after civil wars ending between 1945 and 1999. Other than a short-term effect of negotiated settlements, we find little support for the prominent claim that the outcome of the war shapes the prospects for postwar democratization. Neither does peacekeeping foster democratization. Meanwhile, consistent with the more general democratization literature, we find that economic development aids democratization while oil wealth hinders it. In short, we find the determinants of democratization to be much the same for post-civil war societies as for other societies. [R]</p>
<p>63.1457 FRANCO DE SÁ, Alexandre — <bold>Liberal democracy and domination: a cryptopolitics of populations.</bold> <italic>Telos</italic> 161, Winter 2012: 16–28.</p>
<p>The author details a new perverse form of neutralization prevalent today. He highlights the dangers inherent in the obverse of the metaphysical obsession with presence, namely, in the veiling and withdrawal of power. Starting with M. Foucault's “biopolitics of populations”, where power is invisibly present, he suggests that today we witness an even more insidious “visible absence” of power, which defines what he calls “the cryptopolitics of populations”. Rather than overcome metaphysics, the absolute overturning of its ideal of pure presence repeats all the pitfalls of metaphysical politics, which must be kept at bay by exposing, or making visible, the self-encryption of political power.

<p>When considering the implications for policy outcomes of the dispersion of policy-making authority across multiple actors, recent veto-actor scholarship has emphasized its potential to privilege the status quo and thus retard policy-adjustment rates. In similar contexts, however, others have stressed collective-action and common-pool issues that arise when multiple policy-makers share authority over policies. Still others have highlighted bargaining and compromise in policy-making with multiple actors. This paper offers a synthetic discussion of these multifarious effects of the number and diversity of policy-making actors, thereby placing veto-actor considerations in broader theoretical context, and it offers an empirical approach to modeling these manifold effects of multiple policy-makers distinctly and effectively.

<p>Ch. S. Taber and M.

What may explain the coincidence of dogmatism and knowledgeability is the very process of learning about politics, which must use theories, schemas, ideologies, or Lippmannesque “stereotypes” to target certain political information as germane by putting it into an interpretive framework. This interpretive process is likely to create for each of us a growing database of information that is congruent with our extant convictions but that excludes incongruent information.

<p>Research on tabloid journalism suffers from two shortcomings: on the one hand, scholars regard tabloid journalism as an entertaining but apolitical form of journalism with little societal relevance. On the other hand, empirical research measures a variety of supposedly tabloid features but fails to ground these aspects in a theoretical concept of tabloid journalism. The paper addresses these shortcomings by theorizing tabloid media as mediated arenas for a distinct public sphere, which may very well contribute to the political functions of mass media for democracy. On this theoretical basis, the paper identifies indicators that researchers should consider when measuring the political dimension of tabloid journalism. [R]</p>

<p>What are the incentives of opposition parties to coordinate their electoral strategies to challenge authoritarian incumbents? Are these incentives the same in non-democracies as in democracies? [The] literature on party competition in established democracies [emphasizes] mostly institutional factors in determining whether parties form pre-electoral coalitions. We find, however, that many of these institutional factors have only modest effects on the formation of opposition coalitions in authoritarian elections. As a consequence, we discuss the ways in which authoritarian elections differ from democratic ones, focusing on how these differences affect the incentives of parties to form coalitions. Analyzing original data on party competition in legislative elections in all non-democracies from 1946 to 2006, we find that electoral repression and the stability of parties influence the emergence of pre-electoral coalitions among opposition parties.

<p>In international politics, “friends” co-ally. But friendship is relational and contextual. Countries are more likely to act on particular common interests if few other actors share that identity. In contrast, new cleavages are likely to emerge as an identity becomes ubiquitous. The tendency for states to form alliances based on certain affinities is thus best thought of as a variable, rather than as a constant. For example, in systems where democracies are scarce, democracies eagerly co-ally. As democracy becomes common, however, incentives binding democratic allies together weaken compared to other definitions of mutual interest. This argument, and the evidence we provide, suggest that the salience of identities as cues to affinity and difference vary with the distribution of types in the system. [R]</p>

<p>This paper examines the extent of free-riding in lobbying over tariffs in the context of G. Grossman and E. Helpman's [” Protection for sale”, <italic>American Economic Review</italic> 84 (4), 1994: 833–850] protection-for-sale model in which industry lobbies seek to bend government policy in their favor. Previous investigations have produced the puzzling result that governments are largely welfare-maximizing and care little about campaign contributions, in contrast to numerous examples of welfare-reducing policies that have in fact been bought cheaply by special interests. We think the result arises because the model assumes away freeriding by firms which hinders industry's ability to organize politically. We introduce free-riding into the Grossman-Helpman model, allowing industries to be partially organized. Using a new data-set on US trade barriers, we test the model using estimation methods new to this literature. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>Field survey experiments often measure amorphous concepts in discretely ordered categories, with post-survey analytics that fail to account for the discrete attributes of the data. This article demonstrates the use of discrete distribution tests, specifically the chi-square test and the discrete Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test, as simple devices for comparing and analyzing ordered responses typically found in surveys. In Monte Carlo simulations, we find the discrete KS test to have more power than the chi-square test when distributions are right or left skewed, regardless of the sample size or the number of alternatives. We derive rules of usage [and] implement them in two cases typical of survey analysis. Using our own data collected after Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, we employ our rules to both validate and assess treatment effects in a natural experimental setting. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>This article presents a theoretical framework that explains the longevity of autocracies by referring to three pillars of stability: legitimization, repression, and co-optation. These three causal factors are derived by distilling and synthesizing the main arguments of classic and more recent research efforts. Particular emphasis is paid to re-incorporate legitimization in the explanation of stable autocracies. The article [conceptualizes] the three pillars and discusses methods of concrete measurement. It then explains the stabilization process. I argue that reinforcement processes take place both within and between the pillars, taking the form of exogenous reinforcement, self-reinforcement, and reciprocal reinforcement. To illustrate the inner logic of these processes, I draw on empirical examples. I also state what we would need to observe empirically and how we can approach the three pillars methodically.

<p>This paper argues for a closer inspection of how tolerance and politics interact. Within geography and beyond, there is rising concern about post-political situations, whereby potential disagreements are foreclosed and situated beyond the remit of political debate. This is conceptualized as a process of de-politicization that operates “much more effectively” than alternative ways in which politics can be and has been disavowed (S. Zizek, <italic>The Ticklish Subject: The Absent Centre of Political Ontology</italic>, London, 1999]. While Zizek associates liberal tolerance with the post-political condition, however, theories of tolerance are at odds over whether it represents an everyday enactment of the political. Although some authors have indeed associated tolerance with a depoliticizing tendency, others insist that certain types of tolerance are capable of nurturing simultaneous recognition and disagreement, which directly contradicts the conditions of post-politics.

<p>Cosmopolitan political theorists model their aspirations for global democratic politics on international organizations. But how cosmopolitan are international organizations? Based on a survey of civilian staff of the UN Mission in Kosovo, the UN headquarters and other organizations working in Kosovo's post-conflict environment, the article shows that staff in international organizations are not only cosmopolitan. Their world views confirm the individualist-liberal pedigree of cosmopolitanism but also show a strong tendency towards conservative values and a continued appraisal of the state's role. Their historical narratives are, furthermore, distinctively based on the historical experience of Western Europe and North America. The article concludes that cosmopolitanism is politically firmly rooted in the historical and ideological experience of the West, and hence is not universal.

<p>Alternative dispute-resolution seeks to neutralize asymmetry of power by using an interest-based model of cross-conflict collaboration, but research has indicated that asymmetry persists nonetheless. The role of gender in negotiation has been researched, and to a far lesser degree, also with regard to alternative dispute-resolution.

Prompted by the highlighting of asymmetry in Israeli-Palestinian all-women alternative dispute-resolution (cross-conflict collaboration), this article seeks to determine the role of gender, comparing asymmetry in mixed groups with all-women's groups. A qualitative analysis, based on observations over decades of personal experience, finds only differences of degree rather than essence between predominantly-male mixed and all-women's groups regarding the effects of asymmetry.

<p>In cross-national research on party systems, the empirical units of analysis are often assumed to be self-evident, which can be conducive to misleading research results. This article proposes a set of operational criteria for identifying elements that qualify for inclusion within the universe of democratic party systems among individual election outcomes and country-specific sequences of elections. On this basis, I introduce additional criteria for distinguishing between party systems and party non-systems, and among party systems evolving within the same nation-state settings. By applying these criteria to a set of 1502 national legislative elections held in the world's democracies from 1792 to 2009, the article identifies 162 units that can be entered into a classification of the world's democratic party systems and 21 party non-systems.

<p>Several scholars have argued that decentralization benefits states and municipalities, granting them more autonomy for managing their budgets and more resources to deliver their services. Others have questioned this assertion, claiming that decentralization makes subnational units more fiscally dependent on central governments. This article argues that the fiscal impact of decentralization must be differentiated across states. It theoretically specifies and empirically demonstrates which states benefit during periods of decentralization and centralization. It argues that powerful presidents who centralize resources have imposed greater costs on more developed and fiscally independent districts, thus relying mainly on support from less developed and more fiscally dependent provinces, which prefer more redistribution. I present empirical evidence for Argentina (1983–2004), a developing federation with strong governors and high cross-regional inequality, and discuss some implications for comparative studies on the topic.

<p>Can monetary policy, and the exchange rate, affect military capability? If weapons systems are purchased on international markets, then a depreciating currency can reduce the import of arms, affecting the relative capabilities of military rivals. In this research note, we analyze the demand for arms imports using an error correction model. We show that arms are a “normal” good, with the quantity demanded directly related to price and with exchange rates serving as an instrument for price movements that are normally unobserved. Such price movements are increasingly important given currency volatility and a reliance on imported technology. [R]</p>

<p>This article summarizes the outcome of governance research in political science during the past twenty years. It shows that despite an exceeding voluminous flood of publications, governance research nevertheless still exhibits considerable empirical and theoretical deficits. This stocktaking concludes that new forms of governance have become increasingly important for the production of collective goods, their effectiveness and efficiency, however, seems to be limited. As a result, modern societies must be afraid of having been caught in a “governance trap”. [R]</p>

<p>Researchers typically assume that economic openness increases volatility. But the conventional empirical shorthand for economic openness (trade as a share of overall income) fails to account for crucial distinctions in the way that states trade. States that are deeply incorporated into the core of the international trading network have very different experiences [from those of] states at the periphery with fewer, more marginalized trading partners. This article demonstrates that a position at the core of the international trading system rather than the periphery actually diminishes volatility. Thus, a country's position in the world economy can moderate the risks of exposure to international markets. To demonstrate how this distinction might impact political outcomes and future scholarship, we show that this reduction in volatility allows governments to minimize compensation to their domestic publics.

<p>Although field experiments have long been used to study voter turnout, only recently has this research method generated widespread scholarly interest. This article reviews the substantive contributions of the field experimental literature on voter turnout. This literature may be divided into two strands, one that focuses on the question of which campaign tactics do or do not increase turnout and another that uses voter mobilization campaigns to test social psychological theories. Both strands have generated stubborn facts with which theories of cognition, persuasion and motivation must contend. [R]</p>

<p>We analyze initiatives organized by groups outside of formal politics that involve political confrontation with elected officials, and the need for recourse to the courts. We show that a civic initiative submitted by a proposer gives the voter not only the option to constrain the mayor but also the possibility of learning the mayor's type from the signals conveyed in the legal contest over the validity of the initiative. Our setup identifies limits to empirical inference based on linear models: (1) having a more adversarial mayor can lead to either the introduction or the withdrawal of an initiative; (2) although initiatives effectively constrain incumbents, they do not necessarily imply increasing distrust in incumbents. Examples from Central European countries are used to illustrate how our model corresponds to real-world conditions. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>Re-election-minded officials have motivations to represent some of their constituents more than others when casting roll-call votes. In particular, re-election-seekers have incentives to appeal to those with greater “voting power” (L. M. Bartels, “Where the ducks are: voting power in a party system”, in J. Geer, <italic>ed., Politicians and Party Politics</italic>, Baltimore, 1998: 43–79): those who are likely to vote, are not strongly predisposed to vote for one of the parties, and are members of large groups within a particular constituency. We present two novel findings stemming from these incentives: (1) we find that those with greater voting power tend to enjoy better policy representation; (2) the rewards of voting are greater for those belonging to groups with more voting power. Since voting power varies across racial/ethnic and income lines, these findings hold significant normative implications. [R]</p>

<p>This article explores the intellectual legacy of J.W. Burton, who died in June 2010. Widely lauded as a pioneer in the fields of conflict-resolution and peace studies, Burton's legacy in the broader study of IR is more ambiguous. The author argues that Burton is best remembered as a critic of IR rather than as a contributor to the discipline, particularly as it evolved from the mid 1980s to the present. Burton's most trenchant criticisms of IR in the 1960s and 1970s were really directed against a superficial version of realism. Burton's work on human needs and conflict-resolution, in contrast, has had a more enduring legacy. [R]</p>

<p>Sport and politics have long been linked, but the Olympic Games represent the most political sports event of all. The article focuses on two of the most important aspects of the Olympics (and sports “mega-events” in general) that students of politics and IR could make a major contribution towards: the use of the Olympics by states to showcase the host nation and the hoped-for “legacies” that arise from them. Both aspects are, of course, interlinked: the “legacies” are often put forward as the key rationale for the bidding for, and hosting of, the Olympics. [R]</p>

<p>Enforcement of agreements can be a major challenge in international politics. However, the interest in mechanisms of self-enforcement seems significantly lower among scholars studying international peace agreements (IPAs) than among scholars studying international environmental agreements (IEAs). Moreover, practically no exchange of ideas and findings about enforcement can be found between these two fields of research. We argue that a combination of similarities and differences between the two issue-areas provides fertile ground for mutual learning. To facilitate communication we develop a unifying but differentiated definition of self-enforcing agreements (SEAs). We then use this conceptual framework to explore lessons about IEA design that might be learned by studying IPAs and lessons about IPA design that might be learned by studying IEAs. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>M. Nussbaum's extension of capability justice to nonhuman animals has much to commend it but raises an apparently serious form of the predation problem. It apparently requires us to “police nature” to protect prey from predators. I argue that the underlying problem lies in the attitude to nature encapsulated in her proposal that we “gradually supplant the natural by the just”. Extending capability justice to animals in a spirit of unqualified humanizing “improvement” requires the elimination of wilderness defined in terms of predatory relations. This spirit is logically separable from the capabilities approach and inconsistent with its central notion of embodied animal dignity. The elimination of predatory wilderness cannot be viewed coherently as an ideal outcome from the perspective of capability justice. [A]</p>

The use of collaborative online-platforms by parties).</bold> <italic>Zeitschrift für Politikwissenschaft</italic>, 2012(1): 5–34.</p>
<p>Facing severe linkage problems, parties are experimenting with new channels for intra-party communication, such as collaborative online-platforms. Implementing internet-applications of this kind can change the intra-party processes of opinion-forming and decision-making, either by strengthening the party management or by empowering the members of the party in a bottom-up direction. A case study on the implementation of an online-platform prior to the party convention of the German Social Democrats in December, 2011, reveals that the party management controlled the online procedure as well as the processing of the results to a remarkable extent — thereby effectively constraining the participatory potential of the tool. Robust application might limit the instrumentalization of these platforms by the party elites in the long run, shifting power resources away from the party elites to the party's ground.

<p>Models designed for limited dependent variables are increasingly common in political science. Researchers estimating such models often give little attention to the coefficient estimates and instead focus on marginal effects, predicted probabilities, predicted counts, etc. The most common approach involves estimating the effect for the “average case”. But this approach creates a weaker connection between the results and the larger goals of the research enterprise and is thus less preferable than the observed-value approach. That is, rather than seeking to understand the effect for the average case, the goal is to obtain an estimate of the average effect in the population. In addition to the theoretical argument in favor of the observed-value approach, we illustrate via an empirical example and Monte Carlo simulations that the two approaches can produce substantively different results.

<p>This study examines how numbers in transnational governance constitute actors, objects, and relationships, including relationships of power. We review the existing literatures on numbers for insights relevant to their role in transnational governance, including the ontology of numbers, the history of numbers and their role in governance. We set out the main distinctive ways that numbers are implicated in transnational governance. Studies of transnational governance would benefit from paying more attention to the much-overlooked performative role of numbers in governance processes. Numbers have properties that differ from words, and shifts from one to the other in governance, for instance in the displacement of laws or norms with risk models or rankings based on numbers, have particular effects, including political effects on states, firms, individuals, and other actors and institutions.

<p>Structural theories have advanced our understanding of IR. This article contends that the two leading structural realist frameworks, however, rely too heavily on an ascribed unit motivation and core dynamic that are not derived from structure.

It sets out three challenges for a renewed agenda: a need to address the problematic relationship between universal analytical concepts and regional particularities; a need to recognize, and analyze, African agency in international politics; and a need to address inequalities in knowledge production in the field of Africa's international relations.

<p>This article discusses recent research on party politics and the welfare state that differs from traditional “partisan politics theory”. The traditional approach states that left-wing and right-wing parties hold contrasting positions on welfare issues, depending on the interests of their respective electorates. This view has recently been challenged by three strands of research, which emphasize (1) the effects of electoral change on parties' policy positions, (2) the role of context, notably electoral institutions, party competition and the configuration of party systems, and (3) the impact of different linkages between parties and electorates (particularistic versus programmatic). The implications of these arguments for the applicability of partisan theory are presented, and theoretical and empirical issues are identified for further research. [R]</p>

<p>We argue that groups organized vertically as hierarchies are likely to conduct more lethal attacks. We build our argument around three advantages inherent to centralized structures: functional differentiation, clear command and control structures, and accountability. We argue that each of these characteristics positively impacts an organization's ability to deliver an effective lethal blow. To test our argument, we use a mixed method approach, drawing on empirical evidence and support from a time-series case study. Our large-N analysis examines the trends in more than 19,000 attacks. In this test we develop a novel proxy measure for hierarchy based on a group's bases of operation and non-violent activities. To complement the empirical work, we examine the history of Euskadi Ta Askatasuna (ETA), the Basque separatist group. [R, abr.]</p>

It especially emphasizes the critical need of approaching the theoretical debates of international relations to provide a more solid base for mediation studies, and to enrich the field with studies that explore the potentials of a plurality of theoretical perspectives.

<p>Governments make extensive use of the internet and other digital technologies for administering government, delivering services and supporting political processes. All these activities are embraced by the term “e-government”. Yet many perceive digital technologies as mundane administrative tools simply deployed by government actors. In contrast, this paper argues that the field of e-government is infused by power and has power effects. Drawing on recent theoretical thinking of power, the paper articulates and examines three distinct, but inter-twined, dimensions of the power of e-government: technical; discursive; and human. These dimensions are illustrated using previously published empirical e-government research. The paper observes that digital technologies have power effects that overflow the intentions of their designers and deployers. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>A new system that would represent a break with the disappointments of the past and yet win approval would have to be effective in responding to a variety of crises and include the active participation of all the world's countries. It should be sustainable in the sense that the citizenry of individual countries would not pressure their government to dissolve the new system, nor to remove themselves from it. A participating domestic population will need to see the value in this new system for their nation and for the world as a whole. It should limit risk to vital national interests and closely held principles, and thus embody a variety of checks and balances. Still, it should be an effective mechanism for forging policy consensus. [See <italic>Abstr</italic>. 63.2309]</p>

<p>Preferential trade agreements (PTAs) limit member-states' trade policy discretion; consequently, policy uncertainty is mitigated. Reductions in policy uncertainty stemming from accession to a PTA improve the resource allocation decisions of the voters and reduce deadweight losses from the need to self-insure against policy uncertainty. The resultant increase in efficiency improves an incumbent government's — particularly a democratic government's — chance of surviving in office. We test this prediction using survival analysis, adjusting for potential selection biases using propensity score matching. We find robust support for the proposition that governments that sign PTAs survive longer in office than observationally similar governments that do not sign. In addition, we find that this effect is stronger in democracies than in autocracies. [R]</p>

<p>I present a model in which different candidates are stronger on different issues and an incumbent must decide how many resources to devote to each of two different issues. I derive conditions under which the incumbent has an incentive to devote an inefficiently high amount of resources to the issue in which the incumbent is weakest so that voters will be relatively more concerned about the issue on which the incumbent is strongest and be more inclined to vote for a candidate that is strong on that issue. I find that incumbents are especially likely to use an inefficient resource allocation if voters care a lot about the issue in which the incumbent is strongest before the election or they will care moderately about multiple issues after the election.

<p>Social scientists generally enjoy substantial latitude in selecting measures and models for hypothesis testing. This latitude raises the concern that researchers may intentionally or unintentionally select models that yield positive findings, leading to an unreliable body of published research. To combat this “fishing” problem in medical studies, leading journals now require pre-registration of designs that emphasize the prior identification of dependent and independent variables. However, we demonstrate here that the scope for “fishing” is considerable when there is latitude over selection of covariates, subgroups, and other elements of an analysis plan. These concerns could be addressed through the use of a form of comprehensive registration. We experiment with such an approach in the context of an ongoing field experiment for which we drafted a complete “mock report” of findings using fake data on treatment assignment.

<p>At the height of the influence of the secularization thesis, the notion that religion had been ignored and should be “brought back in” to IR took center-stage among many academics and practitioners. The assumption is that restoring religion in the right way will help address the problems associated with having ignored religion in IR, paving the way for the marginalization of violent religion and globalization of religious freedom. This article undertakes a critical analysis of this restorative narrative and the religious and political world it is creating. It then proposes a different approach to the intersection of religion and world politics after secularism. This approach draws attention to the authority of transnational actors such as the US, UN, and EU to shape the public administration of religious affairs globally.

<p>We argue that international law can help state leaders reach a settlement in territorial disputes by suggesting a focal point for negotiations. International law is more likely to serve as a focal point when the legal principles relevant to the dispute are clear and well established and when one of the states in the dispute has a stronger legal claim to disputed territory. When these two conditions are present, we expect the state with a legal advantage to push for and receive favorable terms of settlement. In our analysis of all negotiated settlements in territorial disputes from 1945 to 2000, we find strong support for the importance of international law in influencing the terms of settlements.

<p>It is evident that the international order changed after the terrorist attacks of September 2001. Peace is the essential end of every constitutional democracy, internally — in the relationships that its members maintain among themselves — as well as externally — those relations that a society sustains with others. The problem arises especially in the relation of constitutional democracies with other political regimes. Whereas Kant [argued] that the best means to achieve peace was the expansion of the republican regime, Rawls's defense of liberal democracy did not envisage its expansion. The relations of a constitutional democracy with other societies, whether democratic or not, necessarily require a limitation of sovereignty in their exercise abroad. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>Why do governmental institutions look as they do, and who controls them? IR scholars often point to states. However, two-thirds of today's intergovernmental organizations (IGOs) were created not by states alone, but with participation by international bureaucrats working in preexisting IGOs. International bureaucrats' design activities can be modest or proactive. Meanwhile, their interests differ from states' interests: insulating their organizational family from state intervention facilitates international bureaucrats' pursuit of material security, legitimacy, and policy advancement. The more proactive the design activities of international bureaucrats, the more insulated the resulting institution will be from mechanisms of state control (e.g., financial monopolization or veto power).

To demonstrate the usefulness of the classification, I explore the extent to which the classification and its theoretical foundation, namely the pattern of legitimization, helps to explain the durability of different political regime types. I compare the results and explanations with those of B. Geddes [“What do we know about democratization after twenty years?”, <italic>Annual Review of Political Science</italic> 2, 1999: 115–144; <italic>Abstr</italic>. 49.6650] and A. Hadenius and J.

<p>We examine the potential of highly structured intergovernmental organizations (HSIGOs) to prevent the escalation of low-level, domestic armed conflicts in member states to civil wars. A state's membership in HSIGOs alters the bargaining game between the government and rebels by increasing the costs of escalation (e.g., via sanctions) and decreasing the amount of benefits the state hoped to receive from future international cooperation. The anticipation of such consequences provides the government with an increased interest in settling the conflict before it escalates. This in turn also mitigates an important aspect of uncertainty associated with bargaining failure, including enhancing the credibility of commitments. Empirical analyses and follow-up tests of all domestic armed conflicts from 1945 to 2000 provide robust support for the hypothesized conflict-management function of HSIGO memberships. [R]</p>

<p>This article frames the highly complex national security challenges of surprise, denial and deception. These ultimate asymmetric threats exploit vulnerabilities, capitalizing on hubris, complacency and self-delusion. Such actions prevent the full and accurate assessment of opponents' capabilities and intentions, and hinder appropriate actions. The long and frequent history of surprise, denial and deception suggest that these are essentially psychological phenomena. They are effective because they challenge and exploit perceptions that fill the gap between what is known and unknown. The authors present decision superiority as the fusion of information dominance and decisive action. Technology and intelligence can enhance decision superiority by ameliorating, but not eliminating, the limits of human perception. Translating knowledge into capabilities and actions requires agile, adaptive processes and open institutional collaboration within the interagency, with global allies and the private sector. [R]</p>

<p>Do fair-trade PTAs — trade agreements that contain provisions for protection of labor rights — lead to improvements in labor protection in PTA partner states? If so, how do the PTAs bring about such improvements? I argue that trade partner states are likely to engage in <italic>ex ante</italic> due diligence and improve the protection of labor rights at home before they sign or even enter into negotiations for a PTA. Given that large developed economies have increasingly placed value on strong labor protection, trade partners of these economies act on the belief that, holding other factors constant, having stronger labor protection will increase their attractiveness as a potential or a prospective PTA partner. I test this argument in the context of the US and its trade partners between 1982 and 2005. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>“Energy security” has been an iconic word in policy discourses around the world. Yet, its meaning has remained obscure and its diverse dimensions blurred. This paper sheds new light to theoretical and political debates on energy security by (1) clarifying the meaning of energy security along the levels of analysis, in view of existing literature on security studies in general, (2) distinguishing the “derivative” and the “intrinsic” energy security issues, and (3) recasting the political dynamics over energy sources in terms of (1) power and interdependence, (2) lateral pressure, (3) changing balance of power in international energy politics. A set of policy implications are derived from the ongoing discussions, including the danger of “securitization” in energy policy, which may justify overly intrusive government policy and thereby lead to market distortion and waste of government resources.

<p>In “Psychology under fire: adversarial operational psychology and psychological ethics” <italic>[Abstr</italic>. 63.1352], J. M. Arrigo, R. J. Eidelson and R.

That argument is set forth primarily by challenging their fundamental premises as set forth in the cited cases studies and by providing alternative perspectives on those very case studies. [R]</p>

<p>This analysis identifies all of the potential arguments that can be made both for and against the hypothesis of a disarmament-nonproliferation linkage. The arguments are grouped in terms of five broader sets of explanatory factors: security, institutions, norms, domestic politics, and psychology. This approach clarifies the various causal microfoundations that could underpin different arguments in the debate as well as the types of empirical tests that would be most relevant for evaluating the “linkage hypothesis”. Comparative assessment of the arguments on both sides suggests that signs of commitment to nuclear disarmament by the nuclear weapon states will tend to enhance support for nonproliferation. Because of the multitude of other factors that affect state decision-making, however, progress on disarmament will not by itself address all of the challenges to making the nonproliferation regime effective.

<p>After a period of stagnation, research on autocracies has in recent years become revitalized. Much of this research has a comparative orientation and a range of global datasets that have become available, which enable the systematic testing of hypotheses. Yet, current research on autocracies goes beyond large-N studies. It is a pluralistic enterprise, characterized by the use of a multitude of theoretical, analytical and methodological approaches, lenses and tools. This special issue fills some gaps in the newer literature by addressing questions of legitimization and repression (as well as co-optation) in autocracies, by probing into the origins of a number of competitive authoritarian regimes and into pre-electoral dynamics in non-democracies, and by finally asking what happens to dictators once autocratic regimes fall.

<p>This essay argues that one should not overestimate the explanatory power of linking the Democratic Peace proposition to the study of security communities. Democratic values, norms, institutions, and practices may certainly facilitate the formation of a security community but it is by no means the only or even most plausible path to assure dependable expectations of peaceful change. While a number of authors have of late made similar claims, what is not settled is why non-democracies can form security communities. This essay shows that similar causal logics commonly attributed exclusively to democratic security communityformation are also present in the formation of non-democratic security communities. At the same time, however, there are differences that suggest greater instability in non-democratic security communities. The study develops a historical case study of the Sino-Soviet relationship.

<p>This article examines the intersection and interaction of religion, politics and law as a semantic field, focusing on the conceptual analysis of practices. First, the article addresses and challenges the myth of a purely secular and contractarian international order, allegedly created by the Peace of Westphalia. Second, it shows how this contractarian metaphor generated the notion of the “sacralization of the people” in modernity, and it was transfigured into the “nation” as the source of legitimacy for politics and law. Third, the article develops a critical assessment of the human rights discourse and on the potential of imperial projects — of a “rule of lawyers” instead of a rule of law. I also argue that “religions” do not have the monopoly for millennarian derailments, since even “secular” projects, such as human rights, have that crusading potential. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>Scholars have long debated whether nuclear superiority or the balance of resolve shapes the probability of victory in nuclear crises, but they have not clearly articulated a mechanism linking superiority to victory, nor have they systematically analyzed the entire universe of empirical cases. Beginning from a nuclear brinkmanship theory framework, I develop a new theory of nuclear crisis outcomes, which links nuclear superiority to victory in nuclear crises precisely through its effect on the balance of resolve. Using a new data-set on fifty-two nuclear crisis dyads, I show that states that enjoy nuclear superiority over their opponents are more likely to win nuclear crises. I also find some support for the idea that political stakes shape crisis outcomes. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>Ch. Taber and M. Lodge provide compelling evidence that people's minds may be closed to information inconsistent with their prior beliefs. However, recent research suggests that being open- or closed-minded is not an unchanging variable but depends on one's goals, which vary from person to person and situation to situation. In this vein, those who have more political information may, after having been open-minded enough to acquire the information, become closed-minded by virtue of having acquired it. At the same time, being more open-minded to inaccurate information might lead one in the wrong direction; hence, open-mindedness does not necessarily enhance the accuracy of one's judgments or the quality of one's decisions. We may need to rethink the concept of an enlightened, well-informed electorate, to the extent that it assumes the unqualified benefits of open-mindedness.

<p>The literature on power displays little interest in the subject of regional governance and the literature on governance tends to neglect issues of power. This article reintroduces power into the governance debate. To this end, we adopt M. Barnett and R. Duvall's broad power perspective [“Power in international politics”, <italic>International Organization</italic> 59(1), Winter 2005: 39–75; <italic>Abstr</italic>. 55.6761] that includes four faces of power. With this broad perspective, we analyze a regional governance case study on the implementation of nature policy in the Netherlands. Our main conclusion is that each of the four faces of power reveals different aspects of this case, and that only by taking them together can we fully explain the outcome of the case. We also suggest that such a broad analysis of power in regional governance studies would greatly contribute to understanding governance processes and their outcomes in general. [R]</p>

<p>It is often assumed that economists have little to say about democracy, a normative and contested concept. This article argues that this perception is mistaken and misleading. When several key figures in economic science are examined in detail, we can see that their economic theories are, in fact, deeply intertwined with certain normative visions of democracy, even if implicitly. Recognizing the role of hidden normative theories of democracy within economic science perspectives is important theoretically, in re-reading the nature and scope of economic science discourses. It is also, however, important in understanding some key world political trends. It is argued here that we are in a better position to understand the curious “dabbling” of global financial organizations in matters of “political nature” when we remain attuned to the role of hidden democratic assumptions.

<p>Torture is an old “legal institution”, we are told by legal historians. However, modernity in the law consists in expelling it from the precinct of what is legally conceivable and permitted. This has recently and unfortunately begun to be challenged and is now much less obvious. Law is again and openly sometimes reconnected with violence and evil. Evil, we are instructed, will be compensated and paid back with evil, illegal terror is fought back with legal terror, and torture is a lesser evil. Could it really be the case that a “state of exception” is the hard core of rule of law? [R, abr.]</p>

Third, this concept is applied in two case studies of local poor and minority youth and their participation in transnational political events, a form of participation representing concrete practices of transnational democracy.

<p>A new psychological theory — the argumentative theory of reasoning — provides theoretical support for the discursive, dialogical ideal of democratic deliberation. it converges, in particular, with deliberative democrats' predictions about the positive epistemic properties of talking things out with others. The paper further considers two influential objections to democratic deliberation: first, that “deliberation within” rather than deliberation with others carries most of the burden in terms of changing people's minds; and second, that the “law of group polarization” casts serous doubts on the value of democratic deliberation and, more generally, the ideal of deliberative democracy.

The Cold War's end saw a revival of Liberal enthusiasm for the Good State, but the translation of this into the foreign policies of key Western states generated new lines of critique focusing on the underlying universalism. Drawing upon aspects of much less-discussed Scandinavian internationalist discourse, the possibility of a more modest, open and thus sustainable understanding of the Good State is explored.

<p>We explore the sources of durability of party-based authoritarian regimes in the face of crisis. The identities, norms, and organizational structures forged during periods of sustained, violent, and ideologically-driven conflict are a critical source of cohesion — and durability — in party-based authoritarian regimes. Origins in violent conflict raise the cost of defection and provide leaders with additional (non-material) resources that can be critical to maintaining unity and discipline, even when a crisis threatens the party's hold on power. Hence, where ruling parties combine mechanisms of patronage-distribution with the strong identities, solidarity ties, and discipline generated by violent origins, regimes should be most durable. We apply this argument to four party-based competitive authoritarian regimes in post-Cold War Africa: Kenya, Mozambique, Zambia, and Zimbabwe. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>In the light of the great capitalist failures over the past two decades, it is necessary to reevaluate both the historical performance of, and historical justification for, socialism. Even if one follows the logic of mainstream economic theory, there is no clear theoretical case why socialism is necessarily inferior to capitalism. There is no clear evidence that the socialist economies performed worse than the capitalist economies in terms of economic growth. But there is evidence that the socialist economies met the population's basic needs better than the capitalist economies, especially with countries in the periphery and semi-periphery included in the comparison.

<p>[Although] “securitization” has become enormously important to capital markets, we have no agreed understanding of the term. Perhaps more surprising, the [US] Dodd-Frank financial services reform — the most aggressive attempt yet to regulate securitization — does not define it at all. This article assesses data on the performance of securitizations, as well as the transaction form's essential elements (its inputs, structure, and outputs). The definition offered here distinguishes “true” securitizations from other transactions. While the latter transactions may satisfy many current definitions of (or associated with) securitization, they in fact lack one or more essential elements of true securitizations. Not surprisingly, such transactions largely failed to advance the legitimate social and economic goals of securitization. After (re)defining securitization, this article summarizes the benefits of a better definition of securitization. [R, abr.] [See also Steven L. SCHWARCZ's comment, “What is securitization?

<p>Majority cycling and related social-choice paradoxes are often thought to threaten the meaningfulness of democracy. Deliberation can protect against majority cycles — not by inducing unanimity, which is unrealistic, but by bringing preferences closer to single-peakedness. We present the first empirical test of this hypothesis, using data from Deliberative Polls. Comparing preferences before and after deliberation, we find increases in proximity to single-peakedness. The increases are greater for lowerversus higher-salience issues and for individuals who seem to have deliberated more versus less effectively. They are not merely a byproduct of increased substantive agreement (which in fact does not generally increase). [R, abr.]</p>

<p>The fields of political science and public administration are said to be drifting apart.

This conversation should concentrate on the “administrative factor” in political life and the “political factor” in administrative life. This article develops this argument in three steps. (1) It defines the field of executive politics. (2) It considers the rationale why a focus on executive politics is pertinent at this particular time. (3) It discusses the challenges that a turn towards executive politics faces. This article considers the position of British public administration in the field of executive politics. [R]</p>

<p>This aim of a more integrated e-government, which goes beyond the establishment of “single” governmental websites, calls for both horizontal, as well as vertical integration of otherwise separate public agencies and authorities who are supposed to collaborate towards “joint” and “needs-based” electronic solutions to the benefit of citizens. Consequently, many of the current endeavors of integrating government information systems is best described in terms of “network governance” in which interdependent, yet autonomous, agents through institutionalized network arrangements, are in charge for the actual implementation of the policy. While many authors have described this implementation processes in purely technical interoperability terms, the article frames this development as a policy process of governing self-regulating networks.

<p>There is a growing consensus that parliamentary systems with recently enacted bills of rights constitute a new model of constitutionalism that serves as a middle ground between parliamentary sovereignty and judicial supremacy. A key feature in relation to this model of judicial review is the notion of an inter-branch dialogue about rights that permits legislatures to respond to court rulings about the policies at stake. This article develops a framework for empirically assessing whether and how dialogue operates in practice. A systematic examination of legislative responses to Supreme Court rulings affecting legislation in Canada finds that relatively little genuine dialogue occurs in practice because legislatures rarely respond in a manner that departs from the dictates of the Court's rulings. The article explores the implications this type of empirical assessment might have for other parliamentary systems. [R, abr.]</p>

In order to assess the relevant competences that determine presidential power, this article presents an indicator of relative turnout in 28 parliamentary democracies with a popularly elected president. The core hypothesis is that if presidents have considerable power, the turnout is higher for presidential elections than for legislative ones. The results show that presidents are deemed “strong” when they play a central role in foreign policy. This finding is compatible with different analyses of presidential regimes and provides a clear and coherent criterion for identifying semi-presidential regimes. [R]</p>

<p>Scholars of redistricting often make reference to “communities of interest”, either to describe what districts should look like, or to criticize blatant partisan gerrymanders. The term, however, suffers from a great deal of ambiguity, the lack of an objective measurement strategy, and the absence of a methodology for translating beliefs about communities of interest into districting plans. I suggest a novel approach to defining communities of interest: using the results from statewide initiative votes to allow voters to essentially define their own communities of interest at the ballot box. Such a definition would be fundamentally political — as opposed to geographic, demographic, civic, or historical — but would not be rooted solely in partisanship. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>This study examines the conditions under which states engaged in strategic rivalries choose to support non-state armed groups (NAGs) that target their rivals. NAGs include ethnic or religious insurgents, guerilla organizations, and terrorists. We develop a rational choice model of state support for NAGs. We focus on state support of NAGs as cooperation between states and NAGs emerging out of a mutual and purposive decision-making process. The model suggests that decisions of states to support NAGs targeting a rival are affected by dissatisfaction with the status quo and the expected risk of retaliation. We test the propositions of the model using an original data set that includes observations for 175 NAGs and 83 state supporters in the post-WWII period. [R, abr.]</p>

If fire has been the organizing symbol of revolutionary political theory and practice, then upon the exhaustion of the metaphysical paradigm, it is the remnants of this dangerous element that say with us: smoldering ruins, cinders, and ashes. Reconsidering the experience of victimhood community, temporality, and phenomenality in the afterglow of the great fires of metaphysics and onto-theology, the author attempts to find in the ashes a fragile figuration of contemporary politics.

The data suggest that legitimacy is a robust predictor of terrorism and merits further investigation as a causal variable. [R]</p>

<p>This paper presents an approach that engages agent impact on the institutional system, and the political or social motives for action; the two-tiered approach moves away from the categories described in “Varieties of Capitalism”. Instead of static national categories, the approach presented in this paper differentiates between defining institutions and instrumental institutions, the differences in ease and speed of change which characterize each institutional tier, and how the system's evolution is impacted by the combined effect of changes in each tier. Differentiating between institutions in this manner, the paper provides an approach that is more flexible in explaining the interactions between agents and institutions, and the changes which may result.

This ensures that these courts legitimize those decisions susceptible to generate dissent and avoid that the opposition capitalize controversial political issues that could threat the regime.

<p>This article focuses on the possibilities for internationalism to be meaningfully incorporated into state foreign policy. In international relations, constructivists have come closest to directly addressing the domestic constraints and possibilities associated with foreign policy agenda. Building on insights from the recent “practice turn” in IR, this article employs the work of P.

I suggest the utility of his conceptions of field, <italic>habitus</italic>, capital and symbolic power in coming to terms with both possibilities for and limits to internationalism as a foreign policy orientation.

<p>This article introduces a new method of evaluating the ability of individuals to vote for the political party with policy positions closest to their own — to vote “correctly” — defined as the vote-choice individuals would make under conditions of perfect information. In other words, a vote is “correct” if it is cast for the party that a voter should vote for, based upon a fully informed comparison of his or her policy positions with those of the parties contesting an election. Voters' policy preferences are estimated here using election study data, and the positions of parties are derived through data from the Comparative Manifestos Project. For illustrative purposes, this new method is applied to the 2004 Canadian federal election. Correct voting rates are calculated by comparing voter and party positions in seven dimensions of political competition. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>Government capacity on the Web is based on external-facing e-government's online presence. The external face of e-government is what citizens, clients, customers, and partners see when they visit government Web sites. Government Web sites expand the state's capacity to collect information and affect behavior, providing opportunities to influence policy outcomes. Governments seek to be the most popular Web sites online in subject areas where the state has authority, spends money, provides information, or organizes partnerships. However, competition over users' attention diminishes government capacity, as the state must compete with global actors. This study examined government nodality on the Wed to evaluate the external face of e-government in five different Canadian policy fields: agriculture, climate change, equalization, healthcare, and women.

While challenging, there is a need to build comprehensive global resource governance frameworks as a means to weaken and eventually break the links between resources and conflict. [R]</p>

<p>Correct voting in elections has been extensively analyzed, [but] correct voting in direct legislation has hardly been investigated [although] direct legislation is a more demanding form of democracy and, thus, to vote one's true preferences in direct legislation represents a greater challenge than picking the “right” party or the “right” candidate at elections. Moreover, the few researches on the correctness of individual referendum votes used a measurement method that we think has some methodological shortfalls. Instead, we propose another better-suited method of measuring correct voting in direct legislation settings. This method makes use of voters' stances on the issue at stake. We scrutinize the share of correct voting as well as its determinants on the Swiss popular vote of November 2009, which included three rather different propositions. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>This article contributes to the re-evaluation of the formative years of the emergent IR discipline. Work on this topic has overturned a number of the foundational myths of the global discipline, especially regarding the period between the two world wars. The literature on international relations in Australia, slow to reflect this re-evaluation, generally still locates the first important developments in the 1960s, and characterizes the scholarship that emerged as predominantly “realist”. This study both pushes back the boundaries and challenges the theoretical perspectives used to categorize thinking in Australia at that time. G. Modelski's early exposure to theoretical work in the US and his endeavors to give his department a strongly regional focus gave his work a richness and multifaceted character not easily captured by the “realist-rationalist” dichotomy.

<p>Much of the debate concerning political obligation deals with the question of which, if any, moral principles could make obedience to the directives of the government a matter of obligation. What makes political obligation political has not received attention in the literature on the topic. I argue that the lack of systematic reflection on what makes political obligation political is responsible for the failure of a number of influential theories of political obligation. I demonstrate this failure using the consent theory of political obligation as my major example. I conclude my analysis by formulating some positive conditions that a successful principle of political obligation should satisfy. [R]</p>

<p>We study a Condorcet jury model where voters are driven by instrumental and expressive motives. We show that arbitrarily small amounts of expressive motives significantly affect equilibrium behavior and the optimal size of voting bodies. Enlarging voting bodies always reduces accuracy over some region. Unless conflict between expressive and instrumental preferences is very low, information does not aggregate in the limit, and large voting bodies perform no better than a coin-flip in selecting the correct outcome. Thus, even when adding informed voters is costless, smaller voting bodies often produce better decisions. [R]</p>

It raises the question whether hybrid regimes can be classified either as a new third type or a sub-type of democratic or authoritarian political system. There is no doubt that the disagreement at the conceptual level has influenced the empirical analysis and determined a conceptual stretching which needs to be re-formulated in order to better understand their real identity and further institutional development.

<p>After establishing “sovereignty as responsibility” as a <italic>de jure</italic> theory of sovereignty, the article contrasts the <italic>de facto</italic> theory, based upon the sovereignty theories of Hobbes, Schmitt, and Morgenthau. I argue that the <italic>de facto</italic> theories of sovereignty, concerned as they are with unlimited power and decision as the essence of sovereign authority, can be used to highlight the lack of appreciation of power in the literature surrounding the Responsibility to Protect. This is particularly the case in relation to the just war principles of “right authority” and “reasonable prospects of success”, both of which lie at the heart of the RtoP criteria for assessing when military interventions for human protection purposes may take place. Any attempt to advance the RtoP norm must engage with the problem of unlimited power in a more sustained manner. [R, abr.]</p>

Analyzing 182 countries in the period 1979–2008, we show that democracies repress civil liberties less than autocracies do, whereas we find little evidence to the effect that different kinds of autocracies violate civil liberties to different degrees. However, we also show that the differences between democracies and autocracies have declined starkly since the Cold War. Finally, our results demonstrate that the difference in the extent to which democracies and autocracies repress civil liberties is larger for the freedom of speech and freedom of assembly/association than for the freedom of religion and freedom of movement.

<p>As the antiperfectionists might say, meaningful work is whatever individuals happen to find meaning doing. But in a more general way, meaningful work might be taken in one of two senses. In the first sense, meaningful work is bounded. In the second, more romantic sense, it is a source of personal fulfillment. At first sight, these two ideas seem contradictory: one would contain the claims of work so as to preserve human powers in other domains, while the other looks to work itself as a source of passion and devotion. But, in fact, they share a common core conviction.</p>

<p>The shadow of violence that elections cast remains poorly understood. A key obstacle impeding cross-national empirical analysis of electoral violence has been the varied nature of such violence. To address this challenge, I examine terrorist attacks as one particular form of electoral violence. By tracking the incidence of terrorist violence relative to election dates over time and across countries using an original dataset for the period from 2000–2005, I find strong support for the hypothesis that terrorist violence increases as we move closer to an election date. In fact, terrorist violence approximates a normal distribution centered on the election date.

By tracing the history of struggles, political practices and the ideas such as the God-King, problems of some contemporary IR theories become evident.

Although banning the former ruling party offers a clear-cut and normatively plausible instrument of political transition, it is beset be practical ambivalences that have contributed, especially in the most recent cases, to discrediting the practice. Banning the former ruling party has in recent decades undergone a functional transformation, from an exceptional measure of symbolic transitional justice to a soberly calculating instrument of normal politics.

Have the intervening dozen years, with their recurrent crises in markets and corporate governance, demonstrated the need for a return of the state? This analysis of the G20 London communiqué, using criteria that Strange advanced, suggests that far from asserting a return of the state, the G20 signifies its persistent weakness and concludes that the G20 leaders, at least, sense a more complex network of power relationships, and that structural power rests in the network.

I examine the contributions of key structural variables, including the mission type, weapon type, rules of engagement, mission strength, and major power participation controlling for other intervening variables using negative binomial and logit regression models. The empirical results indicated that the core variable — robust peacekeeping — has impact on civilian killings, namely that it lowers civilian killings. The key factor seems to be strength of mission size associated with lower numbers of civilian killings. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>Though instances of party-switching have been widely documented, there is little cross-national research on this phenomenon. The prevalence of switching is therefore unknown, and the factors influencing this behavior remain unclear. Using the most comprehensive dataset on party-switching ever constructed, we illustrate both that interparty movement is more common than previously assumed and that there are substantial differences in its prevalence across parties. To explain this variation, we examine the relationship between legislators' motivations, institutional arrangements, and switching. We find that motivational explanations are correlated with interparty movement and that institutional arrangements exhibit only limited direct influence on switching. [R]</p>

<p>Indigenous peoples have recently achieved increased recognition of Indigenous rights in international declarations and conventions, and national legislation. This increased recognition does not itself allow Indigenous peoples to achieve one of their central objectives, control over development which affects them or their ancestral lands. State authorities often ignore international legal instruments and domestic legislation in dealing with major resource projects on Indigenous land, and international recognition of Indigenous rights has no binding effect on the private resource corporations that increasingly dominate resource exploitation. Given this situation, Indigenous control of development can only be achieved by Indigenous mobilization in the domestic political sphere, targeting both the state and resource corporations. [R]</p>

<p>Debates about liberal internationalism and “purposes beyond ourselves” have focused on the role of states. Such a focus risks limiting our potential to achieve solidarist goals by tying us to the ontological and ethical concerns of the state. This article argues that a more expansive conception of agency, including non-state actors (NSAs), reflects more accurately the complexity of agency and interests within liberal internationalism. Using the example of humanitarianism, it argues that humanitarian NSAs demonstrate that important additional avenues exist for the pursuit of solidarism within the liberal international order. Humanitarian NSAs are embedded in complex relationships with states and are implicated in structures of power and interest within the liberal international order. These present them with their own dilemmas of solidarism and can compromise their pursuit of “purposes beyond ourselves”. [R, abr.] [See <italic>Abstr</italic>. 63.1440]</p>

<p>The author highlights the positive role of paradox in contemporary politics. He shows how the modern politics of dualism (“Left” versus “Right”) and the post-modern politics of difference can be supplanted with a new politics of paradox. Arguing that instead of providing an alternative, the politics of difference is an aporetic extension of the insistence on dualism, the author wishes to revive the paradox, which harks back to Plato's Idea of the Good. Beyond being and knowledge, the Good still motivates the actions of all and can become the “radical center” for contemporary political practices. [R] [See <italic>Abstr</italic>. 63.1648]</p>

<p>This article argues that the post-secular remains trapped in the logic of secularism. First, a new account is provided of the “secularist bias” that characterizes mainstream IR theory: (1) defining religion in either essentialist or epiphenomenal terms; (2) positing a series of “antagonistic binary opposites” such as the secular versus the religious; and (3) desacralizing and re-sacralizing the public square. The article then shows that post-secularity subordinates faith under secular reason and sacralizes the “other” by elevating difference into the sole transcendental term. Theorists of the post-secular such as J. Habermas or W. Connolly also equate secular modernity with metaphysical universalism, which they seek to replace with post-metaphysical pluralism. In contrast, this article outlines is an international theory that develops the Christian realism of the English School in the direction of a metaphysical-political realism.

<p>I claim that film matters to political theory not because of the stories films recount, but because the medium of film offers political theorists an image of political thinking that emphasizes the stochastic serialization of actions. I thus argue that the stochastic serialization of moving images that films project makes available for democratic theory an experience of resistance and change as a felt discontinuity of succession, rather than as an inversion of hierarchical power. In my treatment of these issues, I rely on Hume's ontology of “broken appearances” and “interrupted perceptions”, as well as S. Cavell's ontology of film as treated in <italic>The World Viewed</italic>. The manner in which I proceed is to show the aspectual overlay between film and political thinking. [R, abr.]</p>

Trends in the development of the world system include interaction of the progressive and of the cyclic dynamics, which must be taken into consideration when forecasting global, regional and national transformations.

<p>The study examines charisma as a pure power term by focusing on what makes it appear in ordinary democratic politics as an extraordinary phenomenon, namely, its personal (as opposed to impersonal) character of leadership and the pursuit of a politically radical (as opposed to moderate) program. Accordingly, political charisma is defined as a distinct type of legitimate leadership that is personal and aims at the radical transformation of an established institutional order. Such an understanding of political charisma enables us to further analyze the core features of charismatic leadership and construct an “index of charismaticness” ready to be put under comparative empirical investigation.

<p>We argue that the continued persistence of borders is an effect of their constitutive role for the many dimensions of a social particular. States cannot choose to have a border; but they can and do make choices among the materials available on the various planes of inscription for bordering. For contemporary states, the planes have become increasingly disaggregated, in the sense that they do not fall into place at one and the same border. Thus, states have to pick and choose different articulations (often inconsistently) on different planes. We illustrate these ideas with instances, present-day and historical, of bordering. A corollary of there being more need to pick and choose is that articulations of sovereignty change. So, sovereignty is increasingly the material of “sovereignty games”, where sovereignty is used as a political instrument. [R, abr.] [See <italic>Abstr</italic>. 63.1711]</p>

<p>The term Islamic Cultural Zones (ICZs) refers to Muslim majority areas informed by transnational subjectivities loosely connecting varied Islamic societies around symbolic commonality, memory, and historical experience. The term stresses the plurality of Islamic cultural experience, albeit distinguished by recognizable semiotic markers, without essentializing Islamic identity. This article questions the hegemonic view pervasive in both secular and post-secular theorizing of the fiction of immutability of faith in the ICZs and recognizes its rupture and displacement under conditions of late modernity. The ontological dislocation in the character of religion itself under conditions of late modernity opens up the possibility to account for the assumed resistance of Islam to secular modernity, but also to explain Islam's imbrications in politics read under the sign of Political Islam.

<p>This paper identifies the different components of democratic deficit. It distinguishes between a structural deficit, found in the institutions of a democratic political system, and a behavioral deficit, attributed to the actions and omissions of the authorities. Providing non-systematic examples and selectively probing into some political systems, the paper concludes that there are different types of democratic deficit. Most of those deficits by no means indicate the crisis of democracy, either as an ideal or as a practice. Plenty of remedies can be found and applied to solve, though never once and for all, a variety of deficits. Probably, the concept is not especially useful.

<p>I advance that government alternation, contrary to the common wisdom, has a positive impact on the control of corruption only in those political systems that A. Lijphart calls consensual democracies. In this kind of political system, high levels of alternation provide incentives to oppositions to expose corrupt practices of government parties. This is because alternation strongly reduces the probability of future alliances between the opposition and the incumbent. I test the research hypothesis with a cross-sectional comparison of thirty-two democracies in a period that goes from the first democratic election from 1945 until 2004. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>Among new approaches to rethinking the nature of relations between society and state institutions, the concept of monitoring democracy is of prior importance: it does not limit itself to political space, but penetrates into the spheres of social life.

An important part of the article is dedicated to the analysis of contradictory, but mostly positive trends that permit to assert the implementation of some traits of monitoring democracy in contemporary social and political life in Russia. A full-fledged implementation of this model could lead to qualitative changes in the overall relations between state and society. [R] [See <italic>Abstr</italic>. 63.1613]</p>

Further, the assumption that interpersonal trust diminishes in response to high diversity is not supported by the German data. While migration-related diversity and trust seem largely unrelated, contact between residents without and with migration backgrounds is more frequent in more diverse areas. [R]</p>

<p>This article contrasts the parallel “wars on terror” that liberal and authoritarian states have prosecuted since 9/11 [2001] to determine their broader significance for the pursuit of “purposes beyond ourselves” in an increasingly multi-polar world. I maintain that the ensuing “wars on terror” have simultaneously exacerbated longstanding disagreements between liberal and authoritarian states over the fundamental principles of international society. Under American leadership, liberal states have sought to eradicate jihadism through the transplantation of liberal values and institutions to Muslim-majority societies, countenancing sweeping qualifications of weak states' sovereignty to advance this goal. Conversely, authoritarian states led by Russia and China have mounted a vigorous counter-offensive against both jihadism and liberal internationalist revisionism, harnessing counter-terrorism concerns to reassert illiberal internationalist conceptions of state sovereignty in response.

<p>In dealing with safety and security issues, social science research has a focus on symbolic policy. The case of road safety offers telling examples.

<p>Public value theory has had its supporters and critics, with debate about the use of strategic management by public managers and confusion about the meaning of public value. This paper formalizes Mark H. Moore's <italic>[Creating Public Value: Strategic Management in Government</italic>, Cambridge, 1995] into a simple theory. That theory introduces the concept of an “ideal state” — a simple means of describing and analyzing public value, using a graphical presentation. Insights from that ideal state are then applied to a more real world to clarify the nature of public value and to consider the appropriate use of strategic management by public servants. Public value theory provides some justification for strategic management, but the paper also demonstrates the limits to strategic management by officials. [R, abr.]</p>

I propose a complex, multidimensional index combining the most important sources of governments' decision-making potential: the ideological cohesion of the executive (the most important feature); the “color” of the government compared with the previous one; the number of partisan veto-players; the institutional context — i.e., the relationship between government and parliament; the size of parliamentary majority (the least important feature). This index fits quite well with qualitative literature on comparative governmental systems. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>This article concerns itself with the agenda, the instruments, and the goals of public diplomacy (PD). Taking into account the current state of PD that concentrates predominantly on forging cultural and educational links and promoting values, but not policies, it refocuses PD in two substantial ways: driving it, first, to focus on the most significant global issues and, second, to employ profound discursive processes. The emphasis then shifts to how PD can strengthen the global public sphere with regard to the profoundly political and critical issues of the present era. It argues in favor of strategic discursive PD and suggests ways to enhance both the legitimacy and efficiency of states' foreign policies on the handling of the Greek economic crisis and the issue of economic governance.

<p>Three studies showed that focus on the shared human threat of global climate change can encourage peaceful coexistence and discourage support for war in the face of existential threat.

Conversely, in Study 2, MS increased Americans' support for war against Iran after imagining a localized catastrophe, but imagining global climate change completely eliminated this effect. Study 3 was conducted among Arab citizens of Israel during the January 2009 Israeli invasion of Gaza. For those high in perceptions of shared humanity, MS increased support for peaceful coexistence with Israeli Jews after imagining global climate change but not a localized catastrophe that would affect both Muslims and Jews.

<p>Science has been institutionalized as a legitimate basis for decision-making at the WTO. This raises a critical question: how does the scientization of decision-making shape the construction of new governance arrangements? Using the case of negotiations between the Chinese state and the US state over the harmonization of cotton quality classification, I consider three approaches to scientization in world politics: the world polity approach, the world-systems approach and the political sociology of science. Evidence from the case demonstrates the need to largely reject the world polity approach while integrating the world-systems approach with the finer-grained analyses of the political sociology of science.

<p>Recent research suggesting that leader transitions increase the probability of war termination is based on the assumption that leader change is exogenous. However, the exogeneity of leader change needs to be tested, not assumed. This paper uses a bivariate discrete survival model to test the exogeneity of leader change and correctly estimate its partial effect on war termination. The paper extends the analysis by estimating a competing risks model of types of leader transitions. The evidence shows that leader-change in large coalition systems never increases the probability of war termination, while leader change in small coalition systems never reduces the probability of war termination. In short, leader transitions in autocratic systems are more likely to bring interstate war to an end than leader transitions in democratic ones. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>This article differentiates political cultures in two dimensions. (1) Inspired by J.

(2) Inspired by Kohlberg's stage models for the development of the individual moral consciousness and for moral culture, a distinction is similarly suggested between two pre-conventional, two conventional and two post-conventional collective stages of political culture. It can be shown that from a normative point of view, only deliberations made in a post-conventional political culture can produce reasonable or at least fair results. Conceptual considerations indicate processes of direct democracy as the method for promoting post-conventional political cultures. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>Mutual autonomy between religious and state institutions is often seen as a key ingredient for democratization. Yet, there are a large number of democracies with an established religion. If a separation of church and state is desirable for the maintenance of a stable democracy, then why do so many democracies continue to support religious institutions and practices? As the evidence from this study reveals, the difference between democracies and non-democracies does not depend on a wall of separation between church and state, but instead, on the protection of religious freedom for minority groups and the promotion of secular legislation.

<p>While leadership has always been at the center of politics, the concept of “leadership” did not find a shared definition in the political science literature. Between the two families of definitions, the “relational” and the “positional”, I embrace the former, stressing the relationship between leaders and followers and excluding the “positional” definition, since being a leader means more than having a position of power. The article puts forward a less connotative definition of leadership, to be able to encompass a larger number of empirical referents. Therefore, leaders' characteristics are not included in the definition, while the importance of contextual factors is strongly underlined. [R, abr.] [See <italic>Abstr</italic>. 63.1605]</p>

<p>Realists propose that elected leaders that seek war but face a hesitant public may use deception to build public support for war. Leaders may secretly make provocative diplomatic or military moves to push the adversary to attack first, rallying the public behind a war effort seen as defensive, or publicly exaggerate the threat posed by the adversary. This paper develops a liberal institutionalist critique of this theory, positing that elected leaders are deterred from engaging in such deception because democratic political institutions such as political competition, a professionalized military, and the marketplace of ideas increase the likelihood that such moves will be exposed, and once exposed, deceptive politicians will suffer domestic political punishment. The paper examines the thesis that F.D. Roosevelt sought to provoke Germany and Japan to war in 1941, finding little support. [R, abr.]</p>

This article calls attention to how polarity structures the perceptions and calculations of states. Ultimately, this impacts a sender's ability to project a clear, consistent demand and potent ultimatum as well as the target's calculations for compliance. Thus, if the literature wants to understand fully great power coercion, it is necessary to infuse the systemic context into the discussion. [R]</p>

<p>Governments elected by majoritarian rules are, according to conventional wisdom, more protectionist than governments elected by proportional rules. However, existing tests of this claim examine only one possible form of trade protection: tariffs. This leaves open the possibility that governments in majoritarian systems provide no more protection than governments in proportional systems but simply use tariffs more often than other forms of trade protection. Does the protectionist bias in majoritarian politics extend beyond tariffs? This study examines an increasingly important form of trade protection: subsidies. In a sample of 68 countries from 1990 to 2006, spending on subsidies is found to be higher in majoritarian systems than in proportional systems, holding all else equal. The implication is that the protectionist bias in majoritarian systems does in fact extend beyond tariffs. [R]</p>

<p>Armed interventions of the past decades demonstrate that strategic leadership can give way to lofty campaign plans, conflicting strategic narratives and concern with tactical, as opposed to strategic, issues. This article argues that strategic leadership grows out of the effort to connect the three distinct political arenas that dominate armed interventions: coalitions, institutions and big tent diplomacy. Strategic leadership is not about choosing between coalitions or institutions; it is about building bridges among these political arenas. The article embeds this argument within the strategic literature and demonstrates how it emerges from an engagement with modern armed interventions. It engages in two in-depth assessments of NATO's experiences in Afghanistan and Libya and then undertakes a more general discussion of the steps that can be taken to encourage strategic leadership.

<p>The past three decades have witnessed the spread of automobile emission standards throughout the world. There appears to be a race to the top, not only among rich countries but also among poor ones. Using econometric analysis of the adoption of automobile emission standards over the past twenty years for 129 countries, the author argues that this global diffusion results from countries' efforts to stay competitive in the international market. Due to the pressure from importing countries that have adopted stringent emission standards, even developing countries have rapidly moved to adopt rich-country standards. Adoption of automobile emission standards correlates with an increase in the total value of automobile exports. Under some conditions, economic incentives in a global market can be a complement to environmental protection. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>How does militant democracy regard — and respond to — political emotionalism? In this regard, fascism is only one extreme form of emotional politics that relies on and abuses constitutional rights and democratic processes. Militant democracy as understood by K. Loewenstein raises important issues related to emotionalism in politics beyond the context of fascism, and as such it is of particular relevance for extreme political emotionalism. Militant democracy as it stands is not a general theory and practice of the protection of the constitution, but it can be perceived as a set of measures directed against radical emotionalism, a technique that may be relevant in all situations where emotionalism takes over the political process.

<p>No science can be made out of fuzzy and confused concepts. At the same time, concepts shape the theories and are shaped by them. Any good conceptual analysis will go through three different stages: (1) anatomy; (2) reconstruction; (3) formation of the concept. Clear and precise definitions are essential. When the concepts are precisely defined it will become possible also to proceed to useful classifications. The distinction to be kept in mind runs between conceptual analysis and simple terminological rationalization. Only after an appropriate classification will it be fruitful to launch measurement efforts. In the end, the scholar may find that some concepts contain facts and some concepts are capable of finding facts. And the scientific endeavor will be considerably enriched.

<p>We argue that extremist factions within minority groups make use of divergence in religion to mobilize support for violent action when the group is excluded from government. Thus, we posit that while religion <italic>per se</italic> is not a source of violence, extremist elements of ethnic minorities, whose religion differs from the majority, may use religious divergence to mobilize group members to perpetrate terrorism. We test the hypothesis that extremist factions of an excluded group will be more likely to carry out terrorist attacks when the group's members belong to a different religion as well as when they belong to a different denomination or sect of a religion than the majority.

<p>Liberal nationalism and the theory of national responsibility present a cosmopolitan argument maintaining that political institutional bodies should be held responsible for catering to their people. So conceived, liberal nationalism provides a significant contribution to contemporary cosmopolitan theory. Three arguments are provided. (1) Liberal nationalists shares fundamental values with institutional cosmopolitans, and they agree on the relevance of shared responsibility supplementing individual responsibility. (2) National responsibility is endorsed as a productive way of determining responsibility for the political distribution of goods and benefits for a group of people that supplements responsibilities at the global level. (3) By disentangling the cultural assumptions from the concept of national responsibility, the article suggests a concept of national responsibility based on political institutional capacity rather than culture.

<p>The concept of “nationalization” is vigorously discussed in the literature and three dimensions have been proposed. A first dimension considers the extent to which a party's vote in territorial units varies across time and this is labeled “dynamic nationalization”. “Distributional nationalization” focuses on the degree to which there is an equal distribution of party votes across territorial units. Finally, “party-linkage nationalization” concerns the extent to which candidates link together under common party labels. In addition to a conceptual debate there has been a simultaneous debate on the measurement of the various forms of nationalization. This article contributes to both debates and argues that most of the literature on nationalization suffers from a methodological nationalism bias: the tendency of many scholars to choose the statewide level and national election as the natural unit of analysis.

<p>Our article analyzes the determinants of local growth-control decisions, which are modeled as the result of a political struggle between different groups of voters and organized lobbies. We show that under specific hypotheses, a higher homeownership rate can induce lower levels of controls. Considering residential choices as endogenous to growth control policies, the local decisions to control growth become strategically interdependent. Assuming imperfect mobility, we show that a spatial econometric specification can be directly derived from our theoretical model. Our empirical analysis concerning the determinants of the <italic>taxe locale d'équipement</italic>, a French local development tax, is thus naturally based on spatial econometrics. Its results confirm the major predictions of our model. [R]</p>

<p>The isolated introduction of stricter international treaty law increases the risk of weaker countries becoming victims of predatory violence while at the same time reducing such risk for middle-weight countries. The distribution of the benefits and burdens resulting from restrictions in access to coerced treaties would not be agreed to by countries deciding as free and equals on the terms of their cooperation. Therefore it is unfair. Recent developments in relevant scholarly fields and precedents of extorted treaties show that it is possible to extricate a principle that explains the non-conferral of validity to such treaties. This is turn allows to consider the costs potentially paid by countries which have been denied access to extorted treaties and explains how treaty validation controls access to treaties.</p>

<p>While scholars have devoted significant attention to questions about nuclear deterrence, we know comparatively little about whether nuclear weapons can help compel states to change their behavior. This study argues that, despite their extraordinary power, nuclear weapons are uniquely poor instruments of compellence. Compellent threats are more likely to be effective under two conditions: (1) if a challenger can credibly threaten to seize the item in dispute; and (2) if enacting the threat would entail few costs to the challenger. Nuclear weapons, however, meet neither of these conditions. They are neither useful tools of conquest nor low-cost tools of punishment. Using a new dataset of more than 200 militarized compellent threats from 1918 to 2001, we find strong support for our theory. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>What can geography as a discipline contribute towards a better understanding of human rights issues?

<p>While advocates of liberal internationalism have traditionally identified the state as an agent of progressive transformation of the international realm, they have had less to say about the specific domestic mechanisms that might govern the foreign policies of “good” states. This article argues that domestic constitutions provide both a legal limit on the actions of governments and other actors, and also the means whereby citizens can pursue legal redress against the state. They therefore play a potentially constraining role that is different from that provided by the embedding of cosmopolitan law in transnational and international legal codes and norms. Transformed in this way, states become powerful agents for achieving cosmopolitan purposes and ultimately transforming world order. [R] [See <italic>Abstr</italic>. 63.1440]</p>

<p>In what ways does religion matter as justification for violence? Based on a larger study of the Pakistani Taliban and their communication and recruitment materials, this article presents some of its main findings. It summarizes the lessons learned about the various roles religion plays in providing justification for taking up arms, namely: as an object to be defended; as a threat; as the purpose of armed struggle; as a (blurred) limit on war; and, finally, as imagery and myth. Although this article specifically looks at the case of the Pakistani Taliban and their religious justifications of violence, the findings might also find resonance in other cases of violent religious movements.

<p>In districts where only one seat is contested, the electoral formula (plurality or majority) should be a major determinant of the number of parties that receive votes. Specifically, plurality rule should generate two-party competition while other institutional arrangements should generate electoral fragmentation. Yet tests of these propositions using district-level data have focused on a limited number of cases; they rarely contrast different electoral systems and have reached mixed conclusions. This study analyzes district-level data from 6,745 single-member district election contests from 53 democratic countries to test the evidence for Duverger's Law and Hypothesis. Double-ballot majoritarian systems have large numbers of candidates, as predicted, but while the average outcome under plurality rule is generally consistent with two-party competition, it is not perfectly so.

<p>Compulsory rules are known to have far-reaching effects beyond boosting electoral participation rates. This article examines the relationship between compulsory voting and partisan attachments. A theory of attachment formation and strength is engaged that argues that compulsory voting boosts the likelihood that one will identify with a party and, in turn, the strength of party attachments among identifiers. The statistical model accounts for both the hierarchical structure of the data (individuals in elections) and the dual nature of the dependent variable (individuals report a strength of attachment only for the party with which they identify). Using data from the Comparative Study of Electoral Systems, it is demonstrated that compulsory voting does indeed increase both the incidence and the strength of partisanship. [R]</p>

<p>The number of veto-players is consistently linked to the fluidity of the policy-making process across countries. Building upon previous work on authoritarianism, we theorize that the nature of the policy-making process, as influenced by the number of veto-players, serves to shape attitudes among the public. Specifically, we argue that fractionalization of powerful political actors leads to a conflictual policy-making process, which in turn exacerbates the expression of authoritarian attitudes among those predisposed to such by portraying an image of a heterogeneous and divided society. To test this, we gather data on thousands of individuals and several countries from the World Values Survey and other sources. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>In this polemical analysis of the rise of neoliberalism in the UK and the political culture it threw up, the author argues that the market state no longer serves the nation, but transnational capital. Consequently, inequality and poverty have been structured into society. Government rhetoric about the small state, “big society” and localism are cons that smooth the way to privatization, the undermining of democracy, and the imposition of market morality. It is by resisting the market state and its political culture that new social movements can “socialize” global capital-in-crisis as the labor movement once socialized industrial capital. [R]</p>

<p>This article engages with trans-theorizing to show how IR is currently blind to gender diversity, and the conceptual contributions trans-theorizing could make. It asks what insights trans-theorizing might provide for the study of global politics generally, and for feminist theorizing about gender in global politics specifically. After briefly introducing the terminology of trans-theorizing, the article addresses the potential for (and potential hazards of) an alliance between trans-theorizing and feminist theorizing in IR. The article then discusses several potential contributions of trans-theorizing — including hyper- and in-visibility, liminality, crossing, and disidentification — which provide explanatory leverage for IR. The article concludes with some suggestions for further collaboration between trans-theorizing and (feminist) IR to deepen and widen IR's work on gender specifically, and global politics generally.

<p>This paper examines some of the main geo-economic and geo-political inter-dependencies which are structuring Europe's relations with the wider world and how various European and EU policy frameworks work to create relations of increasing yet uneven inter-dependency between Europe and that wider world.

It discusses the entanglement of Europe with the forces which gave rise to the “Arab Spring” in North Africa and the Middle East.

Four pathways for how political efficacy develops, building on the merged perspective, are then tested in a single two-step hierarchical OLS regression. The results show that mastery experiences, role models, encouragement, and empowering outlooks in a political setting are predictors of youths' political efficacy, over and above the effects of political interest and perceived political knowledge.

The political responses to the financial and economic crisis only exaggerates these troubles. Fierce austerity policies are imposed and justified on the basis of a false claim that government budget deficits are caused by excessive welfare spending. Center-left political powers in several European states increasingly defend the needs of their populations [and] realize that the frenzy financial sector has been left unregulated for too long and that things must change. But their power is constrained decisively by both powerful international institutions guided by neoliberal economic theory and the profit-demands of global market investors. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>This article [examines] the pro-autonomy argument in discussions on state-social movement relations in the new social movement (NSM) literature. The argument is framed by a dichotomy between autonomy and power that portrays the NSMs as “anti-state” or “non-statist” movements. The generalized assumption implicit in the NSM literature is that the new movements operate at a distance from the state, as state politics is inherently undemocratic and despotic, and, in addition, that their collectivities prefer independent political activism to state politics. This article advances two arguments in order to offer a more complex picture of the autonomy question: (1) the infatuation with autonomy in NSM scholarship could unwittingly legitimate the depredations of neoliberal capitalism; (2) the relationship between state practices and the praxis of the NSMs is dialectical and fluid.

This article addresses these oversights by explicating pipeline politics as an international “credible commitment” problem. It focuses specifically on the different incentives among producer, consumer and transit states and on how insights into the economic and institutional dimensions of bargaining shape the value, risks and capacity of the parties to forge and uphold pipeline agreements.

<p>Writing about contemporary history or international relations presupposes relevant empirical knowledge.

(2) During the Cold War, European terrorism was described as an anarchist/leftwing threat, but we now know that eastern and Western state agencies were deeply involved in these operations. In these examples, contemporary history appears as a parallel “simulacrum” bearing no similarity to the authentic events. A combination of oral and written sources is often necessary. [R, abr.]</p>

A reply to Stephan Engelkamp, Katharina Glaab and Judith Renner).</bold> <italic>Zeitschrift für internationale Beziehungen</italic> 19(2), Dec. 2012: 129–140.</p>
<p>Calling for a research program of critical norm research, S. Engelkamp, K. Glaab and J. Renner <italic>[Abstr</italic>. 63.1444] identify weaknesses of constructivist norm research in IR. To remedy these weaknesses they suggest questioning global hegemonic values, reconstructing marginalized knowledge and explicitly reflecting one's own research perspective. Entering into a conversation with the authors, I look into their arguments and recommendations from an ontological, epistemological and methodological perspective. Constructivist norm research is based on a concept of norms and focuses on research questions, which are not consistent with the kind of critical perspective the authors favor. The biggest challenge of pursuing the research strategies the authors suggest is that knowledge production takes place within a knowledge community, whose boundaries can be shifted; but still you have to respect some fundamental conventions to be heard.

<p>Audience costs are a central feature of many prominent theories of international conflict. We advance the understanding of audience costs by specifying the domestic institutions necessary to generate them. In our conceptualization, audience cost capacity (ACC) is a function of the availability of alternative rulers and the cost of mobilizing against the incumbent. This conceptualization leads to the first measure of ACC that has variation between more and less democratic political systems and variation within autocracies. We subject our measure to a rigorous set of tests that includes addressing selection effects and temporal treatment effects, neither of which have been fully examined in this research area. The empirical analysis offers strong support for the validity of our measure. [R]</p>

<p>“Throwing the rascals out” (without bloodshed) is considered by many scholars as a fundamental component of representative democracies and, precisely for this reason, this is a topic that political scientists should start to consider more frequently and carefully. Alternation, rotation in office, turnover are concepts too often (mis)used and confused, though not properly analyzed. This is a particularly striking situation if we consider that government alternation has become, in the last twenty years or so, the most frequent method of government change across West European party systems. Following the established tradition of G. Sartori, this article carries out the analysis of the concept of “alternation” in three distinct steps: anatomy, reconstruction and definition.

<p>63.1645 VALENTINI, Laura — <bold>Justice, disagreement and democracy.</bold> <italic>British Journal of Political Science</italic> 43(1), Jan. 2013: 177–199.</p>
<p>Is democracy a requirement of justice or an instrument for realizing it? This article argues that the correct answer to this question depends on the background circumstances against which democracy is defended. In the presence of thin reasonable disagreement about justice, we should value democracy only instrumentally (if at all); in the presence of thick reasonable disagreement about justice, we should value it also intrinsically, as a necessary demand of justice. Since the latter type of disagreement is pervasive in real-world politics, the conclusion is that theories of justice designed for our world should be centrally concerned with democracy. [R]</p>

<p>Theories of institutional change help us to understand policy transformation, and provide us with a framework for presenting transformation narratives retrospectively. By telling the transformation narrative of a single case through the lenses of three different institutional change theories, this article highlights the potential shortcomings of a single lens, and the value of using complementary lenses. It argues for a pluralist approach to provide a richer understanding of policy transformation. [R]</p>

<p>Deliberative democrats responding to the challenge of fostering reciprocity and civic friendship discourage in-group deliberations, taking them to stoke hostilities and preclude the possibility of sociability between groups. In opposition to these views, I argue that in-group deliberation presents itself as a promising, yet underappreciated, normative category for conflict transformation. I support this claim with reference to the observation that deliberative exchanges among like members are just as, if not more, consequential in the facilitation of positive actor transformations than deliberations among unlike members, especially when antipathy defines group relations.

<p>63.1648 VATTIMO, Gianni — <bold>Democracy and hermeneutics.</bold> <italic>Telos</italic> 161, Winter 2012: 9–15.</p>
<p>The author diagnoses the current inefficacy of democracy and hermeneutics as practiced in the 21st c. Their shared crisis has to do with their neutralization and, therefore, de-politicization, ultimately linked to the search for an objective truth. In opposition to this metaphysical appropriation of potentially destabilizing forces dormant in democracy and hermeneutics, he avows a non-neutral interpretative and political stance that takes sides with those most disadvantaged by the current status quo. As a result, hermeneutics will become “the ontology of revolution”, as he provocatively suggests in the conclusion.

<p>This article provides a roadmap for what gender scholarship offers scholars of federalism. It argues that applying a gender perspective can enrich the field by introducing new concepts, questions, hypotheses, and debates. Gender scholarship's focus on power and change will also make theorizing about federalism more dynamic. The article shows how the “gendering democracy” project's indices will help scholars measure federalism's role in women's continuing political marginalization and incorporation. It also highlights the importance a gender perspective confers on social movements, social policies, and normative issues. Finally, the article speculates that gender analysis could promote a new research theme exploring how different state architectures affect and are affected by interactions between territorial and nonterritorial interests and identities.

<p>Comparisons of individuals based on their selections from an ordinal scale traditionally assume that all respondents interpret subjective scale categories in exactly the same way. However, improving interpersonal comparisons with anchoring vignettes also requires a new set of assumptions. I derive the assumptions needed to make credible non-parametric comparisons using anchoring vignettes, and propose a new nonparametric scale that does not assume homogeneity among respondents. I also provide methods for evaluating empirically whether a set of anchoring objects can produce credible nonparametric interpersonal comparisons. Two empirical studies illustrate the importance of accounting for differences in the use of ordinal scales by showing how our inferences about interpersonal comparisons may change as a function of the assumptions we accept.

<p>A large number of studies of ideological congruence, and of the effect of public opinion on policy outcomes more generally, have relied on the Kim-Fording (KF) measure of median voter opinion. This measure has the great virtue of being readily calculable — no direct measurement of voter opinion is required — but it rests on assumptions concerning party locations and voter behavior that are unquestionably incorrect, at least some of the time. This article explores the sensitivity of the KF measure to violations of its core assumptions through simulation experiments. It then uses public opinion data to assess the degree to which consequential levels of violation occur in actual democratic systems. The article concludes with a discussion of what the KF median really measures and where it can — and cannot — be safely used. [R]</p>

<p>This paper investigates how to address non-traditional security (NTS) challenges where the principal concern is to safeguard individuals. Since unilateral action cannot effectively deal with piracy, terrorism, cross-border conflicts, etc., there is a need for multilateral responses. Yet, the insistence on non-interference in the domestic affairs of countries has proven a major obstacle. EU members, conceptualizing sovereignty in terms of “constitutional independence”, have made some progress addressing these challenges, [while] in Asia Pacific, sovereignty often is used as a semantic weapon. Since states have not only rights but obligations, there is a need for a careful recalibration of sovereignty-related norms that stand in the way of improved human rights. Focusing on the Responsibility to Protect, I illustrate how a recalibration of sovereignty-related norms might take place. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>The article [argues] that the assumptions and approaches of the “anticorruption industry” that debuted in the 1990s framed the issue of corruption and substantially shaped scholarly inquiry on the subject. This article (1) critically reviews prevailing assumptions and approaches to the study of corruption during and especially after the Cold War, (2) examines the impact of economic frameworks and the anticorruption industry on post-Cold War scholarship, (3) explores contemporary forms of potential corruption, (4) argues that prevailing approaches to corruption may make it more difficult to see contemporary forms of the age-old phenomenon and are ill-equipped to study them, (5) considers how corruption might be reconceptualized to encompass the new forms, and (6) argues for a reintegration of ethics and accountability.

<p>63.1656 WHANG Taehee; McLEAN, Elena V.; KUBERSKI, Douglas W. — <bold>Coercion, information, and the success of sanction threats.</bold> <italic>American Journal of Political Science</italic> 57(1), Jan. 2013: 65–81.</p>
<p>This article explores when and why sanction threats succeed in extracting concessions from the targeted country. We focus on two different, albeit not mutually exclusive, mechanisms that can explain the success of sanction threats. The first mechanism relates to incomplete information regarding the sanctioner's determination to impose sanctions and suggests that threats help to extract concessions by revealing the sanctioner's resolve. The second mechanism underscores the direct impact of common interest between the two countries and explains the success of sanction threats by the targeted country's greater dependence on this link between the two countries and the sanctioner's ability to exploit this dependence. We test the hypotheses using a new strategic structural estimator. Our results provide no evidence in favor of the informational hypothesis, while lending robust support for the coercive hypothesis.

<p>63.1657 WILSON, Peter — <bold>The English School meets the Chicago School: the case for a grounded theory of international institutions.</bold> <italic>International Studies Review</italic> 14(4), Dec. 2012: 567–590.</p>
<p>The English School has traditionally found it difficult to define and identify with consistency the institutions of international society. A group of scholars, here called the “new institutionalists”, have recently devised tighter definitions and applied them more rigorously. But different understandings and lists of institutions continue to proliferate. The problem is the reliance on “stipulative” definitions, drawn from an increasingly abstract theoretical literature, compounded by the new institutionalists' employment of social structural and other “outsider” methods of social research. This article argues that it is possible to ground institutions empirically, a task on which all agree, only by returning to the interpretive “insider” approach traditionally associated with the school — but employing it in a much more rigorous way. It makes the case for a “grounded theory” of international institutions inspired by Chicago School sociology. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>This article draws out two implications for cosmopolitan or global friendship from an examination of a recent work on civic friendship in the domestic sphere: (1) Insofar as it is the case that civic friendship, as defined by S. A. Schwarzenbach <italic>(On Civic Friendship: Including Women in the State</italic>, New York, 2009) is necessary for justice in the state, it is also the case that the absence of global justice can be partially explained by the absence of what might be called cosmopolitan friendship. (2) If we consider the practicalities of civic friendship, we find that cosmopolitan friendship is an even more difficult and demanding project than we might have imagined.

<p>This paper proposes a dynamic politico-economic theory of fiscal policy in a world comprising a set of small open economies, whose driving force is the intergenerational conflict over debt, taxes, and public goods. Subsequent generations of voters choose fiscal policy through repeated elections. The presence of young voters induces fiscal discipline, that is, low taxes and low debt-accumulation. The paper characterizes the Markov-perfect equilibrium of the voting game in each economy, as well as the stationary equilibrium debt distribution and interest rate of the world economy. The equilibrium can reproduce some salient features of fiscal policy in modern economies. [R]</p>

<p>The breaks between the colonial and the post-colonial are quite clear. But they often manifest themselves in that the former colonies in the international division of labor or on the topic of “land grabbing” adopt the same positions as the colonial powers. Second, the current world order has maintained quasi-colonial controls, which generally is exercised within the UN or other multilateral organizations. Third, most of the “neocolonial” phenomena are concerned with a perceived colonial control of the economy through foreign agents. [See <italic>Abstr</italic>. 63.1412]</p>

<p>Outbursts of nationalism and partisan squabbles generated by the current economic and migration crisis in Europe suggest an unraveling of the integration project and a resurgence of the international anarchy associated with the Westphalian system. However, this article shows that the evolving system bears a closer resemblance to the Europe of the Middle Ages than to the Europe that followed the Treaties of Westphalia. In contemporary Europe we have overlapping authority, multiple loyalties and fuzzy borders. Conflicts are primarily about exclusion from the European core and abuse of agreed procedures rather than borders and territorial gains. Institutional forms of collective bargaining have replaced balance of power politics. This medieval system is neither conflict-free nor stable, but generates a pattern of international relations fundamentally different from the old Westphalian anarchy. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>This contribution outlines a sketch of the development of how (imagined) conspiracies challenged new means of security production and vice-versa. The main assumption is that (1) a translocal public sphere, (2) concepts, practices and means of institutionalized security production, and (3) developed narratives that contain conspiracy theories emerge together only from the Renaissance onwards. Only if there is a public sphere in which conspiracy theories can circulate anonymously do they become themselves an element of historical agency. Security as a leading principle of politics emerges only with the development of the state. [R, abr.] [Introduction to a thematic issue on “Security and conspiracy in history”, edited by the authors.
