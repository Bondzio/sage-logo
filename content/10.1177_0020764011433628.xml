<title>Background:</title>
<p>Spiritual issues are rarely addressed by psychiatric institutions in daily routine practice.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0020764011433628">
<title>Aims:</title>

<sec id="section3-0020764011433628">
<title>Methods:</title>
<p>All patients evaluated by the religious assistance service in a psychiatric hospital were included.

<sec id="section4-0020764011433628">
<title>Results:</title>
<p>Most of the 213 patients evaluated requested religious assistance (85.0%), including those that reported having no religion (79.1%). Patients with a diagnosis of schizophrenia (<italic>p</italic> = .010) and lower intrinsic religiousness (<italic>p</italic> = .002) tended to request less religious assistance.

<title>Conclusion:</title>
<p>Most psychiatric inpatients were willing to participate in religious assistance sessions, even those without formal religious affiliations. Patients with lower intrinsic religiosity and schizophrenia tended to request less assistance. We believe the findings of this study can serve to foster discussion on whether psychiatric hospitals should provide a structured religious care service.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Studies have shown that religiosity is associated with lower prevalence of depression and suicide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0020764011433628">Moreira-Almeida, Neto, &amp; Koenig, 2006</xref>), better coping with chronic illnesses, higher indicators of psychological well-being and lower rates of substance abuse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0020764011433628">Koenig, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0020764011433628">Lucchetti, Granero Lucchetti et al., 2011</xref>). Many spiritual interventions have also shown promising results in the treatment of substance abuse, anxiety and schizophrenia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0020764011433628">Amaro et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0020764011433628">Huguelet et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0020764011433628">Koszycki, Raab, Aldosary, &amp; Bradwejn, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Nevertheless, this issue is rarely addressed in mental health care settings. Recently, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0020764011433628">Galanter, Dermatis, Talbot, McMahon and Alexander (2011)</xref> found that spirituality is an important component in the lives of many psychiatric patients but goes unrecognized by psychiatrists and hospital staff. The majority of medical doctors point to barriers preventing them from addressing this issue, such as lack of time, lack of knowledge and training, as well as fear of imposing one’s own religion and preconceptions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0020764011433628">Mariotti et al., 2011</xref>). However, there is vigorous debate between those who believe these associations and those who do not. Recently, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0020764011433628">Sloan (2008)</xref> highlighted controversial discrepancies in a number spirituality/religiosity studies, such as heterogeneity of findings, residual confounding, measurement issues and reliance on data sets designed for other purposes.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, some psychiatric residency programmes in the USA have included spirituality courses in their curricula. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0020764011433628">Puchalski, Larson and Lu (2001)</xref>, the National Institute for Healthcare Research’s Model Curriculum for Psychiatric Residency Training Programmes was published to help address the need for quality training programmes that incorporate spirituality and mental health, which includes interviewing and assessing patients’ religious/spiritual practices, beliefs and attitudes.</p>
<p>Many hospitals are also addressing this issue during hospitalization, following guidelines for an international quality programme known as the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations (JCAHO), in which practitioners conduct an initial, brief spiritual assessment with clients in many settings, including hospitals and behavioural health organizations. The same framework, however, is used in all settings. This brief assessment should encompass at least the following three areas: (1) denomination or faith tradition; (2) significant spiritual beliefs; and (3) important spiritual practices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0020764011433628">Hodge, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>In addition, there is the very important role of the mental health chaplain in taking care of psychiatric patients. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0020764011433628">Rattray (2002)</xref>, the mental health chaplain has the position of being employed by the trust as a spiritual expert or advisor and of being seen by patients and staff as a legitimate person with whom to raise issues of a spiritual, or more specifically, a religious, nature. In the USA, approximately 60% of hospitals have an organized health chaplaincy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0020764011433628">Cadge, Freese, &amp; Christakis, 2008</xref>). Unfortunately, few hospitals in Brazil have this kind of professional on their health care teams (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0020764011433628">Gentil, Guia, &amp; Sanna, 2011</xref>). Therefore, health professionals are responsible for identifying patients’ spiritual needs.</p>
<p>Despite concerted efforts to integrate spirituality into psychiatric care, few studies have assessed the number of patients who request religious assistance or which factors rendered requesters more likely to accept this kind of assistance.</p>
<p>The aim of the present report was to analyse the prevalence of, and factors associated with, inpatients’ acceptance of religious/spiritual assistance in a psychiatric hospital in São Paulo, Brazil.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0020764011433628" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>This study was carried out from November 2010 to February 2011. The sampling frame consisted of all inpatients evaluated by the religious assistance service at João Evangelista Hospital (HoJE), representing approximately 80% of the inpatients.</p>
<p>HoJE is a 100-bed psychiatric hospital located in the northern part of the city of São Paulo, Brazil, which cares for mental health conditions such as substance dependence, bipolar disorder, depression and schizophrenia, among others. The hospital also offers outpatient and day care services. A total of 60% of the hospital’s psychiatric beds for the general public are subsidized by the government and it is therefore considered a philanthropic institution under Brazilian law. Public patients tend not to actively choose psychiatric hospitals but are referred under the public health system, which designates the hospital that patients (in psychiatry and other medical specialties) should be admitted to. In Brazil, all citizens have the right to health care and treatment is regionalized (i.e. health care is provided nearest to the patient’s domicile). The hospital is assigned according to availability.</p>
<p>Although not officially a hospital linked to a religious institution, the hospital was founded by Spiritist followers. Spiritism is the third largest religion in Brazil with approximately 2.3 million followers and was founded by Allan Kardec (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0020764011433628">Lucchetti, Lucchetti, Bassi, &amp; Nobre, 2011</xref>). It adopts a dualistic concept of human beings. It postulates that we are essentially, immortal spirits that temporarily inhabit physical bodies for several necessary incarnations to attain moral and intellectual improvement. HoJE is a hospital that has a Spiritist-related charitable foundation and provides spiritual treatments to groups with various different religious traditions such as Spiritists, Catholics and Protestant Evangelicals. HoJE’s credo incorporates the following value: ‘Respect for patient’s spiritual dimension.’ Therefore, a programme entitled Programa de Integração Saúde Mental e Espiritualidade – Mental Health and Spirituality Integration Program (PRISME) was created to promote respect and value for this spiritual dimension.</p>
<p>Upon admission, all HoJE inpatients are systematically asked whether they would like religious assistance (in some cases assessments are carried out during hospitalization, depending on the severity of symptoms and evolution of patients). These interviews are conducted by mental health professionals and patients are asked whether they have a religious affiliation, attend religious services, are sympathetic to other faiths and whether they would like to have religious assistance during hospitalization. Subsequently, patients are invited to fill in the Duke Religion Index (DUREL) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0020764011433628">Koenig, Parkerson, &amp; Meador, 1997</xref>).</p>
<p>After this initial interview, those that accepted religious assistance sign a consent term and have their family contacted in order to confirm acceptance of this assistance. All family representatives must also sign a written consent term authorizing this assistance.</p>
<p>The religious assistance is provided by religious leaders and voluntary members of some religious communities to patients accepting the assistance. Three types of assistance are available as routine at the hospital (Catholic, Evangelical and Spiritist), while the others are available as and when requested. Catholic assistance is given by a priest or a deacon and consists of Bible readings, discussion of a range of issues based on the Catholic religion and prayer. Evangelical assistance is given by an Evangelical pastor and consists of Bible readings, discussion of a range of issues based on the Evangelical religion and prayer. Spiritist assistance is given by Spiritist members and consists of fluidotherapy (laying on of hands and magnetized water), lectures/studies regarding Spiritist evangelical issues, disobsession (spirit release therapy) and prayer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0020764011433628">Lucchetti et al., 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>For the present study, the following data were extracted from patients’ medical charts:</p>
<list id="list1-0020764011433628" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Socio-demographic details (gender, age, marital status, education).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Medical diagnosis (determined by the hospital’s psychiatrists and based on the ICD-10 classification) grouped into alcohol dependence (F10), non-alcohol substance abuse (F11-19), bipolar disorder (F31), depression (F32) or schizophrenia (F20).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Psychiatric hospitalization: how many previous psychiatric hospitalizations did the patient have?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Religious delusion noted by psychiatrists on patients’ charts.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Patient classification system in psychiatric nursing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0020764011433628">Martins, Arantes, &amp; Forcella, 2008</xref>). This is an instrument validated for Portuguese to classify the level of dependence on psychiatric nursing. It consists of 11 questions (mild, moderate and severe dependence) for the following aspects: self-care, thinking, affection, activities, social interaction, feeding, sleep, urinary and bowel continence, medication adherence, vital signs and somatic problems. The questionnaire is filled out by the psychiatric nurse and scores can range from 11 (less dependence) to 33 (more dependence).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Religious assistance service data: as described above.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Duke Religion Index (DUREL) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0020764011433628">Koenig et al., 1997</xref>): the DUREL is a five-item measure of religious involvement, which comprises three sub-scales: (1) organizational religious behaviour (one item) – involves public religious activities such as attending religious services or participating in other group-related religious activity (prayer groups, scripture study groups, etc.); (2) non-organizational religious behaviour – consists of religious activities performed in private, such as prayer, scripture study, watching religious television programmes or listening to religious radio (one item); and (3) intrinsic religious motivation (three items are summed to derive a total intrinsic religiosity score) – according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0020764011433628">Allport and Ross (1967)</xref>, intrinsic religiosity is defined as a genuine, heartfelt devout faith, whereas extrinsic religiosity is defined as a more utilitarian use of religion as a means to an end, such as church attendance to gain social status. Response options are rated on a five- or six-point Likert scale. The DUREL instrument has been translated and re-validated for Portuguese by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0020764011433628">Lucchetti et al. (2010)</xref>.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>In order to compare those who accepted religious assistance against those who did not, student’s <italic>t</italic>-test, χ<italic><sup>2</sup></italic> analysis, Fisher’s test (when the number of observations obtained for analyses was small) and the Mann Whitney U test (for intrinsic religiosity – ordinal data) were used for continuous and dichotomous variables in bivariate analyses. A logistic regression model (enter method) was conducted with ‘acceptance of religious assistance’ as the dependent variable, dichotomized into either 1 = acceptance or 0 = non-acceptance. All other variables were included as independent type. Goodness of fit was evaluated by the Hosmer–Lemeshow test and Omnibus Tests of Model Coefficients. A <italic>p</italic>-value of .05 was used to define statistical significance with a 95% confidence interval (95% CI). All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS version 17.0 software (SPSS Inc., Chicago, USA). The present study was approved by the local ethics committee and patients signed an informed consent term.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>A total of 259 patients were admitted to HoJE, 213 (82.2%) of whom were evaluated by the hospital’s religious assistance service. Typically, all patients admitted to HoJE have their spiritual beliefs evaluated unless they present with severe mental health impairment (conditions such as advanced dementia or low-functioning autism). Patients were predominantly male (66.2%), single (50.7%), with a high educational level (60.8% with at least 11 years of education) and most were young (<italic>M</italic> = 35.6 years, SD = 10.5). The most common medical diagnoses were: 52 (24.4%) non-alcohol abuse, 50 (23.5%) bipolar disorder, 46 (21.6%) schizophrenia, 40 (18.8%) depression, 18 (8.5%) alcohol abuse and 7 (3.2%) other etiologies.</p>
<p>With regard to religious aspects, at least 44% of patients attended religious meetings once a week, more than 50% were involved in private daily religious activities and the mean score for intrinsic religiousness was 12.2 (SD = 2.9) ranging from 3 (less intrinsic religiosity) to 15 (more intrinsic religiosity). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0020764011433628">Figure 1</xref> shows a flow chart with patients’ religious affiliation and number/type of religious assistance requests. Patients were mostly Evangelicals (32.9%), followed by Catholics (30.0%) and Spiritists (12.7%). More than 20% of subjects reported having no religious affiliation. Interestingly, most patients requested religious assistance (85.0%), including those who reported having no religion (79.1%). Many religious followers (44.6%) also reported being sympathetic to other faiths such as Evangelic Protestantism (18.8%), Spiritism (15.0%) and Catholicism (6.6%). Surprisingly, many patients requested assistance for religious traditions other than their own. In other words, Catholics requested Spiritist or Evangelic assistance and so on.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In the present study, 85% of the psychiatric inpatients wished to have religious assistance during their hospitalization, representing the vast majority of the patients. This result is in line with the findings of similar reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0020764011433628">Baetz, Griffin, &amp; Marcoux, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0020764011433628">Galanter et al., 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Recent studies have shown that 8%–20% of doctors ask about their patients’ faith (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0020764011433628">Anandarajah &amp; Hight, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0020764011433628">Lucchetti, Granero Lucchetti et al., 2011</xref>) and more than 90% of patients wish to have their spirituality addressed if they become gravely ill (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0020764011433628">Ehman, Ott, Short, Ciampa, &amp; Hansen-Flaschen, 1999</xref>). There is a clear difference of opinion between patients and doctors on this issue, a situation that may be partially explained by lack of training among doctors on how to address these issues in patient care.</p>
<p>This figure was corroborated by observations in the psychiatric wards of HoJE. In order to better cope with their condition, patients wish to talk to their religious leader or have religious assistance, and this holds true even for those without religious affiliation. In fact, our sample shows that religious affiliation was a less significant factor. In this survey, a high number of patients (38.6%) wished to receive different religious assistance to their own usual religious affiliation. We can speculate that this phenomenon was due to curiosity (patients wanted to know more about another faith but hitherto had not had the opportunity) or because subjects were previously sympathetic to other traditions.</p>
<p>For instance, almost 40% of Catholics requested Spiritist assistance compared to only 10% of Evangelicals. This finding could also be explained by the fact that: (1) HoJE is a psychiatric hospital founded by Spiritists and patients may have believed that participating in Spiritists activities could hasten their discharge (as previously reported by two patients); or (2) in Brazil, there is a high number of ‘Catholics–Spiritists’, in other words, individuals who report a Catholic religious affiliation but attend Spiritist services and believe in reincarnation and some Spiritist traditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0020764011433628">Almeida &amp; Monteiro, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>Surprisingly, almost 80% of those without any formal religious affiliation requested religious assistance (most requested Spiritist or Evangelical assistance). This is an intriguing finding because during psychiatric hospitalization, these patients could possibly use religious activities as a means of coping with this experience, even without a formal religious tradition or religiosity. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0020764011433628">Tepper, Rogers, Coleman and Malony (2001)</xref>, religion may serve as a pervasive and potentially effective method of coping for persons with mental illness, thus warranting its integration into psychiatric and psychological practice.</p>
<p>The high number of requests for religious assistance in this study highlights some challenges in psychiatric treatment. Some psychiatrists believe that addressing spirituality could worsen psychotic symptoms, especially in those with religious delusions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0020764011433628">Braghetta et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0020764011433628">Koenig, 2007</xref>). In fact, we found some reports corroborating this statement, such as in the case of ocular self-mutilation, which is an occurrence most often described in acutely psychotic patients, following the biblical verse: ‘If your right eye causes you to stumble, pluck it out and throw it away from you’ (Matthew 5:29) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0020764011433628">Nucci &amp; Dalgalarrondo, 2000</xref>). Another example of this association is the study conducted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0020764011433628">Salib and Youakim (2001)</xref>, which found that spiritual healing was positively associated with a relapse of schizophrenia in a sample of elderly Egyptian patients.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, many studies have failed to show this worsening in treatment. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0020764011433628">Siddle, Haddock, Tarrier and Faragher (2004)</xref> found no difference in response to a four-week treatment for schizophrenia patients between those who were religious and non-religious, or between those who had religious delusions and those who did not. In addition, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0020764011433628">Verghese et al. (1989)</xref> evaluated 323 schizophrenic patients and found that an increase in religious activities was associated with good outcomes.</p>
<p>Interestingly, religious delusion was not associated with the request for or acceptance of religious assistance in our study, while patients without schizophrenia were more prone to requesting or accepting this assistance. We can speculate that schizophrenia patients, due to their difficulties in social interaction and higher likelihood of mistrust (paranoid, persecutory thoughts), may feel less comfortable with this kind of assistance. We also found that intrinsic religiosity was the only religious aspect associated with acceptance of religious assistance. Thus, it seems that individuals with a deeper faith believe in the necessity of having their religiosity addressed.</p>
<sec id="section10-0020764011433628">
<title>Limitations</title>
<p>Some limitations should be considered when evaluating these results. First, only a single private psychiatric hospital was evaluated (chosen for its well-structured religious/spiritual assistance service). Therefore, further studies are needed involving different hospitals worldwide in order to confirm these findings. Second, due to the Spiritist nature of the hospital studied, some patients may have wanted Spiritist assistance in order to hasten their discharge, as reported above. Third, a comparison of clinical outcomes between those assisted and those who were not, in order to determine the effectiveness of this procedure, was not carried out.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Despite its limitations, the study findings revealed that most psychiatric patients wanted religious assistance, even those with no formal religious affiliation. We should mention that all patients were offered this assistance and were invited to take part in it (active search). This contrasts with some psychiatric hospitals in which religious assistance is only provided if patients specifically request the presence of a religious leader/chaplain (passive search). We believe the results of this study can serve to foster discussion on whether psychiatric hospitals should provide a structured religious care service and also on the type of patient that may want (and benefit from) this kind of assistance.</p>
