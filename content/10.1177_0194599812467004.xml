<title>Background</title>
<p>Guidelines translate best evidence into best practice. A well-crafted guideline promotes quality by reducing health care variations, improving diagnostic accuracy, promoting effective therapy, and discouraging ineffective—or potentially harmful—interventions. Despite a plethora of published guidelines, methodology is often poorly defined and varies greatly within and among organizations.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0194599812467004">
<title>Purpose</title>
<p>The third edition of this manual describes the principles and practices used successfully by the American Academy of Otolaryngology—Head and Neck Surgery Foundation to produce quality-driven, evidence-based guidelines using efficient and transparent methodology for actionable recommendations with multidisciplinary applicability. The development process emphasizes a logical sequence of key action statements supported by amplifying text, action statement profiles, and recommendation grades linking action to evidence. New material in this edition includes standards for trustworthy guidelines, updated classification of evidence levels, increased patient and public involvement, assessing confidence in the evidence, documenting differences of opinion, expanded discussion of conflict of interest, and use of computerized decision support for crafting actionable recommendations.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0194599812467004">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>As clinical practice guidelines become more prominent as a key metric of quality health care, organizations must develop efficient production strategies that balance rigor and pragmatism. Equally important, clinicians must become savvy in understanding what guidelines are—and are not—and how they are best used to improve care. The information in this manual should help clinicians and organizations achieve these goals.</p>

<p>If you use or develop clinical practice guidelines, this manual will likely be of interest. “There are many paths to the top of the mountain,” suggests an old Chinese proverb, “but the view is always the same.”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0194599812467004">1</xref></sup> Although many paths lead to guidelines, we offer proven strategies for efficiently crafting a valid and actionable product. The driving force is quality improvement with a continuous effort to balance pragmatism with developmental rigor. The end product is a starting point for performance improvement.</p>
<p>The third edition of this manual builds on earlier publications<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0194599812467004">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0194599812467004">3</xref></sup> by the American Academy of Otolaryngology—Head and Neck Surgery Foundation (AAO-HNSF) to systematize internal guideline development. By following these principles, the AAO-HNSF has published 8 multidisciplinary guidelines, <italic>all within 12 to 18 months from conception to completion</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0194599812467004">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0194599812467004"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0194599812467004"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0194599812467004"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0194599812467004"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0194599812467004"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0194599812467004"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0194599812467004">11</xref></sup> Our new manual not only summarizes this experience but allows other organizations to assess and adapt the processes.</p>
<p>Guideline methodology continues to evolve rapidly, with substantive advances since our last manual was published. Standards for trustworthy guidelines have been proposed by the Institute of Medicine<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0194599812467004">12</xref></sup> and the Guidelines International Network,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0194599812467004">13</xref></sup> computerized decision-support software is available to facilitate actionable and implementable guideline statements,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0194599812467004">14</xref></sup> consumer and public involvement in guideline development has become the norm, and conflict of interest has taken on increased scope and importance. Moreover, we continue to refine and improve our development processes with each new guideline, striving to meet or exceed current standards.</p>
<p>Our goals in publishing a revised manual are several. First, we sought to provide clinicians with a straightforward explanation of guidelines, considering the increasing prominence of guidelines as a quality metric. Second, we wanted a pragmatic resource, which accurately reflects current practices, to sustain consistent guideline development at the AAO-HNSF. Last, we wanted to share our successful development process with the guideline community at large to encourage an exchange of ideas and to promote best practices.</p>
<p>Guidelines are particularly important when wide regional variations exist in managing a condition. Similarly, the wide variability in guideline <italic>methodology</italic>, both within and between organizations, is precisely what mandates a systematic approach to guideline development. Despite a plethora of techniques reflected in published guidelines, we could not find a single, comprehensive “how to” manual with a valid and pragmatic approach that could be readily implemented. This work is offered to address this void.</p>
<p>We thank the AAO-HNSF for their trust, support, and flexibility throughout this fruitful collaboration and sincerely hope that you may also benefit from the experience. We humbly acknowledge that ours is one of many paths to the mountaintop and look forward to further refinement based on future experience and on postpublication peer review.</p>
<sec id="section4-0194599812467004">
<title>How to Use This Manual</title>
<p>Throughout the manual, we emphasize <italic>principles</italic> and <italic>practices</italic>, recognizing that both are needed to translate concepts into action. <italic>Principles</italic> underlying practices are always stated, to promote conceptual focus and clarity before getting sidetracked with implementation details. <italic>Practices</italic> are illustrated with examples from prior AAO-HNSF guidelines to clarify how we chose to implement a principle, with the understanding that other development groups will need to modify the particulars to fit their organizational structure and resources.</p>
<p>The following list describes some of the fundamental principles underlying guideline development that are discussed sequentially in this manual:</p>
<list id="list1-0194599812467004" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Medicine and guidelines: why guidelines are an essential for quality care</p></list-item>

<list-item><p>Understanding recommendation grades: the link between action and evidence</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Appraising implementability: maximizing the chance to influence clinician behavior</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>This manual is also intended as a practical resource for use during guideline development. Major sections of the text correspond to the activities involved (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0194599812467004"><bold>Table 1</bold></xref>), allowing the user to move from one section to the next as development proceeds. Relevant pages of the manual can be distributed to the guideline development group in advance of conference calls or in-person meetings to facilitate preparation and to ensure appropriate expectations. When significant principles apply to an activity, they are discussed within, or just before, the relevant section.</p>

<p>We have tried to make this manual as reader-friendly as possible, but how to best approach the material will depend on one’s background and perspective. Individuals and organizations involved in guideline development comprise a diverse audience that may benefit from the material in the manual in several ways:</p>
<list id="list2-0194599812467004" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p><italic>Organizations new to guideline development</italic> will benefit from understanding the nuances and complexities of guideline creation and may consider using the process outlined as a starting point for their own endeavors.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Organizations with an established guideline development</italic> process may wish to compare their current processes to those described here, potentially identifying areas for improved quality, efficiency, or both.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Members of guideline panels or working groups</italic> can derive greater insight and understanding of development methodology, allowing to them to contribute most effectively as an author or participant.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Staff supporting guideline development</italic> will find practical suggestions on staying focused and efficient and may consider using or adapting the manual as a template for their own processes.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Guideline users are perhaps even more diverse than guideline developers. Whereas most guideline users do not need, or want, detailed information on methodology, some understanding is necessary to interpret and use existing products:</p>
<list id="list3-0194599812467004" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p><italic>Organizations that use guidelines</italic> will gain greater insight into the guideline development process, understanding what makes a guideline valid and actionable, as well as what attributes should be sought when critically assessing a guideline’s potential value.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Organizations that conduct systematic reviews</italic> can interact most effectively with guideline developers if they understand the process of moving from evidence to action, how systematic reviews facilitate these efforts, and how recommendations are made when evidence is absent or of low quality.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Clinicians with an interest in guidelines</italic> can use them most effectively if they understand how they are developed, what are current best practices, and how guidelines should—and should not—be used to influence clinical care.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>
<italic>Consumers or consumer groups</italic> that have identified guidelines of interest will be better able to assess quality, as well as select among multiple guidelines of varying quality, if they appreciate the processes involved in creating valid guidelines.</p></list-item>

<title>Medicine and Guidelines</title>
<p>The Institute of Medicine has identified 3 crucial tasks for a national system to identify highly effective health care services: priority setting, evidence review, and developing recommendations (guidelines).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0194599812467004">15</xref></sup> The last task—creating clinical practice guidelines—is perhaps the most challenging because methodology continues to evolve, the quality and relevance of available evidence are highly variable, and evidence gaps mandate valid processes for incorporating expert consensus.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Guidelines help clinicians translate best evidence into best practice. A well-crafted guideline promotes quality by reducing health care variations, improving diagnostic accuracy, promoting effective therapy, and discouraging ineffective—or potentially harmful—interventions. <italic>Editorial note: Content that is offset from the remainder of the text is intended to emphasize a concept, insight, or principle of special note or importance. This also serves to create visual breaks that improve readability, along with tables, bulleted lists, numbered lists, and frequent subheadings</italic>.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This manual offers one approach to efficient guideline development based on experience of the AAO-HNSF, the American Academy of Pediatrics, and the Yale Center for Medical Informatics. The AAO-HNS and associated Foundation sponsor continuing medical education, professional meetings, scientific research, and practice management guidance for more than 13,000 ear, nose, and throat specialists in the United States and abroad. Since 2004, the AAO-HNSF has devoted substantial resources to creating and publishing guidelines that improve quality of care in diverse clinical practice environments.</p>
<p>Despite an immediate need for valid, actionable guidelines, many barriers exist. Published guidelines, although numerous, are often poorly suited to assess performance or influence care because recommendations do not translate into measurable actions or activities. Moreover, the development process is generally inefficient and highly complex, requiring, on average, about 2 to 4 years per guideline. Gaps in the evidence base for many important issues may preclude guideline recommendations based on evidence, even when quality concerns or practice variations mandate urgent action.</p>
<p>One solution is to produce <italic>quality-driven, evidence-based</italic> guidelines using <italic>efficient</italic> and <italic>transparent</italic> methodology for <italic>actionable</italic> recommendations with <italic>multidisciplinary applicability:</italic>
</p>
<list id="list4-0194599812467004" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p><italic>Quality driven</italic> means placing quality improvement at the forefront of guideline development, using current best evidence and multidisciplinary consensus to prioritize recommendations. Selection of key action statements is driven by opportunities to promote best practices, reduce variations in care, and minimize inappropriate care or resource utilization.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Evidence based</italic> means supporting all decisions with the best available research evidence identified through systematic literature review. An absence of high-quality evidence (eg, randomized trials), however, does not preclude a structured use of observational studies if an important quality concern needs to be addressed.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>
<italic>Efficient</italic> guideline development processes make maximum use of available resources to create a timely product, ideally moving from conception to publication within 12 to 18 months.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>
<italic>Transparent methodology</italic> is explicit, reproducible, and applied consistently so guideline users can link recommendations to the corresponding the level of evidence, benefit-harm-cost relationship, and the roles of values and patient preferences in decision making.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>
<italic>Actionable</italic> recommendations tell providers precisely what to do, to whom, and under what specific circumstances, using unambiguous language that facilitates implementation and measurement.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>
<italic>Multidisciplinary</italic> validity and applicability means that all stakeholders (eg, primary care, specialists, allied health, nursing, consumers) are part of the development and implementation processes.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>The utility of a guideline depends highly on its <italic>transparency</italic>, which makes clear the purpose and basis of recommendations to end users. Transparency mandates disclosure of competing interests by authors, explicit statements about the reasons for developing a policy, and explanation of how contributing factors are weighed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0194599812467004">16</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The AAO-HNSF guidelines prescribe recommendations in <italic>key action statements</italic> followed by supporting (amplifying) text. All guideline action statements should ideally be supported by an <italic>action statement profile</italic> that summarizes clearly the decision-making process in terms of aggregate evidence quality, harm-benefit assessment, development group values, reasons for intentional vagueness, and the role of patient preference. Our newer guidelines feature expanded profiles that explicitly state differences of opinion and level of confidence in the evidence underpinning the recommendation (not just its aggregate quality). Because of their importance, the profiles now appear immediately after key action statements, instead of after the supporting text. Action statement profiles are discussed fully later in this manual.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0194599812467004">
<title>Understanding Guidelines</title>
<p>As defined by the Institute of Medicine (IOM), clinical practice guidelines are “statements that include recommendations intended to optimize patient care that are informed by a systematic review of evidence and an assessment of the benefits and harms of alternative care options.”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0194599812467004">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>Despite increasing acceptance of an evidence-based approach to clinical decision making, much clinical practice is still not based on the best available evidence. Guidelines are one way of implementing evidence into practice.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0194599812467004">17</xref></sup> They can serve as a guide to best practices, a framework for clinical decision making, and a benchmark for evaluating performance.</p>
<p>Guidelines benefit patients through better outcomes, fewer ineffective interventions, greater consistency of care, and by creating secondary implementation materials (pamphlets, videos, etc). Clinicians can use guidelines to make better decisions, initiate quality improvement efforts, prioritize new research initiatives, and support coverage or reimbursement for appropriate services. Conversely, a flawed guideline could significantly harm both patients and clinicians, thereby mandating sound methodology as a basis for guideline development.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0194599812467004">18</xref></sup></p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Simply inserting the word <italic>guideline</italic> in the title of a document does not make it so. Many review articles, consensus statements, practice parameters, and policy recommendations are mistakenly labeled as <italic>guidelines</italic>, even though they do not possess the methodologic rigor to warrant such a designation. A real guideline is one that fulfills all or most of the specific criteria defined below.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Standards for trustworthy clinical practice guideline have been proposed by the Institute of Medicine and the Guidelines International Network.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0194599812467004">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0194599812467004">13</xref></sup> As summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0194599812467004"><bold>Table 2</bold></xref>, there is significant overlap in the proposals, with many common elements and features. Taken together, however, they provide a useful overview of what guidelines should be and how they differ from other literature syntheses. Although based on expert consensus and current best evidence, the validity of these standards is unknown, and they are not uniformly accepted. Nonetheless, they do represent the best standards available for guideline developers, who, in response, have begun to assess the degree to which their organization’s guideline development processes comply.</p>

<p>Guidelines are never intended to supersede professional judgment; rather, they may be viewed as a relative constraint on individual clinician discretion in a particular clinical circumstance.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0194599812467004">21</xref></sup> Clinicians should always act and decide in a way that they believe will best serve their patients’ interests and needs, regardless of guideline recommendations. Guidelines simply represent the best judgment of a team of experienced clinicians and methodologists addressing the scientific evidence for a particular topic.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Guidelines differ from <italic>systematic reviews</italic> and <italic>evidence reports</italic> that identify and combine studies using explicit methods to reduce bias but do not typically define appropriate actions or incorporate values. In contrast, a guideline uses information from evidence reviews and other sources to create specific action statements by considering values and linking the strength of recommendation to the quality of evidence. <italic>Performance measures</italic> operationalize these statements into a format that can be used to assess adherence, taking into account appropriate patient exceptions and exclusions.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Evidence-based clinical practice guidelines are usually not intended for cost control or health care rationing, unless specifically undertaken to assess cost-effectiveness. Guidelines seek to produce optimal health outcomes for patients, minimize harm, and reduce inappropriate variations in clinical care. Whereas some of these outcomes may also reduce costs, financial benefits alone are generally not the main focus of an evidence-based clinical practice guideline.</p>
<p>When the focus of a clinical practice guideline is a specific procedure or intervention (eg, tonsillectomy), action statements that describe indications should not be viewed as comprehensive. Guidelines address a limited number of quality improvement opportunities, particularly where there is uncertainty about the effects of treatment or indications for intervention (eg, tonsillectomy for recurrent infection). Conversely, when indications are less controversial (eg, tonsillectomy for obstructive sleep apnea or suspected malignancy), the guideline may not contain any related discussion, but this does not imply a contraindication to the procedure. Organizations seeking to define evidence-based indications for procedures or surgery should use guidelines as a starting point but not as the sole source of information.</p>

<title>Principles of Guideline Development</title>
<p>Without substantial advance planning, guideline development is likely to be biased and inefficient. Moreover, an a priori protocol is mandatory to ensure attention to the COGS, AGREE II, Institute of Medicine, and Guidelines Internation Network quality standards. On the basis of a literature review and direct experience in North America and the United Kingdom, Shekelle and colleagues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0194599812467004">22</xref></sup> concluded that 5 steps are involved in the initial development of an evidence-based guideline:</p>
<list id="list7-0194599812467004" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Identifying and refining the subject area</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Convening and running guideline development groups</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Assessing evidence identified by systematic literature review</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Translating evidence into recommendations</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Subjecting the guideline to external review</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Turner and coworkers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0194599812467004">17</xref></sup> compared approaches to guideline development in 6 handbooks from the Council of Europe, World Health Organization, and national organizations in Australia, Scotland, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom. All handbooks agreed that key aspects of development included a multidisciplinary panel, consumer involvement, identifying clinical questions or problems, systemically reviewing and appraising the literature, a process for drafting recommendations, external consultation and review, and planned updating.</p>
<p>Guyatt and colleagues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0194599812467004">23</xref></sup> have focused on grading evidence quality and recommendation strength in guidelines, emphasizing that these are separate and distinct processes essential to establishing and communicating validity. An optimal rating system is characterized by simplicity and transparency for the clinician consumer, sufficient (but not too many) categories, explicitness of methodology for guideline developers, simplicity for guideline developers, consistency with general trends in grading systems, and an explicit approach to different levels of evidence for different outcomes.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>The guideline development process described in this manual addresses the above issues, yet strives for a balance between rigor and pragmatism that maintains efficiency.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Efficiency is critical in guideline development because moving from planning to completion in about 14 months helps avoid a situation in which new evidence continues to appear with a concomitant need to integrate it. With an efficient protocol in place, an organization can stagger guidelines under simultaneous development to result in a finished product every 8 months (depending on resources). The timeline in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0194599812467004"><bold>Table 1</bold></xref> has been developed to ensure rigor in development while promoting efficiency. The remainder of this manual describes the steps listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0194599812467004"><bold>Table 1</bold></xref> in terms of general concepts and specific suggestions based on prior experience.</p>

<title>Planning</title>
<sec id="section9-0194599812467004">
<title>Define Topic</title>
<p>Guidelines can be developed for a wide range of topics, including conditions (sinusitis, ear infections, sudden hearing loss), procedures (tonsillectomy, tympanostomy tubes), and signs or symptoms (cough, hoarseness). Topics selected for guideline development should be of high priority and feasible.</p>
<p>
<italic>High-priority</italic> topics have the potential for evidence-based practice to improve health outcomes, minimize undesirable variations in care, and reduce the burden of disease and health disparities. The Institute of Medicine has identified the following priority-setting criteria as common to most international guideline development groups<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0194599812467004">15</xref></sup>:</p>
<list id="list8-0194599812467004" list-type="order">
<list-item><p><italic>Disease burden</italic>. Extent of disability, morbidity, or mortality imposed by a condition, including effects on patients, families, communities, and society overall.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Controversy</italic>. Controversy or uncertainty around the topic and supporting data.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Cost</italic>. Economic cost associated with the condition, procedure, treatment, or technology related to the number of people needing care, unit cost of care, or indirect costs.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>New evidence</italic>. New evidence with the potential to change conclusions from prior assessments.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Potential impact</italic>. Potential to improve health outcomes and quality of life; improve decision making for patient or provider</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Public or provider interest</italic>. Consumers, patients, clinicians, payers, and others want an assessment to inform decision making.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Variations in care</italic>. Potential to reduce unexplained variations in prevention, diagnosis, or treatment; the current use is outside the parameters of clinical evidence.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p><italic>Feasible</italic> topics have a sufficient base of high-quality published evidence (ideally randomized, controlled trials) to drive guideline development, have 1 or more existing systematic reviews or meta-analyses already published on relevant issues, and have relatively clear definitions of the condition or procedure under consideration.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>A steering committee that includes organizational leadership and broad stakeholder representation can help identify, prioritize, and refine guideline topics. Diversity of expertise and perspective helps minimize bias caused by conflicts of interests.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The AAO-HNSF convened the Guideline Development Task Force in 2006 as a steering committee for developing evidence-based guidelines and related knowledge products.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0194599812467004">24</xref></sup> The task force includes representatives of all subspecialty groups within otolaryngology and of all relevant internal Academy groups, including research, patient safety, quality improvement, board of governors, and evidence-based medicine. Topics are solicited with a standardized form, based on principles outlined above, then presented to the task force for ranking and prioritization.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0194599812467004">
<title>Convene the Guideline Development Group</title>
<p>Perhaps the most important decision in creating a successful guideline relates to composition of the guideline development group (GDG). A group size of 12 to 18 members encourages diversity and efficiency yet is small enough to avoid delays and redundancy.</p>
<p>The group should consist of the (1) chair and 2 assistant chairs; (2) staff lead; (3) methodologist; (4) content experts; (5) stakeholders from all relevant disciplines, including nursing, primary care, and allied health; and (6) 2 consumer representatives. The roles, responsibilities, and considerations for identifying and appointing guideline development group members are outlined in the sections that follow.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0194599812467004">
<title>Identify Organizational Leadership</title>
<p>A <italic>staff lead</italic> is assigned as the primary liaison for the group. Qualifications for staff lead include prior guideline development experience, familiarity with literature searches and using a citation database, and a basic understanding of study design, medical terminology, and levels of evidence.</p>
<p>Specific responsibilities of the staff lead include the following:</p>

<list-item><p>Assisting the chair in formatting the final document for publication submission</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Obtaining copyright transfer and financial disclosure forms from working group members</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>A <italic>methodologist</italic> is assigned to ensure that the working group adheres to methodologic standards and protocols endorsed by the organization and to serve as a facilitator who supports the chair during conference calls and meetings. The methodologist should be fluent with guideline methodology, understand the process of systematic review, and have direct experience with prior guidelines developed by the organization.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Developing trustworthy clinical practice guidelines is not intuitive but is an acquired skill that is independent from clinical expertise and accomplishment. Whereas an explicit and comprehensive manual aids the process, it cannot substitute for hands-on experience. Organizational staff that support guideline development should gain expertise through educational programs offered by the Cochrane Colloquium, Guidelines International Network, and other relevant organizations or medical specialty societies.</p>

<list-item><p>Working with the assistant chairs and support staff to delegate writing assignments and to integrate completed assignments and group feedback into the draft guideline</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>The chair is appointed by a selection panel that includes organizational leadership, steering committee representation, the guideline staff lead, and the methodologist. An ideal chair should be efficient and motivated, have demonstrated leadership ability, have prior experience with evidence-based guideline development, have demonstrated skills in scientific writing, and be fluent with using the Internet, e-mail, and e-mail attachments. All candidates for chair are asked to declare any conflicts of interest prior to their appointment.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>The chair is usually <italic>not</italic> a content expert for the guideline topic (to avoid excess concentration of power) but should be familiar with the scientific literature and management of the clinical condition. Content experts are usually abundant in an organization and can be readily added to the working group to fill in knowledge gaps. Conversely, the chair should be an impartial leader who stimulates discussion, not an advocate who injects his or her own opinions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0194599812467004">22</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>One or 2 <italic>assistant chairs</italic> should be identified who will be asked to chair the next guideline development effort. To maintain a pipeline of guideline projects, a continuing source of leadership for upcoming projects is needed. The best way to groom new chairs is to have them serve on 1 or 2 prior guideline groups to learn methodology and expectations early on. An ideal assistant chair should have experience with evidence-based medicine but does not necessarily need prior guideline development experience.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>The chair is ultimately responsible for moving along the guideline process, keeping the group focused and task oriented, and encouraging balanced participation of all working group members. Having more than 1 chair is inadvisable because responsibilities can be easily shifted and diffused. Instead, the structure should include 1 chair and 1 or more assistant chairs, as noted above.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-0194599812467004">
<title>Identify Partner Organizations</title>
<p>Guideline development groups should include individuals from a range of relevant stakeholder groups to minimize bias. Multidisciplinary participation helps identify and evaluate all relevant evidence, builds support among the intended guideline users, and increases the chances of addressing practical problems related to implementation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0194599812467004">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0194599812467004">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0194599812467004">28</xref></sup></p>
<p>Many guidelines warrant input from nursing, consumers, and primary care clinicians. Based on the target population and setting, the working group may include internists, pediatricians, geriatricians, family practitioners, and emergency medicine physicians. Additional specialty clinicians are recruited as dictated by the specific topic or condition under study. Allied health professions are similarly recruited and may include audiologists, physical therapists, speech-language pathologists, and others.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>An excellent source of consumer participants for guideline development is Consumers United for Evidence-based Healthcare (CUE), a national coalition of health and consumer advocacy organizations, which empowers consumers through critical appraisal of articles, guidelines, and systematic reviews.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0194599812467004">29</xref></sup> CUE is a project of the US Cochrane Center and works closely with the Cochrane Consumer Network.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>If another discipline is to be a <italic>full partner</italic> in developing the guideline, it is approached early to secure interest and cooperation. Alternatively, working group members can be selected to represent their “discipline,” not their “organization.” In this model, a pediatrician member of the working group would provide essential input for pediatrics as a discipline but would not necessarily represent the American Academy of Pediatrics or imply its specific endorsement of the resulting guideline.</p>

<p>Potential members of the guideline development group can be identified by organizational leadership, partner organizations, the working group chair, and the staff liaisons. An understanding of evidence-based medicine is desirable. Individuals are invited as representatives of their field or discipline but need not be content experts for the guideline topic. Content experts should be a minority voice on the working group to limit bias.</p>
<p>Specific responsibilities of the guideline development group members include the following:</p>

<p>Guideline development is <italic>not</italic> a spectator sport; producing a guideline requires substantial time and effort, which often tends to be underestimated by group members when they sign on. All members have a responsibility to other participants to behave with integrity, commitment, and a fully professional demeanor. One way to ensure commitment is to identify dates and times for all conference calls and in-person meetings in advance and to only accept candidates who are agree to full participation.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Despite the upfront commitment of all guideline development group members to participate fully in guideline development, conflicts or unexpected circumstances may arise that threaten validity if an important discipline is not well represented. Therefore, certain disciplines, which include primary care and selected others depending on the topic, should be represented by 2 group members to ensure representation.</p>
<p>To facilitate guideline dissemination and to ensure broad input that represents the needs of members belonging to the organization or society that develops the guidance, we recommend that key leaders of the sponsoring organization be part of the guideline development group. There is no need for these leaders to be content experts on the guideline topic; rather, they serve as a communication bridge by becoming immersed in the process, methodology, and multidisciplinary discussions that underpin the final document. The AAO-HNS requests that the following key leaders be members of the guideline development group, based on availability:</p>
<list id="list13-0194599812467004" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>AAO-HNS president or president-elect</p></list-item>

</list>
<p>A member of the AAO-HNS Section for Residents and Fellows is also invited to participate, as an educational exercise and to familiarize himself or herself with evidence-based medicine and guideline development methodology (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0194599812467004"><bold>Table 4</bold></xref>). Relevant AAO-HNS Education &amp; Scientific committees, including the Centralized Otolaryngology Research Effort, are asked to nominate a member to assist with the guideline’s implementation efforts and to aid the alignment of Academy educational products with the guideline’s key action statements.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>The importance of having content experts constitute only a minority of the guideline development group deserves additional emphasis. Content experts are needed to put evidence in context, but having too many can bias discussions and inhibit participation by other group members. All group members are “experts” in representing their specific discipline, including consumers who are experts in advocating for the public, patients, and their proxies. A primary responsibility of the chair is to ensure that all voices are heard and that no single voice or discipline dominates during meetings and conference calls.</p>

<title>Conflict of Interest Disclosure</title>
<p>Conflict of interest (COI) may be defined as a “set of circumstances that creates a risk that professional judgment or actions regarding a primary interest will be unduly influenced by a secondary interest.”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0194599812467004">12</xref></sup> Conflict of interest is an important potential source of bias when developing guidelines because it frequently results in overestimating benefit and underestimating harm. There is a high prevalence of nondisclosure of COI among guideline authors (development group members) and a high prevalence of COI among authors who do disclose.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0194599812467004">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0194599812467004">31</xref></sup></p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Despite good intentions, it is <italic>not</italic> appropriate for individuals to self-judge if a particular relationship causes conflict; their role is to declare, not interpret.

</disp-quote></p>
<p>Financial relationships are most easily identified and may relate to commercial or noncommercial interests. Examples of direct commercial COIs include employment, consultancies, stock ownership, honoraria, gifts, paid expert testimony, patents or patent applications, and industry-sponsored research or travel for the participant or family members.

<p>The AAO-HNSF explicitly describes its COI policy for clinical practice guidelines in its Code for Interaction with Companies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0194599812467004">34</xref></sup> Key points are (a) prohibiting direct company support for guideline development, printing, or publication; (b) disclosing all potential COIs of guideline development group members; (c) requiring that a majority of guideline development group members be free of financial COIs; (d) requiring that the chair must be free of financial COIs during guideline development and for 1 year after publication; and (e) disclosing all potential COIs of expert reviewers or advisers who are not officially part of the development group.</p>
<p>Managing COI begins by distributing the completed contact and disclosure list to all guideline development group members for verification. All declared conflicts—financial and intellectual—are discussed with the group and published with the guideline. Serious or irreconcilable conflicts may result in dismissal of an individual from the development group. For each key action statement (recommendation), the group must decide if a member’s COI requires him or her to be excluded from voting, recused from discussion related to that statement, or both. The COI disclosures should be reviewed and updated, as needed, during each conference call, at each in-person meeting, and prior to publication.</p>

<sec id="section17-0194599812467004">
<title>Determine Dates for Conference Calls and Meetings</title>
<p>Adhering to a predetermined, specific timeline allows publication of the guideline within 14 months. Arranging dates for conference calls and meetings is particularly difficult when dealing with individuals representing multiple organizations and disciplines. Therefore, it is critical to plan early in the process. Ideally, this should occur <italic>before</italic> guideline development group members are invited to participate, with participation contingent on availability for all calls and in-person meetings. Events are planned using the timetable in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0194599812467004"><bold>Table 1</bold></xref>:</p>
<list id="list15-0194599812467004" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Conference call 1 takes place in month 3</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Conference call 2 takes place about 4 weeks later, in month 4</p></list-item>

<list-item><p>In-person meeting 2 takes place about 6 to 8 weeks later, in month 7</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>We have found that conference calls are often most feasible if planned to start at 8:00 <sc>pm</sc> Eastern Standard Time. Calls should be generally scheduled for 2 hours. In-person meetings can begin at noon with a light working lunch to allow attendees to fly in the same morning. Similarly, they can end by 2:00 <sc>pm</sc> the following day to allow a return flight the same day. A group dinner should be planned the first day. A convenient schedule is to begin on either Friday or Sunday and end the next day.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>The importance of having <italic>all</italic> guideline development group members participate in <italic>all</italic> conference calls and attend <italic>all</italic> meetings cannot be overemphasized. Advance planning is the best guarantee of success, since maximal time is available for group members to adjust their schedules as needed and block out event dates in their calendars. If a group member cannot make this commitment, an alternate should be found as soon as possible.</p>

<title>Identifying Evidence</title>
<sec id="section19-0194599812467004">
<title>Purpose</title>
<p>The validity of an evidence-based guideline depends in large part on an unbiased and systematic literature review. The goal is to locate the best evidence from all relevant sources, producing a comprehensive body of evidence that will allow clinical questions to be answered and highlight gaps in the evidence base where formal consensus methods may be needed.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section20-0194599812467004">
<title>The Role of Evidence in Guideline Development</title>
<p>Although identifying evidence is essential for guideline development, we suggest the proper role is as supporting cast, not protagonist:</p>
<list id="list16-0194599812467004" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p><italic>Evidence as protagonist model</italic>. Some organizations publish “practice parameters” or “evidence-based reviews” as their primary quality products, having the literature search take center stage, with exhaustive evidence tables or textual discussions that rank and summarize citations. If recommendations are made, the strength is linked directly to level of evidence, sometimes with a threshold number of minimum studies of a specific level or combinations thereof, rather than an explicit consideration of benefits, risks, harms, and costs. Recommendations have uncertain validity because there is no systematic process to incorporate costs, harms, adverse events, uncertainty, vagueness, working group values, or patient preference. Moreover, recommendations become difficult to make when evidence gaps exist.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Evidence as supporting cast model</italic>. An alternative approach, described in this manual, is to drive guideline development with considerations of quality improvement, using the literature search as one of several factors that help translate evidence into action. In this model, the ratio of benefits to harms and costs is considered equal to, or even greater than, level of evidence in formulating recommendations. Action statement profiles are used to state explicitly how values, patient preferences, differences of opinion, and other factors were incorporated. Recommendations are still possible with evidence gaps, but strength will be limited.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Although it is tempting to exclude topics with limited evidence from guideline development, it is precisely such topics that may benefit users most because of uncertainty and conflicting opinions about appropriate practice. Even if evidence is limited, recommendations are still possible based on observational studies when benefits and harms are identified and lower evidence quality is transparently documented along with our confidence in it.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Using expert opinion or consensus to fill evidence gaps is entirely appropriate, provided this basis is explicit and transparent to the critical reader.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0194599812467004">16</xref></sup> Discussing topics with limited evidence allows guideline developers to highlight future research needs and suggest how to best fill existing gaps. The guideline as a whole, however, should focus on topics with high-quality evidence and avoid overreliance on expert opinion or clinical consensus as a primary decision-making strategy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0194599812467004">35</xref></sup></p>

<title>Literature Search Stages</title>
<p>Searching the literature is an iterative process that is best implemented in 3 stages.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0194599812467004">25</xref></sup> The stages correspond to different phases of guideline development and are discussed later in this manual. The 3 stages of searching (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0194599812467004"><bold>Table 1</bold></xref>) can be briefly summarized as follows:</p>

<list-item><p>Identifying supplementary literature, performed after the first in-person meeting</p></list-item>
</list>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>All search stages must be documented for transparency and reproducibility. Specific considerations include databases, time periods, keywords, subject headings, language restrictions, use of gray literature (eg, symposium proceedings), and selection criteria, such as filters, algorithms, or inclusion and exclusion criteria. A balance of pragmatism and rigor is required to avoid delays in the development process.</p>

</sec>
<sec id="section22-0194599812467004">
<title>Evidence Quality Assessment</title>
<p>Simply identifying reviews, guidelines, and randomized trials does not ensure quality, and basing decisions on research with weak design or flawed methodology may yield biased or invalid conclusions. Therefore, to filter out potentially biased or poorly conducted studies, quality assessment must be performed as part of the process of identifying evidence. Suggestions for assessing reviews, guidelines, and randomized trials are presented later in the manual when the related search stage is discussed.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section23-0194599812467004">
<title>Performing Systematic Review and Meta-analysis</title>
<p>An organization may find it necessary to perform a systematic review as part of guideline development if there are no published reviews or if available reviews are outdated or of poor quality. Systematic review is a rigorous and complex undertaking, which often requires additional expertise, resources, and staff support.</p>
<p>All systematic reviews should be conducted using a priori protocols that adhere to standards for the conduct and reporting of meta-analyses, as suggested in the PRISMA statement for randomized trials<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0194599812467004">36</xref></sup> and the MOOSE statement for observational studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0194599812467004">37</xref></sup> The Institute of Medicine has also defined rigorous quality standards for systematic reviews.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0194599812467004">38</xref></sup> Systematic reviews can be used to define natural history using placebo group outcomes and the absolute or comparative efficacy of interventions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0194599812467004">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0194599812467004">40</xref></sup></p>
<p>Guideline developers may use systematic reviews that have been previously published or performed concurrently. The most important consideration is that regardless of the review origin, it should be of high quality and meet reasonable standards for systematic reviews. Concurrent reviews may be performed by members of the guideline development group (with appropriate expertise) or by an external group or agency. When reviews are conducted specifically to inform particular guidelines, the guideline development group and systematic review team should interact regarding the scope, approach, and output of both processes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0194599812467004">12</xref></sup></p>

<p>The purpose of sponsoring organization(s) in developing the guideline should be specified and can be revised and updated as development proceeds. The purpose can often be divided into 2 distinct but related components:</p>
<list id="list23-0194599812467004" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Objective (ie, general) goals that implementation of the guideline are intended to bring about</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Rationale, that is, reasons for developing recommendations, including why the guideline is needed (eg, evidence of practice variation or inappropriate practice)</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Here is an example of how the purpose was stated in the AAO-HNSF guideline on tonsillectomy in children: “The primary purpose of this guideline is to provide clinicians with evidence-based guidance in identifying children who are the best candidates for tonsillectomy. Secondary objectives are to optimize the perioperative management of children undergoing tonsillectomy, emphasize the need for evaluation and intervention in special populations, improve counseling and education of families of children who are considering tonsillectomy for their child, highlight the management options for patients with modifying factors, and reduce inappropriate or unnecessary variations in care.”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0194599812467004">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>As another example, consider this statement of purpose from the AAO-HNSF guideline on sudden hearing loss: “The purpose of this guideline is to provide clinicians with evidence-based recommendations in evaluating patients with sudden hearing loss (SHL), with a particular emphasis on managing sudden sensorineural hearing loss (SSNHL). The panel recognized that patients enter the healthcare system with SHL as a nonspecific, primary complaint. Therefore, the initial recommendations of the guideline deal with efficiently distinguishing SSNHL from other causes of SHL at the time of presentation. By focusing on opportunities for quality improvement, the guideline should improve diagnostic accuracy, facilitate prompt intervention, decrease variations in management, reduce unnecessary tests and imaging procedures, and improve hearing and rehabilitative outcomes for affected patients.”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0194599812467004">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>After the guideline purpose has been discussed, the consultant provides a very brief overview of development methodology. Points worthy of emphasis include the following:</p>
<list id="list24-0194599812467004" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>The guideline will be developed using an explicit, evidence-based process that is consistent with current standards for trustworthy guidelines and follows a published, a priori protocol.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The published guideline will meet or exceed reporting standards defined by the COGS statement and AGREE instrument.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0194599812467004">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0194599812467004">20</xref></sup></p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The process will involve 3 conference calls and 2 in-person meetings.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The goal is to produce a document with key action statements for clinicians, highlighting the key areas of behavior change and quality improvement defined by the guideline development group that address the stated purpose.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The guideline will incorporate about 10 to 18 key action statements, each of which is followed by a summary action statement profile and supporting text on why the statement is made and how the recommendation may be carried out. Each key action statement will have an associated strength of recommendation based on the quality and consistency of supporting evidence plus a consideration of the benefit-harm relationship for any interventions.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The document will conclude with implementation considerations and recommendations for future research. In addition, a reference will be made as to when the guideline will be updated in the future.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>The detailed methodology for classifying recommendations <italic>should not</italic> be discussed at this time to avoid an unnecessary tangent. Instead, this is optimally discussed before classifications are made at the first in-person meeting. Members who want additional details can be referred to subsequent sections in this manual.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0194599812467004">21</xref></sup></p>

</sec>
<sec id="section35-0194599812467004">
<title>Discuss Conflicts of Interest</title>
<p>Group members are directed to the contact list, which was prepared by the staff lead in advance of the call and includes potential financial and intellectual COIs that have been declared by the development group. The group will then decide if any particular relationships are significant enough to preclude participation of any individual(s) from further service in the guideline development group. Relationships should be thoroughly documented and included in the guideline manuscript.</p>
<p>Since more than 80% of guideline authors, in general, have potential COIs, the existence of a relationship alone is not sufficient to preclude participation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0194599812467004">42</xref></sup> At the AAO-HNSF, they are excluded only if the nature of the relationship is considered by the group to interfere with objective participation. On the basis of the nature of the disclosed relationship, a member may be asked to not participate in a specific section of the guideline where a conflict may produce bias.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section36-0194599812467004">
<title>Determine Guideline Scope</title>
<p>A well-crafted guideline has a clearly defined scope. Defining scope will occupy most of the first conference call and may require a second for completion. Inexperienced guideline developers attempt to cover all aspects of a condition, resulting in a broad scope that will stall development efforts. The key to progress is a razor-sharp focus from the start, recognizing that some issues important to some stakeholders will inevitably be left out.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Clinicians may have trouble embracing the concept of a <italic>focused</italic> guideline with restricted scope and a limited number of recommendations. Instead, the desire will be to include a broad range of topics, similar to what appears in a traditional review article or book chapter. Topics deemed important by the group, but <italic>not</italic> accommodated in the guideline action statements, may still be discussed in the supporting text or in an appendix, provided it is clearly identified as based on consensus or expert opinion.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>An example of a clearly defined scope appears in the AAO-HNSF guideline on polysomnography for sleep-disordered breathing prior to tonsillectomy in children: “The guideline is intended to focus on a limited number of quality improvement opportunities, deemed most important by the working group, and is not intended to be a comprehensive, general guide for prescribing polysomnography for tonsillectomy candidates and patients with sleep-disordered breathing. In this context, the purpose is to define actions that could be taken by otolaryngologists to deliver quality care. Conversely, statements in this guideline are not intended to limit or restrict care provided by clinicians based on assessment of individual patients.”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0194599812467004">10</xref></sup></p>
<sec id="section37-0194599812467004">
<title>Define target condition or procedure</title>
<p>The group should identify the conditions, procedures, or signs or symptoms for which the guideline is intended. This may be a single condition or a list of potential target conditions, which could later be condensed into those that can be realistically examined by the group within its allotted time. A guideline can be procedure based instead of disease oriented. For example, the emphasis can be on “tonsillectomy” as a procedure instead of tonsillitis as an acute or chronic condition, or sore throat as a symptom.</p>
<p>Any diseases or procedures should be <italic>explicitly</italic> defined by the group. Definitions derived from publications on the topic can be used, if available, but a multidisciplinary group can often improve upon definitions advanced by an individual or single discipline. This is a particularly valuable contribution when existing definitions are controversial or unclear.</p>
<p>The definition of the target or procedure should be clear and concise (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0194599812467004"><bold>Table 5</bold></xref>). The definition, however, should be distinguished from diagnostic criteria, which are typically specified later in the guideline and have more precise and detailed information to guide clinicians.</p>

<p>Time spent explicitly defining the target condition or procedure may be viewed as unnecessary by some group members, with statements like “<italic>everyone</italic> knows already what is meant by ‘tonsillectomy’ (or some other topic).” A few minutes of discussion, however, will invariably show a range of opinions and definitions and, it is hoped, will justify why time must be spent on this important exercise.</p>

<sec id="section38-0194599812467004">
<title>Define target patient or clinical presentations</title>
<p>The guideline development group should specify the type of patient for whom the guideline is intended as precisely as possible. The target patient can be specified in terms of demographics, presenting signs and symptoms, past health history, results of previous diagnostic tests, or similar criteria.</p>
<p>Equally important as defining the target patient is defining clearly the types of patients or clinical presentations that are beyond the scope of the group’s analysis. One or more exclusion criteria should generally accompany the definition. For example, consider this definition from the AAO-HNSF guideline on tonsillectomy in children:
<disp-quote>
<p>This guideline is intended for all clinicians in any setting who interact with children aged 1 to 18 years who may be candidates for tonsillectomy. The guideline does not apply to tonsillotomy, intracapsular surgery, or other partial removal techniques of the tonsil because of the relatively sparse high-quality published evidence on these techniques and limited long-term follow-up. Similarly, the guideline does not apply to populations of children excluded from most tonsillectomy research studies, including those with diabetes mellitus, cardiopulmonary disease, craniofacial disorders, congenital anomalies of the head and neck region, sickle cell disease, and other coagulopathies or immunodeficiency disorders.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0194599812467004">9</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Here is another example of target patient definition from the AAO-HNSF guideline on cerumen impaction:
<disp-quote>
<p>The target patient for this guideline is over 6 months of age with a clinical diagnosis of cerumen impaction. The guideline does not apply to patients with cerumen impaction associated with the following conditions: dermatologic diseases of the ear canal; recurrent otitis externa; keratosis obturans; prior radiation therapy affecting the ear; previous tympanoplasty/myringoplasty or canal wall down mastoidectomy. However, the guideline will discuss the relevance of these conditions in cerumen management. The following modifying factors are not the primary focus of the guideline, but will be discussed relative to their impact on management: non-intact tympanic membrane (perforation or tympanostomy tube); ear canal stenosis; exostoses; diabetes mellitus; immunocompromised state; or anticoagulant therapy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0194599812467004">6</xref></sup></p>

</sec>
<sec id="section39-0194599812467004">
<title>Define the intended audience and practice settings</title>
<p>The decision about the intended users of the guideline needs to be made early in the process since it influences decisions about the interventions that will be considered and the audiences to which the language in the final product and specific implementation suggestions will be directed. <italic>Ideally, a representative of each target audience group or organization should be included in the guideline development group</italic>. Stakeholder representatives should also be involved in reviewing and pretesting the document.</p>
<p>Practice settings should also be defined since a guideline may be applicable only in selected settings (eg, rural, primary care, hospital emergency room, operating room, managed care, specific geographic regions). The working group should identify those settings in which using the guideline would be appropriate as well as settings where it should not be applied.</p>
<p>Here is an example of how practice setting was defined in the AAO-HNSF otitis media with effusion guideline: “The guideline is intended for use by providers of health care to children, including primary care and specialist physicians, nurses and nurse practitioners, physician assistants, audiologists, speech-language pathologists, and child development specialists. The guideline is applicable to any setting in which children with otitis media with effusion would be identified, monitored, or managed.”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0194599812467004">43</xref></sup></p>
<p>As another example, consider the definition used in the guideline on polysomnography: “The target audience is otolaryngologists in any practice setting where a child would be evaluated. Although the guidance was developed with input from other specialities, the intent is to provide guidance specifically for otolaryngologists–head and neck surgeons.”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0194599812467004">10</xref></sup></p>

<sec id="section40-0194599812467004">
<title>Identify interventions to consider and exclude</title>
<p>The group should generate a list of the clinical interventions (treatments, diagnostic tests, preventive measures) that will be considered in developing the guideline. All interventions potentially relevant to the topic should be included, with the intent of being overly comprehensive.

<title>Stage 2 Literature Search</title>
<sec id="section46-0194599812467004">
<title>Purpose</title>
<p>The second step in identifying evidence is to assess the quantity and scope of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) available to support guideline development. Recommendations for therapy are strongest when supported by RCTs or systematic reviews of RCTs, and a paucity—or surplus—of quality studies may affect group decisions.</p>
<p>The stage 2 search should be coordinated by the information specialist, with support from the staff lead, before the <italic>second</italic> working group conference call using parameters defined by the working group during the first conference call. Search results are reviewed by the chair and assistant chairs to eliminate irrelevant items. Remaining RCTs are organized by broad subject headings to facilitate group discussion and reference. A summary grid is compiled and distributed to the working group. The grid is most useful if some brief, descriptive information is included for each trial, such as sample size, blinding (open, single, or double), and industry funding (no or yes).</p>
<p>High-quality studies to support recommendations about prevalence, prognosis, or diagnostic testing are usually not RCTs and will not be identified in the stage 1 or 2 searches (unless a systematic review has been published). Evidence to support these types of recommendations is identified in the stage 3 searches that are conducted after the first in-person guideline development group meeting.</p>

A simple and efficient scale (Jadad scale) can be used to rank quality from 1 (poor) to 5 (excellent) based on (a) method and adequacy of randomization, (b) method and adequacy of masking, and (c) reporting of withdrawals and dropouts.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0194599812467004">45</xref></sup> A similar quality scale is available for randomized trials included in systematic reviews.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0194599812467004">46</xref></sup></p>
<p>An alternative to quality assessment is to determine the risk of bias. There is low correlation between risk of bias overall and quality scores (eg, Jadad), but risk of bias assessment better differentiates effect size estimates, with more conservative estimates for studies at low risk.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0194599812467004">47</xref></sup> The most popular risk of bias tool, developed by the Cochrane Collaboration, assesses (a) random sequence generation, (b) allocation concealment, (c) blinding of participants and personnel, (d) blinding of outcome assessment, (e) incomplete data, (f) selective reporting, and (g) other bias.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0194599812467004">48</xref></sup></p>

<title>Conference Call 2: Identifying Topics</title>
<sec id="section50-0194599812467004">
<title>Purpose</title>
<p>The primary purpose of the second conference call (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0194599812467004"><bold>Table 1</bold></xref>) is to refine and polish the concepts developed in the first call, particularly the scope and definition(s). The interval between the first and second conference calls should be kept short, ideally about 4 weeks, to facilitate recall and sustain momentum.</p>
<p>The stage 2 literature search is now available and will help identify errors, omissions, and exclusions in the earlier discussion. The call ends with a discussion of quality improvement opportunities that are used to form a preliminary topic list, which will be further refined and prioritized by electronic mail exchange after the call. The call is planned to last 2 hours and may be recorded.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section51-0194599812467004">
<title>Predistribute Electronic Materials</title>
<p>Documents should be distributed by e-mail and stored electronically prior to the conference call for review by participants before the call. Materials for predistribution include the following:</p>
<list id="list30-0194599812467004" list-type="bullet">

<sec id="section52-0194599812467004">
<title>Review First Conference Call and Timeline</title>
<p>Minutes from the first conference call are reviewed, with emphasis on the guideline purpose, scope, and definitions. Feedback is also solicited on the stage 2 literature search, especially from the group content experts, regarding content, organization, and possible omissions.</p>
<list id="list31-0194599812467004" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Decisions made at the first meeting are reviewed and updated. Revisions to the definition(s), scope, or purpose are discussed in detail until consensus is achieved.

<sec id="section53-0194599812467004">
<title>Begin Discussion of Topics for Key Action Statements</title>
<p>The heart of a guideline is a series of <italic>key action statements</italic> that reflect issues deemed most important by the group. Although there is no rigid guide as to the number of key statements, AAO-HNSF guidelines usually include 10 to 18 based on the guideline scope. Since each statement will require supporting text and an action statement profile, the number is limited for feasibility and timeliness. The goal is to achieve maximal quality improvement with a manageable set of actions.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Quality health care is ideally patient centered yet also accounts for the needs of the population. A useful definition of quality for guideline development is how well physicians and health care institutions fulfill their care obligations to individual patients and how well patients, physicians, and health care institutions enable these obligations to be fulfilled justly across the population. The goal is to improve desired health outcomes that are consistent with current professional knowledge.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0194599812467004">49</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The process for developing key action statements begins by asking the working group to suggest <italic>topics</italic> that represent opportunities for quality improvement within the guideline scope. A given topic may become the basis for a key action statement or, if deemed of lesser importance, may be incorporated into the supporting text of a related statement. Opportunities for quality improvement may be broadly summarized as follows<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0194599812467004">15</xref></sup>:</p>
<list id="list32-0194599812467004" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Promoting appropriate care</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Reducing inappropriate or harmful care</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Reducing regional variations in delivery of care</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Improving access to care</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Educating and empowering clinicians and patients</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Facilitating coordination and continuity of care</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Facilitating ethical care</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>After reviewing the above list with the group, the chair solicits feedback for quality improvement topics. The following points should help in moving the discussion along:</p>
<list id="list33-0194599812467004" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Begin by asking the group, “If we could only discuss a few aspects of this condition or procedure, what topics would we focus on to most improve quality of care and patient outcomes?” A related question is, “What should we focus on to minimize harm?”</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Additional topics may be gleaned from the literature searches. Examining the scope of guidelines and systematic reviews from the stage 1 search is often very useful. Similarly, the availability of randomized controlled trials, identified in the stage 2 search, is a superb source of feasible topics to consider.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Last, the group should review the intervention list from the previous conference call (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-0194599812467004"><bold>Table 6</bold></xref>) to ensure that no important aspects of management were omitted from the discussion.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Recall that the quality-driven approach allows all important topics to be included, at least initially, even if the supporting evidence is weak or limited. Although recommendations are facilitated by strong evidence, important topics with weak evidence may still become key action statements if there is a clear preponderance of benefit or harm. The group should focus on potential quality impact in selecting topics, not primarily on level of evidence.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Topic suggestions should be short and simple, emphasizing content, not structure. No attempt should be made at this time to create polished action statements. The topic list is often much longer than the eventual list of key action statements. All group members must contribute to ensure multidisciplinary involvement. At least 20 to 35 topics are desired, roughly twice the number of anticipated key action statements.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section54-0194599812467004">
<title>Compose Preliminary Topic List</title>
<p>As topics are suggested by working group members, the chair composes a simple list, assisted by the staff lead. The goal is to have a starting point for electronic exchange after the call that will refine and complete the entries.</p>
<p>A sample topic list developed from conference call 2 for a sinusitis guideline included the following:</p>
<list id="list34-0194599812467004" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Initial management of acute sinusitis: observation vs antimicrobials</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Optimizing diagnostic accuracy for acute sinusitis</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>What is an appropriate medical evaluation?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Antimicrobial selection for acute sinusitis: when to change, duration</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Indications for imaging studies (plain radiographs, computed tomography) in sinusitis</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Symptomatic relief for acute sinusitis, especially if antimicrobials are withheld</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Effectiveness and benefit of adjunctive measures for sinusitis</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Indications for allergy/immunology assessment</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Indications for nasal endoscopy in sinusitis</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Categorizing acute vs chronic vs recurrent acute: terminology issues</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Environmental control measures: smoking, environmental tobacco smoke, allergens</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Prevalence of antimicrobial resistance/resistant organisms for acute sinusitis</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Control of allergies as adjunctive therapy for sinusitis</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Preventing recurrent sinusitis</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Interpretation of imaging findings</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Patient education, information therapy</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Importance of identifying modifying factors or underlying conditions (eg, cystic fibrosis, prior surgery, immune deficiency, immotile cilia)</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Can sinusitis be managed over the phone (without office assessment)?</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Many of the topic suggestions for sinusitis were the basis for key action statements, but the final wording had little relationship to how the topic first appeared. Topics are best viewed as the raw material for deriving key action statements, which is the subject of the first in-person meeting. The purpose of conference call 2, as well as the subsequent electronic exchange, is to create a robust platform of raw material to assist the group at the meeting.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section55-0194599812467004">
<title>The Importance of Multiple Chronic Conditions</title>
<p>Despite the high prevalence of comorbidities and multiple chronic conditions, most guidelines are developed for individuals with a single disease, rather than for people with several diseases.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0194599812467004">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0194599812467004">50</xref></sup> Therefore, the guideline development group should explicitly address the importance of multiple chronic conditions as factors that might modify treatment, outcome assessment, follow-up care, or any other aspect of management. About 25% of Americans have multiple chronic conditions (rising to 75% around age 65 years), such as arthritis, asthma, respiratory disorders, diabetes, heart disease, hypertension, or mental and cognitive disorders.</p>
<p>Guideline developers should determine the most relevant chronic conditions coexisting with the guideline topic and assess how they might interfere with recommended actions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0194599812467004">12</xref></sup> One way to accomplish this is to include “modifying factors” or “multiple chronic conditions” as a topic or a specific chronic condition as a topic if warranted. Given the increasing prevalence of patients with multiple chronic conditions, guidelines should be explicit and transparent about the degree to which they were considered in formulating topics and how their presence might alter prescribed management.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0194599812467004">50</xref></sup></p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Despite the increasing prevalence of multiple chronic conditions, many RCTs frequently exclude patients with them from their study sample. This limits the generalizability of conclusions based on these studies to patients with multiple chronic conditions and decreases the level of confidence in the evidence as a basis for recommendations.</p>
</disp-quote></p>

<sec id="section56-0194599812467004">
<title>Moving from Broad Topics to Answerable Questions</title>
<p>Whereas a topic list, such as that shown above, is a useful starting point for prioritizing guideline content, the topics may be too broad and unfocused to generate meaningful questions that can subsequently be transformed into key action statements. As keenly observed by John Ruskin, “To be able to ask a question is clearly two-thirds of the way to getting it answered.”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0194599812467004">51</xref></sup></p>
<p>One of the best ways to craft an answerable clinical question is using the PICO format, which has 4 basic components: population, intervention, comparator, and outcome. These may be extended to PICOTS, by adding time frame and setting (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table7-0194599812467004"><bold>Table 7</bold></xref>). Questions may be framed under the broad categories of treatment, harm, diagnosis, and prognosis, and they may or may not include the optional components of comparator, time frame, and setting. The value of PICO-type questions has been established in evidence-based medicine, literature searching, and general librarianship.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0194599812467004">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0194599812467004">53</xref></sup></p>

<title>Ranking Topics and Assigning Evidence</title>
<p>The final topic list, based on electronic exchange after the second conference call, is made into a 3-column table. The first column, left blank, has the heading “Rank”; the second column, containing the topics, has the heading “Topic”; and the final column, “PICOTS Questions,” contains any PICOTS questions that have been developed to substantiate the importance of the topic and feasibility of creating answerable related questions. The order of the topics is not important and can simply correspond to the sequence in which they were suggested by the group.</p>
<p>The staff lead distributes the topic list to working group members with the following instructions, replacing the number “31” in this example with the total number of topics:
<disp-quote>
<p>Please rank the 31 topics below in order of importance for inclusion in this guideline by placing a number from 1 to 31 under the “Rank” column. Please use each number only once. Assign the number “1” to the most important topic, “2” to the next most important, “3” to the third most important topic, and so forth. Number “31” will be the least important topic. The table should <italic>not be sorted</italic> but should be left in the original order. In addition, please send any comments to [staff lead e-mail address]. Thank you for your time.</p>
<p>The scoping process often benefits from input beyond the guideline development group to ensure that important topics have not been overlooked. While the group is ranking the initial topics, the list may also be sent for review and comment to the organization’s board of directors, board of governors, the general public, and any relevant consumer or advocacy groups.</p>

<title>Understanding Key Action Statements</title>
<p>The recommendations in a guideline can only be implemented if they are clear and identifiable. This goal is best achieved by structuring the guideline around a series of <italic>key action statements</italic>, which are supported by amplifying text, action statement profiles, and recommendation grade. Unfortunately, recommendation statements are often not readily identifiable in published guidelines, and many statements are not executable as written.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0194599812467004">54</xref></sup> This section introduces the concept of key action statements, laying the foundation for developing the statements from the topic list at the first in-person meeting.</p>
<p>Clarity and precision in guidelines not only facilitate implementation by clinicians and patients but also facilitate incorporating guideline recommendations (eg, action statements) into decision support tools.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0194599812467004">12</xref></sup> This is particularly important when using guidelines as a foundation for performance measures, which mandate clarity regarding precisely what is recommended, the type of patient to whom it applies, and other details for specifying numerators, denominators, and programming rules.</p>
<sec id="section65-0194599812467004">
<title>Crafting Valid Recommendation Statements</title>
<p>The group must understand the purpose and structure of key action statements before they can begin creating them from the prioritized topic list. Key statements are action-oriented prescriptions of specific behavior from a clinician. As such, they should suggest <italic>measurable</italic> activities that can form the basis of performance measures or other quality initiatives.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Key statements are quality driven and propose actions that will improve quality of care. These actions include, but are not limited to, reducing variations in care, improving diagnosis/recognition, promoting appropriate care, avoiding unnecessary tests or interventions, improved coordination of care, and improved patient safety.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>An ideal key action statement describes</p>
<list id="list38-0194599812467004" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p><italic>When</italic> (ie, under what specific conditions)</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Who</italic> (specifically)</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Must, should, or may (ie, the level of obligation)</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Do <italic>what</italic> (precisely what actions)</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>To <italic>whom</italic>
</p></list-item>
</list>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Key action statements should be brief yet precise. The supporting text, which immediately follows the action statement profile, amplifies <italic>why</italic> the recommendation is important and <italic>how</italic> it is to be carried out.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section66-0194599812467004">
<title>Examples of Key Action Statements</title>
<p>Examples of key action statements from prior guidelines are listed below with the specific action requested in italics. These examples are <italic>polished</italic> statements developed after extensive discussion and not necessarily what was initially proposed based on the topic list.</p>
<list id="list39-0194599812467004" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Clinicians <italic>should administer</italic> a single, intraoperative dose of intravenous dexamethasone to children undergoing tonsillectomy.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Clinicians <italic>should not routinely administer or prescribe</italic> perioperative antibiotics to children undergoing tonsillectomy.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Clinicians <italic>should diagnose</italic> presumptive idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss if audiometry confirms a 30-decibel hearing loss at 3 consecutive frequencies AND an underlying condition cannot by identified by history and physical examination.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Clinicians <italic>should educate</italic> patients with idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss about the natural history of the condition, the benefits and risks of medical interventions, and the limitations of existing evidence regarding efficacy.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Clinicians <italic>should communicate</italic> polysomnography results to the anesthesiologist prior to the induction of anesthesia for tonsillectomy in a child with sleep-disordered breathing.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>All of the statements above apply to “clinicians” as the “who,” followed by the word <italic>should</italic> and then an action statement. The word <italic>should</italic> qualifies the strength of the statement and is replaced by <italic>may</italic> if the level of evidence is not strong or the harm-benefit relationship is unclear. Recommendations supported by consistent, high-quality evidence and a strong preponderance of benefit over risk, harm, and cost may occasionally be associated with the term <italic>must</italic>. Developers should understand the possible legal and reimbursement ramifications when using that term.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>One of the best ways to understand the “action” component of key action statements is to distinguish statements of fact, which are found in many evidence reports and practice parameters, from statements of action (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table10-0194599812467004"><bold>Table 10</bold></xref>), which are the heart and soul of a true clinical practice guideline. Only the latter can serve as a platform to implement guideline recommendations and develop measures to assess performance.</p>

<p>As recommended by the Institute of Medicine, we added “level of confidence” and “differences of opinion” to our action statement profiles. The level of confidence relates to quantity, consistency, precision, and generalizability of the aggregate evidence, which is distinct from evidence level. It is possible to have “low” confidence in evidence from randomized trials if the trials are inconsistent, have design flaws, and relate poorly to the guideline’s target population. Conversely, it is possible to have “high” confidence in observational studies if consistent, well designed, and applicable to patients covered by the guideline.</p>
<p>Differences of opinion among guideline development group members can occur with any components of the action statement profile. Mechanisms for resolving disagreements should be specified early in the development process, such as a member vote with a specified threshold for approval (eg, 50%, 70%). Any differences of opinion are rated as “minor” or “major” with an explanation of what occurred and how it was resolved.</p>

<p>Many rating scales have been developed, both for individual studies and for aggregate assessments. The AAO-HNSF originally used the scale proposed the American Academy of Pediatrics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0194599812467004">21</xref></sup> for its clarity and simplicity. The aggregate levels of evidence in this scale are best suited for statements about treatment but are more difficult to apply to statements that deal with diagnosis, prognosis, or harm. Moreover, the revised and updated levels of evidence from the Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine (OCEBM) assign greater value to systematic reviews (compared with individual studies) and to observational studies with dramatic effects.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0194599812467004">55</xref></sup> For consistency with the OCEBM levels and to accommodate multiple statement types (treatment, harm, diagnosis, and prognosis), the AAO-HNSF developed the aggregate evidence scale in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table12-0194599812467004"><bold>Table 12</bold></xref>.</p>

<title>Understanding Recommendation Grades</title>
<p>Although many different methods have been proposed for grading recommendation strength, most developers agree that determining the strength of action is distinct from rating the aggregate quality of evidence. High-quality evidence (eg, grade A) does not always justify strong recommendations, and recommendations—or even strong recommendations—may be possible despite lower quality evidence (eg, grade B, C, or X).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0194599812467004">57</xref></sup> The primary modifying factor in this regard is the <italic>benefit-harm assessment</italic>, as defined in the preceding section on action statement profiles.</p>
<p>The method for determining strength of recommendation (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table13-0194599812467004"><bold>Tables 13</bold></xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table14-0194599812467004"><bold>14</bold></xref>) developed by the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) is simple, transparent, and clinically relevant.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0194599812467004">21</xref></sup> Similar to the GRADE approach,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0194599812467004">58</xref></sup> the aggregate evidence level and benefit-harm assessment are the primary rating determinants. GRADE is more complex, however, and offers only 2 levels of action strength (“strong recommendation” and “weak recommendation”) in contrast to the 3 levels from the AAP (“strong recommendation,” “recommendation,” and “option”). The authors’ empiric experience in developing guidelines suggests that 3 levels support more flexible decision making and are better accepted by clinicians.</p>

<p>Using 3 levels of recommendation is supported by research into the obligation level conveyed by terms commonly found in clinical practice guidelines.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0194599812467004">59</xref></sup> Despite a large number of descriptive terms, the obligation levels cluster into 3 distinct levels: <italic>must</italic> conveys the highest obligation level, <italic>may</italic> the lowest, and <italic>should</italic> an intermediate level. These terms can be used to strengthen a connection between recommendation language and expected adherence to recommendations. For example, a “strong recommendation” carries an obligation of <italic>must</italic> or <italic>should</italic>, a “recommendation” an obligation of <italic>should</italic>, and an “option” an obligation of <italic>may. Should</italic> is the most commonly used term in published guidelines.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>The strength of recommendation is best viewed as a relative constraint on clinician behavior (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table14-0194599812467004"><bold>Table 14</bold></xref>). In general, less frequent variation in practice is expected for a strong recommendation than might be expected for a recommendation. The desire of many authors to make uniformly strong recommendations must be tempered by the reality of the evidence quality and benefit-risk assessment.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Assigning a strength of recommendation to a key action statement should be very straightforward after assigning an aggregate level of evidence and performing the benefit-harm assessment. As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table13-0194599812467004"><bold>Table 13</bold></xref>, however, when there is a preponderance of benefit over harm, the group may choose between “recommendation” and “strong recommendation” with level B or X evidence quality. Once a choice is made, the reasons should be stated in the action statement profile, usually under the “values” section.</p>
<p>To understand better how the strength of recommendation is determined by the aggregate quality and benefit-harm assessment, consider the statements below from various AAO-HNSF guidelines. In each case, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table13-0194599812467004"><bold>Table 13</bold></xref> can be used to cross-check the link between evidence, harm-benefit, and action strength.</p>

<p>Key action statements that lead to recommendations or strong recommendations are most desirable in guidelines, but options and no recommendations may also serve an important educational role. Options are helpful in addressing controversial aspects of management when anticipated benefits are offset by harms, especially when wide practice variation exists but evidence is sparse. A clear, systematic review and interpretation of the evidence, using expert consensus to fill gaps, may be very helpful to clinicians, consumers, and policy makers in facilitating decisions.</p>

<title>In-Person Meeting 1: Drafting Key Action Statements</title>
<sec id="section75-0194599812467004">
<title>Purpose and Organization</title>
<p>The goal of this meeting to develop a “straw man” draft of the guideline’s key action statements based on the prioritized topic list and the corresponding PICOTS questions. A consensus is reached regarding key statements, the messages to be delivered, and the order in which they are to be presented. Action statement profiles are drafted with the knowledge they will be revised at in-person meeting 2, when the group is more fully informed about the underlying evidence and other components of the profile. The template resulting from this meeting facilitates working group assignments to sketch in the supporting text and other details prior to the next meeting.</p>
<p>As one of only 2 in-person meetings during guideline development, the venue must be organized efficiently. One suggestion is to begin at noon and end at 2:00 <sc>PM</sc> the next day, with 2 working lunches and a group dinner. The noon start allows some members to arrive the same morning, and the early afternoon finish allows all members to return the same day. In between, there are about 10 hours of working time, excluding the dinner. This time allotment, combined with effective leadership from the chair and consultant, should be adequate for completing the meeting agenda.</p>

<title>Presentations by Methodology and Content Experts</title>
<p>The prearranged presentations on methodology and content are given at the start of the meeting.

</sec>
<sec id="section78-0194599812467004">
<title>Reviewing the Draft Introduction, Purpose, and Health Care Burden</title>
<p>The introductory sections of the guideline, composed by the chair and assistant chairs after the second conference call, are reviewed and discussed by the group for broad concepts, clarity, and consistency. The first 2 sections are based largely on discussions at the first 2 conference calls, and the content should accurately reflect group decisions made regarding scope, purpose, and definitions. Members should focus on identifying sections of the text in need of revision, clarification, or documentation but should not be concerned about the nuances of wording. There will be ample opportunity in future e-mail exchanges to wordsmith the final document.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>An efficient method of group review of guideline text is to project the relevant section on a screen using a projector and computer. The group moves sequentially through paragraphs of text while the chair, or his or her designee, makes corrections in real time. If a revision is complex or requires additional research, the need is clearly indicated (using track changes or a comment box) and can be addressed after the meeting by electronic exchange.</p>

<p>The productivity of the guideline development group will largely depend on the ability to interact in a calm, respectful manner that encourages full participation and open discussion. Although this may occur spontaneously, effective group facilitation is usually needed to ensure the right outcome. The guideline chair is the primary group facilitator with the methodologist and staff leads providing additional support.</p>
<p><italic>Facilitation deals with how the group approaches big concepts, identifies their learning needs, and remains on task to accomplish goals</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0194599812467004">60</xref></sup> Group facilitation is more about process than content, aiming to make the process easier and more convenient rather than provide definitive answers. A good facilitator strives to enable discussion, encourage understanding, ask open-ended questions, promote group dynamics (giving everyone a chance to speak), and provide feedback that bolsters the group. The facilitator’s role is not to dominate the discussion.</p>
<p>Some points to keep in mind regarding facilitation include the following:</p>
<list id="list49-0194599812467004" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Establish ground rules, which may be as simple as beginning on time, respecting each other’s opinions, listening to others, and debating, not arguing.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0194599812467004">60</xref></sup></p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Remind group members that they are representing a specific point of view or discipline (eg, primary care, specialty [or subspecialty] care, consumer advocacy, nonphysician providers, allied health professionals), not serving as the official voice of their sponsoring organization.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Encourage consumers and other nonphysicians to contribute since they may feel intimidated in a room dominated by physicians.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Beware of content experts and senior leaders in the field who may hold strong opinions and have significant intellectual bias that creates unbridled passion for contributing to discussions, sometimes to the extent that it drowns out other voices.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Defer discussions to a later time if an impasse is reached since progress is more likely to be made when passions have cooled and calm thinking prevails.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Remember that as the chair, you may be wrong when pointing out errors or inconsistencies; a healthy dose of humility is always advised.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Delegate 1 or more assistants to keep track of time to prolonged discussions that create a sense of urgency in completing the task at hand.</p></list-item>

<sec id="section80-0194599812467004">
<title>Creating a Draft Guideline from the Topic List</title>
<p>The group now begins the important task of creating a draft list of key action statements for the guideline based on the prioritized topic list. This is not an exercise in linguistic perfection but instead emphasizes a logical sequence of proposed actions that capture opportunities for quality improvement.</p>
<p>Keeping in mind the quality-driven nature of the process, the chair leads the group in deciding which topics on the prioritized list will be used to create action statements. Invariably, there will be some obvious choices that stand out since they are likely the reason the guideline was undertaken.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Don’t be surprised if the task of creating key statements seems awkward or chaotic at first; developing simple, but insightful, action-oriented statements is difficult, even for seasoned guideline writers.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Some considerations in selecting topics include the following:</p>
<list id="list50-0194599812467004" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Try to identify a few critical, “must-have” topics or statements from the list. For example, if the group could change clinician behavior or public policy only in a few critical areas, what would they be? If there is a perception that the condition is currently managed poorly, what should be done differently? Opinions may differ considerably, but some consistent items will invariably emerge.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Next, consider topics with high priority scores <italic>and</italic> supporting evidence that includes systematic reviews, randomized trials, or both. Strong evidence supports strong recommendations when the benefit to harm balance is favorable.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Include topics that can most influence quality of care, <italic>even if</italic> systematic reviews and randomized trials are not available. Recommendations may still be possible if benefits exceed harms, based on lower quality evidence or working group consensus. Guideline users are often most perplexed by clinical decisions that are not informed by high-quality evidence. Expert consensus about these questions can be quite useful, so long as it is clear that consensus-based recommendations differ from evidence-based recommendations.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Develop a logical sequence of statements that moves from broad concepts (eg, diagnosis, modifying factors, initial management), to more specific concerns (eg, therapeutic alternatives, use of diagnostic tests, outcome assessment), to concluding aspects of providing care (eg, treatment failures, recurrence, prevention).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Link topics that are deemed not suitable for a key action statement to the supporting text of related statements, thereby allowing the group to include some discussion of the topic without having to justify a distinct action statement and action statement profile.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Consider topics with lower priority scores that are nonetheless supported by systematic reviews or randomized trials as potential key action statements, especially when the volume of high-quality evidence is substantial.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>As each topic is discussed, the group, assisted by the consultant, should draft a rough version of a related key action statement. To facilitate this process, the AAO-HNSF uses the BRIDGE-Wiz software application, developed by the Yale Center of Medical Informatics, to support the working group’s discussions. The BRIDGE-Wiz application (Building Recommendations In a Developer’s Guideline Editor) uses a sequential, step-like process to guide the group in developing action statements. BRIDGE-Wiz requires the group to outline (1) when (ie, precisely under what circumstances), (2) who, (3) ought (with what level of implied obligation), (4) to do what, and (5) to whom. The “how and why” of the statement are covered in the associated supporting text.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>The most important word in a key action statement is the verb describing the action to be taken. Most guideline-prescribed activities can be described with a limited vocabulary of actions, shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table15-0194599812467004"><bold>Table 15</bold></xref>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0194599812467004">61</xref></sup> This list is not intended to be restrictive but rather to help the group in getting started with creating the statements. Other verbs can be used provided they offer clear guidance.</p>

<p>BRIDGE-Wiz is a standalone desktop application that runs on both Windows and Macintosh platforms. As a software wizard, it leads the user in real time, while working with the guideline development group, through the following steps for each key action statement:</p>
<list id="list51-0194599812467004" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Choose an action type from a dropdown list (eg, examine, test, perform, educate)</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Choose a verb based on the action type from a dropdown list</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Define the object for the verb (to complete the action clause)</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Add action(s), using AND or OR conjunctions for linkage</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Check executability (eg, is each action stated specifically and unambiguously?)</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Define precisely the conditions under which the action is to be performed</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Check decidability (eg, would users consistently determine if a condition was met?)</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Describe benefits followed by risks, harms, and costs if the statement were executed</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Judge the benefit-harms balance (preponderance or equilibrium)</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Select aggregate evidence quality that supports the recommendation</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Review the proposed strength of recommendation and the term for the level of obligation (may, should, or must)</p></list-item>

<list-item><p>Choose a recommendation style from the several options offered</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Edit the key action statement that is generated in a word processor</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Guideline authors should remember the intended audience and ensure that their guidance is applicable. For example, a recommendation that “patients should not be exposed to passive cigarette smoke” is only actionable if the intended audience includes smokers. A preferable statement directed to an intended audience of (nonsmoking) clinicians would be to <italic>counsel</italic> patients about the importance of avoiding cigarette smoke.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section81-0194599812467004">
<title>Ambiguity and Vagueness in Action Statements</title>
<p>Key action statements should be clear and precise to avoid inconsistent interpretation and prevent inappropriate practice variation. Having drafted a list of key statements, the group should review the list for ambiguous or vague actions.</p>
<p><italic>Ambiguity</italic> is present when a term can reasonably be interpreted in more than one discrete way.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0194599812467004">62</xref></sup> True ambiguity is almost always unintentional and readily correctible when identified. Examples might include interpretation of an acronym in more than one way (eg, LAD = left anterior descending, left axis deviation, and lymphadenopathy; MS might be interpreted as morphine sulfate, magnesium sulfate, or multiple sclerosis).</p>
<list id="list52-0194599812467004" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>We differentiate truly <italic>ambiguous</italic> statements from <italic>vague</italic> and <italic>underspecified</italic> statements. Vagueness is present when a word’s meaning is not well defined, lacking a crisp threshold in a single dimension. Examples include using terms such as <italic>short, febrile</italic>, or <italic>old</italic>, which are open to broad interpretation. Underspecified statements lack specificity in multiple dimensions, such as “sufficiently ill” or “severe asthma.”</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Modifying phrases introduce another form of vagueness. Examples include “it is prudent to recommend.” The passive voice is always vague because the essential “who” of the statement is missing. Similarly, asking clinicians to “consider” an action results in an unmeasurable outcome.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Sometimes guideline developers introduce statements of fact as recommendations (eg, “adjuvant hormone therapy for locally advanced breast cancer results in improved survival in the long term”). Such statements (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table10-0194599812467004"><bold>Table 10</bold></xref>) are not executable because the specific action required is never defined.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Although key guideline statements should generally be precise and unambiguous, there may occasionally be a need for deliberate vagueness or underspecification. Reasons for intentionally creating vague recommendations include the following<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0194599812467004">16</xref></sup>:</p>
<list id="list53-0194599812467004" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Insufficient evidence: the available literature has not addressed critical topics or the conclusions of published studies are suspect because of methodological flaws</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Inability to achieve consensus among the authors regarding evidence quality, anticipated benefits and harms, or interpretation of the science base (which should be documented in the action statement profile under “differences of opinion”)</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Legal considerations: unwillingness to create a potential legal “standard of care”</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Economic reasons: one approach is clearly best but may not be affordable</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Ethical/religious issues: for example, attitudes about the “the burden” or “futility” of care, premarital sex, use of blood products</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>An explicit statement of the reasons for writing deliberately vague recommendations can help users interpret and apply them, which is why “intentional vagueness” is included as an explicit construct in the action statement profile (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table11-0194599812467004"><bold>Table 11</bold></xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section82-0194599812467004">
<title>Refining the Draft Guideline Key Statements</title>
<p>The group should now review and discuss the proposed outline of key action statements for the draft guideline. Is the sequence logical? Have all major quality concerns been addressed? Are there any obvious omissions or inconsistencies? Do the statements reflect the concerns of all disciplines in the working group?</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>A logical sequence of key action statements is important for clarity and will also facilitate writing if later statements build upon concepts developed in earlier text. The order of statements can always be adjusted later, but effort at this time to ensure smooth, conceptual flow is time well spent.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>As mentioned before, the goal is not to have a perfect list of statements but rather to have an <italic>acceptable</italic> list that serves as a platform for moving forward with guideline development. The list can be revised as the process proceeds, but ideally the agreed-upon structure should be maintained. A draft list of guideline key action statements is shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table16-0194599812467004"><bold>Table 16</bold></xref>, based on the topic list for the hoarseness guideline shown in the preceding section.

<title>Define Supporting Text and Literature Search Needs</title>
<p>Following each key action statement, authors should write several paragraphs of supporting (amplifying) text that develop the rationale for the statement, present the underlying evidence (answering “why?”), and provide sufficient detail or references that members of the intended audience will be able to carry out (answering “how?”). It is important at this stage to remain focused on the recommendation statement and not to strive for encyclopedic coverage of the topic. Concisely stated guidance is more likely to be read and followed.</p>
<p>Although the text will not be written at this time, the group should discuss each key statement sequentially and outline concepts for the supporting text (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table17-0194599812467004"><bold>Table 17</bold></xref>). Ideas are recorded under each statement with the results displayed for immediate group feedback. The BRIDGE-Wiz software also includes a “comments” box on every data entry screen, which can be used to record ideas, concepts, and issues for discussion in the supporting text. The goal at this stage is define broad concepts; no attempt is made to create definitive language or statements. The supporting text, however, must thoroughly answer “why” the action statement was included (usually in the first paragraph of the text) and “how” it will be carried out (the remainder of the section). This is similar to the “methods” section of a scientific article in that enough detail should be provided for the reader (in this case, the guideline user) to reproduce or carry out the intervention in a clear and consistent manner.</p>

</table>
</table-wrap>
<p>Any topics or issues that were considered important by the group but were not chosen to be key recommendations can nonetheless be discussed in the text under a related key statement heading. By demoting a topic to the amplifying text, information can still be incorporated without the rigor needed to support a key recommendation.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Guideline authors need to be careful not to make substantive recommendations in the amplifying text. In contrast, they should be explicit about the evidence base, or lack thereof, for the actions proposed.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Before moving on to the next key action statement, the group must discuss the need for any stage 3 literature searches to support the statement. For example, a search may be needed to fill an evidence “gap” for a key action statement. A statement in the otitis media with effusion guideline reads, “Clinicians should document the laterality, duration of effusion, and presence and severity of associated symptoms at each assessment of the child with otitis media with effusion.”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0194599812467004">43</xref></sup> Since no reviews or randomized trials were identified to support this, additional searches were done on the value of documentation, in general, in ambulatory care settings. Two references were identified to support the importance and value of appropriate documentation.</p>
<p>Considerations in planning the stage 3 literature searches include the following:</p>
<list id="list55-0194599812467004" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>If the key action statement is already supported by systematic reviews or randomized trials, there may be no need for an additional literature search.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>If the key action statement is not supported by high-level evidence, or if additional information is required to answer questions posed in the supporting text, a stage 3 search should be planned. The group specifies the search parameters using a PICO format, which allows the staff lead to conduct an efficient search based on a predefined patient population, intervention, comparison, and outcomes.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Although the stage 3 searches do not require the methodological rigor used in the stage 1 and 2 searches, the staff lead must reasonably document the search terms and processes to ensure transparency in reporting. Additional internal or external staff may be needed to complete the searches in a timely fashion or work with the information specialist, based on the number required.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>One or more stage 3 searches may be required for the supporting text of a single key action statement. Parsimony and precision are encouraged to limit the search burden and keep the process as focused as possible.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>When a key statement is supported by multiple randomized controlled trials, the group should identify and assess existing systematic reviews or meta-analyses. If none exist, an internal systematic review may be planned provided that time, resources, and expertise are available. If an existing, but outdated, systematic review is found, it may be possible to modify or update the data without conducting an entirely new review.</p>

<title>Writing Assignments and Deadlines</title>

<p>Each key statement and supporting text is assigned a primary author, who composes a draft that is reviewed by a secondary author with complementary expertise. For example, a statement about surgery might have a surgeon and primary care clinician as primary and secondary authors, respectively.

<title>Stage 3 Literature Search</title>
<sec id="section87-0194599812467004">
<title>Purpose</title>
<p>The final step in identifying evidence is driven by the specific key action statements developed by the working group, which form the core of the guideline. These statements reflect opportunities for education and quality improvement, which may not necessarily be supported by existing systematic reviews or randomized controlled trials. Therefore, the stage 3 searches focus on identifying best published evidence to facilitate writing assignments for specific action statements and to subsequently assist the group in determining the corresponding action statement profiles and strengths of recommendation.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>As discussed in the preceding section, the group should identify the need for stage 3 searches when discussing the guideline topic list and composing the list of concepts to be covered in the corresponding supporting text.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The stage 3 searches should be coordinated by the staff lead, working with the information specialist, after the first in-person meeting. Search results should be grouped by major subheadings (eg, etiology, diagnosis, therapy, prognosis) available in standard electronic databases. Search results are sent to the group member assigned as the primary writer for the specific action statement. The writer eliminates irrelevant items, leaving a core of evidence that is distributed to the group for reference along with the statement that prompted the literature search.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section88-0194599812467004">
<title>Identifying Supplementary Evidence</title>
<p>Supplementary evidence can be identified by using PICOTS-type questions, which pose a well-focused question that can serve as the basis for the literature search.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0194599812467004">63</xref></sup> The rationale and format of PICOTS questions have been discussed earlier in this document, with examples in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table7-0194599812467004"><bold>Table 7</bold></xref>. Any PICOTS questions that were formulated earlier to support specific topics can be used at this time for the literature search.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0194599812467004">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>If a specific action statement is already supported by high-quality evidence such as systematic reviews or randomized controlled trials, additional stage 3 searches may be unnecessary. When high-quality evidence is sparse, however, a PICOTS-type question may be formulated for each action statement to facilitate the search.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section89-0194599812467004">
<title>Writing Assignments</title>
<sec id="section90-0194599812467004">
<title>Group Writing Assignments</title>
<p>Timely completion of group writing assignments is mandatory to keep guideline development on schedule. The staff lead and, if necessary, the chair should send reminders in advance of deadlines and monitor when assignments are completed. Delinquent group members should be contacted to ascertain the reason for delay and identify remedial action. In some cases, assignments may need to be modified.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section91-0194599812467004">
<title>Additional Literature Search and Systematic Review</title>
<p>The need for a search may only become apparent once the author assigned to write the text begins the task and becomes more familiar with the material. In this circumstance, the author may conduct his or her own search, with or without assistance from the staff lead.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Authors must take care with supplementary literature searches to avoid introducing bias. Search and filter criteria should be documented, regardless of whether the search is conducted by the author, staff lead, or both.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>If any systematic reviews or meta-analyses are required, they are planned with the group consultant or methodologist. This will entail substantial added effort because of the methodological rigor needed to produce a valid, unbiased, publication-quality systematic review. Whenever possible, guideline topics should be selected based on a foundation of existing systematic reviews, rather than attempting to create reviews from scratch. Sometimes, however, the need to create a review is unavoidable, and the project should be approached with realistic expectations regarding the time and effort involved.</p>
<p>Systematic reviews or meta-analyses conducted to support the guideline are conducted with an a priori protocol to justify publication as an independent manuscript. Attempting to incorporate the review into the guideline text is ill advised, because the reporting detail needed to demonstrate validity of the review will overwhelm the guideline with unnecessary technical details. Only a brief, readable summary is included, with external reference to the systematic review manuscript, which is submitted separately for publication.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section92-0194599812467004">
<title>Collation of Writing Assignments into First Draft</title>
<p>As the staff lead receives the completed writing assignments (by electronic mail), they are collated into a first draft of the guideline, using the previously described template (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table8-0194599812467004"><bold>Table 8</bold></xref>). The goal is to create the draft before the next in-person meeting while still allowing sufficient time for preliminary feedback by the group.</p>
<p>Prior to the second in-person meeting, the collated first draft should be reviewed by the chair to align ideas and concepts provided by the writing assignments, although editing may be necessary to standardize the writing style. Writing assignments are best viewed as raw material for composing the draft to ensure a balanced, multidisciplinary product. Authors of the original writing assignment will have ample opportunity to comment on any changes made by the chair in style or format for consistency with the remainder of the guideline.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>The effort required by the chair in collating the writing assignments should not be underestimated. The assignments are likely to vary greatly in quality, completeness, and punctuality. Consequently, the chair may need to revise substantial portions of submissions and fill in conceptual gaps not covered. Some groups use professional medical writers to collate and improve the consistency of submissions.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>When complete, the first draft of the guideline is distributed by e-mail to guideline development group members for review and comment. Using the “line numbers” feature of the word processor facilitates commenting by line number. The document is distributed as a read-only file (eg, pdf format) to prevent direct modification and force the use of comments based on stable line numbers.</p>
<p>Comments from the group are collected and collated by the staff lead, who then distributes the final list to the chair for incorporation into the draft. Strict accounting of responses to substantive comments is critical to avoid a situation in which the same topic is revisited on multiple occasions. A recommended approach is for the staff lead to create a 4-column table (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table20-0194599812467004"><bold>Table 20</bold></xref>) in which all comments received from group members are listed by line number. The “disposition” states how the chair handled the comment and will assure members that their concerns have been addressed.</p>

</sec>
<sec id="section96-0194599812467004">
<title>Reviewing Front Matter</title>
<p>The main goal of reviewing the draft guideline is to achieve a logical, consistent document that accurately reflects the group intentions, minimizing vagueness and underspecification. The goal <italic>is not</italic> to quibble over semantics, grammar, or sentence structure, all of which waste valuable time and can be done through electronic mail exchange.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>The chair, assisted by the consultant, must effectively manage time and the group dynamics during the meeting to facilitate steady progress and to ensure that a minority of voices do not dominate the session.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Begin by reviewing the guideline front matter, which includes information about purpose and disease burden. Since this was already reviewed once at the prior meeting, the process should not require substantial time. The document is revised in real time by the chair or his or her designate, and requests for additional information or fact checking are assigned for completion after the meeting.</p>
<p>Reviewing the draft guideline presents an ideal opportunity for identifying research and implementation needs, beyond any already specified in the writing assignment. Throughout the meeting, thoughts related to opportunities for effective implementation and future research are recorded:</p>
<list id="list58-0194599812467004" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p><italic>Implementation needs</italic>. One group member, ideally an assistant chair, is assigned by the chair to record implementation needs. Consider what exactly will be needed for the target clinician to effectively and efficiently perform what is requested in the key action statement. Examples include fact sheets, brochures, algorithms, visual aids, and videos.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Research needs</italic>. Another member, ideally an assistant chair, is assigned to record ideas for future research. As the group discusses supporting text, evidence voids become apparent, creating the perfect opportunity to decide what is needed to fill the void.</p></list-item>
</list>
</sec>
<sec id="section97-0194599812467004">
<title>Reviewing Action Statements and Supporting Text</title>
<p>Next, each key action statement is reviewed by the group along with the supporting text. The chair and consultant lead the discussion, striving for balanced input from the group and efficient use of time. The chair or his or her designate records changes to the guideline in real time, projecting the guideline for all to see and using “track changes” on the word processor to clearly identify what has been altered.</p>
<p>The following sequence is advised when reviewing each action statement and supporting text:</p>
<list id="list59-0194599812467004" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Read the key action statement to the group and identify any potential words or actions that are vague, underspecified, or unclear.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Skip any discussion of the action statement profile for now, since a more informed discussion can occur after the amplifying text is fully reviewed.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Assess the introductory paragraphs of supporting text to determine if they effectively engage the reader by giving an overview of the rationale for the key action statement and how following it will improve quality of care (the “why”).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Review all remaining paragraphs for content, sequence, and conceptual clarity. Is the purpose of each paragraph clear? Do the paragraphs follow a logical sequence? Did the writers cover all concepts in the original writing assignment?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Determine if the action specified in the statement is described with enough detail and clarity to enable a typical guideline user to perform what is requested (the “how”).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Consider the need for 1 or more subheadings in the supporting text if the section is long or if there are several discrete concepts that would benefit from segregation.</p></list-item>
</list>
</sec>
<sec id="section98-0194599812467004">
<title>Reviewing Action Statement Profiles and Recommendation Strength</title>
<p>One of the most important goals of sequentially reviewing the key action statements and accompanying text is to reach consensus on the action statement profiles (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table11-0194599812467004"><bold>Table 11</bold></xref>). Although the profile statements should be concise, at this stage it is better to be more verbose and err on the side of overexplanation than risk not being clear on why decisions were made. The profiles can subsequently be edited for brevity and consistency.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Action statement profiles are a primary means of promoting transparency in guideline development and must be developed with care and consistency. Additional time spent ensuring full consensus on the profiles will facilitate grading recommendation strength.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Once the profile has been agreed upon for a specific key action statement, the group reviews the strength of recommendation for consistency with <xref ref-type="table" rid="table13-0194599812467004"><bold>Table 13</bold></xref>. This should be very straightforward if the action statement profile was fully discussed. At times, however, the strength of recommendation does not “make sense” to 1 or more group members. When this occurs, the action statement profile is reviewed, especially the aggregate evidence quality, to ensure accuracy of the information and that no important evidence was overlooked.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>An accurate, explicit action statement profile offers the most compelling argument for the group to accept a recommendation grade that challenges existing biases and preconceptions. Special attention should be given to the aggregate evidence level and the descriptions of benefit and harms/risks/costs since these are the primary determinants of recommendation strength.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<sec id="section99-0194599812467004">
<title>Assigning a level of confidence to the evidence</title>
<p>Now that the guideline development group is thoroughly familiar with the evidence underpinning each action statement, the level of confidence should be estimated as high, medium, or low in the second bullet-point of the action statement profile (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table11-0194599812467004"><bold>Table 11</bold></xref>). There is a direct relationship between the level of confidence in the aggregate evidence supporting a prescribed action and the level of obligation that can reasonably be assigned (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table14-0194599812467004"><bold>Table 14</bold></xref>).</p>
<p>The GRADE approach offers a comprehensive method of assessing risk of bias (level of confidence) for guideline developers based on study limitations, imprecision, inconsistency, and indirectness.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0194599812467004">56</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0194599812467004">64</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0194599812467004"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0194599812467004"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0194599812467004">67</xref></sup> A simple adaptation is presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table21-0194599812467004"><bold>Table 21</bold></xref> that can be used by the development group to guide the discussion and reach consensus on the level of confidence for the aggregate evidence in each action statement profile. As the potential quality concerns increase, the confidence in the evidence decreases and should be rated as “low” when multiple, significant concerns are present.</p>

</table-wrap>
<p>When the guideline development group concludes there is “low” confidence in the evidence for a specific recommendation, a decision is required as to whether the aggregate level should be downgraded. For example, a systematic review of randomized trials might be downgraded from level A to level B because of limitations in the source articles, wide 95% confidence intervals in effect sizes, or unexplained heterogeneity (inconsistency) among the studies. Recommendations based on observational studies could similarly be downgraded if plagued by unclear subject selection criteria, loss to follow-up, and failure to consider confounding factors.</p>
<p>Conversely, a body of evidence with very high confidence may at times be upgraded if the group agrees it is warranted.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0194599812467004">68</xref></sup> The most common reason for upgrading the aggregate level of evidence is when a large or dramatic effect (outcome) occurs in high-quality observational studies, which is already incorporated into <xref ref-type="table" rid="table12-0194599812467004"><bold>Table 12</bold></xref> in the columns for “treatment” and “harm” (grade B, OCEBM level 2). Other reasons for upgrading include when there is a dose-response gradient or when all plausible confounding factors or other biases increase confidence in the outcomes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0194599812467004">68</xref></sup> In general, the group should only upgrade evidence when there is clear consensus that the action is warranted.</p>
<p>Any decisions by the group regarding level of confidence and its impact on aggregate evidence level <italic>must be clearly documented</italic> in the relevant sections of the action statement profile, including the “values” section, if appropriate. Since there are no precise formulas or any strict rules for rating level of confidence, the group is obligated to make clear the reasoning applied. Additional justification can be given in the supporting text as needed, especially if the decisions alter the final recommendation strength.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section100-0194599812467004">
<title>Determining the role of patient preferences</title>
<p>In contrast to the paternalistic approach to medical decision making that dominated most of the 20th century, the medical community and public are increasingly embracing shared decision making.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0194599812467004">69</xref></sup> The process of shared decision making is more properly defined in terms of a continuum, ranging from physician-driven decisions to patient- or agent-driven decisions, made almost entirely by the patient or surrogates (parents, guardians, family members, etc). The goal of shared decision making is to ensure consistency with the patient’s wishes and values.</p>
<p>For some guideline action statements, where the evidence base demonstrates clear and convincing benefit (eg, a strong recommendation), the role of patient preference is diminished. Nonetheless, clinicians should provide patients with clear and comprehensible information on the benefits to facilitate patient understanding, adherence to therapy, and improved outcomes. In cases where evidence is weak or benefits unclear (eg, an option), the role of patient preference is typically large, necessitating a collaborative effort between the clinician and an informed patient. Factors that might influence patient preference include (but are not limited to) absolute benefits (numbers needed to treat), adverse effects (number needed to harm), cost of drugs or procedures, and frequency and duration of treatment.</p>
<p>The anticipated role of patient preferences is rated as small, moderate, or large in each action statement profile. Input from the consumer representatives on the guideline development group is often extremely helpful in reaching consensus regarding the appropriate rating. A useful perspective on shared decision making is found in the Salzburg Statement,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0194599812467004">70</xref></sup> which calls on clinicians to</p>

This approach often highlights areas that may be missed otherwise. The staff lead then reconciles any differences between the 2 reviews, and the eGLIA tool generates a report highlighting all potential barriers for implementation.</p>
<p>The following examples illustrate how feedback from the GLIA assessment identifies areas for improvement in guideline statements. In each case, the specific key action statement under analysis is stated followed by the general and specific areas of concern:</p>

<title>Conference Call 3: Ensuring Implementability</title>
<p>The purpose of this call is to review the guideline appraisal report, address any deficiencies identified, and plan for external peer review. In advance of the call, the guideline appraisal report should be distributed to group members.</p>
<list id="list70-0194599812467004" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>The section of the report focusing on the global dimensions is reviewed and discussed. If any deficiencies were noted, they are discussed and corrected if necessary.</p></list-item>

</list>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Now is <italic>not</italic> the time for major changes in the structure or order of key action statements unless the GLIA report identifies a serious deficiency that requires corrective action. The group should focus on remedying barriers to implementation identified in the report, without revisiting peripheral issues. If the conversation does digress, often the action statement profiles can be used as “organizational memory” as to why earlier decisions were made.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Suggestions are next solicited for external peer reviewers to review the draft guideline. Peer reviewers should represent the intended target audience and practice settings, and they are selected with input from the chair, working group members, Academy committee chairs, specialty leaders, and others.</p>
<p>Soliciting peer reviewers may take up to 6 weeks. The staff lead is responsible for contacting the organizations previously identified and gathering the names and contact details of all reviewers. In addition, the staff lead must ensure that each reviewer completes a conflict of interest disclosure form prior to distribution of the guideline. The guideline’s chair, assistant chair, and consultant should be made aware of any potential conflicts of reviewers.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>External, multidisciplinary peer review is essential to ensure guideline clarity and anticipate concerns or objections before the document is published. Several reviewers are solicited from each discipline involved in the guideline to increase the chance of comprehensive feedback. Typically, as many as 25 to 35 reviewers are solicited.</p>

<sec id="section111-0194599812467004">
<title>External Review of Draft Guideline</title>
<p>Independent, external peer review of a guideline is a critical aspect of development. Existing guideline processes have been criticized as biased, self-promoting, and exempt from accepted procedures for scientific publication and editorial peer review.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0194599812467004">74</xref></sup> The implementability assessment described in the preceding section promotes clarity of action but does not address whether the recommended actions are appropriate and meaningful in the first place. This latter concern is the subject of multidisciplinary peer review as described in this section.</p>
<p>A final draft of the guideline is prepared using the “line numbers” feature of the word processor to insert continuous line numbers along the left margin. The draft guideline is distributed electronically to external peer reviewers with instructions to submit comments <italic>by line number</italic>. A strict deadline is specified, usually allowing 4 weeks for review, by which time comments should be submitted to the staff lead.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Distributing the draft guideline as a pdf file has the advantage of making it impossible for a reviewer to simply type changes into the guideline text (which will greatly complicate the staff lead’s ability to identify them). The pdf file also ensures that all reviewers use the same line numbers, since numbers may not match when different word processing programs or operating systems are used.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>External reviewers should be informed in advance that all comments provided will be vetted by the chair and assistant chairs, but there is no guarantee that every requested change will be made. Furthermore, unlike traditional editorial peer review, this is usually one-time event; the reviewers <italic>may not</italic> be provided with a revised document for further comment because doing so at this time is impractical and will create unacceptable delays. The reviewers are asked to focus on 3 main guideline attributes: validity, reliability, and feasibility:</p>
<list id="list71-0194599812467004" list-type="order">
<list-item><p><italic>Valid</italic> guidelines include all relevant literature, have explicit links between decisions and scientific evidence, and clearly distinguish and justify situations where expert judgment or group consensus is used to support recommendations.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Reliable and reproducible</italic> guidelines allow a knowledgeable peer reviewer to arrive at conclusions similar to those of the development group when considering the evidence.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Feasible</italic> guidelines are clearly written, are user-friendly, allow for flexibility in individual clinician decisions, and are suitable for routine use in intended settings.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Comments from the external reviewers are collected and collated by the staff lead. A recommended approach is for the staff lead to create a 4-column table (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table24-0194599812467004"><bold>Table 24</bold></xref>) in which all comments received are listed by line number. The comment table is distributed by the staff lead to the guideline’s chair and assistant chairs who complete the “dispositions” column, stating how each comment was handled and assuring external reviewers that their concerns have been addressed.</p>

<title>Organizational Board Approval of Guideline</title>
<p>Prior to publication, the guideline should be distributed for approval to the board of directors of the sponsoring organization(s). The procedure will vary based on organizational policy, but the process used at the AAO-HNS is as follows:</p>
<list id="list72-0194599812467004" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>The staff lead prepares and executive summary of the guideline that contains the (a) Introduction section, (b) Purpose section, (c) all key action statements with their corresponding action statement profiles, and (d) Implementation section.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The executive summary and full-text guideline are distributed to the board members for review, comment, and approval. The summary grid of external peer review comments and their disposition may also be included.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Because the document is based on evidence, any substantive changes requested by an oversight body (eg, the organizational board of directors) must be supported and accompanied by additional evidence. The oversight body should be informed, however, that the purpose of review is not to rewrite the guideline but rather to ensure that the guideline has been developed using approved methodology and that the recommended actions are clear, appropriate, and consistent with the organization’s mission.</p>
<p>Any comments or concerns expressed by the board are responded to by the chair, with input from the working group solicited as needed.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section113-0194599812467004">
<title>Publication and Disclaimers</title>
<p>The final guideline is converted by the staff liaison and chair into a manuscript that meets publication requirements from the sponsoring organization’s official journal. Ideally, the manuscript is submitted to the journal simultaneous with the organizational board review, which allows time for the journal peer-review process.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Although the guideline has undergone extensive internal and external review prior to manuscript submission for publication, it is advisable to have additional editorial peer review in observance of standard journal policy. It is important, however, for the editor and associate editor to understand the guideline development process and difficulty in making major changes at this late stage. Reviewers must also appreciate the multidisciplinary nature of the document (both in terms of development group and target audience) and avoid critique based on personal preference or experience.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Responding to the comments of journal peer reviewers must be handled delicately since many concerns are likely valid and intended to improve the quality of the work. The suggestions in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table25-0194599812467004"><bold>Table 25</bold></xref> should help in formulating a response and in revising the manuscript. In contrast to external reviewers, journal peer reviewers have the opportunity to provide additional feedback in response to a revised manuscript with point-by-point responses to the reviewer’s concerns. A sincere attempt should be made to incorporate most of the reviewer’s suggestions.</p>
<p>A copy of the chair’s summary table of external reviewer comments and their disposition should be submitted to the managing editor to document the external review and remain on file in lieu of traditional editorial peer review. Depending on the length of the document, the guideline may be published as a supplement or within the main journal. If the guideline is lengthy and published as a supplement, an executive summary may be prepared for publication in the main journal to promote awareness. The summary should contain condensed versions of the introductory segments, a tabular listing of all key action statements, full action statement profiles for the action statements, and condensed versions of supporting text.</p>
<p>Guidelines should be published with an accompanying disclaimer, created by the organization’s legal counsel, to set clear bounds on the intended use of the document. The AAO-HNSF adds a brief disclaimer to the abstract and a longer disclaimer to the end of the manuscript. Having a disclaimer in the abstract is advised because individuals without access to the full text may cite only the abstract text.</p>
<p>Here is the AAO-HNSF disclaimer text added to the end of the abstract<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0194599812467004">7</xref></sup>:
<disp-quote>
<p>This clinical practice guideline is not intended as a sole source of guidance in managing [topic specified here]. Rather, it is designed to assist clinicians by providing an evidence-based framework for decision-making strategies. The guideline is not intended to replace clinical judgment or establish a protocol for all individuals with this condition, and may not provide the only appropriate approach to diagnosing and managing this problem.</p>

<p>Here is the AAO-HNSF disclaimer text added to the end of the manuscript<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0194599812467004">7</xref></sup>:
<disp-quote>
<p>This clinical practice guideline is provided for information and educational purposes only. It is not intended as a sole source of guidance in managing (GUIDELINE TOPIC). Rather, it is designed to assist clinicians by providing an evidence-based framework for decision-making strategies. The guideline is not intended to replace clinical judgment or establish a protocol for all individuals with this condition, and may not provide the only appropriate approach to diagnosing and managing this program of care. As medical knowledge expands and technology advances, clinical indicators and guidelines are promoted as conditional and provisional proposals of what is recommended under specific conditions, but they are not absolute. Guidelines are not mandates and do not and should not purport to be a legal standard of care. The responsible physician, in lights of all the circumstances presented by the individual patient, must determine the appropriate treatment. Adherence to these guidelines will not ensure successful patient outcomes in every situation. The American Academy of Otolaryngology—Head and Neck Surgery (AAO-HNS), Inc. emphasizes that these clinical guidelines should not be deemed to include all proper treatment decisions or methods of care, or to exclude other treatment decisions or methods of care reasonably directed to obtaining the same results.</p>

<title>Dissemination and Implementation</title>
<p>Dissemination (raising awareness) is the precursor to implementation (affecting change) and begins with publishing the guideline. The guideline chair, working with the staff lead, should prepare a summary of newsworthy points from the guideline, which the organization’s public relations department can use in a press release. Embargo and publication dates are coordinated among all involved organizations.</p>
<p>Issues that should be addressed in the press release, or in other documents prepared for dissemination, include the following:</p>
<list id="list73-0194599812467004" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Why is the topic of the guideline important?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>How and by whom was the guideline developed?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Who is the target audience (eg, what types of patients, providers, settings)?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>What is the main public health message, stated succinctly and in lay terms?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>What are the key messages, and what do they mean for clinicians and patients?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>What changes in practice or health outcomes might the guideline produce?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Are any barriers to implementation anticipated?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>What gaps in care were identified?</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Dissemination may also include blast e-mails, postings, and links on the organization’s website; articles in the organization’s monthly bulletin; and podcasts at the journal website. The organization’s annual meeting is an ideal venue to showcase guidelines, which can be the subject of plenary presentations, miniseminars, or instructional courses.</p>
<p>The implementation plan outlined in the guideline by the development group is begun, with necessary resources committed by the sponsoring organization or external funding agencies. Relevant brochures, educational materials, and continuing medical education (CME) produced by the organization should be updated for consistency with the new guideline recommendations.</p>
<p>The conceptual framework for guideline implementation continues to evolve and is being affected by new distribution venues (eg, tablet computers, smartphones, electronic health records). Strategies that have been used by guideline developers include short versions, patient (plain language) versions, recommendation summaries, algorithms, patient and caregiver resources, and attempts to individualize recommendations to specific patient needs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0194599812467004">75</xref></sup> Manuscripts can also include links to illustrative videos and other supporting materials accessible online.</p>
<p>Awareness of the guideline is increased by ensuring that the National Guideline Clearinghouse (NGC) receives a copy of the final publication with appropriate copyright release to produce a summary document. Furthermore, each guideline should be submitted and referenced in the Guidelines International Network (G-I-N) to support further dissemination. Efforts to create performance measures based on the guideline should be planned when appropriate and are facilitated by clear action-oriented recommendations supported by high-quality evidence.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>In general, performance measures are likely to be most valid when built around strong recommendations and recommendations, where the benefit-risk deliberation shows a preponderance of one or the other, and good quality evidence supports the policy.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Performance measures are <italic>unlikely</italic> to be valuable if built around (1) statements that are vague or underspecified; (2) recommendations where anticipated benefit is balanced by anticipated risk, harm, and cost; or (3) recommendations are based on evidence that may change.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section115-0194599812467004">
<title>Update</title>
<p>Guidelines should describe how and when the need for an update will be assessed. Situations that might require clinical guidelines to be updated include the following<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0194599812467004">76</xref></sup>:</p>
<list id="list74-0194599812467004" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Changes in evidence that bear on the existing benefits and harms of interventions</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Changes in outcomes considered important</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Changes in available interventions</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Changes in evidence that current practice is optimal</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Changes in values placed on outcomes</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Changes in resources available for health care</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>The AAO-HNSF guidelines are updated at a minimum of 5 years after publication. An earlier update may take place if any of the situations previously noted becomes apparent.</p>
<p>The first stage of the update process is to convene a guideline update group. This should consist of a chair, assistant chair, a methodology consult, and between 2 and 5 content experts. The members can be identified from the original guideline panel, those with previous guideline experience, and AAO-HNS members such as those from content committees.</p>
<p>Prior to the guideline update group reviewing the original guideline, an executive summary is distributed to a small group of external reviewers for their feedback. Between 5 and 10 reviewers are sought, and they should include representatives from AAO-HNS content committees, the AAO-HNS Board of Governors, subspecialty society members, other pertinent disciplines, and consumer advocacy groups. The executive summary should include the original guideline’s introduction and purpose sections along with each of the guideline’s key action statements and respective action statement profiles.</p>
<p>Reviewers are asked to complete a summary grid, review each key action statement, and provide a suggested disposition (keep as is, keep but modify, or discard). They also identify any new or pertinent evidence and submit additional quality improvement opportunities, not addressed in the original guideline, for which new action statements could be developed. An example of the summary table used for the update of one key action statement from the acute otitis externa guideline is provided in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table26-0194599812467004"><bold>Table 26</bold></xref>.</p>

<p>In addition to the external review, a literature search should be performed to identify new randomized control trials, systematic reviews, and clinical practice guidelines published since the guideline’s release. Ideally, as with previous literature searches, an information specialist should be identified to coordinate the search.</p>
<p>The guideline update group should convene via conference call to review the original guideline’s key action statements, the feedback provided by reviewers, and the results of the literature search. The conference call should proceed by carefully reviewing each of the guideline’s key action statements to determine if a revision is required. In some cases, an original key action statement may no longer be relevant or may have become redundant and be removed from the guideline. In addition, the guideline update group should discuss any quality improvement opportunities that were submitted during the review process and decide if any new action statements should be added during the guideline update.</p>
<p>At this point, the group should determine the extent of the update required. In addition, the composition of the group should be reassessed based on the planned extent of the update. There are 3 different levels of update:</p>
<list id="list75-0194599812467004" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Reaffirmation, if no significant changes are required. Working by conference call, the guideline development group prepares a brief statement for publication in the organization’s journal stating how the group reached this decision and the length of the reaffirmation (guidelines may only be reaffirmed once).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Minor update, if revisions to the key action statements are required that do not substantively change the conclusions or recommendations. The guideline development group convenes for 1 or more conference calls followed by a 1-day, in-person meeting.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Major update, if revisions that substantively change recommendations or include new key action statements are required. The guideline development group convenes for 1 or more conference calls followed by a 1- or 2-day, in-person meeting.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Any new key action statements will be developed with the methodology previously described; this includes the use of BRIDGE-Wiz. After completing the update, the finalized draft will undergo a guideline implementability appraisal with eGLIA. Any additional revisions to the draft will be incorporated after the completion of the GLIA assessment, and the document will be distributed for a further period of external review. Publication, dissemination, and implementation proceed as outlined in preceding sections.</p>
