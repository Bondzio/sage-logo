<p>The history of the military institution could come down to a myth, a great narrative, more or less believable until an extreme situation has seriously has shaken it — which does not mean it has lost all efficiency. As for the law enforcement forces, it is the story of an overloaded police institution, that had become the backbone of the state and the regime, has abused his powers and was broken. It is now one of the issues in the conflict between the army and the Muslim Brotherhood. [R] [First of a series of articles on “The Arab revolutions, an endless sequel”.

<p>63.1741 ADASCALITEI, Dragos — <bold>Welfare state development in Central and Eastern Europe: a state of the art literature review.</bold> <italic>Studies of Transition States and Societies</italic> 4(2), Nov. 2012: online.</p>
<p>This paper reviews the literature on welfare state development in Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) in light of the theories used to study advanced capitalist democracies. It critically assesses the extent to which different theories can explain changes in the welfare state during and after transition. Until now, two strands of literature have crystallized: institutionalism and actor-centered explanations. Institutionalists agree that welfare reforms are limited by the path-dependence of the national welfare state structures though this framework is biased towards explaining stability. Recent literature adds variables that traditionally belong to the actor-centered paradigm. This essay argues that the gains from such an approach are exceeded by losses in the accuracy and parsimony of explanations. [R, abr.]</p>
<p>63.1742 AFONSO, Alexandre; PAPADOPOULOS, Yannis — <bold>Europeanization or party politics? Explaining government choice for corporatist concertation.</bold> <italic>Governance</italic> 26(1), Jan. 2013: 5–29.</p>
<p>This article assesses whether changes in government choice for policy concertation with trade unions and employers are better explained by international or domestic factors. We compare patterns of corporatist governance in a strongly Europeanized policy domain (labor migration policy) and in a weakly Europeanized policy domain (welfare state reforms) over the last 20 years in Austria and Switzerland. We show that there is no systematic difference in patterns of concertation between the two policy sectors and that factors linked to party politics play a bigger role in the choice of governments for concertation. If the base of party support for policies is divided, governments are more prone to resort to corporatist concertation as a way to build compromises for potentially controversial or unpopular policies.

<p>63.1743 AGARIN, Timofey; REGELMANN, Ada Charlotte — <bold>Which is the only game in town? Minority rights issues in Estonia and Slovakia during and after EU accession.</bold> <italic>Perspectives on European Politics and Society</italic> 13(4), Dec. 2012: 443–461.</p>
<p>Post-communist transition went hand in hand with the European integration process. Much of the literature on EU accession focuses on the rational decision to implement a set of European norms into domestic legislation pre-accession. It is often concluded that once EU membership is achieved, states succumb their rationality and act on the basis of internalized norms. The paper claims that the past literature overlooks the wider framework within which policy-makers operate before and after the accession, namely domestic sovereignty over policy-making and implementation. Tracing the policy dynamics in the area of minority rights in Estonia and Slovakia, we demonstrate that the European integration ushered greater domestic control over policy implementation on minority issues in two states exposed to a heavy dose of conditionality.

<p>63.1744 AINSWORTH, Scott H.; HARWARD, Brian M.; MOFFETT, Kenneth W. — <bold>Congressional response to [US] presidential signing statements.</bold> <italic>American Politics Research</italic> 40(6), Nov. 2012: 1067–1091.</p>
<p>Popular and scholarly accounts argue that signing statements are important tools for presidents to shape the implementation of policy. Although signing statements might be important presidential tools, the legislative branch stands in the most immediate and direct competition with the executive for ultimate control of the bureaucracy. We assess whether congressional committees react to presidential signing statements with increased oversight. Using a data-set that includes every oversight hearing held by the US House between 1995 and 2007, we find evidence that congressional committees are sensitive to the number of objections raised by presidents in signing statements. As the president uses signing statements to object to a larger number of provisions in laws, the affected House committees respond with more oversight. [R]</p>

<p>63.1746 ALEXIADOU, Nafsika; LANGE, Bettina — <bold>Deflecting European Union Influence on national education policy-making: the case of the United Kingdom.</bold> <italic>Journal of European Integration</italic> 35(1), Jan. 2013: 37–52.</p>
<p>This article examines how education policies developed in the EU through the Open Method of Coordination (OMC) are received at the level of the UK. We argue that the UK's response to the education OMC can be understood mainly in terms of deflecting EU influence on the process and content of national education policy-making. We focus on three manifestations of deflecting EU influence on national education policies: (1) few organizational resources are made available for responding to the education OMC. (2) There is limited communication between domestic policy teams and UK civil servants involved in international work. (3) On a level of discourse, UK education policy-makers have remained committed to UK sovereignty over education policy and its role as a potential leader of education policy agendas in the EU.

<p>63.1747 ANNESLEY, Claire; GAINS, Francesca — <bold>Investigating the economic determinants of the UK gender equality policy agenda.</bold> <italic>British Journal of Politics and International Relations</italic> 15(1), Feb. 2013: 125–146.</p>
<p>There has been little examination in gender and policy research of the economic determinants of gendered policy-change. This article investigates, using graphs and descriptive analysis derived from three datasets, whether the agenda-setting possibilities of feminist policy actors pushing for redistributive gender policy are constrained by economic conditions. Our hypotheses are that it is easier to get costly gender equality policies on the agenda (1) when the economy is growing and (2) when advocates utilize an economic case to frame their arguments. We find that gender equality policy agendas in the UK appear to follow periods of positive economic performance and that economic framing of gender equality policy is essential. [R]</p>
<p>63.1748 AUSTERMANN, Philipp — <bold>Das Abgeornetenbild des Bundesverfassungsgerichts (How the [German] Federal Constitutional Court perceives the Members of Parliament).</bold> <italic>Zeitschrift für Parlamentsfragen</italic> 43(4), 2012: 719–726.</p>
<p>Ever since the Federal Constitutional Court was founded in 1951, it had to deal with the status of the Members of Parliament, especially their income situation. Its decisions strongly effect the Members' legal position. The remuneration for the Members of Parliament has been the subject of several proceedings. In an important key case, known as the <italic>Diätenurteil</italic> (“remuneration case”) in 1975, the Court decided that the “job profile” of the deputies had changed and had become a “fulltime-job”. Therefore the nature of the remuneration had changed as well. It was no longer seen as a non-taxable representation allowance but as a taxable salary. The Court also tried to answer other questions concerning the parliamentary mandate. In this and following cases it prohibited extra allowances for Members of Parliament with a special function in a parliamentary standing committee or a parliamentary party (with an exception for the President of the Parliament, the vice-presidents and the chairmen of the parliamentary parties). The reasoning in these decisions is however not very convincing. In 2007, the Court had to deal with the question whether other paid work at the time of the mandate is legally acceptable. It was not able to find a common position in that case but was divided into two “fractions”. [R]</p>
<p>63.1749 BÁEZ, Carlos — <bold>El fortalecimiento de la autonomía de los órganos electorales (Strengthening the autonomy of [Mexican] electoral institutions).</bold> <italic>Elecciones</italic> 11, Jan.-Dec. 2011: 61–90.</p>
<p>The article discusses the conflict generated by the electoral powers conferred on the Political Constitution of the United Mexican States (CPEUM) and the Federal District Legislative Assembly (ALDF), which arises with the appointment of the positions of chair adviser and electoral advisers for the Federal District. The author outlines the regulatory amendments that were made, the injunction processes that took place and ends by presenting the resolution adapted by the Supreme Court. The text delves into the analysis of the concepts of “independence” and “autonomy”. It argues that in the case of electoral institutions they are not absolute but relative concepts; it also debates vis-a-vis when electoral entities are independent. [R]</p>
<p>63.1750 BARNES, Lucy — <bold>Does median voter income matter? The effects of inequality and turnout on [US] government spending.</bold> <italic>Political Studies</italic> 61(1), March 2013: 82–100.</p>
<p>This article examines the relationship between economic inequality, electoral turnout and redistributive spending. I use the Current Population Survey to create direct measures of the income of the median voter to investigate its effect on spending and its relationship with inequality and turnout. In the fifty US states from 1978 to 2002, I find little effect of these direct measures on redistributive outcomes; nor do the individual characteristics of the median voter appear to mediate the effects of turnout and inequality measured at the state level. Thus I find no support for the contention that turnout affects government spending via increasing the political representation of the poor. In contrast to cross-national findings, across US states the income of the median voter is not strongly affected by turnout, but rather by other state characteristics. [R]</p>
<p>63.1751 BATORY, Agnes — <bold>The national coordination of EU policy in Hungary: patterns of continuity and change.</bold> <italic>Public Administration</italic> 90(4), Dec. 2012: 922–936.</p>
<p>Although EU membership generates similar functional pressures for national administrations, member states' institutional arrangements show marked cross-country variation in the coordination of EU policy. This article examines and assesses the institutions and mechanisms established in Hungary for formulating policy positions on the domestic level. In line with the general features of central government, the system is highly centralized and hierarchical, and has been characterized by a comprehensive coordination ambition from its inception. The case confirms the primary importance of national institutional factors for shaping coordination systems, but also the relevance of more actor-centered explanations for accounting for changes in the top decision-making tier. At the same time, the Hungarian experience also draws attention to power relations within governing parties and prime ministerial involvement as important variables so far relatively neglected in the literature.

<p>63.1752 BAUDNER, Joerg; BULL, Martin J. — <bold>The Europeanisation of national institutions reassessed: a comparison of regional policies in Germany and Italy.</bold> <italic>Comparative European Politics</italic> 11(2), March 2013: 201–221.</p>
<p>The article explains the differential impact of European regional policies in eastern Germany and southern Italy by focusing on the different domestic institutional settings and the competition between domestic actors for the position of gatekeeper in relation to the [EU] Commission. Despite similar exposure to European regional policies, the existence of “parallel institutions” in German regional policy proved to be the basis for an empowerment of the regions through the reinforcement of one institutional arrangement at the expense of the other while limiting change within the institutions. By contrast, the dichotomous nature of formal and informal rules and institutions in Italian policies for the south resulted in the exploitation of European regional policy by a national actor in order to drive through change in governance and administration.

<p>This article explores the democratic values underlying public services when they are outsourced. Building on D.H. Rosenbloom and S.J. Piotrowski's [“Outsourcing the constitution and administrative law norms”, <italic>American Review of Public Administration</italic>, 35(2), 2005: 103–121] framework, we examine whether and how administrative law norms — that serve as central democratic governance and accountability mechanisms in the administrative state — are extended to the new (private) frontline service providers. Through a study of the regulation of the privatized welfare-to-work program in Wisconsin, we find that new forms of administrative law are evolving in third-party government. These forms differ from administrative law as it usually applies to public agencies in several important aspects. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>63.1756 BEZES, Philippe, <italic>et al</italic>. — <bold>Understanding organizational reforms in the modern state: specialization and integration in Norway and France.</bold> <italic>Governance</italic> 26(1), Jan. 2013: 147–175.</p>
<p>This article examines the challenge Norway and France face in coordinating specialized government activities after ten years of comprehensive reforms. The focus is on the tension between territorial and sectoral specialization and between vertical and horizontal specialization. We describe both sector-specific administrative reforms and more overarching general reforms, looking at similarities and differences in the reorganization choices made by the two countries and also at what drives change. We argue that a combination of factors is required to explain outcomes. These factors include not only home-grown reforms but also sectoral challenges, diffusion and learning from abroad, adaptation to the financial crisis and budget deficit, and choices made by powerful political executives.

<p>This article enriches the comparative perspective of administrative reform policies by focusing on four interrelated dimensions: the choices of reformers, institutional constraints, timing and sequencing and long-term trajectories. [It considers] whether most similar administrative systems exhibit analogous contemporary reform trajectories in content, timing and sequence. By comparing the administrative reform policies of two “most similar” Napoleonic countries, France and Spain, this article analyzes the commonalities and divergences of decentralization, territorial state reorganization, civil service reforms and policies that focus on performance management and organizational design. It identifies the “causal mechanisms” that characterize the specific role of institutions and considers both the role of context and the importance of policy intersections. [R, abr.]</p>
<p>63.1758 BONGYU, Moye Godwin — <bold>The need to evolve from adaptive to anticipative administrations in Africa: an application of organizational theory.</bold> <italic>Cahiers africains d'Administration publique (African Administrative Studies)</italic> 76, 2011: 9–24.</p>
<p>In recent times, many African leaders (notably President Paul Biya) have been complaining about administrative inertness, but the reasons for this and the way forward have been given less focus. organizational change has become an indispensable, inevitable and prevalent phenomenon in contemporary world. In this paper, organizational theories will be used to demonstrate the adverse effects of administrative conservatism on African systems. Generally, due to inflexibility, these administrations have become obsolete, overtaken by endogenous and exogenous challenges and pressures. As a rule, these administrations have become superfluous, overloaded, unproductive and more liabilities than assets for development. Normatively, the African managers have to defeat resistances and provoke changes. To meet the challenges of change, management must be forward-looking; there should be constant foresight. the modern administrative system is supposed to be predictable before being adaptive. The African administrations have the imperative to be anticipative in order to meet the challenges of globalization. [R]</p>
<p>63.1759 BORGHETTO, Enrico, <italic>et al</italic>. — <bold>Italian Law-Making Archive: a new tool for the analysis of the Italian legislative process.</bold> <italic>Rivista italiana di Scienza politica</italic> 42(3), Dec. 2012: 481–502.</p>
<p>The Italian Law-Making Archive (ILMA) is a relational database that combines information on the legislation, legislative initiative, legislative processes, parliamentarians and government members and policy positions of parties present in different legislatures and governments. It covers a period that extends from the beginning of the 10th legislature of the Italian Republic in 1987 to the end of the 15th legislature in 2008. In contrast to commonly available data sources, records are non-redundantly stored in the database, are organized in different tables characterized by unique keys, and are linked to each other by relations, thus permitting scholars to extract, through queries on a specific web interface, only those data necessary for their empirical studies. This article presents ILMA and its main components. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>Are women and men, mothers and fathers represented equally in the German Bundestag? Or does politics remain a male-dominated affair and is that owed to the fact that most women have and raise children, which restrains their availability for the demanding time schedule of a politician? This question is highly relevant, given the current debate about a female quota for leadership positions in Germany's economy. A comparison of legislative terms before and after the introduction of a female quota by political parties shows that indeed the number of women increased, but mothers remain considerably underrepresented. The degree of underrepresentation varies between parties. In the CDU/CSU and FDP it has increased significantly. However, a mother quota has potential advantages and disadvantages which are discussed. [R]</p>
<p>63.1761 BUCUR, Cristina; ELGIE, Robert — <bold>The development of the French executive: endogenous Americanization.</bold> <italic>French Politics</italic> 10(4), Dec. 2012: 389–402.</p>
<p>In the context of current debates about the presidentialization and personalization of politics, this review discusses the Americanization of presidential politics in France. Two specific areas are reviewed: the personalization of French presidential elections and the presidentialization of the executive decision-making process. The discussion focuses on a set of features that are usually associated with the US system, such as the relatively recent adoption of primary elections, the programmatic differences between presidential candidates and their parties, and their increasingly centrist policies. By contextualizing this analysis within the development of the Fifth Republic, we emphasize the endogenous roots of the apparently Americanized practices of the French executive and their full adaptation to the French institutional context.

[Résumé en français]</p>
<p>This article shows [how] a body of knowledge that originated in the US — applied epidemiology — was successfully institutionalized in France initially by a private training structure intended for health professionals. The Institute for the Development of Applied Epidemiology [was] backed by a coalition that included marginal actors within the state, a private foundation, and an American agency. The reform of the French “health state” took on specific features in this case. Its initial model was that of American philanthropic foundations. It then took concrete form as an agency, the National Public Health Network, which made it possible for knowledge to penetrate public policy decision-making circles. The agency framework allowed for acclimatization prior to institutionalization and bureaucratization in the context of a formal public administrative body: the National Institute of Health Surveillance.

<p>The operation of the systems of competence-sharing in federal states, in their various forms, usually leads to a progressive expansion of federal jurisdiction over previously shared matters, with the consequent reduction (and sometimes elimination) of the power of component units. Germany has not been an exception to this rule, and therefore for decades the <italic>Länder</italic> had been demanding a reform of concurrent and framework competences. After various constitutional reforms that failed to change the initial distribution and forced the Constitutional Court to establish limits on the expansiveness of the Federation, the 2006 constitutional reform introduced a new system of competence-sharing that enabled the <italic>Länder</italic> to deviate from previous divergence from that of the Federation.

<p>With the increasing use of the oceans and coastal areas, there is a need to pay greater attention to and re-examine the issue of ocean governance. Through comparing the framework of ocean governance in mainland China with that in Taiwan in terms of legislation, administration, and law-enforcement, this article establishes that there are advanced practices concerning ocean governance in Taiwan and lessons that may be applicable for mainland China.

<p>Does federalism make a difference to policy-making in the area of family and domestic violence (FDV)? This article explores this question through a comparison of Australia and New Zealand, whose state architecture aside from federalism is very similar. It argues that Australian federalism has provided laboratories for innovative policy-making and the continual articulation of a progressive policy response to FDV. By contrast, in New Zealand subnational experiments have occurred, but continuous progressive policy responses have been less evident because centralization accentuates the need for left-wing governments to substantively advance the issue.

<p>We examine how the [US] Supreme Court learns from lower court decisions to evaluate new legal issues. We present a theory of optimal stopping in which the Court learns from successive rulings on new issues by lower courts but incurs a cost when lower courts come into conflict with one another. The Court faces a strategic trade-off between allowing conflict to continue while it learns about a new legal issue and intervening to end a costly conflict between the lower courts. We evaluate how factors such as the quality of lower courts, the distribution of judicial preferences, and the timing of the emergence of conflict affect how the Court weighs this trade-off.

<p>63.1767 CLOSA, Carlos — <bold>National Higher Courts and the ratification of EU treaties.</bold> <italic>West European Politics</italic> 36(1), 2013: 97–121.</p>
<p>Courts in a given institutional context are aware of the implementation costs of their decisions. Contrary to some interpretations of Higher Courts' reasoning, these have decided, in most cases, that EU treaties are compatible with national constitutional law. In cases on the constitutionality of EU treaties, a negative decision on a given treaty offers only two possible implementation options: either the treaty is re-negotiated or the constitution is modified. The most rigid constitutional revision procedures involve citizens either by means of a referendum and/or an intervening election. Therefore, and despite a significant number of appeals, Higher Courts have not ruled that EU reform treaties require constitutional revision for their ratification when citizens intervene in constitutional amendment procedures.

<p>63.1768 COHEN, Jeffrey E.; BOND, Jon R.; FLEISHER, Richard — <bold>Placing presidential-congressional relations in context: a comparison of Barack Obama and his predecessors.</bold> <italic>Polity</italic> 45(1), Jan. 2013: 105–126.</p>
<p>What better accounts for [US President] Obama's success with Congress: his political skills, or aspects of the political context, such as party control of Congress and public approval? We update the Bond-Fleisher-Wood (BFW) political context model through 2010. The BFW model accounts for Obama's success vis-à-vis the House, and, to some extent, for the Senate as well. This article argues that increasing party polarization affects the relationship between party control and presidential success differently in the House and Senate. In the supermajoritiarian Senate, greater partisanship diminishes the effects of party control — in other words, as party polarization increases, presidential success declines for both majority and minority presidents. A comparison with previous presidents facing a similar context reveals no evidence that Obama has won significantly more often than should be expected given the context.

<p>63.1769 COLE, Alistair; PASQUIER, Romain — <bold>The impact of European integration on centre/periphery relations. A comparison France/United Kingdom.</bold> <italic>Politique européenne</italic> 36, 2012: 160–182. [Résumé en français]</p>
<p>The core question is: has EU regional policy, interpreted as a form of Europeanization, produced policy change? What explanatory variables might explain such change, or resistance to change? These questions give rise to three main hypotheses to explain change: misfit, convergence and mobilization. The three hypotheses are “tested” with reference to two countries, France and UK. The research thus captures two distinct state types that represent contrasting liberal democratic poles and yet contain sufficient variation to allow internal, as well as cross-national comparison. The cases considered offer some evidence of inertia (the management of structural funds reaffirming pre-existing nation al patterns of center-periphery relations), some evidence of policy recalibration (in the UK devolved nations and the French regions), but none of policy transformation as a result of EU cohesion policy. As a more general point, structural funds policy is perhaps not the most appropriate instrument to measure policy change; from this survey, structural funds are an epiphenomenon of deeper explanatory variables rooted mainly (but not exclusively) in domestic institutional orders and change.

<p>Local ward boundary reviews are designed to equalize electorates within each local authority, thereby satisfying the requirement of “one vote, one value”. In 2010, this responsibility was passed to the Local Government Boundary Commission for England which has sought to engage with key stakeholders about the process generally. The main actors affected by this process are incumbent councilors who frequently find their own ward boundaries have altered significantly. Such changes may prompt some councilors to stand down before the new boundaries are implemented but others continue and represent new wards.

<p>Across Latin America, many former presidents have faced criminal prosecutions on corruption charges, with widely varied outcomes. As with an impeachment, law and politics intersect in the prosecution of a president. I examine this nexus by mapping the actions of agents who mobilize to influence how the justice system processes presidential prosecutions: first, accountability actors located in state-based institutions and civil society; second, partisan actors in the executive and legislative branches; and third, defendants, and their partisan and civil society supporters. This study argues that variations in the make-up, resources and alignment of these sets of actors fundamentally shape the trajectory of legal cases. Proceedings against three former presidents of Ecuador are analyzed: A. Bucaram, J. Mahuad and G. Noboa. [R]</p>

[Résumés en français]</p>
<p>Political science has been [asking] why upward-redistributive policies, which grant significant tax cuts to the rich, seem to be supported by a majority of the voters? Is it due to misinformation, political obfuscation, or a shift in the moral attitudes towards taxation and redistribution? Through an analysis of the French <italic>“bouclier fiscal”</italic> (tax shield), created in 2005 and abolished in 2011, we stress the major role played by symbols, narratives and figures in the evolving representations of tax unfairness. First conceived as a tool bound to protect all the taxpayers from abusive taxation, this measure became increasingly perceived as client-politics, especially after 2009–2010. We argue that in politics symbols may help frame public issues, but also lead to political weakness when reality appears to be too distorted from the narratives. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>Four African leaders died in 2012. This article explores the constellation of factors that together led to a constitutional succession after President B. Mutharika's death in Malawi, despite plotting by the late president's allies to circumvent the constitution and install their own candidate over Vice-President J. Banda. We present data on executive deaths in office since 1961 and executive transfers of power 2010–2012 in order to situate the Malawi transition within the broader African context, and draw especially on comparisons to executive successions that followed the death-in-office of presidents in Nigeria (2010) and Zambia (2008). We assert from these cases that constitutional provisions on executive succession are necessary in precipitating peaceful transitions, but also argue that periods of delay indicate that such provisions are insufficient on their own.

<p>Recent studies of legislative gridlock espouse the importance of institutional design in separation-of-powers games. However, few scholars have focused on the effects of the adoption of the US Constitution on legislative gridlock. This article determines whether the Constitution improved the marginal effect of the gridlock interval on the ability to change policy. Results suggest that policy is more responsive to the range of pivotal players (in both the negative and the positive direction) under the Constitution than under the Articles of Confederation, providing empirical evidence that it may be the superior design.

<p>A liberal paradigm shift from state to private responsibility in old-age income protection has been a general development across Western Europe. The financial crisis sheds new light on the question of the public-private divide in pension policy. Applying convention theory, the analysis reviews how funded pensions are governed and how states use a range of regulation to control their operations as they seek to convert market-related practices to social policy purposes. The article argues that accruing state regulation consequent on coping with the financial crisis and its aftermath has undermined easy distinctions between public and private schemes, and is generating increasingly technocratic and oligarchic forms of pension governance, to the detriment of democratic debate on pensions.

<p>This paper puts forward a strategic view of what South African trade policy should be doing in relation to the future global trading environment. The future is uncertain, but South African trade policy needs to be positioned for a continuation of the commodity cycle, and to exploit markets in emerging economies, including Africa, more fully. Simultaneously, it needs policies to spur labor-intensive services and manufacturing exports, both because these will be needed if commodity markets are less robust and because of their employment-creating potential. South Africa's current strategy, however, is inflexible, heavily focused on domestic concerns and is in danger of placing South African exporters at a disadvantage in accessing the growing emerging economies.

<p>Most political science accounts assume that governments in Western democracies avoid unpopular reforms to protect their re-election chances. Nevertheless, governments sometimes embark on electorally risky reforms — even in times when they have no slack in the polls. We argue that pursuing unpopular reforms can be a perfectly rational strategy for vote-seeking governments. Based on a simple game-theoretical model that compares strategic framing with the classic blame-avoidance strategy, we demonstrate that unpopular policy reforms allow governments to pursue gains of both policy and votes by opting for a highly visible strategy of reframing the substantive reform issue in question. This general argument is illustrated with the substantial 2011 retrenchment of Danish early retirement benefits. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>Executive agencies remain key players in UK government. However, reflecting their declining political profile, little research has emerged on the longer term evolution of this key New Public Management (NPM) infrastructure. Although widely cited, the “disaggregation-reaggregation” thesis — which posits that a significant reversal has taken place, following the extensive agencification of the 1990s — has received little systematic evaluation. As political interest in the agency model reawakens under the Coalition Government, it is necessary to understand how the agency landscape has evolved while outside of the limelight. Accordingly, this article examines developments across 1988–2010 along two dimensions: “structural”, relating to organizational boundaries; and “functional”, relating to the department-agency task division. Viewed within this structural-functional framework, considerable merit is found in the disaggregation-reaggregation thesis. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>The literature on [US] congressional committees has largely overlooked the impact of jurisdictional fights on policy proposals and outcomes. This paper develops a theory of how legislators balance the benefits of expanded committee jurisdiction against preferred policy outcomes. It shows why (1) senior members, and junior members in safe seats, are most likely to challenge a committee's jurisdiction; (2) policy proposals may be initiated off the proposer's ideal point for jurisdictional gains; (3) policy outcomes will generally be more moderate with jurisdictional fights than without these turf wars. We empirically investigate these results examining proposed internet intellectual property protection legislation in the 106th Congress. [R]</p>

<p>When even Germany's bold but unworkable decision to place a ban on the short selling of Eurozone government bonds and on the buying of sovereign credit-default swaps by investors who did not also buy the underlying bonds failed, a series of questions emerged. Which factors explain the markets' abrupt volte-face? Why did the Eurozone's unprecedented $1 trillion war-chest fail to placate the markets? Why did the problems of Greece, a relatively small economy, so quickly metastasize into a broader crisis, casting an ominous shadow over the 16 country Eurozone, and the EU? Which lessons does the crisis provide for the Eurozone and the EU, and what might be solutions to a crisis that placed into question the very existence of the European integration project?

<p>Laws against party-hopping are relatively common in the southern hemisphere.

<p>Through a comparison of federal Argentina and unitary Chile, we ask whether federalism explains subnational protections of women's reproductive rights. We explore two factors: policy jurisdictions under decentralization and party system territorialization under federalism. We find that, under decentralization, subunits in both countries enjoy autonomy in funding and delivering health care. Yet, decentralization does not explain why specific subunits comply with national policies while others deviate. We argue that federalism, in allowing party system fragmentation, makes subunit leaders more responsive to local concerns, especially when subunits vary in their principled opposition to or support for contraception. When party systems are centralized, as in unitary states, partisan allegiances better predict patterns of compliance and defiance. Thus, federalism matters for understanding patterns in the subnational variation of policy outcomes. [R] [See <italic>Abstr</italic>. 63.1649]</p>

<p>This article examines state-civil society relationships in contemporary Russia. It assesses opportunity structures of Russian NGOs that are intertwined with the state. It presents qualitative data from fieldwork in the Russian cities of Moscow, St Petersburg, Nizhniy Novgorod, and Perm in 2009 and 2010. The focus of NGOs in the field of disability was chosen because of their roles as social service providers and as advocates for the rights of the disabled. Despite the Soviet legacy of an occupying state, Russian NGOs widen their opportunities by maintaining close relationships with state structures. Thus, litigation strategies seem to be an effective instrument for fostering social change for the benefit of the disabled. [R] [See <italic>Abstr</italic>. 63.2185]</p>

<p>This article contributes to the body of the developing theoretical research in leadership and presidential studies by adding analysis of what I have termed “comportmental style” as a factor in leader/follower relations. Within institutionalism and the wider structure/agency debate in political science, one of the challenges as regards the study of leadership is to identify factors that offer scope to or else militate against leaders' performance. The comportmental style of N. Sarkozy (President of the French Republic 2007–2012), deployed in the context of the — changing — institution of the presidency, was a major factor in his extreme unpopularity, and contributed to his defeat in 2012. What this tells us about the nature of the changing French presidency and the role of style is discussed in the conclusion. [R]</p>

<p>“Best practice” in policy-making and institution-building for the deployment of grid-connected renewable energy (GCRE) can be found scattered throughout reports and policy papers of major international actors and in the discourse of policy-makers and business people. This article collects and systematizes a “best practice” model and portrays it as a sector-specific description of a liberal market economy (LME). Also, the article provides a comparison of China's policies and institutions for GCRE with “best practice”, finding that China's approach coincides with the latter only imperfectly. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>Claims concerning the death of the nation-state are often accompanied by post-nationalist arguments that emphasize the potential of human rights to contest nation-bounded conceptualizations of membership. Conversely, arguments focusing on the continuing importance of state-bounded social citizenship rights undermine such post-nationalist claims. To assess these claims, this article turns to the Irish state and its prohibition of abortion except in cases where the life of the pregnant woman is in danger. The authors focus on four legal cases that unfolded between 1992 and 2010. These cases reflect how specific women's social location within interconnected power hierarchies of nationality, gender, class, race/ethnicity positioned them differently vis-à-vis the Irish state, international (European Court of Human Rights) and supranational (EU) bodies.

<p>After twenty-five years, the federal jurisprudence of partisan gerrymandering remains a mess. The partition of the electorate through districting matters not only for its influence on who wins office, but also for its influence on important characteristics of democratic politics, broadly defined. Federal courts, however, have not explained what democratic values are served by an adherence to traditional districting principles. An account therefore is required of how the drawing of legislative districts affects democratic politics. This article examines three such effects: how the placing of district boundaries affects which issues become salient in electoral politics; the degree of conflict that ensues when these issues are taken up in democratic processes; and the specific forums in which such conflict emerges. This analysis, however, raises normatively charged prescriptive questions. [R, abr.]</p>

While “pessimists” focus on cultural and historical embeddedness of subversive institutions in Russia, “optimists” draw their attention to patterns of post-Communist state-building, and “realists” point out the major role of special interests groups in turning growing pains of informal governance in Russia into its chronic deceases.

As time goes by, the negative repercussions — in particular social and political instability, as well as the erosion of the Portuguese democratic regime — are inevitable if there is no light at the end of the tunnel.

To understand these commonalities and differences, I aggregate information from 231 books and 37 articles that review the history of American domestic policy in 14 issue areas from 1945 to 2004. The histories collectively uncover 790 notable policy enactments and credit 1,306 actors for their role in policy development.

<p>The paper assesses, in the context of European economic governance reforms, whether strengthening fiscal institutions will resolve the problem of budgetary imbalances in countries prone to the deficit bias. The central argument is that the commitment behind the institutional changes — signaled by the composition of fiscal consolidation and the role of external actors — is critical for the success of reforms. In order to examine this thesis, the contrasting experiences of Hungary and Slovakia are analyzed. While both have struggled with fiscal imbalances and eventually introduced far-reaching institutional reforms, these were successful in Slovakia while reversed in Hungary. [R, abr.]</p>

While the current debate is grounded in a need for balanced budgets and reduced deficits, long-standing unresolved legacies fragment arts and culture policy and leave arts and culture funding vulnerable to additional cuts. The normative implications for the role of the arts and culture sectors in a democratic society need to be considered. [R]</p>

<p>In response to the seismic events of 2007–2009, a consolidated crisis discourse emerged in Britain, a “crisis of debt” discourse to which the response is austerity and deficit-reduction; it is paradigm-reinforcing rather than paradigm-threatening. I consider the appropriateness of such a crisis discourse, arguing that an alternative “crisis of growth” discourse is rather more compelling and would point in different policy directions while generating different expectations about the effects of deficit-reduction. Such a discourse can be detected in the growing criticism of the government's austerity program, but it is yet to lead to the positing of a new growth model. I explore the implications of both crisis discourses for responses to the crisis, assessing the prospects for the return to growth under a new growth model in the years ahead.

Westminster was already very open and other initiatives have helped increase participation. Trust was badly damaged by the MPs' expenses scandal, triggered by FOI requests. The House of Commons' hesitant response to those requests revealed problems of corporate governance. [R]</p>

<p>Prior to December 2011, instances of widespread collective mobilization were relatively rare in contemporary Russia. Russian citizens are more likely to engage in a different means of airing grievances: making an official complaint to the authorities. This article considers how complaint-making, as a variety of political participation, may contribute either to authoritarian resilience or to political liberalization. The political significance of complaints made to the Commissioner for Human Rights of the Russian Federation is examined. Since it is the broader political context that shapes the significance of complaints, in the absence of meaningful elections individualized appeals to the state are unlikely to promote democratic change, although they may allow for redress of individual rights violations.

<p>Why did a highly redistributive, nationalized health care system emerge in the UK, where the Left was comparatively weak, while a more redistributively neutral, cash-centric, insurance-based system was pursued in Sweden, where the Left was strong? The explanation is two fold. First, in contrast to the Swedish Social Democrats, the weakness of the British Labour Party constrained it to pursue redistribution via health policy. Second, given the redistributive goals of the National Health Service, it became imperative for the Labour Party to construct a system that would be difficult for future Conservative governments to retrench. More generally, this formulation posits rational actors operating in the kinds of processes typically studied by historical institutionalists. The result is a tendency for a type of path dependence by design. [R]</p>

This is particularly visible in the People's Liberation Army Navy, where a more ambitious and confident maritime strategy is now being discussed. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>[Much] scholarship suggests that war, perhaps more than any other contributor, is responsible for the emergence of a distinctly modern presidency. Central to this argument is a belief that members of Congress predictably and reliably line up behind the president during times of war. This article subjects this argument to quantitative investigation. Estimating ideal points for members of Congress at the start and end of the most significant wars in the past century, we find consistent evidence of a wartime effect. The outbreaks of both world wars and the post-9/11 [2001] era — though not the Korean or Vietnam wars — coincided with discernible changes in member voting behavior that better reflected the ideological leanings of the presidents then in office. In the aftermath of all these wars, meanwhile, members shifted away from the sitting president's ideological orientation. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>Constitutionalization occurred in the past primarily by way of referential and jurisdictionally confined forms of approximation of constitutional transplants. The erosion of classical, government-related constitutionalism and the countervailing appearance of quasi-constitutional structures of governance beyond the nation-state have dramatically changed the original paradigm and, by implication, the conditions for the possibility of constitutionalism and constitutional modernization. The general phenomenon of displacement of constitutional institutions, principles and vocabularies is referred to nowadays as “transnational”, “pluralist” or “global” constitutionalism. The article inquires into the limits and shortcomings of constitutionalism beyond the state, extrapolating from the case study of an intervention by the EU Commission in a recent Romanian constitutional crisis.

<p>After gaining independence, the Azerbaijani government gave priority to its energy policies, aiming to manage its energy sources within the frame of international conjuncture. Azerbaijan first invited Western companies to the region to ensure that its natural-gas deposits will operate. [Then] it conducted research to build the necessary infrastructure to transfer the processed energy supplies to the global market. In this respect, the primary principle was to develop alternative lines while building transportation gateways. Following this policy, the government [protected] its position against dependency in the transportation process of its oil and natural gas over the neighboring states. This article deals with the process of Azerbaijani energy policy development and the construction of alternative energy lines and the multi-variable dimensions of its energy policy. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>This paper looks at the paradoxical creation of a Muslim minority by the Pakistani state to cast a light on the processes of secularism, citizenship and minoritization. Contrary to the concerns articulated in academic debates about citizenship and minorities, it is the majority that is managed most assiduously. Critically, these debates assume readymade groupings; this paper discusses how the creation of both a minority and a majority is an ongoing, fractured process. The creation of a minority group, the Ahmadiyya, from within the putative Muslim majority by the state in Pakistan, is thus a useful prism through which to understand the ways in which a specific kind of citizen has been created in Pakistan.

<p>Parity in gender representation on the bench is crucial if the judiciary is to reflect the population it serves. This article determines whether judicial appointments commissions, recently adopted in the UK, can increase judicial diversity on Commonwealth courts. Applying the synthetic control method to cross-national comparative data, the author finds that while the appointment of women judges increased in the first year after appointment commissions were established in the UK, any increase in the gender equity of appointments vanished soon thereafter. Not only does this result has important practical and theoretical implications for ongoing efforts to increase judicial diversity in Commonwealth countries, but it also highlights the utility of the synthetic control method for cross-national comparative political analysis.

<p>In Latin America's young democracies, actors in the private sector may influence military security work through resource-transfers, with implications for state accountability and democracy in the region. This analysis finds that in Ecuador and Peru local army commanders — who frequently decide when and where army operations are conducted — make decisions not according to technical evaluations of security requirements but rather on the basis of how much local clients pay. The article's local political economy perspective enables us to identify client influence, even in cases in which client and national security interests overlap. The study also helps bridge two literatures: research on Latin American civil-military relations, and scholarship on security privatization. [R, abr.]</p>

<p><italic>Prima facie</italic>, spectacular public events and large-scale capital projects are an ideal vehicle for “high politics” and the predilection of policy-making elites for grand, iconic and schematic visions that offer high-profile policy successes and historic legacies. Yet the prospective political rewards from such mega-events and projects must be offset against high levels of risk and complexity. Further, such schemes tend to be at odds with the modern state's deference to market-based mechanisms and its liking for instruments of calculation and control. Indeed, mega-projects and events often prove uneconomic despite the predictions of forecasters. This review essay considers how the bidding and planning process for the London 2012 Olympic Games demonstrates this tension between high politics, risk and the preferred methods of governing the modern state.

<p>This article presents the argument that frontline bureaucrats fulfilling their duties within an infrastructure bureaucracy can be understood as negotiating bureaucrats, policy-makers, and cousins to street-level bureaucrats. Empirically, the argument is based on data from an exploratory case study of a major road construction project in Sweden collected through passive participatory observation, interviews, and documents; the main source of theoretical inspiration is implementation theory and the theory of street-level bureaucracy. Working conditions, both similar to and different from street-level bureaucrats, are discussed, and patterns of negotiating practices are identified and analyzed. The analysis indicates that a fragmented implementation structure has effects on when and how negotiating practices are applied, and on policy outcomes, bureaucratic legitimacy, and political efficacy.

<p>This article focuses on the policy process stemming from European cohesion policy at the regional level and at its programming stage. It explains how the formally introduced EU “partnership” principles and rules work in practice in different political environments. The article argues that externally introduced procedural decision rules have different impacts on effective policy-making processes. In particular, we suggest that the patterns of social capital linkages carried by the actors involved produce different regional policy networks, even though the existing formal rules are similar. Relying on social network analysis as its main methodological tool, the article presents empirical evidence drawn from two similar Spanish regions, identifies the characteristics of the actors' social capital and compares the structures of the policy networks dealing with the programming tasks in the two regions.

<p>By focusing on the general ignorance concerning occupational diseases related to exposure to pesticides among farmworkers, the authors [examine] how public policy tools used to produce knowledge may paradoxically result in the obscuring of social problems. They rely on recent sociological studies on the dynamics of the organized ignorance. They complete this approach by stressing the underlying moral and political implications of this state of affairs. They demonstrate two factors contributing to the social invisibility of diseases brought about by the use of pesticides among farmworkers: the institutionalized under-recognition of chronic illnesses caused by certain forms of exposure to low doses of these toxic substances; and the under-reporting by workers of the acute effects of high-dose pesticide poisoning.

<p>The US Army's recent embrace of counterinsurgency warfare and nationbuilding complicates theories of military politics. For decades, critics declared the army too risk-averse, too parochial, and too insulated to change. How should we understand these recent, unexpected changes? I synthesize insights from historical institutionalism and American political development to derive a micropolitical perspective on institutional change. I investigate how the army developed its AirLand Battle doctrine after the Vietnam War. My analysis of recently declassified correspondence, oral-history interviews, and the writings of officers and experts shows how mid-level officers and external reformers were able to shift the discourses of army leaders and develop an institutional paradigm that endured for decades. Indeed, AirLand Battle influenced the Weinberger criteria for deploying American troops, and it shaped US conduct during the Persian Gulf War of 1991. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>In the wake of the recent financial and economic crisis it has been claimed sometimes that German economic policy makers lack economic expertise. By examining a sample of 234 Ministers of Economic Affairs at the federal and state level in Germany since 1945 as well as 73 members of the German Bundestag's Economic Committee since 2005, it turns out that the public criticism hits a nerve: About 27 percent of the considered Ministers of Economic Affairs and 29 percent of the committee members have neither a formal economic education (i.e. degree in economics and/or a commercial training) nor gained work experience in businesses before they received their political position. There are good arguments which hold that economic policy makers without economic expertise are rather unproblematic for the functioning of a society. However, citizens who wish to be ruled by economic policy makers with economic training/experience must hope that many other citizen/voters also have such a preference. If this is the case, vote-maximizing parties and governments would have to ensure that they fill political positions in the field of economic policy with individuals qualified in this field. [R]</p>

<p>Through analysis of the OECD's recommendations to reform Nordic public and economic policy, this article assesses the OECD's influence on Nordic politics. OECD recommendations are placed at the juncture of internationally acknowledged ideas and national traditions, thus being potentially useful for national policy-makers trying to deal with this tension. During the post-war period the Nordic countries found an original combination of international ideas and national traditions, involving a combination of economic efficiency and social equality. The OECD acknowledges this tradition in various ways but seeks to reform Nordic public policy according to a different, and in many ways opposing logic. Despite existing evidence of regime stability, it is not possible to exclude OECD influence on Nordic public and economic policy as past reforms correspond in many ways to OECD recommendations.

<p>Croatia represents in many respects a unique case in the world in the way it standardized the right to vote, the electoral model, and the pattern of political representation of the diaspora in the national parliament. Besides standard theoretical arguments that explain the right of diaspora members to vote in parliamentary and presidential elections in the country, the authorities made use of a number of contextually specific political, economic, military, and moral reasons for that. It was shown that principled reasons used to justify legalizing diaspora voting rights and institutionalization of special electoral models as well as the patterns of political representation in the Croatian parliament were subordinated to the interests to symbolically integrate the Croats from Bosnia and Herzegovina in the political system of Croatia.

<p>This article evaluates the substantive consequences of judicial diversity on the US Courts of Appeals. Due to the small percentage of racial minorities on the federal bench, the key question in evaluating these consequences is not whether minority judges vote differently from nonminority judges, but whether their presence on appellate courts influences their colleagues and affects case outcomes. Using matching methods, I show that black judges are significantly more likely than nonblack judges to support affirmative action programs. This individual-level difference translates into a substantial causal effect of adding a black judge to an otherwise all-nonblack panel. Randomly assigning a black counterjudge — a black judge sitting with two nonblack judges — to a three-judge panel of the Courts of Appeals nearly ensures that the panel will vote in favor of an affirmative action program.

<p>Despite two bailout agreements of unprecedented size and the implementation of a harsh austerity program, no solution to the Greek crisis is in sight. As a result, Greece continues to be a hotspot, sending sporadic tremors to a fragile Eurozone. The outcome so far leaves no doubts about the grave mishandling of the crisis. The most important cause of this failure is the lack of political leadership at both the national and European levels. Accordingly, a solution to the Greek crisis will remain elusive unless Greek and Europeans politicians overcome the constraints of national political calculations and exercise leadership commensurate to the challenge of rescuing Greece and indeed the Eurozone itself.

<p>This article explores the hitherto underresearched relationship between state architecture and women's political representation, specifically their descriptive or numerical presence. Using a qualitative comparative case study of gender quota reforms in Spain and Britain, we ask how party organizational dynamics mediate the relationship between formal institutions and representative outcomes in recently decentralized countries. We find that the impact of political decentralization on quota adoption and implementation is contingent upon a number of variables related to the party organization, particularly the internal distribution of authority between the central and the regional branches. We conclude that political parties need to be considered as complex and independent actors in analyses of the relationship between state architecture and women's politics.

<p>The article deals with the conditions and the ways in which the Secretary of State for Immigrant Workers and a non-profit-organization at the margin of the state <italic>(Agence de développement des relations interculturelles)</italic> mobilized knowledge focused on intercultural relations, from 1975 to 1990. The ADRI was intended to promote a dialogue between “French people” and “immigrants”. This organization has contributed to establishing administrative interaction with immigrants as a policy target. Training programs focused on intercultural relations for street-level bureaucrats have reframed the political imperative of “dialogue” according to administrative agents' own understanding. This paper analyzes this knowledge as cognitive resources, able to frame a new arena for political and administrative action, as the issue of immigrants' insertion is being politicized. These actors use this knowledge to redefine and depoliticize this public problem. [R] [See <italic>Abstr</italic>. 63.1378]</p>

<p>Using a sample of full-time employees of a public-sector organization in South Korea, this study examines whether transformational leadership (TL) has a significant positive effect on affective commitment (AC) and organizational citizenship behavior (OCB), and whether AC is positively related to OCB. The study also examines whether AC mediates the effects of TL on OCB. The results of higher-order structural equation modeling indicate a positive relationship between TL and AC; no significant relationship between TL and OCB; and a significant positive relationship between AC and OCB. Thus, the results clearly demonstrate that AC fully mediates the relationship between TL and OCB. Theoretical and practical implications of these findings are discussed. [R]</p>

<p>The relationship between state and religions in Japan has changed dramatically since the end of World War II. Their evolution preceding separation helps explain the formulation of the principle of division. From an institutional perspective, the degree of separation of state and religions is quite high in Japan, especially in terms of the regime of religious associations. An important aspect of the question of secularism in Japan is that of the non-interference of the state in the religious sphere and of religious associations in internal affairs respectively. Several case studies in addition to the Supreme Court's decision of 20 January 2010 reveal the delicacy of the prohibition of the state's exercising any religious activity.</p>

The dynamics are explained through the existence of constraints: the type of the regime-change, the nature of the Communist regime and elite configuration. The transition process in Slovakia can be divided into three distinct phases, in which the interplay of the constraints allows for the application of various transitional justice mechanisms. Throughout the existence of independent Slovakia, the elite configuration was the variable which affected the process the most, allowing for the establishment of the institute in 2002, which can be considered a “breaking of the silence” when it comes to dealing with the past in Slovakia.

<p>This article examines the implementation of the recommendations (COs) of the committee monitoring the Convention on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination (CERD) and the causal mechanisms leading to compliance. It is shown that these non-binding COs for the Netherlands have been ineffective in terms of securing compliance. One reason for this is the limited usefulness, legitimacy and persuasiveness of CERD and the COs. Another more important reason is the absence of domestic mobilization in relation to CERD's COs. By analyzing some effective COs of the committees monitoring the Convention on the Rights of the Child and the Convention on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women, this article demonstrates that COs might still be effective when other actors than the government, such as parliament and national courts, take action on the basis of COs.

Kuchma, an instrument of elite struggles for power and rents under V. Yushchenko and a return to a centralized state authority under Y. Vanukovych. Despite its different transformations, the state in Ukraine has been continuously characterized by the prevalence of in formal levers of power and the absence of strong formal institutional foundations. As a result, after twenty years it still lacks the prerequisites of effective governance in a modern state: an impersonal bureaucracy, rule of law and mechanisms of accountability. This institutional void produces Ukraine's vicious cycling between hybrid types of authoritarianism and democracy leaving the state dysfunctional and incomplete.

<p>This article examines civil-military relations and Danish Defense Agreements. A principal-agent approach is taken in a case study of the creation of the first modern Danish defense agreement in 1960, in which Denmark was to honor NATO membership while discussing participation in NATO's forward defense and defense of Danish territory. The military and politicians exchange proposals and directives (1957–1960) and NATO's supreme allied commander is involved. The result is a historic political consensus. The involvement of the three services in the process assists in balancing the information asymmetry and furthers a joint compromise shaped by political intent. A joint ideal in organizing the defense force has since promoted organizational evolution where military advice has been increasingly monopolized. [R, abr.]</p>

Further, parallel analysis of the Senate reveals that the publication effect found for the House is not an artifact of some secular trend in legislative behavior, doing so by showing that no similar pattern occurs in the Senate during the same period of time.

<p>This article uses the controversy over China's Three Gorges Dam to examine the interaction between the Chinese state and transnational civil society that has unfolded in the global arena. It uses the human rights disputes and the emergent Chinese “hydropower discourse” to explore the global politics of the dam. The conflict flared up in the late 1990s and the early 2000s. The increasing interconnectedness of the world enabled the Three Gorges technocrats to solicit global capital for the project. Transnational activists, however, mobilized opposition to the dam through public opinion forums, and cross-border networking to seek to constrain the Chinese government's agenda. They also championed principles of environmental protection and human rights as a challenge to the investment policies of multinational corporations. But the Chinese developmentalists insisted on a particularist interpretation of people's rights. [R, abr.]</p>

This political struggle leads the state to favor ultra-Orthodox observance and criteria of belonging, even though that is a minority strand in the country itself and even more so outside. Religious interests and ideologies have found substantial niches in the legal system, in education, in the army and in the West Bank settlements, by exploiting the state's corporatist character, leading to a type of multiculturalism in which the once-secular center has been seriously eroded.

<p>In recent years, the intelligence communities of the US and the UK have faced a rapidly changing security environment. In that time, a number of high-profile failures have exposed weaknesses within these communities and how they perform their tasks. This article analyzes these failures, identifying the key problems, and examines the various reforms designed to overcome the identified weaknesses. These reforms are discussed in three categories: structural change, budget increases, and increased oversight procedures. The article concludes with an assessment of whether said reforms have produced intelligence communities ready for the new security environment. [R]</p>

<p>In its Lisbon ruling, the German Constitutional Court claims that the “formation of a government with the powers of a state” from within the European Parliament would require its seats to be apportioned in a strict relationship to the share of each member state in the population of the Union. In reaching this conclusion, the Court distinguishes between the equal representation of whole democratic peoples and the equal representation of individual citizens. However, we question that the composition of a EP with powers of “government-formation” would need to give strict priority to the equal representation of persons, rather than continue to give some weight to both equalities.

<p>The article examines the capacity of the Tunisian national system of innovation to resist the political, economic, and social changes affecting the country. After reviewing the theoretical issues, we observe that even if the system continued to function practically unchanged, proof of a certain resilience, difficulties will remain in the absence of a clear policy in scientific research and technological development in the medium and long term, as well as because of an overly-centralized system. The article examines the architecture of the system and the proposals of political parties with regard to it. Finally, it examines the technopoles programs and makes some proposals for improving it.

<p>This essay tracks the concept of militant democracy in the jurisprudence of the European Court of Human Rights, where militant democracy appears to have migrated from a principle that authorizes a state to act in a militant manner to preserve democratic processes to one that entitles a state to establish perimeters and guard against threats of a different kind. Militant democracy now authorizes a state to assume a militant stance toward the exercise of religious freedom that threatens substantive conceptions of democracy instantiated in its constitutional order.

<p>Strategies referred to as “Government 2.0” and e-democracy have turned attention to the use of interactive Web 2.0-based “social media” to engage citizens in consultation and participation to redress a concerning “democratic deficit” and reinvigorate the public sphere. Even in countries with compulsory voting, such as Australia, electoral enrolment, voter-turnout and formal voting are declining. Much focus has been given to expedient political use of social media during election campaigns, but an understudied area is how disengaged citizens and youth can be encouraged to engage or re-engage in democratic participation on an ongoing basis. This article reports analysis of initiatives by national, state and territory electoral commissions in Australia and New Zealand to use social media to engage citizens in political participation.

<p>How does federal state architecture affect the design of welfare? We explore the development of childcare and parental leave in Canada and Australia to address this question. Both countries are considered liberal welfare regimes, but their federal institutions operate in quite different ways, providing an opportunity for comparative analysis. We consider the ways in which federal institutions have affected mobilization around childcare and parental leave and have helped to shape policy outcomes. There is a plausible connection between the institutional configuration of each federation and policy design. It is not definitive, but interacts with variables such as the nature and scale of federal fiscal and policy capacity, the gendered assumptions embedded in the structures of the welfare state, political party strategies, and feminist mobilization.

<p>The Dniester region [Transnistria] has since 1990 defied the Chisinau-based Moldovan government. In 1992, the separatists, relying on Russian military support, won a brief war against the government. Since then, the conflict is “frozen”. A Russian-dominated “peacekeeping mission” contributes to the preservation of the status quo and thus supports the <italic>de facto</italic> independence of the “Dniester Republic”. The Moldovan government is so weak that it cannot even threaten with a military intervention. The separatist armed forces are clearly superior; furthermore, the military balance in the Dniester river has to consider the Russian military contingent in the region as well as, which ostensibly guards Soviet-era ammunition depots; but in reality, the force implements Moscow's geopolitical interests.

<p>The author argues that what distinguishes South Africa from many other African countries is the strength of its institutions. Over the past 18 years South Africa has been able to make peaceful and stable transitions between four presidents: from N. Mandela's charismatic authority, to T. Mbeki's rational-legal authority and J. Zuma's traditional/prebendal authority. K. Motlanthe's presidency was too short to exhibit one type of authority or the other. Despite efforts by ruling party politicians to curtail the judiciary, the media and civil society, South Africa boasts strong institutions of the bourgeois public sphere. The Achilles heel for South Africa's democracy is the lack of strong micro-level institutions, particularly in local government, leading to regular eruptions of violent protests. [R]</p>

<p>How effective are elections in selecting and de-selecting MPs? How do electoral rules affect descriptive representation? To answer such fundamental questions, information is not only needed on those elected to parliament but also data on all those who stood for election. In this article fundamental questions of democratic selection and representation are addressed on the basis of a new data set containing information on each person who ever ran for a seat in the German Bundestag. This new dataset provides us with a complete picture of the personal side of political representation in Germany for the last 60 years — from 1949 to 2009. We look at the different career sequences that typically lead to a seat in parliament, and we investigate the determinants of women's representation, both over time and with an inter-party comparison.

<p>Do reputational concerns affect the duration of enforcement decisions? We analyze “time to decision” in warning letter processes by two enforcement divisions within the [US] Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. We find that nearly all criticism of these divisions revolves around the FDA's primary consumer protection responsibilities (i.e., underenforcement), thus questioning the validity of the FDA's unique reputation. We also found that as media coverage of the FDA's consumer protection responsibilities becomes more positive, the agency takes enforcement decisions (warning letters) more slowly; in contrast, more critical media coverage leads to quicker action by the FDA.

<p>Theories of political entrepreneurship usually focus on the construction of coalitions necessary to change policy. We argue that political entrepreneurs who are unable to secure favored policies may redirect their efforts to a “higher tier”, attempting to change the rules of the game to enable the exploitation of future political profit opportunities. We present a taxonomy of three levels of political rules — pre-constitutional, constitutional, and post-constitutional — and identify the salient characteristics of institutional entrepreneurship that targets rules at each level. The development of the [US] congressional committee system is explored as a case study in entrepreneurship over post-constitutional rules. [R]</p>

<p>The comparison of Indonesia and the Philippines demonstrates the importance of political reconciliation in countering ideologically based terrorist organizations such as JI <italic>[Jemaah Islamiyah]</italic> and ASG <italic>[Abu Sayyaf</italic> Group]. Capable security forces are another important factor. Both states have capable security forces that have put both JI and ASG under pressure. However, the Philippines' reliance on the military has hindered their ability to delegitimize ASG. The judicial process is not a critical part of Filipino CT [counterterrorist] strategy. In Indonesia, the judicial system helped delegitimize JI, which impacted the population's perception of the group and reduced their ability to carry out attacks. At the end of the day it is not the number of terrorists that have been captured or killer that really matters: it is the population's perception of those terrorists.

<p>Despite nearly two decades of scholarship, the disjuncture between the increasing intricacy of the policy landscape and effectiveness of governments' institutional responses suggests that the focus upon complexity and fragmentation within governance discourse risks neglecting the institutional continuity that continues to characterize the structures of government. This article highlights the relationship between intra-government capacity and the resultant capacity of governments to steer the broader policy terrain through a case study of the Labour government's response to climate change. Climate change cuts across traditional bureaucratic lines and challenges established ways of working, and embodies many of the challenges associated with the governance narrative. However, this article suggests that the government's intra-government approach to climate change has been incoherent, with tools being mapped onto existing governing structures with seemingly little consideration for institutional fit.

<p>In the early 1990s, Slovakia, fearing threats of devolution, embarked on an ethno-centric nation-state building, triggering a conflict structure between the majority and the minorities that can be illustrated in the game theoretic model of a “pure conflict”. Even under these unfavorable structural conditions, EU conditionality prompted the state to fulfill the Copenhagen Criteria and to adopt the necessary European legislative package, but inducing formal legislative changes mainly. Before accession, the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages was also adopted, but appropriate measures necessary for its implementation did not implicitly follow. Consequently, social practice generated reciprocal collective meanings on minority language rights and proved to have a constitutive impact on Slovakia's identity profile in the post-accession period.

<p>During the first eight years of the French Fifth Republic, resorting to economists and their knowledge gradually became common within the Ministry of Transport. This article [examines] why economists became so important in the conduct of public affairs. Studying the processes that lead to the construction of transport economists' social roles enables to analyze their ambiguous relationship with political power. It also reveals how they were gradually bound to both legitimize and delineate their field of intervention, with regard to the specific knowledge of other experts wanting to participate in public decisions. The article shows how the social characteristics of engineer-economists and the expectations of the political and administrative authorities they worked for affected the (re)definition of the government's project led by the economic knowledge in this policy field.

<p>Prime Minister K. Rudd's first National Security Statement in 2008 identified climate-change as a “fundamental” threat to national security. Two years later, Rudd was deposed with little to show for climate activism beyond the largely symbolic ratification of the Kyoto Protocol. Australians largely accepted Rudd's claim that climate-change constituted a threat, yet relatively mainstream climate-policy measures were subjected to significant, and ultimately effective, political opposition. This has important implications for climate politics in Australia. This paper, however, focuses on implications for the securitization framework. Specifically, the author argues that this case raises serious questions about the capacity of the framework to account for the mobilizing power of security or the dynamics of its construction.

<p>This article argues that Israel's non-assimilationist policy toward Palestinians — what I term Israel's “rule of difference” — is embedded in the state's security conception. Under the guise of protecting the state and its people, Israel has successfully achieved two essential prongs of this political objective. Dating from the 1948 War, the state has created a series of legal mechanisms that have enabled it to expropriate Palestinian land. Similarly, it has refused to allow Palestinian political associations that espouse nationalist views or challenge the Jewish character of the state to organize or run candidates, even if their programs are clearly non-violent. Ultimately, the state has effectively blocked Palestinians' ability to participate in shaping policy. Ensuring security has thus aided the state in preventing the assimilation of this group into society.

<p>In recent decades, the role that national supreme courts have played in shaping and determining institutional change has been studied from a number of angles. However, this vast literature has not produced a dynamic model that is capable of illuminating the impact of supreme courts on national policy or institutional change. This article proposes such a dynamic model using perspectives based on the “shared mental model” and the concept of “political entrepreneurship”. Adapting hypotheses from the neo-institutionalism literature, it develops a procedural model for analyzing how political rules are changed formally in a democratic system. The analysis also explores the political entrepreneur role that supreme courts play in developing institutional change and addressing social problems. This model is then used to study the Supreme Court in Israel. [R] [See <italic>Abstr</italic>. 63.1857]</p>

<p>Studies analyzing the American Congress demonstrate that senators' attention towards voters substantially increased after the 17th Amendment to the US Constitution, which replaced their indirect appointment with direct election. Should politicians with nonstatic ambition shift their attention towards voters if they do not expect re-election? Making use of a quasi-experimental setting, I analyze the impact of the shift from indirect to direct election to select the members of the Argentine Senate. I develop an argument for why, despite the lack of systematic pursuit of re-election, elected senators have incentives to be more oriented towards voters. Through the analysis of about 55,000 bills, I evaluate senatorial behavior under both sources of legitimacy. The findings support the idea that audience costs make a difference in behavior, regardless of short-term career expectations. [R, abr.]</p>

The weight of the Catholic Church in Brazilian political life is not enough to explain the paralysis with regard to that issue. [R]</p>

<p>In the quest for individualization and liberalization, Swedish public sector policies have since the late 1980s been marked by market-like reforms.

I analyze the arguments of the Swedish Social Democratic and Conservative parties on private and public, in relation to the question of individual choice, from the late 1970s until today. The Social Democrats show continuity in attributing essential values to the state to guarantee the desirable outcome (an equally distributed welfare), but a marked change in the instrumental values assigned to the market. Although the Conservatives show ambivalence regarding the desired functions of the state, the conservative ideology can appear as more coherent. [R, abr.]</p>

This is because, despite its libertarian roots, nudging is compatible with the promotion of personal autonomy and thus can be used to promote self-empowerment in a non-paternalistic fashion. Further, I argue that nudging may play a valid role in tackling large-scale social problems in tandem with other traditional policy measures. Consequently, Goodwin is wrong to reject choice architecture for these reasons. [R]</p>

<p>Over the past two decades, governments in Germany, the Netherlands, and the UK have introduced important reforms to their welfare regimes, enacting paid leave schemes, expanded rights to part-time work, and greater investments in child care. A comparison of these countries reveals a similar sequence of political and policy change. Faced with growing electoral instability and the decline of core constituencies, party leaders sought to attract dealigning voter groups, such as women. In all three cases, women working within the parties played an important role in hatching or lobbying for these reforms. After comparing three countries that moved in a path-shifting direction, this article examines whether a similar set of dynamics are lacking in two countries — Austria and Italy — that have moved more slowly in reforming these policies.

Since liberalization, its approach to planning has changed (1) from comprehensive planning to indicative planning; (2) from planning for state hegemony to adapting to private sector expansion; (3) from planning for a producer state to planning for a quasiwelfare state; and (4) from centralization to coordination in planning. Challenges abound, however. [R, abr.]</p>
<p>63.1870 NELSON, Harry W.; NIKOLAKIS, William — <bold>How does corporatization improve the performance of government agencies? Lessons from the restructuring of state-owned forest agencies in Australia.</bold> <italic>International Public Management Journal</italic> 15(3), 2012: 364–391.</p>
<p>Corporatization, or the adoption of more business-like practices or governance arrangements by government agencies, has been shown to lead to improvements in performance. However, why corporatization leads to improved performance is not well understood. There are competing theories as to how corporatization may improve performance, but because of confounding factors empirical studies have difficulty in identifying causal relationships. We address these issues in our analysis of the corporatization of six Australian state forest agencies that took place in the past two decades, focusing on: (1) improvements in efficiency and (2) improved profitability or cost recovery.

<p>Based on conceptual and comparative analysis, the author analyzes the properties of the electoral systems of Arab and Islamic countries. He develops a general overview of elections as institutions, in the world of western democracies, and compares them with elections of Arab countries. He thus seeks to differentiate them, without ignoring the specific context of the region under study. The titles of the six parts give an overview of the approach: elections, voting, electoral system, organization of elections, integration of political forces that are opposed to democracy, and functional ambivalence of elections.

<p>Identity politics and citizenship are often envisaged in dichotomous terms, but cosmopolitan theorists believe commitments to “thin” universal values can be generated from divergent “thick” positions. Yet, they often gloss over the ways in which the nexus of thick and thin is negotiated in practice — a weak link in the cosmopolitan argument. To understand this nexus better, we turn to women's rights organizations (WROs) in polarized Turkey to show that women affiliated with rival camps (e.g., proreligious/pro-secular, Turkish/Kurdish, liberal/leftist) can mobilize over issues like empowerment, violence against women, and education. However, thick readings of these issues inflect upon collaboration. This has spurred pro-religious and Kurdish women to develop strategies that flag their specific concerns. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>German foreign policy can fruitfully be analyzed through the lens of a modified two-level framework which identifies three interdependent drivers behind government decision-making: the expectations of Germany's international partners, domestic constraints and the national role conceptions of decision-makers. In recent years, the configuration of these three drivers has witnessed a two-fold change. (1) There has been a nascent shift towards the role conception of Germany as a “normal ally”. (2) The domestic context of German foreign policy has become more politicized and contentious. In consequence, Germany's current foreign policy tends to attach relatively less weight to the expectations of its allies, to be more driven by domestic politics — and to be altogether less predictable.

<p>The article suggests a way to explain cases of minority policies in which deliberate avoidance of implementing certain normative provisions generates no criticism in the given society and combines with the overall silent consent on this state of affairs of all the stakeholders, including minority activists themselves. One may regard this as a normal pattern of public politics rather than a deviation, and the lack of implementation as a generally anticipated and accepted outcome rather than a failure. This pattern is labeled as “systemic hypocrisy”, i.e., de-coupling public representation of an organization from its actual functions. The article exposes and specifies two cases of “systemic hypocrisy” in minority policies that are non-territorial autonomy and ethnic federalism within the domain of contemporary Russian diversity-management.

<p>Narrative stories offer insight into political agency and constructed reality. They are also part of the armory for maintaining political ascendancy. The UK Cameron-Clegg Coalition government's public service reform narrative juxtaposed its open, transparent and decentralized approach with the top-down configuration of institutional power attributed to New Labour. The more complex reality of public service reform is exemplified particularly from the criminal justice arena. From a structuralist perspective, the Coalition's reform trajectory has been related to emergent realities of networked governance. But here too more ambiguous influences were at work with reform again proving more problematic than anticipated. [R]</p>

<p>Under which conditions did the introduction of women's suffrage occur before World War I (early), and when only after World War II (late)? This article analyzes necessary and sufficient conditions to explain both early and late introduction of women's suffrage in 14 Western European countries using St. Rokkan's cleavage theory, which distinguishes between four cleavages: religious, ethnic-linguistic, class and sectoral. In addition to testing St. Rokkan's cleavage theory, it adds a structural dimension to agency-based studies on the role of the women's movement, which helps to explain why some such movements had much earlier success than others. Finally, it advances the democratization literature that takes the timing of the introduction of male suffrage as a proxy for the timing of the introduction of women's suffrage. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>Since the UK devolved administrations first took office in 1999, they have asserted their distinctiveness and identity while remaining within UK norms and traditions of public administration. Many variables now show a balance between institutional continuity and adaptive local practices. Generally the devolved administrations fall within continuing patterns of UK government. The system has proved resilient even in the face of challenges to the UK constitutional order, especially in Scotland, where officials have advised the Scottish National Party government about their constitutional aspirations. Controversy over this role is a reminder that public administration is a third dimension alongside the politics of nationalism and devolution and the service-specific public policies of the devolved nations, and also a contribution to our understanding of adaptations of the Whitehall model.

<p>Despite their common history, the countries of the former Czechoslovakia appear to have adopted markedly different policies towards Eurozone accession. Whereas Slovakia joined the common currency in January 2009 the Czech Republic has adopted a more skeptical attitude with the question of Euro adoption postponed indefinitely. Given the relative similarities of the two states' institutional apparatuses and economic structures, it is unsurprising that standard accounts of monetary policy-making struggle to explain the divergence in attitudes towards the EMU. This article presents a constructivist understanding of the politics of Eurozone accession strategies by focusing on the role of “legitimizing discourses” in the political process. [R, abr.]</p>

This situation is put into perspective by looking at the fiscal sustainability of the whole public sector and how much health care adds to the challenge of staying fiscal sustainable. No coherent strategy for coping with demographics and the economic crisis has been developed.

<p>In order to analyze “official statistics”, I suggest changing the focus of analysis by exploring the ways in which they are produced and publicized rather than their uses. The survey conducted among the statisticians who draft these publications allowed us to identify three kinds of issues: the public legitimization of their profession; the bureaucratization of the writing process, which creates a tension with the “right to publish”, and the politicization of statistics, which sometimes may take place in connection with the political agenda. Conflicts formed around these issues encourage us not to reify the boundaries between “politics” and “administration” but rather to analyze the different logics of domination at work in these institutions.

<p>In parliamentary committees of investigation, the qualified minority is entitled by the [German] Constitution to participate in the investigation on equal footing. Hence the minority must be able to enforce its understanding and concept of an adequate clarification of facts. In particular, when the enquiry's fact-finding is impacted by procedural law, the minority is allowed to co-determine the procedures. This is the case regarding decisions on motions to take evidence, the enforcement of evidence orders, special sessions, means of coercion, legal means, the insight into non-repudiation protocols and records of the committee, the final report and the completion of the proceedings. In these cases a “qualified right of motion” is in place. The majority may only refuse the motion of the qualified minority if it can base its refusal on constitutional grounds, such as unsuitable evidence, incorrect or illegal means of gathering the evidence. The refusal requires constitutionally sound grounds. The minority may secure legal protection only in case of an institutional controversy, unless the law determines otherwise. The constitutional depth of control is restricted to the control of plausibility, abuse und arbitrariness. [R]</p>

<p>The adoption of communication forms like Twitter presents students of congressional behavior an interesting case to examine the intersection of technology and politics.

In this paper, I examine Twitter use in the 111th [US] Congress in order to better understand congressional early adoption of new technology. The primary question addressed is what systematic determinants shape the decision to adopt Twitter as a component of an MC's media strategy. Using data collected from MC Twitter accounts and the 2008 congressional election, I find partisan, cohort, and ideological determinants on early Twitter adoption.

<p>This paper evaluates how “infostructure” has been reformed in the liberalization process of network industries, which has involved third-party access to the network through a comparison of the electricity, railway, and civil aviation sectors in Switzerland. Our theoretical argument posits that infostructure is a missing link in the study of the regulation of liberalized network industries. Infostructure is defined as the control and command services necessary for monitoring the access to and optimizing the uses of infrastructure. What is the impact of the management of infostructure on the liberalization process and the structure of liberalizing markets? This study of the liberalization of network industries in Switzerland highlights the potential strategic function of infostructure in the context of opening to competition and internationalizing markets.

<p>Much recent international press coverage of Spain's difficulties portrays a country rapidly approaching political, economic and social meltdown. Its economy is contracting, its unemployment rate is at unprecedented levels and its sovereign-risk premium hovers at apparently unsustainable levels. Spain will undoubtedly require external financial help from its European partners, as well as more time and flexibility to achieve its fiscal targets. But it also has a number of strengths that are too often overlooked. Spending cuts and structural reforms are proceeding at a lively pace, unit labor costs are falling significantly, and exports and productivity are on the rise. In short, there is light at the end of the tunnel. [R]</p>

<p>Since the establishment of the “fluid” five-party-system in Germany, two-party coalitions beyond the grand coalition have become more difficult to form. Therefore, the option of a minority government on the federal level attracts attention and the question of its capacity to act emerges. The decade-long Danish experience with successful minority governments stands as a model. The thorough institutional analysis of both systems shows that the Danish example suits very well for comparison. The study of the Bundestag's majority-finding in the decision-making process on the basis of “key decisions” and the comparison of the party systems reveal the structural similarities and allow the conclusion that in Germany a federal minority government could act efficiently.

<p>[Recently], the “Will it last?” question about parliamentary governments has received growing attention by political scientists. However, only a few studies focus on the Italian case, and scholars have not yet found a satisfactory interpretation for the huge differences characterizing the transition from the First to the Second Italian Republic. I assume that this interpretation deals with the linkages between institutional opportunities and constraints, power relations among parties and their strategic behavior. This, in turn, depends on the “shadow of the past” characterizing each party decision, and on expectations that parties shape rationally. The more these opportunities and constraints set up a condition in which majority parties perceive themselves as ruling the country only temporarrily, the more those parties are stimulated not to modify that (fickle) equilibrium.

<p>This research shows that [US] Congress's approval ratings are linked to the degree important legislation deviates from the public's ideological mood. The results of an error-correction model show that these policy origins of support are as important as other determinants of approval such as partisan conflict and the economy. The effect of policy divergence from public opinion is also accentuated during periods of unified government when there might be a normative expectation that shared partisan control should translate into policy success. The findings substantiate conventional wisdom regarding the relationship between congressional approval and policy, spatial theories of voting, and models of the electoral behavior of congressional members.

<p>This article examines to what extent legislators in Estonia use performance information in budgetary decision-making. Interviews with the members of parliament's finance committee show that legislators make only limited use of the formal documents containing performance information. Instead, they rely mostly on informal social networks for gathering information they consider necessary for budget discussions. According to the legislators, the main reasons for limited use of performance information are the following: the documents containing performance are too long and cumbersome, the legislative budget process is too time-constrained, and the parliament has only a limited role in making substantive changes to the budget. The study also indicates that more experienced politicians are less interested in performance information than the novices but there are no significant differences between legislators from governing and opposition parties.

The article first details an extended case of counterfeiting of legality in the practices of business raiding, commonly termed <italic>reiderstvo</italic>, in Russia.

<p>Legislative earmarks have taken center stage in the popular press in recent years as journalists, pundits, the president, and, sometimes, even legislators themselves question the economic, representational, and general policy implications of this type of federal spending. Some scholars suggest that legislators garner either direct or indirect electoral benefits from this behavior, but empirical findings are mixed. We place this discussion in the context of the literature on the link between campaign contributions and legislative services. We argue that MCs use earmarks to reward loyal contributors while interest groups attract earmarks by contributing to legislators' campaigns. Utilizing a two-stage OLS technique, we find a robust relationship between defense earmarks and campaign contributions from defense political action committees during the 111th Congress. [R]</p>

<p>This article addresses the way in which the Argentine Supreme Court has set out to redefine its own institutional role through its procedures and decisions, since its institutional reform in 2003. It shows that the Court has developed innovative ways of judicial intervention in public policy and rights issues, which include the participation of new kinds of actors and entail an emerging new relationship between the Court and civil society organizations in Argentina. The article argues that this change can be understood as a way for the Court to rebuild its institutional legitimacy, and that the reform is connected to the presence of strong NGOs, whose claims for a change in the Court's composition and procedures gained momentum in the aftermath of the social and political crisis of 2001–2002 in Argentina.

<p>The article addresses the change in administrative structure at the center of the Estonian government during the twenty years of post-communist development. The focus is on three issues of theoretical relevance: the rate of change in the core parts of public administration, the aspired retrenchment of administrative structures, and the combination of national and international forces behind structural change. In analyzing the factors behind Estonian administrative formation, the initial deinstitutionalization of the politico-administrative system appears to be a critical factor for understanding the direction and content of the reforms undertaken.

<p>The pursuits of private profit and distributional political advantage can be powerful state-building motives. This article describes how each motive can trigger a distinct causal sequence amid commodity booms, which can result in the growth of state capacity. First, when pursuing profit during booms, export-oriented actors regularly seek new state-supplied public goods, the provision of which promotes the expansion of state capacity. Second, when booms enrich rivals to the ruling coalition, coalition members may respond with institution building to preserve their existing political advantages. A case study of Chile (1848–1883) and supplementary evidence from Argentina, Central America, Colombia, and Peru indicate that these causal sequences may have been central to state-building in Latin America historically.

<p>Venezuelan President H. Chávez fended off a spirited challenge by Governor H. Capriles this fall.

Meanwhile, political differences and power struggles, and a sense of demoralization, risk undermining Capriles' diverse coalition. The regional scenario would look very different without Chávez. External players should restrain from meddling during this period of uncertainty. Instead, support should focus on trying to ensure that Venezuelans continue to rely on the ballot box in determining the course of a country facing so many daunting problems. [R]</p>

<p>The Swiss Constitution demands respect for the “dignity of creatures”. Creatures are “animals, plants and other organisms”. “Dignity” refers to the inherent worth, the proper good which distinguishes each living being. None may be treated as simply instrumental; dealing with them is bound to the duty of carefully weighing the goods and interests in question. Yet Switzerland is not a paradise for non-human living being. Five examples are illustrating the situation: the lost institution of lawyers for animal protection, the fierce dispute about the use of primates in research, the wish to eliminate the concept of “dignity of creatures” from the Constitution, derisive remarks about the dignity of plants, endeavors in civil society to consolidate the idea of the dignity of plants.

<p>I argue here that Israel's “basic structure” (i.e., the main economic, social, and political institutions), to use J.

This basic structure is particularly unjust, as it does not provide these citizens with the minimal conditions of a decent life. The state not only fails to rectify this injustice but is actively implicated in producing it. This process within Israel intersects with a process of separation and annexation in the Occupied Territories. Together, these processes are eroding the citizenship status of the Palestinian citizens of Israel. [R]</p>

Further complicating the political arena, the referendum effectively caused strife among revolutionary compatriots and opposition forces and engendered a state of polarization across Egyptian society. This turbulent situation requires Egyptians to rapidly initiate genuine nationwide dialogue to deal with the demands and aspirations of different parties and to develop an agenda to achieve the revolutionary goals: bread, freedom, and human dignity.

<p>63.1905 TAVAN, Gwenda — <bold>No going back? Australian multiculturalism as a path-dependent process.</bold> <italic>Australian Journal of Political Science</italic> 47(4), Dec. 2012: 547–561.</p>
<p>This article evaluates the J. Gillard Labor government's efforts to revive Australian multiculturalism when other liberal democracies have declared it a failure. Despite a controversial history, Australian multiculturalism has many of the characteristics of institutional path dependence, representing a highly contested set of policies, programs and norms that evolved in specific historical contexts and developed their own self-reinforcing logic. The Australian experience offers salient reminders of the difficulties of overturning the social and political consequences of immigration decisions made long ago. The general success of multiculturalism as a migrant-integration strategy suggests that it may be the best available option for liberal-democratic governments to manage the politics of cultural diversity in the 21st c. There is a need, however, for governments to renew their commitment to migrant rights and equity. [R]</p>

<p>Formal constitutional systems of separated powers often fail to sustain meaningful systems of checks and balances in presidential-style democracies. What conditions support balance in the separation of powers and what conditions provoke instability and conflict? We draw on Madisonian political theory and research addressing the separation of powers in the United States to develop a game theoretical model of inter-institutional stability and conflict within a separation of powers system. Two factors emerge as catalysts for institutional instability and conflict among the branches of government: high-stakes institutional rivalry combined with uncertainty about the public's relative support for various branches of government. We apply the model to the experience of Honduras in 2008–2009 that resulted in the coup ousting President Zelaya which illustrates the difficulty of developing credible checks and balances. [R]</p>

<p>Throughout the 20th c., many US presidents tried and failed to overhaul the nation's health care system. For this reason, the passage of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act in March 2010 has been hailed as a historic turn. This article summarizes key provisions of the health care reform law and describes the eventful journey of this [bill] through Congress. The new law is an incremental reform, that will only partially tackle the most critical problems affecting the health care system in the US. Applying lessons learned from past failures, [the B. Obama administration] succeeded through a combination of political pragmatism and compromise, negotiating deals with health industry groups, and compromising on a range of issues in order to satisfy the demands of many members of Congress.

<p>This contribution analyzes from a retrospective and synchronous perspective the often conflicting power relations between the French colonial, the Senegalese post-colonial central states and the decentralized collectivities. Reflecting on the effective autonomy of the local collectivities in the management and running of the competences which are transferred to them through the decentralization laws, the article shows how, on the basis of real cases, the intervention of the central power in local affairs not only questions democracy but also and above all diverts the regionalization policies from their initial objectives.

<p>Despite advances in contemporary research on the “European administrative space” (EAS), no widespread understanding about its meaning, mechanisms and significance yet exists. This contribution offers a comprehensive conceptualization of EAS and takes stock of accumulated lessons learned. The development of EAS can be understood as a process of institutionalization of common administrative capacity at a “European level”. The contribution suggests that the rise of EAS can be analytically grasped in terms of three analytical dimensions: independence; integration; and co-optation. Taken together, these dimensions seem to capture central aspects of the integration of public administration in Europe. [R]</p>

<p>In a democratic country like Taiwan, we would expect public spending, especially on welfare items, to be influenced by changes in demographic structure and political power. Taiwan is an aging society, and there has been a unique connection between welfare for the elderly and which political party is in power since 1993. We apply demographic variables and political factors to the empirical models to explore their effects on the size of local government welfare spending. A panel-data model for twenty-one counties and cities from 1993 to 2007 is used in our investigation. The results show that central government transfers are the main factor affecting the level of local government welfare spending. This also shows that decentralization is limited in Taiwan.

<p>This article addresses the question of how governments can set up and manage, in an increasingly complex policy environment, processes of public consultation that lead to good outcomes. Drawing upon insights of democratic theory and literature on network and interactive governance, the article discusses the organization and outcomes of public consultation processes. The analysis of four Belgian cases shows that the absence of open process rules does not prevent good outcomes. Second, the level of managerial autonomy is positively correlated with the intensity of process design and management. Third, cases with intensive process design and management have better overall results. These findings question some normative assumptions in the literature, positing the need for open process rules regarding entrance, scope of discussion, and interaction. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>Little scholarly literature has examined why the chambers of the US Congress use conference committees to reconcile inter-cameral legislative differences. Why would the chambers be willing to delegate conciliation authority to a subset of the membership that is then granted wide leverage in shaping the policy choices on legislation with such broad implications for the membership? We theorize that conference committees, by way of an information advantage, offer a means of promoting bicameral agreement and avoiding the risk of failure associated with bargaining between the chambers. We develop a formal model of two-sided incomplete information and find that certain conditions on preferences and information yield the chambers, who must be complicit in the decision to go to conference, higher expected policy returns to delegating this authority to utility maximizing conferees.

<p>By trying to stop and reverse the effects of the economic crisis, governments resort to new methods of clarifying and communicating public services. eGovernment has the necessary capacity to attain such a desideratum. It may be successfully implemented using marketing. This paper [examines] the propensity of the Romanian public management system to digitize offered services and the contribution that marketing may be able to offer in the implementation process. [After] analyzing interviews with public managers, this article shows that the degree of importance given to citizen-centric principles, by establishing efficient, reachable and inexpensive services, is low. The few identified digitized solutions have been introduced following political decisions and the postimplementation results show a degree of use which is below the initial expectations.

<p>The largest disenfranchised group in modern democracies is international migrants who lack citizenship of their country of residence. There have been no systematic attempts to investigate the policy consequences of noncitizen suffrage. Drawing on standard models of political competition, I argue that there will be a selection bias inherent in estimating the impact of noncitizen suffrage on public policy and analyze data that are uniquely suitable to deal with this methodological problem, namely data on exogenous changes in the composition of the electorates of Swedish municipalities generated by the introduction of noncitizen suffrage. According to the results, the effect of enfranchising noncitizens on public policy was large, causing spending on education and social and family services to increase substantially in municipalities where noncitizens made up a non-negligible share of the electorate.

<p>A common threat to democratic politics in developing countries is state interference with the independent media. Despite the importance of this, we know very little about when and why governments attack the media. We explain media harassment in Africa with a theory focusing on varying government incentives to control information over time. We propose that media harassment will increase when governments face threats to maintaining power or undertake extraordinary efforts to consolidate power. Leveraging an original dataset that covers 15 years and 23 countries, our findings offer support for this. Media harassment increases when governments are faced with major protests, coup plots, and conflict onsets and when they are seeking to amend constitutions in ways that increase or extend their power.

<p>There has been an increasing attempt to theories the emergence of a liberal-local hybrid approach to state-building, which recognizes the coexistence and interaction of liberal and local socio-political institutions.

<p>Conventional wisdom and empirical academic research conclude that creating majority-black district decreases black representation by increasing conservatism in [the US] Congress. I compare congressional delegations from states that during the 1990 redistricting were under greater pressure to create majority-minority districts with those under lesser pressure using a difference-in-differences framework. I find no evidence that the creation of majority-minority districts leads to more conservative House delegations. In fact, point estimates, although largely statistically insignificant, indicate that states that increased their shares of majority-black districts saw their delegations grow increasingly liberal. I find similar results for majority-Latino districts in the South-West. Thus, I find no evidence for the common view that majority-minority districts decrease minority representation in Congress.

<p>This article explains the contradictions in Bachelet's presidency by focusing on the paradoxical nature of presidential power, the limits on the executive in the Chilean constitution, and how those limits affected her government. At the outset, she faced the problem of wanting to promote inclusive policies while simultaneously experiencing political pressure to maintain elite consensus. Due to institutional and political constraints, Bachelet's rhetoric of inclusion could not be realized, and she eventually decided to opt for the more traditional elite consensus approach. In our view, the emphasis on achieving elite consensus produced contradictory results. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>From the late 1990s, in response to growing unrest and crime, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) put greater emphasis on the role of the “comprehensive management of public security” (CMS) than it did on legal reform as the main means of “maintaining social stability” <italic>(weiwen)</italic>.

This paper analyzes the measures, mechanisms, and logic of CMS in order to explain why it does not work as intended.

Why did China make such a drastic shift in its fiscal and monetary policies in 2008? Third, it highlights the major fiscal and monetary policies implemented by China during the financial crisis. Finally, it assesses the effects of China's policy responses on the Chinese economy and the rest of the world. [R] [See <italic>Abstr</italic>. 63.2309]</p>

<p>Turkey represents relatively a success story in minority rights due to the intensive minority-related legal adoption and increasing implementation in the accession process. Therefore, Turkey provides an empirical arena to explore factors that influence the implementation process. Suggesting a revised version of comprehensive “worlds of compliance” applicable to the candidate states as a filter of explanatory factors for implementation, this article argues that two worlds of compliance matter in Turkey's compliance with minority rights: world of domestic politics for implementation process, influenced by the domestic choice of the Turkish government; and world of law observance for legal adoption driven by the EU's credible conditionality.

<p>Saudi Arabia is a crucially important media player in the Middle East, commanding modern, sophisticated and far-reaching media systems. Driving the Saudi media hegemony is what may be loosely termed “a security imperative” which is tightly connected to internal dynamics, geopolitical considerations and regional rivalries. Empowered with its oil wealth, Saudi Arabia pursued a dual media strategy, operating state-controlled and circumscribed domestic media systems which insulate the population from undesired external influences and uphold the religious sensibility of the kingdom while developing decentralized, open and modern transnational media systems abroad capable of safeguarding the kingdom's interests and promoting its foreign policy. [However], the media have proven to be an inordinately complex asset. The liberalization of Saudi media engendered a number of potentially consequential conflictual dynamics. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>The severity with which the financial crisis struck Germany in 2008 came as a shock to German elites. The relatively traditional shape of its bank-based financial system was supposed to isolate the country from the vagaries of Anglo-Saxon capitalism. Instead, the government was forced to unprecedented steps, such as the <italic>de facto</italic> nationalization of banks and an unlimited guarantee on savings deposits. A comprehensive reform of financial regulation in the country seemed imperative. This article evaluates change in the institutional structure of financial-sector regulation and supervision in Germany. The inconclusive debate about the reorganization of financial supervision, the emergence of new regulation in the field of bank restructuring, and the attempted reform of the deposit insurance system are used as empirical cases.

<p>Do different levels of exposure to EU law implementation have consequences for the organization of national ministries? Previous accounts suggest that European integration has little influence on the “hardware” of member state administrations. Data covering the organization of 21 ministries in Estonia, Poland, and Slovenia show the Europeanization effect to be more pronounced than might be expected. Ministries responsible for transposing many EU directives tend to institutionalize centralized oversight in legislative planning, review, and monitoring; ministries with few implementation responsibilities rarely make such adaptations. This effect holds when one controls for the impact of partisan preferences and organizational conventions. The results offer a counterpoint to the studies of old member states that find little EU effect on the organization of domestic ministries. [R]</p>

<p>A vast literature argues that the majority party in most legislatures enjoys a policy-making advantage through its access to gatekeeping institutions that let it block bills from reaching the floor. However, agenda-setting institutions vary substantially across legislatures. We propose that this variation should have demonstrable consequences for the majority party's influence. We develop hypotheses about the institutional features of legislatures that enable the majority party to block bills. Then, we canvass all 99 US state legislative chambers to measure whether those institutions are present and test whether they lower the rate at which the majority party is rolled. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>Like its Scandinavian neighbors, Denmark is considered to be among the countries where politics has moved farthest in the direction of gender equality. Hence, finding gendered differences in committee assignments here indicates that such differences probably also exist in most other settings. While our data demonstrate that women are not outright discriminated against in the Danish case, we do observe large gender differences in committee assignments. Even in the Scandinavian countries, there still seem to be limits to the level of gender equality. We suspect that committee assignments are generally not gender-neutral, and we would encourage others to try to produce empirical support for this claim. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>Using a new dataset based on co-sponsorship data from 18 Argentine provincial-level legislative chambers, I find that gender does indeed influence legislative preferences. I demonstrate that gender differences are present within political parties in approximately 90% of the legislative chambers in my sample. Differences in women's and men's co-sponsorship behavior emerge as a product of women coalescing to promote shared interests, to galvanize support for important policies, and to raise awareness around issues that disproportionately exert an impact on women's lives. Co-sponsoring legislation with colleagues who share similar priorities provides a venue for women in legislative bodies to exhibit distinct preferences over policy outcomes. [R]</p>

<p>This article assesses differences in the way local government associations organize to influence EU legislation in different countries. EU policy outcomes have an increasing financial and administrative impact on local government. This has been increasingly recognized by both EU institutions and many national governments, and recent reforms have sought to ensure greater involvement of local authorities in the preparation of EU proposals and domestic pre-negotiations, with an emphasis on the aggregation of local government interests via European and national local government associations. Research suggests that representative organizations need to be well resourced to be able to mobilize at both European and national level to influence EU proposals. This article empirically examines attempts by local government associations in England, Denmark and Ireland to influence EU environmental directives. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>We examine the proposition that incentives for legislative organization can be explained by the nature of electoral competition. We argue that legislators in environments where parties are competitive for majority status are most likely to have delegated power to their leadership to constrain individualistic behavior within their party, which will in turn increase the spatial predictability of individual voting patterns. Using roll-call votes and district-level electoral data from the US state legislatures, we show empirically that increased statewide interparty competition corresponds to more predictable voting behavior overall, while legislators from competitive districts and those in the minority party have less predictable behavior.

<p>This article stems from an internet survey administered to public officers from two Italian regions and presents evidence concerning two crucial features of participative policies, participation and conflict. Specifically, a model to determine the “participative inclination” of policies, based on identifying and weighing the influence of the subjects entering the arena, and a methodology to explore the conflict in inclusive processes are introduced. Participative policies, on average, appear biased towards a particular interest-representation model, that is a bargaining, rather than ideological-deliberative setting. Inclusive processes are all but markedly conflictual, evidencing the utilization of conflict-limitation strategies and a pathological interpretation of conflict in itself. The “conflict-resolution score” computed has shown a positive correlation to the institutionalization of singled-out policies. [R]</p>

<p>For years now, the elevation of the county-based, deconcentrated bodies of public administration mediating governmental functions to the regional level has been in progress. It is clear for the larger cities of county rank that if the political and public administration is decentralized in Hungary, it will be an evident consequence to designate those cities that will serve as the seats of the regional governments, in practice the capitals of the regions. There is a sharp competition taking place for the possession of these regional functions, while the state is decreasing the number of potential actors via public administration and regional development. This study answers which cities are suitable for acting as regional centers by the regional decentralization of governmental functions and top-bottom regional planning. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>This study investigates the connection between municipality size and political support in 55 Swedish municipalities. Three hypotheses are developed, claiming negative, positive, and no connection between municipality size and political support. In the empirical analysis, two aspects of size (area and population) and eleven aspects of political support (five aspects of political trust, participation in parliamentary and municipal elections, political interests, party identification, and activity in associations) are included. The analysis also includes age, education, ethnicity, income, labor market activity and urbanization. When the three hypotheses are empirically tested, the analysis indicates that several aspects of political support have negative correlations with area size, while only one of the aspects has a negative correlation with population size. However, a major part of the investigated aspects has no connection with municipality size. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>Although research on professionalism in state legislatures has been substantial, professionalism research has ignored legislative bodies in local government, such as city councils and school boards. Using detailed school district-level data and an original survey of school board members in 210 school districts in California [US], we develop measures of professionalism in the local government context. We then use these measures to examine which characteristics of school districts are associated with greater professionalization. Consistent with findings in the state politics literature, we find that districts with greater resources and more heterogeneous environments exhibit higher degrees of professionalism th an other districts.

<p>63.1940 HALBERSTAM, Michael — <bold>Process failure and transparency reform in local [US] redistricting.</bold> <italic>Election Law Journal</italic> 11(4), 2012: 446–471.</p>
<p>Redistricting reform has pushed for greater transparency, more public participation, the removal of redistricting from the hands of legislatures, and the design of more legitimate institutions and decision procedures. Reform efforts are generally focused on statewide and congressional redistricting, but mostly ignore thousands of local redistrictings across the country. Local redistricting often takes place under the radar, varies between jurisdictions, is subject to different institutional arrangements and political dynamics, and is more vulnerable to process failure. This article advances a policy proposal to reform local redistricting that weds aspects of several contemporary governance approaches — including “New Institutionalism” and “Third-Generation Transparency” methods. It argues that states should establish centralized statewide redistricting clearinghouses for local redistricting. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>This article examines the relationship between polity size and political trust in local government, for which two schools of thought offer opposing expectations. It contributes with a dynamic perspective of how changes in polity size affect changes in citizens' political trust on the input-side of local government. The case examined is the recent municipal mergers in Denmark which were implemented in January 2007. The article reports an analysis of a panel based on a repeated survey of Danish citizens using an untreated control group design with pre-test and post-test. A quasi-experimental difference-in-difference identification strategy is used to obtain the effect of municipal size on local political trust. [R, abr.]</p>

The cases of Quebec and Flanders are used to explore the extent to which subnational policy regimes can be seen as credible or symbolic. [R]</p>
<p>63.1943 HARADA, Masataka — <bold>The [US] Voting Rights Act of 1965 and strategic policy making in the South.</bold> <italic>State Politics and Policy Quarterly</italic> 12(4), Dec. 2012: 456–482.</p>
<p>This study uses historical data from the 1965 [US] Voting Rights Act (VRA) to examine the effect of strategic policy-making on policy outcomes. Strategic policy-making refers to the exploitation of future policy resources by an incumbent government when it anticipates the policy-change by a future government. In the South, the segregationist governments immediately after the enactment of the VRA still stayed in office but anticipated the future policy-change that would result from minority voters acquiring the right to franchise. This political context provides an ideal setting for testing the theory of strategic policy-making. Through analysis of county panel data-analysis from the 1960s, this study finds that segregationist governments with large budgets increased long-term debts, education spending, and highway spending significantly when compared with the rest of the country.

<p>What are the prospects for the Web enhancing the local governance process by providing a networked public sphere? This article addresses this question by researching online local civic activity associated with a case study of a UK local government referendum. Drawing upon social network analysis theory, this research first of all applies relational hyperlink analysis to map and structurally analyze the hyperlinked network. Second, it draws upon a network ethnography approach to identify and then interview key actors associated with this network. The results suggest a need for policy intervention to counter the distinct homophily effects and “politics as usual” scenario uncovered in the local online network. [R]</p>

<p>Voter identification (ID) policies, especially those of the photo ID variety, have been hotly contested over the last few years. The primary concern surrounding these statutes amounts to lower turnout, especially among certain groups in the electorate, such as racial/ethnic minorities. In 2007, Georgia [US] implemented a new statute requiring registrants to present a government-issued photo ID to vote. Using population data on registrants from two election cycles coupled with information on a subgroup of registrants known to lack photo ID, we conduct a policy-impact analysis of the Georgia voter ID law. We find that the law lowered turnout by about four-tenths of a percentage point in 2008. However, we find no empirical evidence to suggest that there is a racial or ethnic component to this suppression effect. [R, abr.]</p>
<p>63.1946 IBARRA SALAZAR, Jorge — <bold>Entorno político y dependencia financiera de los estados mexicanos (Political environment and financial dependence of the Mexican states).</bold> <italic>Gestión y Política pública</italic> 22(1), 2013: 3–44.</p>
<p>Previous studies on financial dependence of Mexican states have concentrated on the effects of the National System of Fiscal Coordination, established in 1980, and regional characteristics of the states. I analyze the effects of the political framework over states' financial dependence on revenue sharing transfers. The variables comprising the political framework are constructed with the political affiliation of the state governor, the composition of the local congresses, the political affiliation of the Mexican president, and the electoral cycles. In order to study the influence of such framework, we propose and estimate empirical fixed effects models with the panel data approach. I use a data base consisting of a pooling of cross-sectional (31 states) and annual time series (1998–2006). The results show evidence that the impact of confluence and political cycles on financial dependence is different, depending on political affiliation of the governor. It is in that sense that not only institutional, economic, fiscal, and regional factors influence states' financial dependence: the political framework is also important. [R]</p>

<p>The political power of modern bureaucracies may be viewed as a democratic challenge. In fact, many reforms in the public sector aim to strengthen control over these bureaucracies, either by politicians or by citizens. This article argues that the need for control will depend on the degree of interest divergence between bureaucracy on the one hand, and politicians and citizens on the other. Still, attitudes in the three groups are seldom compared directly. Here, the attitudes towards different issues in the three groups are compared, within four small Norwegian municipalities. The results indicate that attitudes of local bureaucrats only to a limited degree diverge from those of politicians and the public, with one exception: attitudes towards “New Public Management” reforms. Implications for control over bureaucracies are discussed. [R]</p>
<p>63.1948 KARLSSON, Martin — <bold>Participatory initiatives and political representation: the case of local councillors in Sweden.</bold> <italic>Local Government Studies</italic> 38(6), 2012: 795–815.</p>
<p>This paper explores the consistency between participatory initiatives in Swedish municipalities and the attitudes, practices and role-taking of local councilors, comparing pioneer municipalities where extensive numbers of participatory initiatives have been executed vis-à-vis hesitator municipalities where few initiatives have been implemented. The study indicates that local participatory initiatives may stimulate political representation by creating new channels for citizen input and communication between citizens and representatives that are supported by local councilors in the pioneer municipalities. However, the core roles of parties and councilors in representative democracy appear not to be challenged by these initiatives, being similar in both groups of municipalities. The article discusses the implications of these results for the function of participatory initiatives in local democracy. [R, abr.]</p>
<p>63.1949 KATZ, Ellen D. — <bold>On overreaching, or why Rick Perry may save the [US] Voting Rights Act but destroy affirmative action.</bold> <italic>Election Law Journal</italic> 11(4), 2012: 420–430.</p>
<p>The [US] State of Texas is presently staking out two positions that are not typically pursued by a single litigant. On the one hand, Texas is seeking the invalidation of the [1965] Voting Rights Act, and, on the other, the State is now defending the validity of the expansive race-based affirmative action policy it uses at its flagship university. This essay presses the claim that Texas has increased the chance it will lose in both <italic>Texas v. Holder</italic> and <italic>Fisher v. University of Texas</italic> because it has opted to stake out markedly extreme positions in each. I argue that Texas would be more likely to succeed had it chosen to temper both its actions and claims in the pending cases. [R, abr.]</p>
<p>63.1950 KRAUSE, George A.; DOUGLAS, James W. — <bold>Organizational structure and the optimal design of policymaking panels: evidence from consensus group commissions' revenue forecasts in the American states.</bold> <italic>American Journal of Political Science</italic> 57(1), Jan. 2013: 135–149.</p>
<p>Increasing both the size and diversity of policy-making panels is widely thought to enhance the accuracy of collective policy decisions. This study advances the theoretical conditions in which improving collective accuracy necessitates an efficient trade-off between a panel's size and its level of organizational diversity. This substitution effect between these organizational characteristics is empirically supported with data on official general-fund revenue forecasts made by consensus group (CG) independent commissions in the American states. Evidence of an asymmetric substitution effect is also uncovered, whereby increasing organizational diversity in large CG commissions produces revenue forecasts that reduce collective accuracy by slightly more than three times as much compared to decreasing such diversity in small CG commissions.

<p>Gubernatorial power has been used as a key explanatory factor in analyses of topics such as gubernatorial approval, divided government, regulation, and even individual political behavior. The key to these studies is the precision with which scholars can measure [US] gubernatorial power, and many such studies rely on the Formal Powers Index (FPI) — a measure maintained by Beyle. We reconsider these commonly used power scores in three parts: (1) We argue and show that FPI suffers from a key measurement error that is particularly problematic in analyses of time-series data. (2) We present a new approach to estimating gubernatorial power and explain how this approach deals with the measurement errors in the FPI. (3) We use our new scores to replicate a study that originally relied on the FPI to analyze the effect of gubernatorial power. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>This study primarily investigates the power dynamics between organized crime, the state and society. Using the Cape Flats community of Manenberg as a case study, this article examines the interaction of organized criminal gangs with the South African state at the level of local government to provide a descriptive analysis of the power dynamics between the local state, the community and criminal groups. It is argued that organized criminal groups act as a rival social organization and have acquired forms of social control lost by the state. As a result, the state is not regarded as the most prominent organization in Manenberg but, rather, as only one actor functioning in a system of local power dynamics. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>California's Voters FIRST Act created the Citizens Redistricting Commission and with it provided a unique opportunity to observe the implementation of one of the most challenging political processes: the creation of electoral districts by a body of non-elected voters. Despite many predictions and accusations to the contrary, this first-time [US] experiment in participatory democracy experienced remarkably few glitches while achieving a successful outcome. This article provides an overview of the many factors and actors that played significant roles in this reform effort, and provides participant-observations illuminating some strengths and weaknesses of the process.

<p>We know relatively little about the Brazilian state's internal dynamics and particularities. It is possible to use network analysis to expand this knowledge by developing mesolevel analysis of those processes. This article proposes an analytical framework for studying networks inside policy communities. This framework considers the stable and resilient patterns that characterize state institutions, especially in contexts of low institutionalization, particularly those found in Latin America and Brazil. The article builds on research on urban policies in Brazil to suggest that networks made of institutional and personal ties structure state organizations internally and insert them into broader political scenarios. These networks, which I call state fabric, frame politics, influence public policies, and introduce more stability and predictability than the majority of the literature usually considers.

<p>From the concept of “odd pricing”, i.e., setting rightmost price digits below a whole number, this paper advances the political counterpart of “odd taxation” using a panel of Danish municipal taxes. First, the distribution of tax decimals is non-uniform and resembles the distribution of price-endings data. Second, nine-ending and other higher-end decimals are found to be over-represented which echoes odd pricing research. It suggests that incumbents take voters' biases into account and apply odd taxes to minimize the political costs of taxation while maximizing revenue. Attention should be given to how policy digits are arranged to exploit voters' cognitive biases. [R]</p>

<p>This article provides an overview of equality policies at the local level, based on a study carried out in Spanish municipalities with between 25,000 and 100,000 inhabitants. Special attention is given to the impact of variables such as the political composition of municipal governing bodies, the gender of the highest political authority and how the size of the municipality influences the development of gender policies. Our findings show that though efforts in this area have achieved greater institutionalization of gender equality policies due to the establishment of gender-related normative and administrative tools and the increased structural capacity of municipal administrations, these do not guarantee consistently transversal or broad implementation of equality plans in local governmental actions. However, and in line with prior studies, a positive correlation was found between the ideological profile of the governing political party, progress in equality plans and greater permeability in female access to executive positions.

<p>Political scientists have widely explored why legislatures pass campaign finance regulations and how these laws condition the influence of organized interests over elected officials. Studies have not explained how state houses can overcome entrenched interests, to pass more restrictive legislative lobbying laws. Interest group pressure can be overcome when routine politics are impacted by agenda-setting environments and broader state political contexts that prompt the passage of legislative lobbying reforms. Findings suggest that although moralistic political culture and political scandals set the agenda for stricter regulation, the prospects for reform are tempered by the power of organized interests in state houses.

<p>The longstanding emphasis on the neighborhood as a scale for intervention and action has given rise to a variety of forms of governance with a number of different rationales. The predominant rationales about the purpose of neighborhood governance are encapsulated in a fourfold typology developed by V. Lowndes and H. Sullivan (“How low can you go? Rationales and challenges for neighborhood governance”, <italic>Public Administration</italic>, 2008: 53–74; <italic>Abstr</italic>. 59.629). This article tests this approach by drawing on an evaluation of neighborhood initiatives in the City of Westminster [UK] which were delivered through a third-sector organization, the Paddington Development Trust. “Insider” perspectives gathered at city and neighborhood levels regarding the infrastructure for neighborhood management are discussed and evaluated in the light of these rationales.

<p>This paper examines corporate governance disclosures on the websites of Australian state government departments. It focuses on the nature and extent of governance information and the ease of finding this information directly on department websites and also in annual reports which are downloadable from websites. Our sample comprises six departments from each of the six states in Australia, giving a sample size of 36 departments. Our findings indicate considerable variability in both the level of disclosure and the accessibility of the information disclosed. The study also highlights a lack of consensus regarding the meaning of governance and what governance comprises, together with the need for a more structured approach to communicating governance information to stakeholders.

<p>An urge to reform local government in Portugal requires a sensitive approach to the role of social capital and, particularly, to the consequences of local governance arrangements in its formation. This research agenda, greatly influenced by the identification of positive externalities of social capital, has generated several claims regarding the need for proactive and objective top-down initiatives. Though assuming that institutions and public policies can have positive effects on social capital-building, this article focuses on the challenges met by local administration reform, arguing that it requires a four-fold approach: the identification of local government functions and the role of the state; a close look at institutional design and citizen engagement mechanisms; correct tools for allowing civil society reinforcement and social capital-building; and recognizing political leadership as a fundamental aspect of a governance arrangement.

<p>This article investigates the main political institutions in the sub-national democracies of Austria, Germany and Switzerland. It applies A. Lijphart's approach to these German-speaking countries in Western Europe and expands it by direct democracy. Two dimensions of democracy can be distinguished. While the first can be considered as the “consensual dimension” of democracy, the second represents the “rules of the game”. Moreover, and in contrast to analyses at the national level, direct democracy does not constitute a dimension on its own, but forms an important element of consensus decision-making in the sub-national units at hand. Finally, three homogenous national clusters were found, but also one cluster with sub-national democracies from Germany and Austria that are more similar to one another than to other Länder within their respective federal states.

<p>Education policy in Germany experienced a boom throughout the 2000s. Numerous reforms were implemented, quite far-reaching shifts of party programs occurred, and the scope of institutions with an educational mandate widened considerably. At the same time, <italic>Landtag</italic> elections came to be seen as less dominated by federal politics. Yet we still know little about education policy's electoral relevance. This article, following a most-likely design, analyzes those five <italic>Landtag</italic> elections held since the reform of federalism in 2006 for which the importance of education policy ought to have been highest. Even though education is one of the very few policies which the <italic>Länder</italic> can decide autonomously, and despite the recent upsurge of regional factors in determining the outcomes of such second-order elections, nearly all <italic>Landtag</italic> elections are won or lost on other battlefields.
