<p>This paper offers a thought-provoking approach to organizing health visiting services and programmes with consideration to addressing health inequities that shape the lives of families, particularly women and children. The authors identify a key premise that targeted-only services ‘will not achieve the major change in health inequalities that is needed’ (p. 111), underscoring the health enhancing potential not only of providing targeted – selective or indicative – services to families identified as vulnerable, disadvantaged, or ‘at risk’, but also of providing universal services to all families.</p>
<p>In support of their position, the authors provide a clear explanation of the <italic>population paradox</italic> that argues against an exclusive reliance on targeted approaches to service and programme organization. Although vulnerable subpopulations experience a higher proportion of cases than the general population, actual numbers of cases are often higher in the general population than in a subpopulation. This apparent paradox supports the need for universal prevention. In the context of fiscal sustainability, the authors recognize a need for community health assessment to determine the intensity of service delivery: disadvantaged populations warranting higher staffing and service intensity, and lower-need populations served by universal staffing and service organization.</p>
<p>The logic of the proposed system organization is consistent with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1744987111430608">Joyce and Bambra’s (2010)</xref> conclusion that coupling universal approaches with targeted interventions is necessary to avoid inequity in access to and uptake of resources intended to address health disparities. They position their work in relation to conditions and patterns of inequality in developed nations. Their conclusion is drawn from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1744987111430608">Graham and Kelly’s (2004)</xref> articulation of three approaches to understanding the relationship between inequalities and health status and to addressing health inequalities: health disadvantage, health gaps and health gradients. A health disadvantage approach, targeted to address the poor health of people who live in socially disadvantaged conditions, may improve individual health but may widen the health gap between the health of the most and least advantaged groups. A health gap approach, also targeted to population groups who live in the most disadvantaged social conditions, supports a faster-paced health impact intended to close the gap between the most and least disadvantaged. Graham and Kelly note, however, that this approach is limited by the typical focus on individual lifestyle rather than on root cause societal conditions. The health gradients approach broadens to focus on the majority of the population (i.e. all groups between the best and worst off groups) reflecting a universal approach that offers potential for the greatest population impact, although this potential is undercut if resources are disproportionately taken up by advantaged populations. This dynamic, however, can be mitigated by targeted approaches working together with a universal approach; hence, the recommendation for system-level coupling of universal and targeted approaches to service and program organization, as is persuasively advocated in the paper here.</p>
<p>The paper effectively takes up a caution noted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1744987111430608">Barros et al. (2010)</xref> that<disp-quote>
<p>‘policy-makers, planners and health workers should be aware that the way in which they plan and implement preventive and curative interventions often contributes to further increasing inequities. Mainstreaming equity considerations in the health sector is essential to ensure that those involved become part of the solution, rather than part of the problem’ (Barros et al., p. 50)</p></disp-quote>Variation in inequity patterns among countries should guide decisions about specific targeted services within a system of universal coverage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1744987111430608">Victora et al., 2005</xref>). In countries with least inequity, targeted service organization could effectively reach the relatively small proportion of disadvantaged children and families, whereas in highest inequity countries, services and programmes may need to be provided more universally.</p>
<p>I would, however, raise an additional caution that policy-makers, planners and health workers also should be mindful that the scope of interventions needs to encompass action, including policy advocacy, to address the root causes of inequities and not be limited to actions that may mitigate and manage health compromising conditions but that do not alter these conditions as root causes (Reutter and Kushner, 2010). In addition to effective system-level organization of services and programmes, such as advocated in the paper, health visitors, nurses, and others who work with families need to take action to address the social determinants of health that represent the root causes of health inequities for the populations with whom we work.</p>
