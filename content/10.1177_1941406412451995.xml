<p>Dietary patterns are a subject of growing interest considering the complex nature of dietary intake and its relationship with health outcomes. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between changes in adolescents’ BMI and their dietary trend pattern. This study is a follow-up of the children in the study titled “Dietary Intake and Physical Activity as Determinants of Changes in Body Mass Index in a Cohort of Adolescents Enrolled in Public Schools in Piracicaba, Sao Paulo,” and was conducted in public schools in Piracicaba, Sao Paulo, Brazil, with 372 adolescents participating in wave I (2004) and 268 participating in wave II (2005). Dietary intake was assessed using a semiquantitative food frequency questionnaire (SQFFQ), and height and weight measurements were also collected. The authors identified dietary patterns using principal component analysis. To describe dietary trends, they decided to match patterns across waves. Dietary patterns were gathered from 12 food groups. Relative risk was calculated by dividing the incidence of overweight among boys and girls across quintiles of dietary pattern scores. Matching C1 wave I and C1 wave II shows a multigroup trend pattern based on consumption of high levels of fruit, cereals, fatty foods, meat/eggs, milk, and vegetable groups. The relative risk for overweight was significantly lower for boys between the quintiles of this pattern (P &lt; .05). The main results indicate that sustaining a healthy eating pattern for adolescents living without any nutritional intervention is of primary importance in maintaining or reducing BMI at this age.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Adolescence is a transition period characterized by biological and social changes, especially changes in behavior. In the period from childhood to adolescence, young people are at increased risk of undesirable weight gain. This may happen because, at this age, children have more decision-making power about what they eat and how they spend their leisure time.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1941406412451995">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1941406412451995">2</xref></sup> Among the behaviors with the potential to negatively influence the energy balance or induce adverse health outcomes are skipping breakfast, low-frequency of attendance at or dropping out from sports clubs, increase in computer use, increase in snacking and soft drink consumption.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1941406412451995">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>Recent evidence indicates that the diet profile of adolescents is characterized by a high proportion of processed foods; high-energy-density foods; high content of saturated fats, sugars, and sodium; and food poor in fiber.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1941406412451995">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1941406412451995"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1941406412451995"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1941406412451995"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1941406412451995">8</xref></sup> This consumption profile combined with low levels of physical activity are recognized as the major behavioral risk factors for morbidity and mortality in adulthood and have their origin in adolescence.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1941406412451995">9</xref></sup> Several studies have reported the relationship between diet components, eating behaviors, and overweight among adolescents.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1941406412451995">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1941406412451995">11</xref></sup> The dietary patterns characterized by high intake of sugar and fats and low intake of fruits and vegetables are positively associated with weight gain in this group.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1941406412451995">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1941406412451995">13</xref></sup> The analysis of association between dietary patterns and chronic diseases is more refined and effective because it can clearly describe food practices observed in populations than the analysis of the only the nutrients consumed. Furthermore, it allows us to identify more homogeneous subgroups whose practices are good markers for or are directly associated with healthy outcomes or health risk.</p>
<p>A promising approach to estimate the relationship between dietary patterns and chronic diseases is principal component analysis (PCA). PCA is a multivariate statistical method that has become increasingly popular in nutritional epidemiology to investigate the relationship between diet as a whole and health outcome in contrast to traditional methods that highlight specific nutrients or a single food instead of diet.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1941406412451995">14</xref></sup> The use of PCA allows us to identify the underlying dimensions in a large number of variables in the same context and is based on the intercorrelations among these variables and also takes into account food practices as a whole.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1941406412451995">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>Few studies in Brazil have investigated the effect of dietary patterns on adolescents’ BMI using PCA. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between changes in adolescents’ BMI and the dietary trend pattern. The hypothesis is that healthy dietary behaviors will contribute to less weight gain, whereas unhealthy dietary habits, such as frequent consumption of sweetened beverages, dessert, foods with sugar added, and fatty foods, will be related to a greater weight gain.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<sec id="section3-1941406412451995">
<title>Participants and Study Design</title>
<p>We have used available data from the study titled Dietary Intake and Physical Activity as Determinants of Changes in Body Mass Index in a Cohort of Adolescents Enrolled in Public Schools in Piracicaba, Sao Paulo. Piracicaba has around 368 000 inhabitants (20% of them adolescents) and shows a predominance of public schools attended in most cases by children and adolescents from lower socioeconomic classes with some homogeneity in eating behavior.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1941406412451995">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1941406412451995"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1941406412451995">17</xref></sup> In the original research, a probabilistic sample covering all municipal students from public schools was drawn in a bistage sampling of conglomerates, stratified by school grade. In the first stage, the primary sampling units were all public schools and, in the second stage, the secondary sampling units comprised all school grades in each school. Further details of baseline sample procedures are provide elsewhere.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1941406412451995">16</xref></sup> The original study had 2 waves: baseline was carried out from month 1 to month 2 in 2004 (wave I, hereafter) and the follow-up from month 1 to month 2 in 2005 (wave II, hereafter). The interval between the 2 assessments was, on average, 12 months. In both waves, anthropometric measurements were taken, and dietary intake was assessed. In wave I, 372 individuals (170 boys and 202 girls) were interviewed, and in wave II, 268 (118 boys and 150 girls) were interviewed; the age range was 10 to 15 years. The attrition rate was 28%. The main reasons for follow-up losses were address, school, and phone number changes, which made tracking of adolescents more difficult. Using baseline (2004) data, we compared adolescents who did not finish the study with those who did, using an unpaired <italic>t</italic> test, to assess potential follow-up bias. The comparison showed that the baseline sample was different from the follow-up sample, so we decided to conduct the analysis separately in the 2 waves.</p>
<p>The original research was authorized by the Department of Education of the state of Sao Paulo and the Department of Education of Piracicaba and approved by the Ethics Committee of the School of Public Health of the University of Sao Paulo. Signed informed consent was obtained from the parents of the adolescents.</p>

<sec id="section4-1941406412451995">
<title>Anthropometric Measurement</title>
<p>Weight was measured on an electronic platform scale to the nearest 0.1 kg. Height was measured to the nearest millimeter using a stadiometer, attached to the wall with no baseboards. All measurement procedures were performed according to the standardization proposed by Lohman et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1941406412451995">18</xref></sup> BMI (in kg/m<sup>2</sup>) was calculated and is expressed as standard deviation (Z scores) of the WHO 2007 growth reference for school-aged children and adolescents. The cutoff used to identify overweight children was ≥1 (<italic>Z</italic> scores) and obese was ≥2 (<italic>Z</italic> scores).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1941406412451995">19</xref></sup> There was no outlier in the anthropometric data.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1941406412451995">
<title>Dietary Assessment</title>
<p>Dietary intake was assessed by a semiquantitative food frequency questionnaire (SQFFQ) in paper format, with 94 food items.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1941406412451995">20</xref></sup> Trained researchers interviewed adolescents and filled out the questionnaires. Participants were asked to indicate how often they consumed each food over the past 6 months by checking frequency categories from 1 to 7, ranging from <italic>never</italic> to ≥<italic>2 times a day</italic>. The main characteristic of this SQFFQ is the inclusion of food and portions that are often consumed by adolescents, which allows the calculation of calories and macronutrients. This tool has been shown to be valid and reproducible for adolescents.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1941406412451995">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1941406412451995">21</xref></sup> The total calories for each individual were calculated through the foods reported in SQFFQ. If the total calories were ≥7500 kcal/d (31 in 2004 and 10 in 2005), it was considered an outlier or an error, and the participant’s data were excluded from further analysis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1941406412451995">22</xref></sup> Consumption data were analyzed using the Dietsys 4.01 software (National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD; Block et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1941406412451995">23</xref></sup>), which is specifically used to analyze food frequency questionnaires.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1941406412451995">
<title>Food Groups</title>
<p>We classified the 94 original food items present in SQFFQ into 12 groups based on their nutrient profile and culinary use. Foods with a high level of lipids were classified as oils/fats when the density was equal to or more than 10 g of lipid per 100 g and as fatty foods when the density was below that. The 12 food groups used for this analysis were the following: fruits, vegetables, cereals, desserts, and sugar-added products (chocolates, ice cream, cakes, and mousses); beans, pasta/breads, milk/dairy, meat/eggs, sandwiches (pizza, sandwiches, hot dogs, and fast foods); sweetened beverages (noncarbonated fruit drinks, sweetened natural fruit juice, and regular soda); fatty foods (fried snacks and French fries); and oils and fat (butter, margarine, olive oil, and mayonnaise). To estimate the main components, which we called “C” for each wave, we used the frequency (in times per day) for each food group as the unit of analysis.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1941406412451995">
<title>Identification of Dietary Patterns</title>
<p>We collected data from SQFFQ and estimated dietary patterns using PCA. PCA provides components obtained from linear combinations among all the observed variables. The coefficients (eigen vectors) that define the variable contribution within each component are called loadings; the sum of squared factor loadings within a component is the eigen value.</p>
<p>The components were estimated separately from wave I and wave II data. We considered a component as a dietary pattern if it was significant, consecutively, in accordance with the Kaiser criterion (eigen value &gt; 1); the eigen value is placed before the “elbow” seen in the scree diagram and also interpretable in terms of food behavior. At wave I, we retained 3 components and 4 at wave II with all criteria. We named dietary patterns according to their order of extraction in C1, C2, C3, and C4. Within each pattern, we highlighted variables (food groups) with loads equal or superior to |0.3|.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1941406412451995">24</xref></sup> Predicted scores were estimated for each dietary pattern.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1941406412451995">
<title>Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>To describe dietary trends, we decided to match patterns across waves by calculating the average difference among loadings and performing Spearman correlations among dietary patterns. We considered matched dietary patterns that had a sum of average loadings difference close to zero and a greater Spearman coefficient. We called the first match a multigroup trend pattern because it is based on the fruit/beans/meat/eggs group, the second match a high-density energy trend pattern (HIDE) because it is based on sandwiches/desserts and sugar-added/sweetened beverages groups, and the third match a changing pattern because we detected a change from positive to negative and vice versa among the strongest variable loadings. These names do not perfectly describe each underlying pattern but help report and discuss the results.</p>
<p>We used the Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin (KMO) measure to evaluate the sampling adequacy and Cronbach’s α to compute the interitem correlation or covariance. We divided each predicted score of dietary pattern into quintiles and calculated the median of BMI <italic>Z</italic> within quintiles. Afterward, we calculated means and differences among BMI <italic>Z</italic> across quintiles of matched dietary patterns. To demonstrate the effect of dietary patterns on the adolescents’ BMI, we plotted BMI <italic>Z</italic> difference versus its means.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1941406412451995">25</xref></sup> To demonstrate the effect, when it happens, we rearranged the horizontal axis to plot values from the lowest to the highest quintile of the dietary pattern. Pearson’s correlation coefficient was calculated between BMI differences, and matched dietary patterns were found. Relative risks were calculated by dividing the incidence of overweight among boys and girls across quintiles of dietary pattern scores. We set the first quintile as basic risk because it shows the lower scores from each dietary pattern. All statistical analyses and anthropometric index computations were performed using Stata, version 11 (StataCorp, College Station, TX).</p>

<sec id="section9-1941406412451995" sec-type="results">
<title>Results</title>
<p>Dietary patterns were gathered from 12 predefined food group variables. In wave I, the 3 first and significant components account for 57% of data variance. In wave II, the 4 significant components account for 60% of data variance. The components did not have statistically significant differences when stratified by age; therefore, we decided to keep the same patterns for all ages. The component C1 at wave I is different from others; all its variables shows strong and positive loads. Components and variable loads are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1941406412451995">Table 1</xref>. The KMO was considered adequate because it is &gt;0.6 for wave I (KMO = 0.66) and wave II (KMO = 0.70). A high internal consistency among food groups was observed according to Cronbach’s α: 0.82 in wave I and 0.70 in wave II.</p>

<p>The matching of C1-I and C1-II describes a multigroup trend pattern that is based on high levels of fruit, cereals, fatty foods, meat/eggs, milk, and vegetable consumption, in addition to a decrease in oil/fat and sandwich consumption. The matching of C2-I and C3-II describes a high-density energy trend pattern (called HIDE) marked by consumption of low levels of beans, cereals, fruits, and milk and high levels of fatty foods, oil/fat, sandwiches, and sweetened beverages. The matching of C3-I and C4-II describes a changing trend pattern from negative or positive to the opposite ones loading across waves. This case highlights the change from positive to negative loadings of fruits, vegetables, and meat/eggs groups and change from negative to positive loadings of beans, fatty foods, and milk groups.</p>
<p>BMI changes matching C1-I and C1-II are negative across waves. This trend is stronger among girls, especially the ones who maintain a high position in the dietary pattern, described by the first component in both waves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1941406412451995">Figure 1</xref>). Among boys, the effect of dietary pattern on BMI changes is lower than among girls. The Pearson correlation coefficient between BMI differences and the dietary pattern was 0.32.</p>

<p>Matching C2-I and C3-II BMI changes is positive across waves. This trend is more accentuated among boys than among girls. For virtually all boys, BMI differences are located beyond the line of no change in that comparison. The Pearson correlation coefficient between BMI differences and dietary pattern was −0.27.</p>
<p>Change of BMI across waves for C3-I and C4-II matching is positive and similar for boys and girls. This dietary pattern matching is completely different from the other ones previously seen. The Pearson correlation coefficient between BMI differences and dietary pattern was 0.11. The effect of crossing trends, from positive to negative and vice versa, over the spread of BMI differences, is more visible among boys.</p>
<p>It was observed that when consumption of the multigroup trend pattern is of greater intensity, it significantly improves the nutritional status for boys (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .05), so we can relate it to a higher-standard practice of maintaining an adequate nutritional status. Among girls this trend remains, though it is not significant (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1941406412451995">Table 3</xref>). The practice of maintaining the 2 other patterns found does not bring changes or improvements in the nutritional status of adolescents.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We have investigated the relationship between dietary intake and BMI change in adolescents living in a town with no intervention as regards food choice or weight management. The results of our study indicate that (<italic>a</italic>) changes in dietary patterns are accentuated over 1 year at this age and (<italic>b</italic>) a multigroup trend pattern based on high consumption of fruit, cereals, fatty foods, meat/eggs, milk, and vegetables has a favorable effect on BMI <italic>Z</italic> score. We examined differences across waves using mean factor loadings using PCA because we wished to focus on food groups. We believe that this is preferable for 2 reasons: (<italic>a</italic>) PCA is an analysis that is more focused on description of vectors in a population than on describing individual preferences; so we have decided to directly compare the unit of information, that is, loadings, rather than individual scores; (<italic>b</italic>) the loadings express the correlation between variables and components across the population. Therefore, loadings are to estimate associations among components, for example, food patterns at 2 moments in the same population.</p>
<p>In this study, the authors decided to use a sequential proceeding: the first criterion was Kaiser, the second one was choice interpretable components. Finally, we matched the interpretable components between waves. This sequence has overcome the limits of using Kaiser’s criteria uniquely, and we constructed a scree diagram as well. The elbow in this diagram has supported the decision we take in the 2 first phases in the proceedings, achieving reliable results.</p>
<p>The results pointed to 3 distinct dietary patterns based on data obtained from SQFFQ. These results differ slightly from those of Marchioni et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1941406412451995">26</xref></sup> The authors retained only 2 main components of dietary patterns for the Brazilian population, which they called <italic>traditional pattern</italic> and <italic>dual pattern</italic>. The traditional pattern is very similar to the multigroup trend pattern found in this study, whereas the dual pattern was similar to our pattern characterized as HIDE. These similarities suggest that our study has a sample with a profile similar to the Brazilian population, conferring transcendence to our results, which are similar to results found in a large urban sample in Brazil.</p>
<p>This study goes beyond a simple description of dietary patterns, and the evidence reveals that the maintenance of a dietary pattern with a wide variety of food groups helps reduce or maintain BMI at adolescence. Another important issue in this study is the analysis of a dietary pattern without nutritional and educational interventions—that is, the dietary pattern that contributes to BMI maintenance is a part of everyday life of these adolescents; it was not a pattern built or planned. A relevant finding was the identification of high consumption of sweetened beverages in the HIDE trend and changing pattern. Danyliw et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1941406412451995">27</xref></sup> also found a high consumption of sweetened beverages among adolescents, representing about 2% to 18% of the total energy in the diet. This is a worrying feature because the high consumption of soft drinks and sugar-sweetened carbonated beverages is often related to overweight among young people.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1941406412451995">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1941406412451995">29</xref></sup></p>
<p>Results indicate that following a multigroup trend pattern may be consistently important for long-term management of body weight, especially among girls. Therefore, differences in BMI <italic>Z</italic> score of more than 1 year are directly and significantly related to scores of positive support of a dietary pattern based on consuming high levels of fruit, cereals, fatty foods, meat/eggs, milk, and vegetable over the same time. This result is even more encouraging when we consider that there was no intervention on the dietary patterns of adolescents, showing that the protective effect against weight gain is associated with the practice of a healthy eating pattern.The fact that a proportion of adolescents has preserved healthy eating habits for 1 year or more has allowed us to explore this window of opportunity to promote healthy eating among adolescents and to identify the stability of dietary habits in a vital stage of the life cycle.</p>
<p>The effects of the dietary pattern on the BMI of adolescents that were identified in this study are consistent with other results obtained using similar analysis methods. Adherence to the Mediterranean diet guidelines was associated with BMI reduction in Greek adolescents.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1941406412451995">7</xref></sup> Pregnant women under diet management have a lower weight variation during the gestational period when compared with prepregnant women under no diet management.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1941406412451995">30</xref></sup> Changes in dietary pattern toward increasing fruit consumption and lowering snack food calories accounted for 43% of BMI reduction over 16 weeks.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1941406412451995">31</xref></sup> Yannakoulia et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1941406412451995">32</xref></sup> also found that consumption of vegetables, cooked meals, and eating dinner was negatively correlated with obesity indices.</p>
<p>The mechanisms underlying the associations we found remains unclear, but we suppose that such dietary patterns with low total energy in the diet are related to an equilibrated physical activity pattern and a general positive attitude about health. Potential mechanisms through which the healthy pattern may protect against weight gain and obesity development have been proposed, such as the low energy density, high fiber content, and low glycemic index.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1941406412451995">33</xref></sup></p>
<p>In contrast, we did observe that adolescents who practiced the HIDE trend pattern and changing pattern showed a positive range in BMI <italic>Z</italic> score over 1 year. In fact, other studies have found similar associations between dietary patterns characterized by high consumption of fast foods, snacks, sweetened beverages, and weight gain.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1941406412451995">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1941406412451995">35</xref></sup> Reilly et al,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1941406412451995">36</xref></sup> examining the relationship of dietary patterns at 3 years of age (derived by PCA) with body mass index at 7 years, have shown that there is an association between junk food patterns and greater risk of obesity. We believe that these dietary patterns would be associated with weight gain because of the high proportion of fats and sugars in the intake as a percentage of energy.</p>
<p>The present study has some limitations. The first one is that the PCA method has some weaknesses that came from various subjective decisions that the investigators were required to make during data analysis, such as the subjective nature of food intake classification before the analysis, the choice of the number of components to be extracted, and the labeling of the components. In contrast, PCA has the advantage of allowing the combination of information across the diet based on food intakes, considering the complexity of the diet, and revealing underlying food consumption patterns. This means that it may be more relevant to dietary choices than analyses based on individual foods and/or nutrients. Another limitation is the short interval between the 2 assessments. The time period studied here (12 months) may not be sufficient to produce important changes in behavior and BMI <italic>Z</italic> score.</p>

<sec id="section11-1941406412451995" sec-type="conclusions">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Our results suggest that sustaining an eating pattern with a large variety of food groups, as a whole, may constitute a potential preventive approach in maintaining or reducing BMI at this age. These results are in line with public health strategies that encourage the consumption of fruit and vegetables, fruit juice with no added sugar, and basic foods such as cereals and beans and should be promoted to prevent excessive annual increases in BMI <italic>Z</italic> score among adolescents. Obesity in adolescents represents a critical window of opportunity for intervention—not only to address an existing health problem but as a secondary prevention strategy for the array of medical and social consequences associated with obesity over the life span. Our findings may provide practical guidance for nutrition interventions and education because the overall patterns of dietary intake are easier to translate to the public.</p>
<p>The components obtained from the 2 time points in this study were mostly consistent in terms of food that loaded highly and the sizes of those loadings. However, the emergence of a new component over time (at wave II) reveals that further investigations are still needed to determine the factors driving these changes in dietary pattern scores.</p>
