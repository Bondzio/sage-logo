<abstract>
<p>The incidence of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is predicted to grow by multiples in the coming decades, and today's young adults will be formal and/or informal caregivers in unprecedented numbers. Their ability to support the independence and well-being of people with AD will depend on their ability to identify intact social and cognitive abilities, selfhood, and needs of people with AD. This case study, conducted in an undergraduate seminar, provides preliminary, suggestive evidence for the educational advantages of a Bio-Psycho-Social approach to understanding these aspects of people with AD. Findings revealed a striking increase in students’ accurate understanding of: (1) the losses due to AD; (2) intact positive qualities in and inaccurate negative stereotypes about people with AD; and (3) important needs of people with AD. These are discussed in light of extant theory. The application of this approach in the case of one student and her family is explored.</p>

<body>
<p>The aging of the baby-boom generation and increased longevity means that the incidence of Alzheimer's disease (AD) in the United States alone will grow to more than 13 million people by mid-century in the absence of a cure or preventive measures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1471301211416612">Hebert, Scherr, Bienias, Bennett, &amp; Evans, 2003</xref>). This ‘tidal wave’, as it were, will bring with it tremendous financial and emotional costs. The consequences for other industrialized, as well as so-called third world, nations will be no less severe, and today's young adults will be faced with providing for the care and well-being of their elders who have been diagnosed. The quality of life of those diagnosed and that of their families will be optimal only if (a) formal and informal caregivers are, to the greatest extent possible, knowledgeable about the remaining intact abilities and the needs of care recipients such that (b) those abilities can be encouraged and engaged appropriately and the needs met, while simultaneously minimizing excess disability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1471301211416612">Brody, 1971</xref>). The biomedical approach to understanding AD, dominant for most of the 20th century, focused principally and understandably on the deficits displayed by those diagnosed, but this approach virtually ignored their intact cognitive and social abilities and the contexts in which those abilities were displayed despite striking deficits observed in clinical testing.</p>
<p>In more recent years, a Bio-Psycho-Social model has been advanced and has focused on the person with AD in terms of his or her intact selfhood, the nature and quality of his or her subjective experience, as well as the effects of social situations on his or her cognitive and social abilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1471301211416612">Bender &amp; Cheston, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1471301211416612">Clare, 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1471301211416612">2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1471301211416612">2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1471301211416612">Cotrell and Schultz, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1471301211416612">Downs, 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1471301211416612">2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1471301211416612">Downs &amp; Bowers, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1471301211416612">Harris 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1471301211416612">Holst and Hallberg, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1471301211416612">Hubbard, Tester, and Downs, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1471301211416612">Hughes, 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1471301211416612">2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1471301211416612">Hughes, Louw, and Sabat, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1471301211416612">Innes, 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1471301211416612">2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1471301211416612">2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1471301211416612">Keady, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1471301211416612">Keady &amp; Gilliard, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1471301211416612">Killick &amp; Allan, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1471301211416612">Kitwood, 1990</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1471301211416612">1993</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1471301211416612">1996</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1471301211416612">1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1471301211416612">1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1471301211416612">Kitwood &amp; Bredin, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1471301211416612">Kontos, 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1471301211416612">2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1471301211416612">Lyman, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1471301211416612">Post, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1471301211416612">Sabat, 1991</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1471301211416612">1994</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1471301211416612">1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1471301211416612">2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1471301211416612">2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1471301211416612">2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1471301211416612">2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1471301211416612">2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1471301211416612">Sabat &amp; Collins, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1471301211416612">Sabat &amp; Harré, 1992</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1471301211416612">1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1471301211416612">Sabat, Fath, Moghaddam, &amp; Harré, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1471301211416612">Sabat, Napolitano, &amp; Fath, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1471301211416612">Snyder, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1471301211416612">Temple, Sabat, &amp; Kroger, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1471301211416612">Wilkinson, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1471301211416612">Washburn, Sands, &amp; Walton, 2003</xref>;). The Bio-Psycho-Social model illuminates what people with AD can experience and accomplish whether they are in the mild, moderate, or severe stages of the disease as defined by standard methods of assessment carried out in hospital clinics or similar venues, and regardless of whether they live at home or in a residential assisted living setting of one or another kind. Intuitively, it would seem that the information provided by the Bio-Psycho-Social model, with its focus on the totality of the person in question, would be beneficial to caregivers and care-recipients alike.</p>
<p>The process of caregiving is fraught with challenges that can have a profound impact on the lives of caregivers and care recipients and numerous investigators have documented this reality (for example, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1471301211416612">Ayres, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1471301211416612">Corbeil, Quayhagen, &amp; Quayhagen, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1471301211416612">Farran, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1471301211416612">Grant, Ramcharan, McGrath, Nolan, &amp; Keady, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1471301211416612">Perren, Schmid, &amp; Wettstein, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1471301211416612">Sanders, Ott, Kelber, &amp; Noonan, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1471301211416612">Toseland &amp; Rossiter, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1471301211416612">Vitaliano, Young, &amp; Russo, 1991</xref>). Often, caregiving requires that healthy others make what may be termed sacrifices for their loved ones. In a recent initial study of young adults’ attitudes about AD, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1471301211416612">Lundquist and Ready (2008)</xref> found that those among their sample who had what they defined as ‘high contact’ with someone diagnosed with AD, would be more willing to make personal sacrifices for the diagnosed person than would those who had ‘no contact’ with a person with AD. Interestingly, and perhaps counter-intuitively, the authors also found that there were ‘no significant differences in levels of sympathy between the no-contact, low-contact, and high-contact groups’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1471301211416612">Lundquist &amp; Ready, 2008</xref>, p. 271). The subjects in the survey also took a brief quiz intended to assay their ‘basic knowledge of AD’. The quiz consisted of 15 questions ‘based on general knowledge facts about AD from the Alzheimer's Association website’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1471301211416612">Alzheimer's Association, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1471301211416612">Lundquist &amp; Ready, 2008</xref>, p. 269). No significant differences were found among those in the ‘no contact, low contact, and high contact’ groups on the measure of knowledge about AD, ‘…further suggesting that even without contact, young adults have generally an equal amount of knowledge about AD’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1471301211416612">Lundquist &amp; Ready, 2008</xref>, p. 272) according to the authors. The authors concluded that: (1) young adults’ willingness to make personal sacrifices for people with AD was associated with close and intimate contact with people diagnosed; and (2) ‘…<italic>there is a great need to learn more about the perceptions (and misperceptions) about the disease and how to improve their</italic> [the young adults’] <italic>attitudes and willingness to help and provide care for persons with the disease’</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1471301211416612">Lundquist &amp; Ready, 2008</xref>, p. 272, my italics).</p>
<p>There is every reason to agree with the second of the above points and it is to this matter that the present work is addressed primarily. Another, but closely related, focus of the present work is the assertion that it is close and intimate contact with, rather than knowledge about, people with AD that is the most important factor with regard to young adults’ attitudes toward, and willingness to make sacrifices for, people with AD. More specifically, I sought to understand more clearly what young adults thought about people with AD, what the disease meant to them, what they knew about AD, what they thought they knew about AD, and if and how a Bio-Psycho-Social approach would inform them further about people diagnosed as well as about the disease itself. Although Lundquist and Ready reported that there were no significant group differences in knowledge about AD among the young adults they studied, their measure of ‘knowledge’ must be examined carefully and not accepted blithely at face value. That is to say, it is vitally important first of all to analyze the information about AD presented on the Alzheimer's Association website, because the type of a priori knowledge one has or does not have may have a great effect on one's attitudes toward and beliefs about people who have been diagnosed as well as on one's willingness and ability to be of help to such people (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1471301211416612">Phillips, Rempusheski, &amp; Morrison, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1471301211416612">Phillips et al., 1995</xref>).</p>
<p>The information presented on the website that was used to test the knowledge of the subjects in the above study is biomedical information about neurofibrillary tangles, amyloid plaques, areas of the brain affected, the relationship between damage to those areas of the brain and to losses in some general aspects of learning, memory, language, and executive function. There is also a discussion of different stages of the disease and some general discussion of the losses related to each stage, as well as a presentation of some graphics regarding the shrinkage of the brain as a function of the severity of the illness. Thus, the ‘knowledge component’ employed in the above study was limited to knowledge about the disease – biomedical knowledge.</p>
<p>Missing from the ‘knowledge’ component employed in the above study, then, were: (a) the subjective experiences of people diagnosed, including their psychological reactions to the losses they experience; (b) how they are treated by others and their reactions to that treatment; (c) their remaining intact social and cognitive abilities; and (d) how being diagnosed affects them and the social aspects of their lives. In other words, the knowledge component employed in the study by Lundquist and Ready was concerned with ‘the disease the person has' rather than ‘the person the disease has’. We thus come face to face with the questions to which the present study was addressed:
<list id="list1-1471301211416612" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>How does knowledge about points (a), (b), (c), and (d) above affect young adults’ thoughts about people with AD?; and</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>In relation to the study reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1471301211416612">Lundquist and Ready (2008)</xref>, is it necessary to have ‘close and intimate’ connections with people with AD in order to see such people as being, in the authors’ words, ‘…persons in need of assistance and support’?</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>According to Lundquist and Ready, having ‘close and intimate’ connections with people with AD, rather than having knowledge about AD, increases the extent to which a person is willing to make sacrifices to care for people diagnosed. The logic behind this notion is that personal contact, rather than knowledge and degrees of sympathy, improves peoples’ attitudes about AD and improvements in attitude yield increased willingness to make sacrifices. Important to this entire discussion is the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1471301211416612">Thorngate (1993)</xref> who, in a very important paper, asserted, ‘Qualitative research changes hearts more effectively than does quantitative research because qualitative research… can more easily communicate practical examples’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1471301211416612">Thorngate, 1993</xref>, p. 244) and ‘…is generally more concerned with experience than behaviour’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1471301211416612">Thorngate, 1993</xref>, p. 249). The points here are that: (1) qualitative research can yield knowledge that can increase one's sympathy and empathy for people with AD (i.e., can change caregivers’ hearts) by conveying the concrete experiences of people with AD, whereas abstract biomedical knowledge, that is based on behavior and quantitative information, cannot; and (2) qualitative knowledge can, therefore, provide understanding about ‘the person the disease has’ (selfhood, aspects of social life and social cognition, for example) that abstract biomedical knowledge cannot. In addition to biomedical information, a Bio-Psycho-Social approach to understanding persons with AD features prominently the kind of qualitative approaches that Thorngate discusses. So the degree to which knowledge about people with AD is important to young adults’ attitudes about people with AD may depend on the kind of knowledge (abstract biomedical vs. concrete qualitative, bio-psycho-social) young adults have and it is this issue to which the present work was addressed primarily. Specifically, what kind of knowledge did young people have before becoming aware of the Bio-Psycho-Social approach and what kind of knowledge did they have after having become aware of the information gained from this approach? Furthermore, what effect did knowledge derived from a Bio-Psycho-Social model have on how a young person viewed, and behaved toward, a relative with AD and how did the conveying of that knowledge to her family affect the family system?</p>
<sec id="sec1-1471301211416612" sec-type="methods"><title>Method</title>
<p>This study emerged from a one-semester seminar course given to 15 first year (first semester) college students. Each student applied to take the course by writing an essay explaining to the personnel in the College Dean's office, who decided whether or not the students would be admitted to the course, why they wanted to take this particular seminar, as this was one of ten different seminars available, each focusing on a different area of study. Ten students in the course had no direct experience with persons with AD, four had a grandparent who had been diagnosed, and one student had a grandparent who died with a malignant brain tumor.</p>
<p>The course ran for fourteen weeks, meeting twice a week for 75 minutes per meeting and students were required to write eight short papers (approximately six double-spaced, typewritten pages) that examined self-chosen aspects of readings assigned and class discussions held in the immediately preceding two weeks (approximately). Class discussions and readings included, but were not limited to, the assets and limitations of qualitative and quantitative approaches to research, the subjective experiences and remaining intact cognitive and social abilities of people with AD in the mild, moderate, and severe stages of the disease, along with areas of brain damage that appear to be most frequently involved and the cognitive functions that are implicated. Thus, class discussions and readings were based on a Bio-Psycho-Social approach. The readings chosen to reflect this approach included the following books listed in the order in which they were assigned: <italic>Speaking Our Minds: Personal Reflections From Individuals with Alzheimer's</italic> by Lisa Snyder; <italic>The Person with Alzheimer's Disease: Pathways to Understanding the Experience</italic>, edited by Phyllis Braudy Harris; and <italic>The Experience of Alzheimer's Disease: Life Through a Tangled Veil</italic> by the present author. The students also visited, during one class meeting, the website provided by the Alzheimer's Association that was used in the study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1471301211416612">Lundquist and Ready (2008)</xref> noted earlier and the information presented therein was discussed.</p>
<p>In order to gain an understanding of what the students knew and thought of regarding AD at the beginning of the course, each was asked to prepare a list of up to ten descriptors/ideas/characteristics that came to mind when they thought of Alzheimer's and then, for the second to last class meeting of the semester, they were asked to prepare another such list. The students were not told, after having prepared the first list at the beginning of the semester, that they would be asked to prepare another list at the end of the course. Thus, we have a ‘pre-’ and ‘post-’ examination of the effect of learning about AD through the lens of the Bio-Psycho-Social model. The results are presented below.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-1471301211416612" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title>
<p>The descriptors that the students provided were presented in class and discussed. Subsequently, these data were organized into five broad categories:
<list id="list2-1471301211416612" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Negative-dispositional</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Negative-situational</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Positive</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Needs</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Neutral</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>The first category, Negative-dispositional, refers to terms that can be considered losses or dysfunctions that are viewed as being problematic attributes of the person with AD as a result of the disease itself. In other words, such attributes are part of the person's disposition. Negative-situational refers to problems experienced by the person with AD that exist in the person's social world, that are not due directly to the neuropathology of the disease, but rather to the ways in which healthy others react to, or treat, the person with AD. Positive attributes are characteristics that are generally thought of as being worthy, admirable, or otherwise valued in the local culture. Needs include those aspects of everyday life that the person with AD lacks, and therefore needs, to one or another degree due to the disease as well as due to social dynamics. The category called Neutral refers to attributes that are neither positive nor negative, in and of themselves, but can be said to be true of AD.</p>
<p>The list below presents the students' responses at the beginning of the course. Numbers in parentheses next to attributes indicate the number of times a particular attribute was mentioned. If there is no parenthetical number, the attribute was mentioned once.</p>

<p>The list immediately below presents the students’ responses compiled during the final week of the course. Some responses may require brief explanation. For example, malignant social psychology is a term coined by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1471301211416612">Kitwood and Bredin (1992)</xref> to describe the innocent, yet dysfunctional and depersonalizing, treatment given to people diagnosed with dementia. Malignant positioning is a term coined by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1471301211416612">Sabat (2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1471301211416612">2003</xref>) to describe the basis for malignant social psychology. Semiotic subjects is a term coined by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1471301211416612">Shweder and Sullivan (1990)</xref> that denotes persons whose behavior is driven by the meaning of situations as experienced and understood by those persons. Implicit memory refers to the phenomenon that a person's actions can be affected by, or can reflect, previous (new) experiences that the person cannot recall having had even if those experiences are days old; implicit memory has been shown to be intact in people with AD (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1471301211416612">Sabat, 2006</xref>). Self II and Self III are terms coined by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1471301211416612">Harré (1991)</xref> as parts of a tripartite Social Constructionist Theory of Selfhood and refer respectively to the aspect of the Self that is comprised of mental and physical attributes, past and present, including one's beliefs (Self II), and to the multiple social personae (devoted friend, demanding teacher, loving parent, romantic spouse, each of which has a unique behavioral pattern) that we construct with the help of at least one other person (Self III). Thus, Self II is threatened in people with AD because others come to see that person increasingly in terms of the negative attributes of AD and less and less in terms of the positive and worthy attributes the person still possesses. Self III is threatened because healthy others do not cooperate with the person with AD in the construction of worthy social personae, but instead see the person increasingly as the ‘burdensome, dysfunctional patient’ and so the public persona of the diagnosed individual becomes narrowed to something that is anathema to the individual him or herself. Hence, people with AD can be viewed as being ‘socially trapped’. Excess disability is a term coined by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1471301211416612">Brody (1971)</xref> to describe situations in which the disability displayed by persons is greater than that which would be predicted on the basis of brain injury alone.</p>

<p>At the end of the course, in the Negative-dispositional category we no longer see the following stereotypic negative attributes: dulled senses, anger/hostility, belligerence/stubbornness, confusion, frail, lethargy/apathy, childlike, loss of coherence, short attention span, no concept of time, burdensome, all of which are often highlighted in the mass media. On the other hand, we still find frustration, anxiety (fearful in the first list), depression, tangles/plaques (brain disorder in first list), struggle to recall (a far more accurate rendition of loss of STM and LTM in the first list), progressive, all of which are accurate.</p>
<p>The Negative-situational category at the end of the course included a number of attributes that are extremely important but that were not included in the list at the beginning of the course. These attributes, such as negative stereoptypes, being misunderstood, socially trapped, victims of malignant social psychology, all can exert powerfully negative effects on the experience and actions of people with AD as well as on the experience of caregivers. Thus, at the end of the course the students were far more keenly aware of the powerful effect that the social environment can have on people with AD.</p>
<p>The Positive attributes category at the end of the course contained a host of attributes that were not identified at the beginning of the course, when this category contained not one attribute whatsoever. Among those positive attributes named were: human, intelligent, interesting, concern for others, have interesting stories to tell, intact implicit memory, unique individuals, resourceful/adaptable/circumlocution, best communication when comfortable, rational needs and feelings, courageous, intact self, semiotic subjects, able to form new memories, people not patients. All of these attributes are thought to be positive in people who haven't been diagnosed with AD. Interestingly, the idea of people with AD using circumlocution was understood as being ‘resourceful’ rather than as being a dysfunction, as it is so often viewed in the interpretations made in formal language testing, because the communicative process is facilitated by the use of circumlocution when word-finding problems exist.</p>
<p>The Needs category at the end of the course expanded greatly to include a number of very important things that most human beings, healthy or otherwise, find to be extremely important in their everyday lives, far more important than the one need (for routine) that was included in this category at the beginning of the course.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec13-1471301211416612"><title>Extended results: Example of Ms. K</title>
<p>The results above are the collective responses of the fifteen members of the class on the second to last day of the course. In this section, I present an example of what might be considered ‘extended results' of the knowledge the students gained, for these results can be seen as being real-world, concrete, applications of learning subsequent to the course itself, thus reflecting what was retained from the course.</p>
<p>Three weeks after the end of the course, many of the students were home for the winter break. One of the students in the course was Ms. K. Her grandmother, who had been diagnosed with AD, was visiting the family for the holidays, having flown from her home in the northeast U.S. to the home of Ms. K and her family in the southeast U.S. This visit was typical of holiday seasons in recent years.</p>
<p>That Ms. K had assimilated what she learned in the course and applied that knowledge to the situations she confronted at home was made known to me in an email letter from her father, dated approximately four weeks after classes ended. Portions of that letter that are relevant to this study are as follows:
<disp-quote>
<p>Since she has been home, (daughter's name) has been a helpful guide through our challenges with her grandmother…From the very beginning, she helped us see things for what they were, which sometimes means seeing that they're not as bad as they seem. We learned quickly not to see everything through an AD worst-case scenario. For example: Her grandmother's trip got off to a difficult start when her flight idled on the runway… due to weather. (Ms. K's) grandmother, having been escorted to her seat by her son, fell asleep while the plane sat on the runway. She awoke just as the plane was preparing to take off. She exhibited confusion and insisted on getting off the plane; she apparently created a bit of a scene until the flight attendants (gladly, probably) allowed her to leave the plane, which then departed without her.</p>
<p>Through our conversations with (daughter's name), we came to see a reality far different from our presumed scenario, in which her grandmother forgot where she was, didn't know why she was on a plane, panicked and became demanding. In the reality (daughter's name) helped us see, her grandmother wasn't acting irrationally at all. When she woke up, she thought she had slept through takeoff… and had already landed. She thought the plane was preparing to take off for the second leg of its flight, to (name of state), and that she had failed to disembark. In insisting that she be able to get off the plane, she seems to have thought she was getting off in (name of city), her destination. All of which is quite rational.</p>
<p>It ended well. Her son returned to the airport, got her and she flew out the next day to (name of city). She's been with us since, and quite happily so. Yes, she sometimes can't recall a conversation we just had or a movie we just saw, but she's getting the jokes, following the conversations and responding appropriately. (Daughter's name), in her straight-up, ordinary dealings with her grandmother, has set an example for her younger sisters. They listen, pay attention and respond with conversation, laughter, eye-to-eye contact. They sit with her (their grandmother), relax with her, talk and walk with her. They don't fawn or pander; they're just with her, as they would be with a friend. I have to say they haven't always been that way with their grandmother; in previous visits, they could be impatient with her, annoyed by her, snarky about her – as teens sometimes are, as perhaps we all were at one time.</p>
<p>As a result, this has been our most delightful visit with their grandmother in years – not because she changed, but because they did.</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Thus, Ms. K modelled for her younger siblings what she incorporated from a Bio-Psycho-Social approach and thereby changed her siblings’ attitudes for the better and taught them how to interact with their grandmother in effective ways. As well, Ms. K served as a ‘helpful guide’ to her parents in terms of recognizing her grandmother's semiotic behavior as being such and thereby encouraged them not to interpret a variety of her grandmother's actions immediately as symptomatic of AD (‘not to see everything through an AD worst-case scenario’). The effect of the ‘social’ aspect of the Bio-Psycho-Social approach was made profoundly clear in the final line of the above letter, in which we discover that the delightful nature of the grandmother's visit was due not to the fact that the grandmother had changed, but to the fact that the younger siblings’ behavior toward their grandmother had changed for the better.</p>

<sec id="sec14-1471301211416612" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title>
<p>The present study provides striking support for the usefulness of the knowledge gained from a Bio-Psycho-Social model in that it can help to improve young adults’ beliefs and attitudes about and behavior toward people with AD. When, in addition to learning about brain damage and its effects on cognition and certain aspects of observable behavior, students were provided with qualitative information about the subjective experiences of people with AD, the important effects of healthy others’ actions and understanding on the ways in which people with AD can be helped or hindered, their understanding of people with AD was enhanced dramatically. This change in their understanding is seen vividly in how the attributes they associated with Alzheimer's changed from the beginning of the course to the end of the course.</p>
<p>Specifically we see:
<list id="list15-1471301211416612" list-type="alpha-lower">
<list-item><p>that their awareness of the remaining intact cognitive and social abilities of people with AD, as seen in the descriptors that fell into the Positive category, increased from 0% at the beginning of the course to 36.66% of their responses at the end of the course. One could refer to many of these attributes (e.g., concern for others, intact self, intact implicit memory, semiotic subjects, resourceful/adaptable/circumlocution, courageous, can converse, best communication when comfortable) as examples of what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1471301211416612">Kitwood and Bredin (1992)</xref> termed, ‘indicators of relative well-being’ – forms of behavior that are found in otherwise healthy people in everyday social life and, if found in people with AD, constitute a common ground between the healthy and those diagnosed.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>that their appreciation of the needs of people with AD increased from 0.89% of their responses to 19.33% of their responses and included needs that are quite common to all people whether or not they have been diagnosed with AD, and these too can be understood as exemplifying ‘indicators of relative well-being’;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>that they came to understand that losses experienced by people with AD are due not only, or even mainly, to the effects of brain injury, but also to the dysfunctional social situations (malignant social psychology and malignant positioning, for example) that people with AD confront. The latter point is seen clearly in the decrease in the ‘Negative-dispositional’ category from 75.89% of students’ responses at the outset of the course to 21.33% at the end of the course, and the corresponding increase in the ‘Negative-situational’ category from 9.82% of students’ responses at the beginning of the course to 18% at the end of the course. Part of the decrease in the ‘Negative-dispositional’ category reflected the fact that at the end of the course the students no longer included incorrect, negative stereotypic descriptors that are often prominent in the mass media. These include, but are not limited to: dulled senses, anger/hostility, belligerence/stubbornness, confusion, frail, lethargy/apathy, childlike, loss of coherence, short attention span, no concept of time, burdensome. On the other hand, students correctly described the primary memory problem as ‘struggle to recall’, rather than saying the incorrect, stereotypic, ‘Short-term and Long-term memory loss’ as they did at the beginning of the course. Thus, the students’ understanding of the dysfunctions attributable to AD <italic>per se</italic> was far more accurate at the end of the course than at the beginning.</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>Supported also by the present results is the view expressed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1471301211416612">Thorngate (1993)</xref> about the effect of qualitative information on people's understanding of a phenomenon, for the psycho-social aspects of the educational model used in the course, were rife with information gleaned from narrative, discourse analysis, interviews, and observational methods of study that brought to life the person with AD. One could argue that the students’ initial views were driven primarily by information derived from the biomedical model that has been dominant for decades, and its representation in the mass media. Thus their knowledge, as far as it went, was of the disease the person has, rather than about the person the disease has. Therefore, the fruits of qualitative research, that ‘…is generally more concerned with experience than behavior’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1471301211416612">Thorngate, 1993</xref>, p. 249), dramatically enhanced students’ appreciation of persons with AD. Learning about the personal and social experiences of people with AD can be said to enhance one's sympathy and empathy in ways that cannot be achieved by learning about the biomedical aspects of the disease.</p>
<p>For example, we see in the second list of attributes some that are especially powerful in this regard. Note that among the Negative-dispositional attributes is ‘struggle to recall’. This is quite different from saying ‘memory loss' or ‘episodic memory deficit’, or ‘short-term memory deficit’ because of the presence of the word ‘struggle’. It is not difficult to identify with an experience that entails a struggle, and this is also true for ‘frustrated/anxiety’ and ‘word-finding problems’. Note that these were mentioned 10, 5, and 9 times respectively. In the Negative-situational category, ‘misunderstood’ was mentioned 11 times. These terms are quite powerful emotionally and can conjure up feelings of empathy and sympathy in young adults who have their own vivid, meaningful experiences with struggle, frustration, anxiety, and feeling misunderstood. In the Needs category, the idea that people with AD need to be understood was mentioned 12 times. One can propose from these results that it is possible to increase young adults’ empathy and sympathy for people with AD not only by having close and intimate contact with them as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1471301211416612">Lundquist and Ready (2008)</xref> asserted, but also by becoming knowledgeable about their experience as unearthed by qualitative methods of research and then recognizing commonalities between aspects of the experiences of people with AD and aspects of one's own experiences.</p>
<p>The above points indicate, therefore, that modifications must be made to the position advanced by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1471301211416612">Lundquist and Ready (2008)</xref>, that knowledge about AD was not a significant factor in shaping the attitudes that young adults have about people with AD. Recall that in the study reported by the above authors, the knowledge component was principally biomedical knowledge derived from the Alzheimer's Association website and there were no significant differences found by the authors in the knowledge about AD displayed among the different groups of young adults who had varying degrees of contact with people with AD. The present results indicate that it is critical to take into account the <italic>type of knowledge</italic> that persons have, for it is clear that knowledge derived from a Bio-Psycho-Social approach can have profound effects on what young adults understand about people with AD and the extent to which they can empathize and sympathize as a result.</p>
<p>The present work bears also on the contributions of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1471301211416612">Phillips et al. (1989</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1471301211416612">1995</xref>) who discussed the relationship between caregivers’ expectations and their strategies for providing care. Their notion of Caregiving Dogmatism, as defined as caregivers’ beliefs that are based on a priori truth and assumptions rather than on empirical evidence, can underlie negative expectations and approaches to caregiving. Specifically, if we take the students’ reactions to and thoughts about AD and people thus diagnosed as seen at the beginning of the course as being a priori assumptions, it would follow that: (1) their expectations of and reactions to any person with AD would be reflections of those assumptions; and (2) their approaches to caregiving would be similarly affected. If on the other hand, the assumptions they hold are based on the knowledge that they demonstrated at the end of the course, there should be improvements in their approaches to caregiving. This latter point is seen quite clearly in the case of Ms. K and her family.</p>
<p>The case of Ms. K, and the quality of her interactions with her grandmother as reported by her father, also supports the idea that: (1) it is not necessarily only the ‘degree of contact’ that one has with a person with AD that affects one's attitudes as suggested by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1471301211416612">Lundquist and Ready (2008)</xref>, but that the type of knowledge that one has is also crucial; and (2) it is likewise the case that the type of knowledge one has can have a huge bearing on one's ability to see people with AD as being, in the authors' words, ‘…persons in need of assistance and support’. Ms. K and her siblings had equal degrees of contact with their grandmother, who lived a long distance away from their family. Yet after spending a semester learning about and internalizing the fruits of research about people with AD as revealed in a Bio-Psycho-Social model, Ms. K was able to serve as a ‘helpful guide’ for her parents and a positive model for her siblings in how she interacted with her grandmother. Her behavior toward her grandmother was guided by her new understanding of her grandmother's intact cognitive and social abilities, including the idea that her grandmother was a semiotic subject (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1471301211416612">Shweder &amp; Sullivan, 1990</xref>) whose behavior was driven by the meaning of the situations she confronted. Indeed, one could describe Ms. K's interactions with her grandmother as being exemplary of what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1471301211416612">Kitwood (1998)</xref> called, ‘positive person work’ (PPW). Included in PPW are such things as Recognition, where the person with AD is acknowledged as a person, listened to carefully, given direct eye contact; Validation, in which others attempt to understand the frame of reference of the person with AD and accept the reality of that person's experience in an empathetic way and, finally, Celebration, in which moments are experienced together as being joyful, wherein the quality of interaction is such that ‘…the division between caregiver and cared-for comes nearest to vanishing completely; all are taken up into a similar mood’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1471301211416612">Kitwood, 1998</xref>, p. 28). Ms. K's father reported these very aspects of PPW as having occurred in his younger daughters’ interactions with their grandmother as a result of the modeling provided by Ms. K.</p>
<p>With this kind of knowledge imparted to and modeled for her family, Ms. K's family members were able to refrain from seeing her grandmother's behavior solely from the point of view of an ‘AD worst-case scenario’ and instead were able to appreciate the same behavior as being logical and rational. In addition, the interactions between Ms. K's siblings and their grandmother improved dramatically so that their grandmother's visit during the holiday season was their ‘<italic>most delightful visit with their grandmother in years’.</italic> The reason for this change was indicated quite clearly in Ms. K's father's letter in which he noted it was ‘<italic>not because she changed, but because they did’</italic> (referring to his two younger daughters)<italic>,</italic> a fact that reaffirmed the idea that the ways in which others behave toward a person with AD can have a profound effect upon the behavior of the latter.</p>
<sec id="sec15-1471301211416612"><title>Questions and limitations</title>
<p>Certainly, it is fair to question the degree to which the present results may be generalized. To be sure, the effects observed in 15 people cannot be generalized any more than can the results in a single case study. Still, the results are striking and suggestive and further research will illuminate the degree to which they are common to others. Then too, one might ask about the extent to which the students’ responses were affected by their motivation to provide ‘the right answers’ and to ‘please the teacher’ so as to obtain a good grade in the course. To say that undergraduates at Georgetown University want to earn good grades may be regarded by some as an understatement, so the question is valid. As it happened, at the time the students were assigned to compile the second list, 87.5% of their course grade had already been determined and the remaining 12.5% was to be determined by their last paper. It was not the case, therefore, that by providing some ‘good answers’ on this exercise, the students’ grades would be enhanced. Interestingly, when we compiled the second list, a few students asked how that list compared to the first one compiled by the class. When I read aloud the responses they turned in three months earlier, most expressed shock at the number of negative, incorrect attributes they heard.</p>
<p>Then, too, one must consider the degree to which the focus of the course was directed toward issues that can have a profound impact in one's life and in the lives of loved ones – issues that go far beyond letter grades on one's transcript. In her final paper for the semester, Ms. K reflected upon what she had learned in the course and the fact that she would be seeing her grandmother during the holiday break that was on the horizon:
<disp-quote>
<p>As we read the first-person accounts in Lisa Snyder's book, I started to feel empathy – not sympathy – for these people. Their voices came off the page and their humanity was revealed in a very moving way. Through discussions and more readings I started to understand the real, complex problem of Alzheimer's from the social implications to personal emotions of both caregiver and care recipient.</p>
<p>I am very excited to see my grandmother and spend time with her in a way that I never have before…. I will be patient and open to my grandmother, looking for understanding and connection with her.</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>As can be seen from the letter written by Ms. K's father, she succeeded preeminently in applying the lessons she learned and thereby helped her entire family to interact with her grandmother in strikingly more helpful ways. As a result, everyone's experience, including that of her grandmother, was improved.</p>
<p>It remains to be seen, though worth investigating, whether learning about Alzheimer's from a Bio-Psycho-Social point of view can yield similar results with other young adults. Indeed, it may well be worth the time and effort to examine whether or not similar effects can be obtained among middle aged and older adults, for the potential benefits may be profoundly significant.</p>
