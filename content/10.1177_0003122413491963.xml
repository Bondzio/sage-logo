<abstract>
<p>Despite the burgeoning research on lifestyles, we have surprisingly little evidence to answer one of the literature’s founding questions: Is the association between social class and lifestyles disappearing? I explore this inquiry with data from the past four decades. In analyzing the class-lifestyle association, I examine changes in the variability of lifestyles within and between social classes. Using data from the General Social Survey on informal social ties and formal membership ties to voluntary associations, I derive proxies for lifestyles and examine their relation to social class with latent class models. Results show that social classes’ contemporary sociability patterns are substantively similar to traditional descriptions from empirical studies on analogous data from as early as the mid-twentieth century. The association between social classes and sociability patterns shows no sign of having weakened over the past four decades. In fact, recent trends of civic disengagement and social isolation in contemporary U.S. society, which these data corroborate, reinforce class differences in sociability.</p>

<p>To what extent do our lifestyles correspond to the positions we occupy in the social structure? In classic sociology, dominated as it was by class analysis, the question was commonly formulated in terms of the association between lifestyles and social class position, more often than not assuming a close if not perfect correspondence. In contemporary sociology, however, this formulation and its underlying assumption have come under direct and sustained criticism on the grounds that social classes have lost internal coherence as well as general relevance to present social life: social classes’ historical association with lifestyles has become superfluous (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0003122413491963">Pakulski and Waters 1996</xref>).</p>
<p>Criticism of class analysis has developed, however, in the absence of direct empirical studies on the historical evolution of the association between social classes and lifestyles. Consequently, the present literature is short on empirical evidence for the hypothesized declining relevance of social class (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0003122413491963">DiMaggio 2001</xref>). In response to this shortcoming, I focus here on that association as it changed over time. My objective is to provide much needed empirical evidence, a reference point from which to interpret existing theories.</p>
<p>This article develops a framework to map the hypothetical forms and directions that the class-lifestyle association may take; I used empirical data on social contacts to follow its transformation over the past four decades. Social contacts—the proxy for lifestyles here—measure a specific aspect of the broad range and diverse content of the lifestyle concept, but I provide references to past and present research and new, original empirical evidence to demonstrate the results’ implications for the literature on lifestyles in general.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0003122413491963">1</xref></sup></p>

<title>Challenges and Rehabilitation of the Class-Lifestyle Association</title>
<p>The critique of class analysis revolves around two general points (for a detailed account, see, e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0003122413491963">Pakulski and Waters 1996</xref>). First, it challenges the traditional understanding of social class as an overarching and transversal structure, which subsumes other dimensions of differentiation like gender, age, ethnic origin, nationality, and sexuality. Second, it questions the productionist bias of class analysis, which identifies labor force relations as the primary context for social differentiation and identity formation.</p>
<p>An influential perspective on contemporary society has evolved around these lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0003122413491963">Beck 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0003122413491963">Clark and Lipset 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0003122413491963">Hall 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0003122413491963">Hechter 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0003122413491963">Inglehart 1997</xref>). This perspective emphasizes the substantive transformations, particularly in the West, that have accompanied the postwar transition from industrial to late-industrial societies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0003122413491963">Be11 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0003122413491963">Piore and Sabel 1984</xref>). This literature describes a social structure of great complexity, which traditional aggregate class categories obscure. Some authors advance an even stronger argument about the disintegration of social structure: on the ruins of this disintegration, individuals emerge as actors in their own right and in control of their unique life trajectories (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0003122413491963">Bauman 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0003122413491963">Beck 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0003122413491963">Featherstone 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0003122413491963">Giddens 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0003122413491963">Kingston 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0003122413491963">Pakulski and Waters 1996</xref>).</p>
<p>These disparate arguments are brought together through a focus on lifestyle differences; in particular, they are connected to postwar developments in living standards, work conditions and activity, available leisure time, access to education, and diversity in mass media and consumption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0003122413491963">Hout and Fischer 2006</xref>). From this viewpoint, this context of material affluence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0003122413491963">Galbraith 1958</xref>), symbolic diversity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0003122413491963">Baudrillard 1988</xref>), and generalized access to consumer goods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0003122413491963">Hirsch 1977</xref>) undermines industrial-era social hierarchies, freeing, if not individuals themselves, at least their capacity to construct and express their identities across a multitude of social dimensions.</p>
<p>Empirical research depicts a complex picture of lifestyles. Factors such as race, ethnicity, religiosity, gender, and age seem to have more influence than class (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0003122413491963">Katz-Gerro 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0003122413491963">Lamont and Molnár 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0003122413491963">Lizardo 2006b</xref>). Lifestyles are stratified not in discrete class-specific patterns but into status hierarchies largely determined by the degree of cultural capital, typically measured by level of education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0003122413491963">Aschaffenburg and Maas 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0003122413491963">DiMaggio and Mukhtar 2004</xref>). In turn, these cultural hierarchies are themselves decomposing due to the spread of education and the diffusion of cultural products (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0003122413491963">Peterson 2005</xref>). Furthermore, individuals tend to bridge class boundaries at the level of social networks that shape lifestyle preferences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0003122413491963">Erickson 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0003122413491963">Lizardo 2006a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0003122413491963">Mark 1998</xref>). Building on such evidence, the critique of class analysis promotes the idea that the association between social classes and lifestyles, if it did exist at some point, is today superfluous.</p>
<p>In response to such evidence, rehabilitation of class analysis has consisted of efforts to redefine social class, in terms of its boundaries and its influence on lifestyles. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0003122413491963">Bourdieu (1984)</xref> provides a strong inspiration for this effort. His work interweaves several theoretical traditions (Marx, Durkheim, and Weber) to demonstrate how class cultures and dynamics adapt and change under the apparent complexity of contemporary social distinction. Bourdieu’s work has yielded a long line of supporting theoretical and empirical research (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0003122413491963">Bennett et al. 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0003122413491963">Coulangeon and Lemel 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0003122413491963">DiMaggio 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0003122413491963">DiMaggio and Useem 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0003122413491963">Holt 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0003122413491963">Hughes and Peterson 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0003122413491963">Kane 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0003122413491963">Ostrower 1998</xref>). This research stream aims to preserve the original transversal scale and depth of social class through a theoretical redefinition of the concept. Nonetheless, some recent work concedes to critics of class analysis a certain degree of unexplained variability in aggregate class categories, proposing, for example, a rescaling of class analysis down to the level of occupations. Empirical evidence shows the presence of coherent lifestyles by occupation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0003122413491963">Weeden and Grusky 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0003122413491963">2012</xref>) and the influence of occupational status on lifestyle differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0003122413491963">Chan 2010</xref>).</p>

<title>A Framework to Test the Class-Lifestyle Association</title>
<p>The contemporary debate on the relevance of social class to lifestyle differentiation has contributed to a more complex and nuanced understanding of social distinction. But its focus on disentangling the relation between class and non-class mechanisms through research at a single point in time has also contributed to a persistent stalemate. In the relative absence of concrete empirical evidence for the purported progressive weakening or outright disappearance of the class-lifestyle association, the incessant production of findings on the influence of non-class factors yields useful justifications for critics of class analysis, as much as timely invitations for class analysts to recast their definitions accordingly.</p>
<p>This stalemate has flourished in the absence of a direct and systematic inquiry into the evolution of the class-lifestyle association over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0003122413491963">DiMaggio 2001</xref>). The purpose of such an inquiry is not to adjudicate between the two camps with yet another study of the competing effects of class and non-class determinants. Instead, the focus is on the evolution of the association between social class positions and lifestyle patterns so as to provide the necessary context to assess whether contemporary empirical research on the subject attests to the historical absence of class effects, their weakening, or simply the complexity of their measurement and manifestation. With this objective in mind, I created an analytic framework to test empirically.</p>
<p>In constructing the framework for analysis of the class-lifestyle association, I followed a common understanding of social classes and lifestyles as discrete constructs. Given this definition, the strength of their association can be formally measured by the number of lifestyles within each class and by the similarity between classes given the types of lifestyles in each.</p>
<p>The association between social classes and lifestyles can weaken over time in two ways. First, individuals from different class positions can adopt increasingly similar lifestyles—a trend of eroding class distinctions that corresponds to a decline in the variability between social classes. Second, within each social class, individuals can adopt an increasingly diverse set of lifestyles—a trend of eroding internal coherence as the growing weight of intervening social determinants yields an increase in the variability of lifestyles within classes, essentially an increase in their internal heterogeneity. The decline in the class-lifestyle association would vary in degree and substance depending on which of the two trends is observed and whether they are concomitant. The cross-section of the two yields four class-by-lifestyle ideal-types, depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0003122413491963">Figure 1</xref>.</p>

</fig>
<p>In the first ideal-type, class homology, class members have a small number of lifestyles and there are great differences between classes. Pushed to the extreme, this ideal-type represents a perfect homology between social class and lifestyle: to each social class corresponds a unique lifestyle. If, on the other hand, differences between social classes are small and their members adopt only a few lifestyles, this ideal-type approaches, at the extreme, a one-dimensional mass society with no discrete class-specific lifestyles but a single lifestyle shared by everyone, albeit at varying levels (i.e., mass society). Opposite these cases are another two ideal-types. One assumes a great diversity of lifestyles within each social class but little to no overlap between classes (i.e., intra-class diversity). The other ideal-type posits a diversity of lifestyles with considerable overlap between social classes (i.e., class convergence).</p>
<p>As an illustration of these ideal-types, consider a comparison with recognizable theoretical paradigms. For instance, the class homology type resembles recent renditions of Bourdieu’s work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0003122413491963">Chan 2010</xref>). Accordingly, the close match between social classes and lifestyles demonstrates the influence of class differences beyond the production sphere and onto lifestyles through the medium of habitus—that is, internally coherent but sharply contrasting systems of dispositions that individuals acquire from living under similar class conditions.</p>
<p>The mass society type, apart from its immediate identification with the work of the Frankfurt School (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0003122413491963">Adorno and Horkheimer 1972</xref>), resonates in contemporary portrayals of Americans as seeking to fulfill (with variable success) a lifestyle of intensive, luxury-driven consumption. This lifestyle has purportedly emerged as a society-wide standard through the combined effect of mass media, marketing, and peer emulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0003122413491963">Frank 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0003122413491963">Schor 1999</xref>). Alternatively, this ideal-type can be likened to descriptions of lifestyle distinctions as fitting into an overarching, socially agreed-upon status hierarchy of occupational positions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0003122413491963">Chan 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>The intra-class diversity ideal-type is associated with variability at the level of occupations, where various closure mechanisms may shape lifestyle activities within aggregate class categories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0003122413491963">Weeden and Grusky 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0003122413491963">2012</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0003122413491963">2</xref></sup> As for the class-convergence ideal-type, it can be understood as an amalgam of various postmodernist accounts, in which lifestyles—numerous and diverse—crisscross class boundaries.</p>
<p>Note that these associations are by no means exclusive. These ideal-types were not constructed with regard to particular paradigms. This typology was designed to frame the inquiry of the more general, if simpler, question: Do aggregate social classes constitute coherent categories to describe contemporary lifestyles? From this point of view, the typology maps the four hypothetical cases in which the association between social classes and lifestyles may fall, leaving the answer open to empirical verification.</p>
<p>Moreover, the typology provides an opportunity to test empirically the direction of historical change in the class-lifestyle association. Scholars often assume that a certain level of homology between social classes and lifestyles characterizes a bygone past, and that the contemporary period has seen the weakening of that homology in the direction of the other three ideal-types. But this hypothesis is as valid and in need of verification as any other hypothetical change. I therefore leave open the possibility to observe change in any direction, or to observe stability in the association, due to its unwavering strength or its absence.</p>

<title>Data, Definitions, and Measures</title>
<p>The operationalization of social classes and lifestyles is guided by this article’s research question: Is there a close and persistent association between social classes and lifestyle patterns? The class analytical tradition assumes lifestyle practices fall into coherent patterns that map closely onto aggregate social class categories. The purported association reflects the influence of class membership on the symbolic construction and social organization of individual ways of living. To test the empirical validity of this claim, I adopt its inherent definition of social class and lifestyles as concepts with broad scope and a fairly inclusive set of elements.</p>
<sec id="section4-0003122413491963">
<title>Dataset</title>
<p>Given the interest here in historical change, I selected survey data that cover a long timeframe: from 1974 to 2010. Data came from the General Social Survey (GSS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0003122413491963">Smith et al. 2011</xref>)—a survey of a representative sample of persons age 18 years or older, living in noninstitutional arrangements within the United States. I divided data from the available year samples into four decades for two reasons. First, this deals with the absence of certain survey years due to unavailability of variables relevant to the inquiry. Second, this construction yields sufficiently large sample sizes for each period. I weighted the four samples to control for differences in sample size. These differences arose from decreased sample sizes in the GSS for survey years from the 1980s and 1990s, as well as the exclusion of portions of the samples, in particular for survey years from the 1990s and 2000s, for which information on lifestyle measures was not gathered. The total unweighted sample includes 12,814 respondents. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0003122413491963">Table 1</xref> presents relevant information and descriptive statistics on the remaining variables.</p>

<title>Social Class Measure</title>
<p>Following convention, I defined social class in terms of aggregate categories that are understood as coherent and institutionalized bundles of endowment (e.g., educational levels), working conditions (e.g., amount of autonomy), and rewards packages (e.g., income) and are assumed to have wide-ranging consequences for their members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0003122413491963">Grusky 2007</xref>:4812–13). The relevant literature proposes various aggregate-class schemas. I chose to use the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0003122413491963">Featherman-Hauser (F-H) (1978)</xref> distinction between professional, managerial, technical-administrative, skilled, unskilled, and service classes (I excluded a seventh category, farmers, because of insufficient sample size).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0003122413491963">3</xref></sup> This choice was guided by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0003122413491963">Weeden and Grusky (2005)</xref>, who compared the predictive power of leading class schemas<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0003122413491963">4</xref></sup> against a large set of attitudinal, participation, and consumption measures from the GSS. Their analysis shows the F-H schema has the strongest predictive power with regard, at least, to data from the GSS. Given that the GSS is the data source for my empirical analysis, the choice of the F-H schema appears justified.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0003122413491963">5</xref></sup></p>

<title>Lifestyle Measure</title>
<p>I defined lifestyles as observable patterns of an individual’s overt behavior and cognitive style. Cognitive style refers to cognitive processes and properties, including values, attitudes, beliefs, opinions, and interests. Overt behavior is the enactment of cognitive style in terms of concrete practices. In the relevant literature, researchers employ measures of lifestyle that include both overt behavior (e.g., spending practices; product and service use; time allocation; food preparation; homemaking; family life; and media, political, cultural, and organizational activities) and cognitive style (e.g., political and economic attitudes and beliefs, social views, and cultural preferences). This list of examples, documented in a review of U.S. lifestyle literature by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0003122413491963">Anderson and Golden (1984)</xref>, illustrates the broad range and diverse content of the lifestyle concept.</p>
<p>The scarcity of adequate data renders operationalization of this multifaceted definition of lifestyles difficult. In the rare cases of empirical research that employ a comprehensive set of measures across a wide range of lifestyle practices, data come from one-time, specialized surveys made for the occasion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0003122413491963">Bennett et al. 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0003122413491963">Bourdieu 1984</xref>). The challenge is even greater when, as is the case here, the objective is to observe lifestyle patterns over a long period of time. Absent adequate data, the convention is to rely on lifestyle proxies. In line with this convention, I used social contacts as proxy measures. The measures consist of 11 indicators of informal contacts with relatives and neighborhood locals<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0003122413491963">6</xref></sup> and formal membership ties to different types of voluntary organizations.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0003122413491963">7</xref></sup> <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0003122413491963">Table 2</xref> presents corresponding labels and descriptive statistics for the 11 indicators.</p>

<p>Use of social contacts as a proxy requires clarification as to their relevance to the broad set of practices that fall under this article’s definition of lifestyles. Although unconventional, use of sociability measures in lifestyle research is neither new nor marginal. In a recent comprehensive review, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0003122413491963">Pachucki and Breiger (2010)</xref> highlight the strong theoretical underpinnings of the link between social contacts and lifestyles in both classic and contemporary texts. In addition, they provide a long list of relevant empirical illustrations from recent studies of cultural discourse, civic life, identity formation, and taste preferences.</p>
<p>Three characteristics of the 11 measures of social contact are worth noting as examples of their direct relevance to lifestyle practices. First, these variables capture respondents’ sociability across a large number of domains associated with lifestyle practices: kin relations, neighborhood socialization, work-based involvement, religion, politics, national identity, community service, fraternal ties, sport, hobby, literature, and art. Second, prior research on these and similar measures of social contact has established empirically their role as a source for the majority of Americans’ friendships, confiding relations, and social support ties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0003122413491963">Mardsen 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0003122413491963">McPherson, Popielarz, and Drobnic 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0003122413491963">McPherson and Smith-Lovin 1987</xref>), which are a strong predictor of lifestyle practices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0003122413491963">Chan and Goldthorpe 2007a</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0003122413491963">8</xref></sup> Third, owing to their tendency toward homophily (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0003122413491963">McPherson, Smith-Lovin, and Cook 2001</xref>), social networks described by these measures yield bounded arenas for the formation, maintenance, and reinforcement of individuals’ general systems of values, norms, and manners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0003122413491963">Galaskiewicz 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0003122413491963">Knoke 1990</xref>).</p>
<p>In summary, we have valid reasons to assume a strong link between lifestyles and sociability and that measures of the latter act as efficient proxies of lifestyles. The final section of this article presents additional evidence, exploring the relation between sociability patterns and a set of conventional lifestyle measures of cultural participation.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0003122413491963">
<title>Control Measures</title>
<p>Similarity breeds connection and the strong homophily in social relations by race, gender, and age influences individuals’ sociability and associations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0003122413491963">McPherson et al. 2001</xref>). I therefore included measures for these sociodemographic characteristics to account for any influence they may exert on the association between social class and sociability. I also included a measure of the presence of minors in a respondent’s household, on the premise it might affect individual priorities for informal contacts with relatives and friends as well as membership in formal associations.</p>
<p>Note that the measure for race was coded as an African American/Other binary variable for the lack of more detailed categories in earlier survey years. Although this limited coding fails to account for any contemporary shifts in the composition of the U.S. non-black population, analyses on the distinction between U.S.- and foreign-born respondents showed no substantive effects on the final results reported here (see Tables S1, S2, and S3 in the online supplement [<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://asr.sagepub.com/supplemental">http://asr.sagepub.com/supplemental</ext-link>]).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0003122413491963">9</xref></sup> Again, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0003122413491963">Table 1</xref> presents descriptive statistics for each variable.</p>
<p>On a final note, contemporary research on lifestyles and social class often includes additional controls for respondents’ education and income to parse out effects of cultural and economic capital from the influence of occupational characteristics. However, inclusion of such controls is at odds with the traditional definition of social class as coherent and institutionalized bundles of endowment (e.g., educational levels), working conditions (e.g., amount of autonomy), and rewards packages (e.g., income). It is precisely on the basis of this synthetic definition that researchers in the class analysis tradition assert the wide-ranging consequences of social class on lifestyles. Because my interest here is to test the empirical validity of this assertion, I maintained that synthetic definition and did not include separate controls for education and income, so as not to reduce social class to a single dimension of occupational characteristics.</p>

<title>Empirical Analysis</title>
<p>The aim of this article is to observe any change over time in the distribution of lifestyles between and within social classes. To do so, I looked at historical data on social contacts. The empirical analysis is organized around four subsections. First, I used basic descriptive statistics to present historical trends in social classes’ social ties. Second, I applied latent class methods to derive sociability patterns as proxies for lifestyles and analyzed the associated differences between social classes. In the third subsection, I applied formal statistical techniques to test the ideal-typical cases announced in the analytic framework. Finally, I explored the relation between sociability patterns and a set of conventional lifestyle measures of cultural practices.</p>
<sec id="section9-0003122413491963">
<title>Social Classes and Social Ties: Historical Trends</title>
<p>Sociological literature notes one long-standing particularity in the sociability of social classes: upper-class individuals’ greater propensity to participate in formal organizations, including voluntary associations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0003122413491963">Dotson 1951</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0003122413491963">Foskett 1955</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0003122413491963">Komarovsky 1946</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0003122413491963">Li, Pickles, and Savage 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0003122413491963">McPherson 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0003122413491963">Reissman 1954</xref>). Research attributes this tendency to class-specific opportunity structures that result from the mutual effect of, on the one hand, individual-level processes of family socialization and status transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0003122413491963">Janoski and Wilson 1995</xref>), and, on the other hand, organizational-level dynamics of recruitment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0003122413491963">McPherson and Ranger-Moore 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0003122413491963">McPherson and Smith-Lovin 1982</xref>). A logical corollary of this tendency is the greater diversity of social ties for the upper classes.</p>
<p>Data corroborate both the upper classes’ higher propensity to participate in formal organizations and their greater network diversity. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0003122413491963">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0003122413491963">3</xref> display the corresponding results. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0003122413491963">Figure 2</xref> illustrates the overall distribution of classes in each type of social tie with class-specific percentage scores estimated across all sample periods (i.e., 1970s, 1980s, and so on). The figure also presents historical trends in class distributions with two estimates: for the mean across the six social classes and for the standard deviation of the means of each social class. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0003122413491963">Figure 3</xref> follows the same structure except it presents results on differences between social classes in the number of declared ties for the 11 types of social contacts.</p>

</fig>
<p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0003122413491963">Figure 2</xref>, the class distribution of membership in formal organizations (i.e., membership in the nine types of voluntary groups) illustrates a clear overrepresentation of respondents in positions associated with high economic and cultural capital (e.g., professional and managerial classes). Such respondents also tended to declare having ties to a greater number of socialization types. As <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0003122413491963">Figure 3</xref> shows, class differences grow with every additional type of social tie until an eventual convergence at the extreme end for a minority of respondents with exceptionally diverse networks.</p>
<p>In contrast to the professional and managerial classes’ wider network range, lower-class respondents exhibit a greater propensity for informal ties. Proxies for these ties are the reported high frequency of social contact with relatives and locals. Lower-class individuals tend to compensate for their limited opportunity structures by concentrating interaction in informal networks that lack the entry barriers of formal organizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0003122413491963">Li et al. 2005</xref>). This observation is not necessarily contradicted by lower-class respondents’ moderate to high absolute membership numbers in church groups (i.e., 40 and 33 percent of technical-administrative and services classes, respectively) and work-based organizations (i.e., 30 and 26 percent of skilled and unskilled classes, respectively). After all, church attendance and membership (both of which are measured by the proxy <italic>church groups</italic>) are an integrative part of local communities, whereas labor unions, included in the <italic>work-based groups</italic> variable, are fairly isolated from the organizational context of U.S. voluntary associations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0003122413491963">Cornwell and Harrison 2004</xref>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0003122413491963">Figure 2</xref> reveals several substantive differences in membership patterns. The professional class, with its distinctively high membership levels in work-based (50 percent), church (43 percent), and literary/art (19 percent) groups, demonstrates its characteristic labor-market status, community role, and high cultural capital. The managerial class stands out with participation in fraternal (15 percent), service (17 percent), and sport (28 percent) groups, all of which suggest a strong fraternal association. A similar characteristic may be assumed from the skilled class’s moderate participation in fraternal (12 percent) and sport (21 percent) groups. The technical-administrative class exhibits moderate levels of participation in fraternal and cultural associations: service (11 percent), sport (20 percent), literary/art (11 percent), and hobby (11 percent). The service and unskilled classes have generally low membership levels in formal organizations.</p>
<p>In fact, these results have a striking resemblance to empirical findings of U.S. researchers writing around the mid-twentieth century (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0003122413491963">Dotson 1951</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0003122413491963">Foskett 1955</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0003122413491963">Komarovsky 1946</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0003122413491963">Reissman 1954</xref>). This suggests stability in the substance and structure of social class differences.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the apparent stability in class differences over the long term, two contemporary trends stand out in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0003122413491963">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0003122413491963">3</xref>. One is the generalized decline in reported memberships. The mean of participation across the six social classes decreased over the four periods, particularly in the 2000s. The decline is concentrated among respondents with less diverse networks (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0003122413491963">Figure 3</xref>) and with ties to work-based, church, fraternity, service, and sport groups (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0003122413491963">Figure 2</xref>). This general trend is in line with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0003122413491963">Putnam’s (2000)</xref> observation of Americans’ disengagement from civic life and from the voluntary sector in particular.</p>
<p>The second trend is the sharp decline across social classes in frequent contact with locals and the simultaneous increase in frequent contact with relatives (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0003122413491963">Figure 2</xref>). This inverse relation is similar to a recent finding on the shrinking size of Americans’ core discussion networks, which are increasingly centered on family members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0003122413491963">McPherson, Smith-Lovin, and Brashears 2006</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0003122413491963">10</xref></sup> Americans’ growing isolation is thus corroborated here in the case of extended networks. We see evidence for the decrease of formal and informal ties as respondents increasingly revert to frequent contact with relatives.</p>
<p>Do these trends of disengagement and isolation amplify differences between social classes? The results are mixed. We must thus turn to the estimated standard deviations of the means of each social class. Note that an increase in the standard deviation over the four periods corresponds to a rise in differences between classes.</p>
<p>The clearest affirmative answer comes from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0003122413491963">Figure 3</xref>. The figure illustrates an increase in the standard deviation across the four periods for respondents involved in at least one and in up to at least three types of social ties. This finding implies that the decline in social contacts is accompanied by an intensification of class differences. This does not concern, however, the small minority of respondents with exceptionally diverse social ties.</p>
<p>By comparison, results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0003122413491963">Figure 2</xref> are less conclusive. Throughout the four periods, the standard deviation, and hence class differences, increases with regard to membership in hobby and nationality groups; decreases in fraternity, service, and political groups; and follows a nonlinear pattern in work-based and church groups. A decline in the mean across the six social classes in frequent contact with locals appears to result in a slight increase in class differences. By contrast, the increase in frequent contact with relatives does not lead to a change in class differences. Nonetheless, these trends are small enough to make any conclusions tentative.</p>
<p>In summary, descriptive statistics corroborate long-established findings about upper-class individuals: they have larger and more diverse social ties, a propensity to privilege formal over informal contacts, and some substantive distinctions, such as professionals’ overrepresentation in organizations associated with high cultural capital and managers’ overrepresentation in organizations with fraternal characteristics. Furthermore, these data provide evidence for the well-recognized trend of disengagement from the voluntary sector, as well as an important confirmation, using different data, of the recent finding on the shrinking of social networks in favor of family ties. These two trends are associated with changes in class differences in different directions, although a modest increase in class differences is prevalent among respondents with smaller, less diverse networks.</p>

<title>Social Classes and Sociability Patterns: Methods and Results</title>
<p>How are social practices packaged together and do these packages replicate, reinforce, or weaken the differences between social classes displayed by the descriptive statistics so far? To examine these questions, I integrated the 11 measures of social ties in latent class models to derive concrete sociability patterns and observe any associated differences between and within social classes over time.</p>
<p><italic>Methods: latent class models.</italic> Latent class models seek to capture the association between a phenomenon’s observed manifest indicators through a small number of latent patterns. Unlike its close cousins<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0003122413491963">11</xref></sup>—factor and correspondence analyses—the latent class method assumes unobserved population heterogeneity, which it captures through discrete latent clusters. In the process, each individual case in the sample population is assigned unique conditional probabilities for membership in discrete clusters, which can be used to analyze the association between clusters (e.g., sociability patterns) and exogenous, sociodemographic variables (e.g., social classes). A fundamental difference from standard cluster analysis is that latent class models assume data are generated by a mixture of probability distributions and hence seek to maximize a log-likelihood function.</p>
<p>The model in this article differs in two respects from common past applications of latent class methods in the sociological literature on lifestyle.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0003122413491963">12</xref></sup> First, I used a variant of the standard latent cluster model: a latent class discrete factor model. It assumes data have a multidimensional structure, essentially that the manifest indicators load not on a single common latent dimension but on multiple dimensions, derived here in terms of discrete factors. This variant produces a better fitting and more parsimonious solution than does the standard latent class cluster model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0003122413491963">Magidson and Vermunt 2001</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0003122413491963">13</xref></sup> It is arguably a more accurate representation of lifestyles in so far as we assume they may be multidimensional.</p>
<p>Second, I incorporated the influence of exogenous factors, in this case, control variables, as direct effects on the 11 sociability measures. This represents any variation in the derived latent patterns attributable to sex, age, race, and the presence of minors in the household. For instance, responsibilities associated with rearing children may discourage maintenance of ties external to the household and encourage maintenance or creation of ties to kin, which in turn affect one’s overall pattern of ties. Similar arguments can be made for effects of sex, age, and race. Note that additional tests including interaction terms as direct effects for each covariate by period showed no significant difference in the final results. I thus did not include this more complex model in the present analysis.</p>
<p>Formally speaking, latent class discrete factor models have the following general probability structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0003122413491963">Vermunt and Magidson 2005a</xref>:29–30):</p>

<p>Each category represents a unique pattern from the cross-section of the discrete factors and their ordinal levels. Distribution of the sample population across patterns is expressed through joint posterior membership probabilities. I estimated parameters of the latent class models, employing the Latent Gold software, with maximum likelihood methods using consecutively the Expectation Maximization and the Newton-Raphson algorithms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0003122413491963">Vermunt and Magidson 2005a</xref>).</p>
<p>Substantively, the 11 indicators of social ties and the four control variables represent, respectively, the manifest indicators, (<italic>y<sub>i</sub></italic>), and the covariates, (<italic>z<sub>i</sub></italic>). Associations between indicators represent the unobservable structure of sociability patterns (i.e., proxies for lifestyles), which is captured by the discrete factors (<italic>L</italic>). Individual factor scores and the associated posterior membership probabilities result from respondents’ observed characteristics on the sociability and control variables.</p>

<p>Discrete Factor 2 is characterized primarily by work-based affiliations; it has a positive and strong, statistically significant loading (.672). Discrete Factor 4 is characterized mainly by informal contacts to kin and locals and is positive and moderate in strength, with statistically significant loadings of .421 and .481, respectively. Discrete Factor 3 includes a fraternal aspect, which is positive and moderate in strength and has statistically significant loadings for membership in service (.396), fraternity (.406), sport (.282), and work-based (.407) groups. Discrete Factor 1 has a prevailing cultural aspect, which is positive, although variable in strength, and statistically significant loadings for membership in literary/art (.416), service (.223), and hobby (.270) groups. Three of the four dimensions show a statistically significant loading for membership in church groups, corroborating the long-observed weight of church-related activities in Americans’ socialization. Finally, associations between the four factors reveal negative, statistically significant associations between cultural and work factors and between communal and fraternal factors.</p>
<p>The four dimensions were constructed as discrete binaries with unique high- and low-level factor scores. The model’s structure can thus be represented as a combination of these factor-specific levels, yielding 16 distinct patterns. This alternative representation offers a synthetic view of the latent structure. It distinguishes substantively unique patterns and presents the distribution of the sample population and particular social classes across these patterns and time-periods.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0003122413491963">15</xref></sup></p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0003122413491963">Figure 4</xref> presents results for the six largest sociability patterns, which include 93 percent of the sample population. The figure describes each pattern with reference to the manifest indicators (top-left panel) and class distribution (bottom-left panel), along with information on historical trends in the sample size of each pattern (top-right panel) and the associated change in class differences (bottom-right panel). The top-left panel defines sociability patterns in terms of the conditional probability of a “Yes/Frequent-Contact” response on each of the 11 indicators. For each of the four periods, the top-right panel shows the average sample size of sociability patterns as measured by the conditional probability of a respondent belonging in a given pattern.

</fig>
<p>An impressive 43 percent of the total sample population belonged to a single pattern. Given its members’ minimal involvement in all types of social contact, I call it the “homebody” pattern. The corresponding conditional probabilities (in the top-left panel of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0003122413491963">Figure 4</xref>) for frequent contact with locals and membership in church, work, fraternal, service, sport, literary/art, hobby, political, and national groups are far below the means for the overall population (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0003122413491963">Table 2</xref>): 23 versus 35 percent, 19 versus 37 percent, 9 versus 29 percent, 3 versus 10 percent, 1 versus 10 percent, 8 versus 20 percent, 0 versus 10 percent, 4 versus 11 percent, 1 versus 4 percent, and 1 versus 3 percent, respectively. Even the one comparatively high probability of 45 percent for frequent contact with relatives is below the overall mean of 56 percent. In other words, Americans’ modal category is a pattern of civic disengagement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0003122413491963">Putnam 2000</xref>) and social isolation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0003122413491963">McPherson et al. 2006</xref>)—a pattern whose ranks increased moderately in the last period, from a stable 42 percent to 47 percent in the 2000s (top-right panel).</p>
<p>Class-wise (bottom-left panel), the homebody pattern is characterized by overrepresentation of technical-administrative (44 percent), skilled (48 percent), unskilled (50 percent), and service (50 percent) workers. By comparison, the managerial and professional classes have much lower conditional probabilities of being in this pattern: 38 and 32 percent, respectively. In fact, class differences are highest in this pattern. However, the increase in its size by 5 percentage points in the last sample period is associated with a modest decline in class differences, judging from the reduction in the standard deviation of the conditional probability means, from 8.8 in the 1990s to 7.7 in the 2000s (bottom-right panel). This decline in class differences reflects the considerable rise in the professional class’s conditional probability of belonging to this pattern in the last period compared to the 1990s. Nevertheless, because this probability rose for the other classes as well, the general class distribution remained stable (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table8-0003122413491963">Table A3</xref> in the <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-0003122413491963">Appendix</xref>).</p>
<p>Overrepresentation of lower-class members is characteristic of another pattern: the “communal” pattern. Containing around 10 percent of the total sample, this pattern is characterized almost exclusively by respondents with high frequency of informal ties to relatives (87 percent) and locals (71 percent) (top-left panel of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0003122413491963">Figure 4</xref>). In light of the long-standing class distinction in informal versus formal ties, it is not surprising to find respondents from the unskilled (14 percent), service (12 percent), skilled (12 percent), and technical-administrative (10 percent) classes overrepresented here relative to the managerial (8 percent) and professional (6 percent) classes (bottom-left panel). Moreover, the increase of about 3 percentage points in the communal pattern’s size in the most recent period (top-right panel) reinforces the pattern’s lower-class aspect, judging from the parallel increase in the standard deviation from 2.8 in the 1990s to 3.5 in the 2000s (bottom-right panel). The brunt of the increase in class differences is associated with the comparatively higher probabilities of skilled and unskilled workers belonging to this pattern (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table8-0003122413491963">Table A3</xref>).</p>
<p>Another 20 percent of the total sample population fit into a pattern defined largely by membership in work-based groups (top-left panel). The associated membership level is significantly above its overall mean. The positive marginal difference of 18 points between the average membership level (47 percent) and the overall mean (29 percent) for work-based ties is higher than for other types of social ties with a positive marginal difference: ties to kin (8 points) and to church (8 points), fraternity (9 points), sport (10 points), and national (1 point) groups. Nonetheless, these numbers speak to the diversity of social contacts in the work pattern. They also illustrate the distinction between the communal and work patterns. In the latter, informal ties to locals are replaced with formal ties to colleagues and, to a lesser extent, members in voluntary groups. These nuances in the pattern’s sociability characteristics may explain the fact that the six social classes’ conditional probabilities are similar (bottom-left panel). They may also explain the fact that the size of the work pattern changed little between the 1970s and 1990s, despite the substantial decline in unionization over the past four decades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0003122413491963">Visser 2006</xref>). Note, though, the decline in the pattern’s size between the 1990s and 2000s, from 21 to 17 percent of the total sample. This decline is associated with the decreasing conditional probability of belonging to the work pattern for all but one social class, managerial workers (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table8-0003122413491963">Table A3</xref> in the <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-0003122413491963">Appendix</xref>).</p>
<p>Of the total sample population, 10 percent belong to a fourth pattern, which is defined by membership in formal organizations with a prevailing fraternal quality, such as church (68 percent), sport (44 percent), service (33 percent), and fraternity (17 percent) groups. Even though these groups’ qualities may justify labeling the pattern “fraternal,” these formal ties come with strong ties to kin (66 percent) and locals (53 percent) as well as membership in groups with cultural qualities like literary/art (23 percent) and hobby (27 percent) groups. These sociability characteristics and the low membership level in work-based groups (13 percent) place this pattern as an alternative to the work pattern. Similar to the work pattern, differences in the six social classes’ conditional probabilities are low. Moreover, the fraternal pattern’s size is stable before a decline from 10 percent in the 1990s to 8 percent in the 2000s, attributable to lower conditional probabilities of belonging to this pattern for all but the managerial class.</p>
<p>The last two patterns, which account for 17 percent of the total sample population, capture the distinctive diversity of upper-class socialization. This is best exemplified by the smaller of the two, the “omnivorous” pattern (6 percent). For this pattern, the conditional probabilities for all 11 types of ties are above their corresponding mean for the overall sample in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0003122413491963">Table 2</xref>. The probabilities are precisely 62 and 44 percent for frequent contact with, respectively, relatives and locals and 90 percent for work-based, 75 percent for church, 31 percent for fraternal, 52 percent for service, 53 percent for sport, 47 percent for literature/art, 35 percent for hobby, 24 percent for political, and 21 percent for national groups (top-left panel).</p>
<p>Values are lower but still high for the other pattern, whose uniquely strong probabilities for literature/art (43 percent) and hobby (22 percent) groups (top-left panel) I interpret as indicating the peculiar, albeit not exclusive, “cultural” aspect of the pattern. This aspect may also explain the overrepresentation of the professional class (17 percent), who are typically associated with a high level of cultural capital.</p>
<p>The class distribution in both patterns illustrates the greater probability of classes associated with higher economic and cultural capital, notably the professional and managerial classes, to belong there (bottom-left panel). Sample sizes of the omnivorous and cultural patterns are relatively stable over time (top-right panel). Note, however, that the latter pattern shows an increase in class differences in the last two periods (bottom-right panel), which reflects changes reinforcing the professional class’s prevalent position (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table8-0003122413491963">Table A3</xref>).</p>
<p>In summary, findings from these figures provide a further corroboration of three standard observations about the sociability of social classes: (1) the prevalence of informal versus formal social ties for lower- and upper-class individuals, respectively; (2) the greater diversity of social ties among members of the upper classes; and (3) the upper classes’ overrepresentation in patterns with more cultural engagement. In addition, these findings show evidence in support of an underappreciated phenomenon: the convergence of a non-negligible portion of lower- and upper-class individuals in patterns with strong, slightly omnivorous participation in formal, fraternal-like organizations. Finally, these patterns reveal a clear trend in the 2000s of accelerating disengagement from formal organizations in favor of ties to the local community and, in particular, the family; this trend is especially pronounced among classes with lower economic and cultural capital.</p>

<p>The next step is to test whether the association between social classes and sociability patterns weakened over the past four decades. So far, I have discussed such changes separately for each pattern. Now I incorporate the information in two statistical tests: one measuring the historical trend within-class and the other measuring between-class differences in the association with the six sociability patterns.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0003122413491963">16</xref></sup> The objective is to relate results directly to the four class-lifestyle ideal-types in the analytic framework.</p>

<title>Within-class variation of sociability patterns</title>
<p>I began with a measure of within-class differences: the Blau Homogeneity Index. It estimated the level of homogeneity within each social class in terms of the distribution of members of a given class across sociability patterns. The index is a variant of the measure of market concentration, the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index, which is formally expressed as</p>

Class distribution reflects differences in each social class’s degree of homogeneity, that is, differences in the relative concentration of members of a given social class across the six sociability patterns.

<p>The observed distribution of social classes in terms of their average level of homogeneity is predictable. Social classes known for their greater diversity of social contacts, like the professional and managerial classes, spread out more evenly across the six patterns (21 and 23 percent, respectively) than do the other, more homogeneous classes (27 percent for technical-administrative; 30 percent for skilled; 31 percent for unskilled; and 31 percent for service).</p>

The figure shows an estimate of the mean level of homogeneity across social classes as well as an estimate of the standard deviation of the means of each social class.</p>
<p>The historical trend depicts a stable level of homogeneity of social classes until a sudden increase in the most recent period. The overall mean level of class homogeneity was relatively stable between the 1970s and 1990s, and then increased from 27 percent in the 1990s to 31 percent in the 2000s. This abrupt rise is similar to the increase in the homebody and communal patterns, which are together responsible for more than half of the sample population. In fact, the rise of homogeneity was due solely to the increase in the homebody pattern: a re-estimation of the analysis in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0003122413491963">Figure 5</xref> without that pattern reveals no significant change in the overall level of homogeneity. The increase in homogeneity was uniform across social classes, as revealed by class-specific numbers behind the trend in the mean (estimates are available from the author upon request). The only exception is stability in the managerial class’s homogeneity, which was responsible for the modest increase of a single percentage point in the standard deviation. Overall, social classes have grown more homogenous over time, particularly in the 2000s.</p>

<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0003122413491963">Table 4</xref> presents estimates for the log-multiplicative layer effect model for the six sociability patterns. Scaled layer scores provide period-specific parameters for the logarithm of the odds ratios between social class positions and sociability patterns. The association is relatively stable throughout the observed historical period (1970s = 1.00; 1980s = 1.00; 2000s = .98), with the exception of a one-time increase in the 1990s (1.09). The relative stability in the association is further corroborated by better goodness-of-fit statistics for the null effect model, which assumes no change in the strength of the class-by-pattern association. Although the log-multiplicative layer effect model has a marginally higher explained variance (rG2) than the null effect model, the improvement is not statistically significant, as would be seen in a likelihood ratio test comparing reduction of the deviance statistic (G2) to the loss of three degrees of freedom (df). In addition, even though the null and log-multiplicative layer effect models both improve significantly—and unsurprisingly—on the conditional independence model and misclassify an almost equally small percentage of cases (the dissimilarity index equals 2.2 and 2.1, respectively), the Bayesian Information Criterion (i.e., a lower BIC indicates a more parsimonious model) also singles out the null effect model as preferable. In other words, in spite of the recorded differences in the layer score estimates of the log-multiplicative layer effect model, it is more prudent to follow results of the null effect model and conclude that the class-by-pattern association remains constant.</p>

<p>Findings from both tests—a rise in within-class homogeneity and a steady state of between-class differences—suggest a trend toward the homology ideal-type. The implication of a transition toward a one-to-one correspondence between social classes and sociability patterns necessitates clarification. There is little reason to expect the rise of class differences to yield a pure homology between social classes and sociability patterns. First, the rising ranks of the homebody pattern include not only members of the lower classes but also members of the upper classes, and increasingly so. As <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0003122413491963">Figure 4</xref> showed, the rise in this pattern’s size is associated with a simultaneous decline in class differences. Second, the homebody pattern aside, social classes remained fairly well distributed across the other five sociability patterns, as the analysis of the individual patterns demonstrated.</p>
<p>Even though a pure homology is unrealistic, the observed change in this direction, however modest and recent, conveys a clear message: traditional social class differences in sociability patterns persist and, given the rise in social classes’ internal homogeneity, they intensified in the most recent period. First, traditional class differences persist because the observed changes fall along the primary line of distinction in sociability: upper classes have diverse formal ties and lower classes have limited informal contacts. Even if more upper-class members enter the homebody and communal patterns, individuals from lower classes join these patterns, too, and ultimately maintain their prevalence there. In other words, the recent increase in the size of the homebody and communal patterns may well concern the upper classes but it does not undermine the structure of class differences. Second, class differences intensify: lower classes are already underrepresented in formal social networks, and as the lower classes grow more homogeneous, they become ever more excluded from ties to that social context, ultimately increasing their qualitative distance from upper-class members. In summary, Americans’ disengagement and their retreat to the relative social isolation of the homebody and communal patterns constitute a trend that, even if common to individuals of all classes, affects members of the lower classes disproportionately, ultimately reinforcing differences between social classes.</p>

<title>From Sociability Patterns to Lifestyle Practices</title>
<p>Most recent accounts of the decline in effects of social class on lifestyles are based on measures of cultural consumption, most notably measures of cultural preferences and participation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0003122413491963">Peterson 2005</xref>). In so far as this article addresses the subject with data on sociability, the generalizability of the present results depends on evidence of a direct link between sociability practices and conventional measures of lifestyles.</p>
<p>In the General Social Survey, measures of cultural participation and the set of 11 sociability variables are simultaneously present in only one subsample of 499 respondents for survey year 1993. I used 15 variables (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0003122413491963">Table 5</xref> for descriptive statistics) to measure how media consumption, participation in cultural activities, and attendance at cultural events differ with regard to membership in the six sociability patterns. I used the latter as predictors of cultural consumption in simple binary logistic regression models. I present results for the effect on cultural consumption of membership in the homebody pattern compared to membership in any of the other five sociability patterns. I also measured the effect of membership in each of the remaining patterns compared to membership in the modal homebody pattern. Regression estimates represent log-odds ratios. They express the probability that a member of a given sociability pattern engages in a cultural activity relative to the probability of a member of another pattern. Estimates for each sociability pattern are illustrated graphically with six panels in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0003122413491963">Figure 6</xref>.</p>

<p>Results corroborate the basic substantive differences between the six sociability patterns and illustrate these patterns’ direct consequences for cultural participation. Members of the homebody pattern exhibit a lower probability of participating in all 15 measures of cultural practices. Their higher likelihood of watching television three or more hours daily is reminiscent of the social isolation evoked in recent work on U.S. society by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0003122413491963">Putnam (2000)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0003122413491963">McPherson and colleagues (2006)</xref>. The absence of any statistically significant difference between effects of membership in the homebody and communal patterns shows that the cultural participation of these two groups is similar.</p>
<p>In direct contrast to the homebody and communal patterns, members of the other four groups exhibited positive probabilities for most, if not all, of the 15 cultural activities, highlighting the positive association between social integration and cultural participation. The observed variation in the positive effects for membership in the work, fraternal, cultural, and omnivorous patterns appears as a logical extension of the types of social contacts that define each pattern. In the case of the work pattern, for instance, the higher and statistically significant probability for the practice of sports and attendance at sport events matches members’ propensity to participate in fraternal and sport groups. Note, too, the positive albeit moderate probabilities for attendance at cultural activities like dance performances, art museums, and galleries. The fraternal pattern is similar: members’ more varied cultural participation reflects the slight omnivorous nature of their social contacts. The cultural pattern, in line with its label and with the underlying types of social contacts, stands out from homebodies with its members’ strong positive and statistically significant probability of attending dance, classical music, and opera performances, as well as art museums and galleries. Finally, the multiple, strong, and statistically significant probabilities for cultural participation of members of the omnivorous pattern correspond to the inherent definition of this pattern and emphasize the direct relation between diverse social contacts and diverse cultural participation.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This article began with the observation that current research has made important advances in our understanding of the diversity of lifestyles and the non-class mechanisms that generate lifestyle distinctions. However, absent evidence on the historical evolution of the class-lifestyle association, the literature lacks an explanation for the relevance of social classes to lifestyles. Do findings on the diversity of lifestyles and the importance of non-class differences attest to the historical absence of class distinctions, their weakening, or simply the complexity of their measurement and manifestation? This article analyzed the class-lifestyle association over time to provide the historical context for such an assessment.</p>
<p>Analysis of data spanning the past four decades yielded two main results. First, social class differences in sociability patterns were robust to the profound changes that U.S. society underwent in the postwar era. Taking research from the mid-twentieth century as a reference point (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0003122413491963">Dotson 1951</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0003122413491963">Foskett 1955</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0003122413491963">Komarovsky 1946</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0003122413491963">Reissman 1954</xref>), we see that general characteristics of social classes’ sociability patterns are comparable then and now. In both past and recent periods, individuals from classes associated with higher economic and cultural capital exhibited greater diversity of ties and a propensity to privilege formal over informal contacts. These tendencies reflect concrete substantive differences: the professional class’s omnivorous but distinctively cultural propensity; the managerial class’s omnivorous but fraternal propensity; and the other classes’ stronger ties to local community and kin, diversified for the minority with membership in labor and fraternal-like organizations.</p>
<p>These class distinctions remained relatively stable throughout the shorter timeframe of the empirical data, from 1974 to 2010. Nevertheless, and this is the second main finding, although there is no evidence of change in the substance of social class differences, I did find evidence of their intensification in the 2000s. This intensification coincided with the growing ranks of individuals with minimal ties to kin, community, and voluntary groups: a development that resonates with the previously documented trends of disengagement from the civic sphere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0003122413491963">Putnam 2000</xref>) and contraction of core networks to immediate kin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0003122413491963">McPherson et al. 2006</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0003122413491963">17</xref></sup> Overexposed to these two trends and overrepresented in the resulting patterns of limited social ties, the lower classes grew more homogenous, reinforcing traditional social class differences. In other words, data from the past decade illustrate a contraction of the minority of lower-class individuals with diverse and formal social ties.</p>
<p>Discussion of these results must account for the nuances of the overall picture these data reveal. First, the substantive differences between social classes are not radical but a matter of degree. No single aggregate class category is associated with an exclusive sociability pattern. The unequal distribution of social classes within each pattern resembles associated class differences in volume of economic and cultural capital. Second, the recent trend of growing within-class homogeneity, even if it evokes a move from an ideal-type of intra-class diversity of sociability patterns toward an ideal-type of homology between social classes and sociability patterns, is modest and short enough to make any conclusions tentative.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, these results provide sufficient evidence to claim comparability of the association between social classes and sociability patterns in the contemporary period with that of and prior to the 1950s. Similarly, research from that period reported not radical but substantively meaningful and consequential differences between social classes. Given that contemporary and mid-twentieth century U.S. society are very different, in many respects, the observed relative comparability speaks to the presence of unabated class distinctions in sociability patterns.</p>
<p>But if the bottom line of the present results is persistence, what does the persistence of class differences in sociability imply for contemporary lifestyles? Considerable prior research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0003122413491963">Pachucki and Breiger 2010</xref>) and direct evidence in the present analysis suggest strong implications. First, the sociability practices measured in this article (1) take place in diverse social contexts in which lifestyle practices are commonly enacted; (2) are the source for Americans’ majority of friendships, confiding relations, and social support ties, which are understood as a strong predictor of lifestyle practices; and (3) contribute, by way of the strong homophily in the associated social networks, to the formation, maintenance, and reinforcement of individuals’ general systems of values, norms, and manners.</p>
<p>Second, the direct link between sociability and lifestyle practices is corroborated by the present empirical analysis on a set of conventional lifestyle measures of cultural participation. Individuals’ cultural practices act as a logical extension of the type of social contacts that define each sociability pattern. This evidence underscores the pertinence of the present findings beyond the specific literature on sociability and for lifestyle research in general. Given the latter’s strong reliance on measures of cultural participation, researchers thus have valid reasons to consider the class-lifestyle association in light of the present evidence on the historical persistence of class differences in sociability.</p>
<p>Findings in this article point to several potent developments for future research. Lifestyles are typically measured through cultural preferences and practices in institutional domains like literature, music, art, and consumer brands. This type of measure is the primary basis upon which challenges to the contemporary pertinence of social class to lifestyles have been formulated. The present evidence to the contrary was based on measures of social contacts. Even though the ensuing sociability patterns appear to have direct consequences for cultural participation, I was able to verify these effects only for a small sample population for a single survey year, at the mid-point of the larger historical period in question. The evidence thus requires further corroboration with a larger sample and over a longer period of time to make stronger inferences regarding the association between social classes and lifestyles. Consideration of emergent forms of sociability like self-help groups and social media contacts, in particular, is also needed. Prospects for such research are rich and can step on solid theoretical and empirical grounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0003122413491963">Pachucki and Breiger 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>These analyses of social class differences leave out two points worthy of further consideration. One concerns the exclusion (due to missing information on occupations) of the inactive population, of which the most sizeable portion is retirees. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0003122413491963">Putnam (2000)</xref> argues that an important generational shift in volunteering is responsible for the trend of disengagement from the civic sphere. Exclusion of retirees from the analysis may thus have led to underestimation of the upward trends in civic disengagement and social isolation. This hypothesis can be verified with appropriate data and may shed new light on the nature of class differences reported here. Second, although the present results support the notion that sociability patterns map coherently onto aggregate social class categories, the analysis does not parse out the contribution of constituent elements of the class definition: endowments (e.g., educational levels), working conditions (e.g., amount of autonomy), and rewards packages (e.g., income). More detailed analysis is necessary to relate the present findings to recent studies emphasizing the importance of occupational status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0003122413491963">Chan 2010</xref>) and differences on the disaggregate level of occupations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0003122413491963">Weeden and Grusky 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0003122413491963">2012</xref>). In this vein, it will be worthwhile to verify whether cultural capital (e.g., educational levels) exerts an influence on sociability comparable to what has been documented in the stratification of cultural consumption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0003122413491963">DiMaggio 2001</xref>).</p>

<title>Appendix: Results and Discussion of Model Selection</title>
<p>Having no preconceived theory about the structure of associative life, I tested models with a different number of dimensions or factors on which the 11 indicators load freely (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-0003122413491963">Table A1</xref>). As a general rule, addition of an extra latent factor improves on the overall explained variance as measured by the decline in the likelihood-ratio chi-squared statistic (L<sup>2</sup>). Even though the associated near-zero <italic>p</italic>-values indicate poor fits for the models, they need to be considered with caution, if trusted at all, because of the extreme sparseness of the models’ tables. An illustration of the sparseness of these data are the corresponding large numbers of degrees of freedom that are almost equivalent to the total weighted sample size of 8,000. Those limitations aside, with every additional latent factor the model’s likelihood-ratio chi-squared statistic declines in a statistically significant way, which I evaluate by comparing the reduction in the likelihood-ratio to the loss of degrees in freedom (df). Accordingly, the model with five discrete factors fits these data best. However, that model is less parsimonious than models with a smaller number of discrete factors, as the respective lower values of the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) suggest.</p>
<p>To adjudicate between models, I verified how well each model accounts for pair-wise associations for the 11 indicators (information is available upon request). Recall that the primary objective of latent class models is to explain these associations by way of latent variables. According to this criterion, the best fitting model is the one for which the residuals for each pair-wise association are not statistically significant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0003122413491963">Vermunt and Magidson 2005b</xref>). This is the case only for Models 4 and 5. However, Model 4 is both more parsimonious (i.e., lower BIC) and misclassifies a smaller proportion of data, 18 percent compared to 22 percent for Model 5. I therefore retained a model with four latent class discrete factors for the empirical analyses in this article. For the technical explanation of the statistics discussed here, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0003122413491963">Vermunt and Magidson (2005a)</xref>.</p>

<p>Note, first, that I chose not to include the available measure on contacts with friends because it may overlap with other measures of social contact. Second, in the 2004 GSS, measures on informal and formal ties are on two separate ballots, which necessitated imputation of the former’s values using estimates based on a list of regressors common to both ballots (results from the analysis are available upon request). Finally, to conform to the structure of the other variables, I dichotomized the two measures of informal ties.</p>

<fn fn-type="other" id="fn7-0003122413491963">

<p>Measures of formal ties came from a battery of variables that capture social ties to work-based and voluntary associations by way of a list of comprehensive, aggregate categories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0003122413491963">Smith 1990</xref>). From the battery of 16 variables, I excluded the residual “other” measure. I excluded four additional measures—membership in veteran, youth, school service, and school fraternity/sorority groups—because they represent practices associated with specific age-, family-, and military-status categories and hence neither occur throughout one’s whole life nor constitute valid options for every individual.</p>

<p>In a separate analysis using the same data, the goodness-of-fit of the best fitting standard latent class cluster model was inferior to the goodness-of-fit of the best fitting latent class discrete factor model on which this article is based; the latter also had a twice lower classification error.</p>

In addition, the model allowed for two violations to the local independence assumption in regard to pair-wise associations, which it does not account for completely: (1) a negative association between membership in hobby and sport groups and (2) a positive association between membership in nationality and service groups. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table7-0003122413491963">Table A2</xref> in the <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-0003122413491963">Appendix</xref> presents all parameters along with the corresponding intercepts.</p>

<p>Using the SI-CHAID software, respondents were assigned to the pattern for which their reported posterior membership probability was highest. This classification procedure conserves the estimated sizes of the latent patterns and is associated with an 18 percent classification error. This amount of error is considered modest in latent class models; given that measurement errors tend to attenuate the association between variables, results of subsequent analyses can be regarded as conservative estimates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0003122413491963">Chan and Goldthorpe 2007b</xref>).</p>

<p>In so far as the latter trend has been the subject of criticism (see note 10), results here, using different data and methods, corroborate the increase of social isolation. Moreover, with regard to this article’s focus on incumbent forms of association at the expense of accounting for some emerging types of sociability (e.g., self-help groups and social media contacts), the present evidence on the rise of social isolation and civic disengagement is reinforced by the observed strong, positive relation between reported patterns of sociability and cultural participation: socially isolated individuals are also significantly less likely to engage in a diverse set of cultural activities.</p>
