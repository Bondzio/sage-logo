<title>Introduction</title>
<p>In the rich tapestry of the histories, practices and movements that claim the name of Indian nationalism, the Gadar Party stands out as a striking motif.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1742766512444342">1</xref></sup> The Gadar Party was a South Asian political organization headquartered in San Francisco, which championed the cause of Indian independence in the first half of the 20th century. Advocating an avowedly militant approach to the liberation of India from British colonial rule, the party was founded in 1913 and formally disbanded in 1947 once India gained independence. Understood more broadly as a movement, Gadar, by different scholarly accounts, spans the years from 1907 to 1947, with the pre-1918 years generally considered its militant phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1742766512444342">Juergensmeyer, 1977</xref>: 18 n.20; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1742766512444342">Omvedt, 1974b</xref>: 3–4; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1742766512444342">Puri, 1993</xref>: ix). Punjabi immigration to North America in the early 20th century, the immigrants’ experiences of racism and the anticolonial disposition shared by the South Asian cultural and political groups of the time shaped the development of the movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1742766512444342">Juergensmeyer, 1977</xref>: 4, 7–8; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1742766512444342">Singh, 2000</xref>: 36–37). Pan-Indian and non-sectarian in ethos, Gadar claimed a natural affinity with the ideals embodied by American revolutionary leaders and professed a strong kinship with contemporary anti-imperial movements.</p>
<p>In the popular imagination, the Gadar movement evokes the romance of lost causes, associated as it is with a failed attempt to launch a revolutionary armed struggle in India. In 1915, Gadar sympathizers in North America returned to India with the aim of fomenting a popular armed uprising to topple the colonial government. The plan, intercepted and quashed by the British, resulted in the imprisonment and execution of significant numbers of the revolutionaries. An insurrection in Singapore in the same year met with similar results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1742766512444342">Omvedt, 1974b</xref>: 4). In 1917, Ram Chandra, the leader of the Gadar Party, other party members and German diplomatic officials were arrested for planning a military conspiracy against the British, in violation of US neutrality laws. Twenty-nine conspirators, Indian and German, would be found guilty at what came to be known as the Hindu-German Conspiracy Trial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1742766512444342">McMahon, 2001</xref>: 37).</p>
<p>Scholars have offered varied conclusions about the impact of the Gadar movement on the Indian struggle for independence, Punjabi and Indian diasporic politics and global political movements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1742766512444342">Juergensmeyer, 1988</xref>: 15; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1742766512444342">Omvedt, 1974a</xref>: 4–6; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1742766512444342">Ramnath, 2005</xref>: 8; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1742766512444342">Singh, 2000</xref>: 35). One aspect of the Gadar movement, however, is beyond dispute – its insistence on the necessity of violence for achieving Indian independence. To the question of the means for realizing the freedom of the nation, ‘[t]here was only one answer: Ghadar, i.e., violent revolutionary change’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1742766512444342">Puri, 1993</xref>: 3). This article analyzes the complex place of violence in Gadar thought. I show how, in key Gadar writings, violence operates both as universal communication and as a critique of the possibility of universal communication. I also argue that violence in these contradictory roles brokers a relationship between national identity and global belonging. I understand <italic>communication</italic> in two broad senses to refer to (a) those mechanisms through which messages are exchanged, and (b) the substance of the messages themselves. I also draw on Williams’ argument that communication is a fundamental primary human activity that actively shapes reality, and not a second-order activity that merely mirrors that reality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1742766512444342">1976</xref>: 11). I use the phrase, ‘universal communication’, in this paper to describe verbal and non-verbal processes, equally available to human social groups, of exchanging messages that can also be effectively understood by all these groups.</p>
<p>In Gadar discourse, on the one hand, acts of violence allow oppressed societies to secure the status of civilized nations. Violence also operates as a historiographic principle that enables the writing of universal history, linking present with past and incorporating national histories into global narratives. Violence thus functions as universal communication in two senses – the performative and the representational. On the other hand, violence fails to sustain collective communities beyond a narrow conception of political community. It is mute to such possibilities. The body that suffers violence also negates the very possibility of communication. The conflicting roles of violence point to an implicit understanding of the contingent nature of national and global identities in Gadar thought.</p>
<p>My analysis centers on two Gadar texts. One of these is <italic>Shabash</italic> (<italic>Bravo</italic>), originally written in Urdu, which celebrates the 1912 bombing attempt in Delhi on Lord Hardinge, Viceroy of India (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1742766512444342">Har Dayal, 1913</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1742766512444342">2</xref></sup> The text was authored by Har Dayal, a leader of the party till his arrest and subsequent departure from the US in 1914. The charismatic and mercurial Har Dayal was also the first editor of the <italic>Hindustan Gadar</italic>, the publication from which the organization gets its name. The other text analyzed is an unpublished memoir, ‘History of the Freedom Movement in India: The Ghadar Movement, 1913–1918’, written around 1956 by a party member, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1742766512444342">Darisi Chenchiah (undated)</xref>.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1742766512444342">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>The rationale for examining these texts as emblematic of Gadar thought is as follows. While the emphasis on violence is visible in several Gadar writings, <italic>Shabash</italic> is a particularly rich example of a text in which, consciously, internationalist idioms of violent political action – terrorism and the ‘philosophy of the bomb’ – are related to a nationalist project. Viewed from another angle, the text brings into conversation the apparently contradictory imperatives of cosmopolitanism and nationalism. Chenchiah’s memoir, written after India attained independence, brings with it the benefit of perspective rooted in temporal distance, providing an illuminating foil and contrast to <italic>Shabash</italic>. It is a detailed account from the vantage point of someone who was intimately involved with the movement during a critical phase of its history. Covering the span of years when the movement was focused on ridding India of British rule through armed revolution, the text offers a fertile ground for exploring the philosophical understandings of the violence animating the movement.</p>
<p>My reading locates Gadar thought on violence in the context of broader understandings of violence in Indian anticolonial nationalism. In examining the texts, I also draw on Fanon’s theorization of anticolonial violence and Scarry’s insights on bodily violence. Given its character as a diasporic political movement, the Gadar discourse on violence may also be understood as a global conversation that is informed by and circulates across global communication networks. As Omvedt notes, the Gadar movement ‘was the most international of all Indian revolutionary organizations, with a sphere of operation that ran quite literally from Stockton, California to Shanghai, China’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1742766512444342">1974b</xref>: 3). The texts analyzed in this paper may, accordingly, be seen as forms of global media, written with a global consciousness and meant for consumption by global audiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1742766512444342">Chopra, 2011</xref>: 7–9). Situated at the intersection of history, cultural theory and communication, this article is a modest attempt to tell what Susan Buck-Morss calls an ‘<italic>un</italic>disciplined’ story, one that traverses and dwells in the borders between the nations of specialized disciplinary and subdisciplinary inquiry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1742766512444342">Buck-Morss, 2009</xref>: 75, italics in original).</p>

<sec id="section2-1742766512444342">
<title>Indian and international genealogies of violence in Gadar thought</title>
<p>The significance of revolutionary violence in the Indian freedom struggle has been somewhat neglected because of the prominent role ascribed to the Gandhian ideology of non-violence in the movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1742766512444342">Heehs, 1998</xref>: vii; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1742766512444342">Singh, 2000</xref>: 35). However, as Heehs notes, ‘violent resistance was preached and practiced throughout the independence movement and had a significant effect on its course and outcome’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1742766512444342">Heehs, 1993</xref>: 469). The Indian terrorist movement, which advocated the use of violence against the British colonial government, flourished in Bengal after 1905, though the first act of Indian terrorism was the murder of a British official by the Chapekar brothers in Poona in 1897 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1742766512444342">Heehs, 1993</xref>: 470; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1742766512444342">Laushey, 1975</xref>: 1). The partition of Bengal in 1905 as well as the inspiration of the Japanese victory in the 1904–1905 Japanese-Russian war gave Indian terrorism a powerful affective charge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1742766512444342">Laushey, 1975</xref>: 5). The movement also developed a presence in Bombay, Madras and the United Provinces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1742766512444342">Heehs, 1993</xref>: 470). Laushey argues that Indian terrorism was, for the most part, homegrown, a ‘natural and indigenous response to European imperialism’, though European writings and technology did have some influence on it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1742766512444342">Laushey, 1975</xref>: viii).</p>
<p>The 23 December 1912 bombing attempt on the life of Lord Hardinge, the Viceroy of India, as he made his state entry into Delhi, the newly restored capital of India, qualifies as the ‘most spectacular terrorist act of the pre-World War I period’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1742766512444342">Laushey, 1975</xref>: 10). The attack was undertaken by a group of north Indian terrorists led by the Bengali Rash Behari Bose. One of Hardinge’s Indian attendants was killed during the attack and another badly injured. The viceroy himself was wounded and his wife, while unhurt, was clearly traumatized by the event (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1742766512444342">Marconi Transatlantic Wireless Telegraph, 1912</xref>). During the First World War, terrorist groups in Bengal, across the nation and internationally, established links, hoping to achieve a number of common goals. These included getting Indians in the armed forces to join their movement, bringing Gadar members into India for fomenting revolution, arranging for German arms to be provided to Indians, and effectively organizing and training the various Indian terrorist societies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1742766512444342">Laushey, 1975</xref>: 10–11). Plans to meet these objectives largely met with failure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1742766512444342">Laushey, 1975</xref>: 11).</p>
<p>Oberoi has argued that the Gadar movement differed radically from the Bengal and Maharashtra schools of terrorism in that it was neither theologically informed nor did it share the metaphysical preoccupations of the latter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1742766512444342">Oberoi, 2009</xref>: 43). He suggests that key aspects of the movement can best be understood with reference to the doctrines of the Russian anarchists, notably the idea of spontaneous revolution predicated on the individual as the fundamental unit of society (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1742766512444342">Oberoi, 2009</xref>: 42–43). Har Dayal was also committed to the ‘philosophy of the bomb’ – the redressal of injustice through violent and terroristic means (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1742766512444342">Laqueur, 2001</xref>: 21). The mode of argument may itself be considered an international genre, to which Indians, among others, contributed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1742766512444342">Laqueur, 2001</xref>: 43–49). Indeed, the bomb was an ‘obsessive part of Har Dayal’s six-step programme’ of political action, inaugurated by the pen, including the tongue, the sword, the gun, the general strike, and culminating with the use of the bomb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1742766512444342">Oberoi, 2009</xref>: 44, n.20, 46).</p>
<p>It is against the backdrop of this general relationship with Indian and international movements that Gadar thinking on violence may be situated.</p>

<sec id="section3-1742766512444342">
<title>Violence in Har Dayal’s <italic>Shabash</italic></title>
<p>Commemorating the one-year anniversary of the Hardinge attack, <italic>Shabash</italic> is squarely in the tradition of the philosophy of the bomb.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1742766512444342">4</xref></sup> Har Dayal does not mince words in his praise of the bomb attack. ‘In the history of liberty throughout the world’, he tells us, ‘perhaps no bomb that was ever thrown has been so successful’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1742766512444342">Har Dayal, 1913</xref>: 10). The insistence on revolutionary violence in <italic>Shabash</italic> is not in itself original, with precedents in European literature that inspired Gadar and the Indian terrorist movement. And Har Dayal’s encomiums for the bombing may bear more than a trace of self-valorization, for he would be discovered by a British intelligence official as one of the original conspirators of the Hardinge plot (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1742766512444342">Popplewell, 1995</xref>: 80–87). Puri has argued that the Gadarites’ and Har Dayal’s views on terrorism were inconsistent, given a semblance of coherence only by having to vanquish a well-defined enemy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1742766512444342">Puri, 1993</xref>: 135). I want to suggest, however, that <italic>Shabash</italic> can be read to discern a somewhat more complex position on violence in Gadar thought. Violence in the figure of the bomb simultaneously embodies a model of universal civilization and the limits of that model. Linking past and present and national with global histories, violence presents the paradox of a universal modality of communication, whose universality, nonetheless, is restricted.</p>
<p>The category of civilization operates in at least three somewhat overlapping senses in Har Dayal’s argument, each of which is linked to the bomb or violence. First, it is a general and desirable characteristic of humanity, a universal and shared state of collective being to which all nations must aspire. Har Dayal can accordingly argue that ‘[t]he bomb has brought India within the sphere of civilization’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1742766512444342">Har Dayal, 1913</xref>: 16, 25). A second sense of the term, intermingled with the first, is the notion of civilization as synonymous with a culturally bounded community. Civilized nations are specific entities and the world divides into civilized and uncivilized nations, a division which corresponds to those nations that use violence effectively and those that do not. Har Dayal proposes that ‘[t]he community that learns t[he] use of the bomb at once joins the civilized nations’ in contrast to ‘the oppressed classes and natives which remain in servitude’ and who ‘are everywhere regarded as uncivilized and ignoble’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1742766512444342">Har Dayal, 1913</xref>: 16, 25). At the same time, Har Dayal makes a distinction between the necessary capacity for violence that civilized nations needs must possess and the kind of violence committed by the British empire in India, which has led to poverty, slavery and suffering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1742766512444342">Har Dayal, 1913</xref>: 31, 32; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1742766512444342">Hindustan Gadar Party, undated</xref>: no page).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1742766512444342">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>A third sense, corresponding to the performative, is the act of civilizing entailed in learning the art of bomb-making, throwing the bomb or, more generally, reorientating one’s consciousness in consonance with a philosophy of violence. The bomb is both teacher and tool in a revolutionary pedagogy of the awakening of dignity, courage and political consciousness. Learning to make a bomb is an apprenticeship in political consciousness for the masses and leaders alike. The bomb is needed because words cannot suffice in rousing Indians to overthrow the British (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1742766512444342">Har Dayal, 1913</xref>: 15). Signifying catharsis, violence brings previously collaborationist nationalists together in a fresh start in the fight against their colonial overlords (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1742766512444342">Oberoi, 2009</xref>: 44). The awakening on the part of Asian nations, such as India and China, reflected in the appearance of the bomb in these societies, will enable them to join forces with European powers, such as Germany, with the common goal of destroying the British empire (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1742766512444342">Har Dayal, 1913</xref>: 16, 17).</p>
<p>The Delhi bomb also condenses national and global histories, even as it links past and present, speaking across space and time. The Delhi bomb was suffused with the spirit, sacrifice and blessing of a number of Indian martyrs, patriots and revolutionaries, past and present, including Rani Lakshmi Bai, the rebels of 1857 and Veer Savarkar (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1742766512444342">Har Dayal, 1913</xref>: 10). Har Dayal also locates the thrower of the bomb in the august company of other revolutionaries in world history, from tyrannicides in ancient Greece to Orsini, the Italian revolutionary who attempted to take the life of Napoleon III (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1742766512444342">Har Dayal, 1913</xref>: 28–29).</p>
<p>Traversing the three senses of civilization and bridging past and present, violence mediates relations between the global and the Indian. The capacity of the bomb to inspire across nations is what allows it to unite Indian communities within the nation in a common cause. Har Dayal states, ‘The roar of the bomb represents the voice of the united nations. Who does not understand this? The Madrasi and the Bengali, the Punjabi and the Pathan, the educated and the uneducated – all understand the meaning of the bomb’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1742766512444342">Har Dayal, 1913</xref>: 14–15). The bomb and violence are universally understood forms of expression and they are the communicative glue linking regional, national and global communities.</p>
<p>Paradoxically, the effectiveness of the bomb as a universal communicative language derives precisely from the fact that the bomb stands for the very antithesis of verbal language. Contrasting the value of words with actions related to the bomb, Har Dayal tells us that:
<disp-quote>
<p>The country that has not learnt the art of bomb making has uselessly wasted its time even if it has learnt thousands of other arts. It is useless to hear a hundred thousand lectures in a country where the bugle of the bomb has not been blown. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1742766512444342">Har Dayal, 1913</xref>: 14–15)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The communicative power of the bomb lies in the fact that it is a ‘force of example’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1742766512444342">Har Dayal, 1913</xref>: 16).</p>
<p>Har Dayal’s thoughts on the nature of the violence of colonialism and decolonization both anticipate and differ in key respects from the radical insights of Fanon, the great theorist of anticolonial liberation. Fanon, like Har Dayal, considers violence essential to the cause of freedom from colonial subjugation. Enabling both psychological survival and regeneration for the colonized individual, the ‘violence of the colonized unifies the people’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1742766512444342">Fanon, 2004</xref>: 51). Although there is much greater psychological depth in Fanon’s case for the value of violence to the colonized, Har Dayal, too, sees acts of violence as acts of self-assertion by a colonized people.</p>
<p>The rationale for anticolonial violence, however, differs significantly in Fanon and Har Dayal. For Har Dayal, violence is a choice as a strategy for anticolonial struggle, even if it is the obvious choice. For Fanon, the colonized do not really have a choice: the violence inherent in the relationship between colonizer and colonized must – and will – be turned on the former in a successful decolonization. Violence is the coin of the realm, the currency of the colonial situation. Colonialism, as experienced by the colonized, is ‘naked violence’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1742766512444342">Fanon, 2004</xref>: 23). The initial encounter between colonizer and colonized is ‘colored by violence’, and the relationship continues to be marked by violence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1742766512444342">Fanon, 2004</xref>: 2). Shot through with violence, the structure of the colonial world, from the moment of its birth, depends on the relentless destruction of the culture, economy and social world of the colonized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1742766512444342">Fanon, 2004</xref>: 3, 5–6).</p>
<p>Born and bred in the atmosphere of the violence of colonialism, the colonized ‘have been prepared for violence from time immemorial’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1742766512444342">Fanon, 2004</xref>: 3). During colonial rule, violence is sterile and counter-productive as far as the colonized are concerned, manifesting itself in ‘fratricidal struggles’ or expended through other activities such as dance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1742766512444342">Fanon, 2004</xref>: 20). This violence, however, is redeemed and redeems when deployed in the service of the anticolonial struggle. It is inherent in the logic of the colonial relationship that this will be the case. It is thus that Fanon can assert: ‘In its bare reality, decolonization reeks of red-hot cannonballs and knives’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1742766512444342">Fanon, 2004</xref>: 3). Violence is the essence of decolonization.</p>
<p>A second difference in the thought of Har Dayal and Fanon pertains to the universal nature and potentialities of political violence. Har Dayal’s somewhat undeveloped distinction between ‘civilized’ violence and barbaric violence undermines his case for the universal redemptive potential of political violence. If the use of violence by the British against women and children is what renders them uncivilized, then the same might apply to the attack on Lady Hardinge as well. And, crucially, the general silence about European imperialism (other than British imperialism) and American imperialism as forms of violence in <italic>Shabash</italic> are striking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1742766512444342">Puri, 1993</xref>: 128–129). The universalist justification for violence in <italic>Shabash</italic> is muddied by an unclear notion of colonial difference. Violence in Fanon, however, stems from and reflects the absolute negation of universalism. As Fanon states, ‘It is not a discourse on the universal, but the impassioned claim by the colonized that their world is fundamentally different’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1742766512444342">Fanon, 2004</xref>: 6). This violence is an assertion of a pure colonial difference and not of a combination of sameness and difference, as in Har Dayal.</p>
<p>In Fanon, there is a clear understanding that the necessary violence of decolonization cannot sustain the postcolonial political community. His Marxist analysis of the failings of the ‘national bourgeoisie’ emphasizes the need for sovereignty based on the ‘dignity’ of the masses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1742766512444342">Fanon, 2004</xref>: 98, 139). The universalizing impetus of violence as communication presented in Har Dayal’s thought also reveals itself as self-limiting in <italic>Shabash</italic>, though these limits are not consciously articulated; for violence as communicative reason in <italic>Shabash</italic> can only mobilize a political community up to a point and in a specific manner. Violence requires an object and an adversary to justify its very existence. If violence is an essential element in the forging of a civilized Indian identity worthy of respect from the world, that violence, however, cannot lead toward a model of Indian identity without reference to a common oppressor that unites different Indian groups. Puri notes that Har Dayal followed the <italic>risorgimento</italic> model of Mazzini, wherein the separate identity of each group, ‘Jats, Rajputs and Khans; Marathas, Bengalis and Punjabis; Hindus, Sikhs and Muslims’, was valorized toward fostering a larger national solidarity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1742766512444342">Puri, 1993</xref>: 131). Violence itself cannot transform these separate identities into another model of Indian identity, nor can it provide the ground for such a collective identity. It follows then that when the Gadar movement is described as secular, it must be understood so in a negative sense of not privileging any overarching religious, regional or linguistic identity. It is not necessarily secular in the positive sense of avowing a composite Indian identity that exceeds particularistic Indian identities.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1742766512444342">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>In concluding this section, it bears noting that Har Dayal dramatically changed his views on the utility of political violence within a few years of his exile in Berlin, following the failure of the attempted insurrection in India in 1915. As a <italic>New York Times</italic> article published in 1919 pointed out, he advocated autonomy for India within the empire on the grounds that Indians, although intelligent, were biologically incapable of courage and militant valor as a result of the enervating climes of India (<italic>New York Times</italic>, 1919). Ramnath notes that the ‘erratic’ Har Dayal ‘would eventually shift his obsessions from open revolution to moral transformation’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1742766512444342">Ramnath, 2005</xref>: 21) After the First World War, the movement would take on another direction, the ‘anarcho-Hindu ascetics’ of the early Gadar era being replaced by communists who would contribute to people’s movements and the struggle for national liberation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1742766512444342">Ramnath, 2005</xref>: 28). One might speculate that the legitimacy of Gadar’s early ideological emphasis on violence as a necessary means for Indian freedom may, to a certain extent, have been rooted in the charismatic authority of Har Dayal. Har Dayal’s exile, the failed attempt at revolution and the changed post-war world may have limited the reach of the message of <italic>Shabash</italic> in the later phase of the movement.</p>

<title>Violence in Darisi Chenchiah’s ‘History of the Freedom Movement in India: The Gadar Movement, 1913–1918’</title>
<p>A lengthier document, Darisi Chenchiah’s memoir, written after the independence of India, did not need to share the pessimism of Har Dayal about the attainability of Indian independence. Chenchiah, who had joined the University of California at Berkeley as a student, was closely involved with Gadar’s history from its inception until his eventual release from prison in 1919 after several arrests for revolutionary activities in the service of the movement. My reading focuses on three arguments about violence as universal communication in the text: violence as a mode of writing history; the distinction between human and inhuman species of violence; and the question of bodily violence, where the body problematizes the possibility of universal communication. Each of these arguments, in turn, implies a particular relationship between national and global identity.</p>
<p>As in <italic>Shabash</italic>, violence in ‘History’ forges a link between the Indian past, the Indian present and the global present. Violence also becomes a way of rewriting Indian history. This argument, which can be gleaned in nascent form in <italic>Shabash</italic>, is elaborated in greater detail in ‘History’. Chenchiah introduces his memoir with a reference to the 1857 revolt. The objective of the Gadar Party ‘was to achieve [the] Independence of India by armed revolt, more or less, on the lines of [the] Indian Mutiny of 1857 (Indian War of Independence)’, while ensuring that, unlike in 1857, the Punjabis would not fight on the side of the British this time around (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1742766512444342">Chenchiah, undated</xref>: Part I, 1, 6). Recalling Har Dayal’s insistence that the British empire was a blight upon the world and that destroying it was in the interest of humanity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1742766512444342">Chenchiah, undated</xref>: Part I, 3), Chenchiah records a similar sentiment being expressed by Sun Yat Sen in a meeting with the latter at Tokyo:
<disp-quote>
<p>British imperialism was the greatest enemy of the freedom of independence of other countries in the world. So long as the British were ruling India, they would continue to remain a menace to the freedom of weaker nations. The Indians must overthrow the British rule in India first. Till then, there would be no hope for weaker nations. It was the sacred and history duty of the Indians to help humanity by liberating India. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1742766512444342">Chenchiah, undated</xref>: Part IV, [5–6])</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>There is a double justification for the recourse to violence in overthrowing the British empire. The failure of the 1857 revolt could be redeemed through such action and the general cause of humanity would also be served through the destruction of the British empire. In this reasoning, violence becomes an instrument that combines ethnic Punjabi, national and global responsibility. It brings the Indian past into world history, by framing 1857 not just as a failed national mutiny but, instead, as a cause for humanity that did not succeed. Violence here is something that communicates and responds to demands across space and time, even as it effects a historiographic revision of anti-imperial insurgency. Violence is both an assertion of universalism, and what may be called a historiographic performative. In its execution, it proves and constructs the history by which it claims to be motivated.</p>
<p>The resonances and differences of both these Gadar texts with the work of Fanon are instructive. In Fanon, anticolonial violence enables the colonized to come into being and enter history for the first time. Decolonization brings with it a ‘new language and a new humanity’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1742766512444342">Fanon, 2004</xref>: 2). It is ‘truly the creation of new men’, even as it reciprocally creates new men (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1742766512444342">Fanon, 2004</xref>: 2). As Fanon says, ‘The “thing” colonized becomes a man through the very process of liberation’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1742766512444342">Fanon, 2004</xref>: 2). The colonizer reduces the colonized to a state of ‘immobility’ by writing the history of the colony as the history of the metropolis, ‘not the history of the country he is despoiling but the history of his own nation’s looting, raping, and starving to death’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1742766512444342">Fanon, 2004</xref>: 15). It is a history of violence, but of the perpetration of violence on the colonized. Colonization itself has to end in order for the colonized to begin to imagine themselves as the subjects of history (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1742766512444342">Fanon, 2004</xref>: 15). Violence in the cause of decolonization, accordingly, becomes the necessary instrument for creating and writing a new, authentic history.</p>
<p>Fanon’s thought shares broad similarities with the Gadar texts with regard to the role of violence in enabling the colonized to stake a claim to history. There are two key differences, though. In the Gadar texts, the history of the colonized is an <italic>interrupted</italic> history. In Fanon, the history of the colonized is a <italic>lost</italic> history. The colonized have no history since colonialism has effectively annihilated it. The other difference resides in what Gyan Prakash has described as the notion of the past as ‘anteriority’, not irretrievably lost to time, but something recoverable and usable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1742766512444342">Prakash, 1999</xref>: 91). Violence enables a recovery of the Indian past and a certain conception of the global past in the Gadar texts. In Fanon, it brings forth a present that will one day become an authentic past.</p>
<p>There is also an implicit argument in ‘History’ about the subversive possibilities of violence as universal communication in that the text creates a community of victims across supposed enemy lines, which do not square with national affiliations. The argument rests on the distinction between human and inhuman species of violence. In Part V of ‘History’, Chenchiah describes his arrest in Bangkok and his experience in detention in connection with the British Lahore Conspiracy case, 2nd Supplementary, related to his role in the wider Gadar conspiracy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1742766512444342">Chenchiah, undated</xref>: Part V, [1]). Transported to Singapore, Chenchiah and five others implicated in the case were subjected to frequent torture for six months in solitary confinement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1742766512444342">Chenchiah, undated</xref>: Part V, [3]). The British were tormenting the Indian prisoners in retaliation for the killing of the 352-strong British population of Singapore in 1915 by the Rajput Muslim Regiment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1742766512444342">Chenchiah, undated</xref>: Part V, [2]). The mutiny by the all-Muslim 5th Light Infantry was ‘apparently incited by propaganda from Ghadarites as well as from emissaries of the BIC-allied Turkish Khilafat’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1742766512444342">Ramnath, 2005</xref>: 15). Eight British officers were killed and the city was under the control of the mutineers for three days.</p>
<p>Chenchiah’s use of the term, ‘inhuman’, to describe the actions committed by the regiment follows shortly after his use of the term, ‘inhuman’, to describe the treatment meted out to him and his fellow prisoners at the hands of a ‘British Imperialist’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1742766512444342">Chenchiah, undated</xref>: Part V, [2], [1], [2]). There is a hint of anxiety in his reflections about the fact that the Singapore mutineers may have been influenced by Gadar ideology. ‘It is not clear to me,’ Chenchiah says, ‘how far this Rajput Muslim Regiment was influenced by the Ghadar propaganda’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1742766512444342">Chenchiah, undated</xref>: Part V, [3]). Describing those who committed the acts as ‘communal fanatics’, he points out that the real culprits fled to neighboring countries when the mutiny was being suppressed, while those who did not participate in the insurrection would either be shot or sent to prison for life after being arrested and court-martialled (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1742766512444342">Chenchiah, undated</xref>: Part V, [3]).</p>
<p>Noteworthy here is the juxtaposition of the innocence of the British victims of the mutiny, Chenchiah and his fellow prisoners and the innocent members of the regiment, who would be condemned to death or life imprisonment for no fault of their own. The community of victims of inhuman violence, fanaticism, wickedness and unjust retaliation crosses national affiliations and traverses the communities of colonizers and colonized. Chenchiah’s ascription of inhumanity to those on both sides of the imperial divide appears as an instance of when the difference between colonizer and colonized, itself a product of history, is temporarily dissolved. It is replaced by another set of contingent categories, another measure of difference, specifically between those who have suffered inhumanity and those who have perpetrated it. The acknowledgment of humanity and inhumanity on both sides of the colonial encounter, aside from the larger question of the structures of colonial rule that engender such inhumanity, manifests itself in a language of violence that is both universal and evanescent, militating against other understandings of difference.</p>
<p>My final observation in this section, centering on the nature of bodily violence, relates to the inscrutability of violence itself. Taking shape as an argument about the limits of violence as communication – and violence as the limit to communication – this perspective on violence can be read in what is possibly the most astonishing and haunting passage in the memoir, a text which rivets and abounds in surprises on every page. If, in <italic>Shabash</italic>, violence speaks because it is the antithesis of words, in ‘History’, violence speaks in place of words, but does not, however, communicate anything. The basic elements of the story recounted in this remarkable passage may be described here in order to trace the meaning of violence at work in it.</p>
<p>Under the heading, ‘A Great Story of Heroism – Singapore’, Chenchiah recalls a ‘story, a most amazing one’ told by the soldiers of the Shropshire Engineers, who escorted the Indian soldiers from Singapore to Calcutta (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1742766512444342">Chenchiah, undated</xref>: Part V, [11]). The story goes that in the Rajput Muslims Regiment that revolted at Singapore in 1914–1915, ‘There was a Jamadar who was the heaviest they had ever seen. He looked like a small elephant, about 500 lbs. in weight’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1742766512444342">Chenchiah, undated</xref>: Part V, [11]). Chenchiah goes on to relate how the individual, who is not named, had remained neutral during the mutiny, neither participating in the killing of the Britishers, nor, however, helping them. When arrested, he was put in chains and fetters ‘since the young soldiers of the regiment felt nervous in dealing with him’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1742766512444342">Chenchiah, undated</xref>: Part V, [11]). Ordered to be shot, the Jamadar tricked or resisted death, at least for a while. The young soldiers tasked with shooting him were made nervous by the prospect and did not shoot him. The older soldiers who volunteered to kill him shot him in the head. But, as Chenchiah recalls,
<disp-quote>
<p>the Jamadar did not die. He merely slumped. Then, the major shot into his heart with his revolver, but even then he did not die. On the whole he received ten shots. Finally, the major knelt on his chest, pressed and pressed to get rid of the air in the lungs. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1742766512444342">Chenchiah, undated</xref>: Part V, [12])</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Fulfiling a promise to the soldiers in the telling of the tale, Chenchiah concludes the narration of the episode with these words:
<disp-quote>
<p>This incident, our escort told us and requested us to reveal this amaxing[sic] fact to the world. They confessed that they could not do it. One of the six soldiers that escorted us on the Steamer to Calcutta, was one of the volunteers of the Firing Squad. I had no opportunity to verify these surprising statements and I leave it to the Research scholars to do it. It is also important to find out if this Rajput Muslim Regiment revolted on account of Ghadar propaganda. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1742766512444342">Chenchiah, undated</xref>: Part V, [12])</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The story lends itself to several interpretations. One might read it as symbolic of the larger struggle of the Gadar movement. It draws attention to its own inassimilability into both the narrative of British tyranny and that of Indian resistance. Importantly, the story raises the question of the conditions under which the tortured body of the colonized can bear witness to the violence inflicted on it. As Scarry observes, the destruction of language is central to pain and that destruction, in turn, may be read as a destruction of that which marks us as human (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1742766512444342">Scarry, 1985</xref>: 4). The reaction to pain does not vary significantly by culture. Scarry speaks of the ‘universal sameness of the central problem’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1742766512444342">1985</xref>: 13), of the ‘utter rigidity of pain itself’, which is its main defining characteristic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1742766512444342">1985</xref>: 5). Pain, then, as Scarry describes it, is universal in its incommunicability. To attempt to communicate the experience of pain is to do two things. It is to translate an act in which the very humanity of a person is at risk of loss back into the idiom of humanity, and it is to attempt to share and communicate that which is unshareable and incommunicable.</p>
<p>Yet, such accounts of bodies that are tortured, destroyed or in pain are always rendered in profoundly unequal economies of sympathy. They are articulated in regimes of value that do not recognize the negative universalism of pain, the fact of its incommunicability across all bodies and the inherent equality of all the particular bodies that suffer. The body of the Jamadar, in its multiple muteness, loudly shouts this truth. The Jamadar is someone whose name we do not know. His neutrality in the matter of the mutiny is to no effect. Of his reaction, except the brute fact of his resistance to the attempts to kill him, we also know nothing. His pain survives not as incontrovertible evidence of a historical record of torture, but as an unverified, uncanny legend. Those who do not have a voice to begin with cannot stake a claim to have suffered as universal human beings. The story of the exceptional violence wrought upon the Jamadar’s body does not suggest that the body in pain could form the basis of an understanding of a shared, universal humanity. Nor does it affirm a notion of violence as a universal language. On the contrary, it suggests that the very concept of the universal human is confounded by the violence done to <italic>specific bodies</italic> based on their history, culture and origin, and that the universality of violence as a language rests on its unequal application to different bodies.</p>
<p>Finally, the story may also be read as a parable about violence and communication. The sudden turning away of the young soldiers from the obligation of killing, the refusal of the Jamadar to die easily and Chenchiah’s doubts and guilt about the possible role of the Gadar movement in the death of the Jamadar hint at an understanding of violence as a choice, violence as a luxury and violence as something whose consequences cannot be controlled by purity of ideological intention or focus. Chenchiah’s account challenges and confounds the claims made for violence in Har Dayal’s <italic>Shabash</italic> and elsewhere in ‘History’. In its deferral and inexplicability, the story of the Jamadar survives and spreads, a counterpoint to the idea of violence as universal communication, uniting British soldier and Indian prisoner in their response, disturbing the idea of any value – global or national – in violence.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>This article, as mentioned earlier, has been an attempt to tell an ‘<italic>un</italic>disciplined story’, using Buck-Morss’ phrase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1742766512444342">Buck-Morss, 2009</xref>: 75, italics in original). Buck-Morss locates the rationale for such stories in a politically urgent and necessary project of imagining and producing a new kind of universal history. This universal history is both rooted in and reflective of a new humanism demanded by the challenges of the present-day global order (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1742766512444342">Buck-Morss, 2009</xref>: 79). I wish to suggest here that the political and philosophical value of undisciplined stories may lie equally in their critique of universal and universalizing histories, of the kind revealed by my reading of the Gadar texts written by Chenchiah and Har Dayal. If these texts contain the possibilities of universal histories of violence, they also contain counter-narratives testifying to the limits of such histories. If violence operates as universal communication, speaking across time and uniting regional, national and local groups, it also symbolizes failures of communication and an inability to mobilize political community beyond a limited inclusivity.</p>
<p>Aside from exercising the imagination of scholars, the Gadar movement occupies an important place in the cultural memory of immigrant South Asians in the regions of the US associated with the party (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1742766512444342">Singh, 2000</xref>: 35). It also continues to dwell in the political imaginary of radical social movements in India and progressive social initiatives in the South Asian diaspora (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1742766512444342">Ramnath, 2005</xref>: 28). Like all movements with an anticolonial or radical political dimension, it runs the risk of hagiographic appropriation, sentimentalization and parochial cooption by different social and cultural groups. To remember Gadar in terms of its universal messages – about violence, belonging and history – while being profoundly aware of the limits of the universal ambitions and reach of those messages would be the ideal way of communicating and perpetuating the legacy of the movement.</p>
