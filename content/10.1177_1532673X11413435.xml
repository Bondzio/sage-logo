<p>What explains policy outcomes? Using a data set containing the actions and assessments of 776 lobbyists working closely on 77 policy proposals, combined with newly collected data on each proposal, I show that the intensity of lobbying against a proposal is a powerful predictor of the likelihood that the proposal is adopted in Congress or a federal agency. This negative lobbying is more effective than positive lobbying: it takes 3.5 lobbyists working for a new proposal to counteract the effect of just one lobbyist against it. Negative lobbying is a more important predictor of the policy outcome than the level of conflict, the preference of the majority of lobbyists, and differences in interest group resources. Several institutional factors—presidential support for the measure, congressional polarization, and whether the proposal was initiated by a federal agency—are found to affect policy outcomes, but only presidential support matters more than negative lobbying.</p>

<p>What explains whether and why a bill passes or a proposed rule is adopted? Understanding, and thereby predicting, whether a given proposal will be adopted is a challenge, because the outcome is affected by numerous complementary and competing influences. Yet policymakers, journalists, and the public find the question substantively and normatively important. Political scientists have offered various predictors of policy outcomes—the distribution of resources, the majority preference, the magnitude of conflict, the status quo policy, institutional factors, and others. But few scholars have attempted to explain policy outcomes using a very wide range of factors.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1532673X11413435">1</xref></sup> As a result, we still do not understand the relative power of the factors that help or hurt a proposal become law.</p>
<p>This article uses a large data set collected from lobbyists, combined with additional information on policy outcomes and institutional variables, to quantify and analyze several predictors of policy outcomes. I find that a new explanation—the amount of lobbying against a proposal—has a profound effect on the probability that a proposal is adopted. I argue that this negative lobbying alerts policymakers to the possibility of substantial negative consequences that outweigh the benefits that could come from adopting the proposal. The negative lobbying explanation is compared to other outcome predictors found in the literature. I find that only presidential support for a measure has a greater effect than does negative lobbying.</p>
<p>The implications of this finding are important. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-1532673X11413435">Schattschneider (1960)</xref> and others complain that the scales of policymaking are tilted toward moneyed, business interests. But the present finding suggests that less well-resourced groups can stave off efforts of wealthier groups to enact new policies the former wants to prevent. By growing the quantity of lobbyists against a measure, a group of shared interests may be able to tilt the policymakers’ calculus in their favor. The disproportionate weight of lobbying against a policy proposal presents an opportunity for less well-represented interests to have a greater say in what government does.</p>

<title>Possible Predictors of Policy Outcomes</title>
<sec id="section2-1532673X11413435">
<title>Conflict</title>
<p>Previous research has offered several main theories to explain policy outcomes. First, many scholars have argued that policy outcomes depend on the nature of the conflict (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1532673X11413435">Bauer, Pool, &amp; Dexter, 1963</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1532673X11413435">Heinz, Laumann, Nelson, &amp; Salisbury, 1993</xref>;<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1532673X11413435">2</xref></sup> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1532673X11413435">Kingdon, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1532673X11413435">Price, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-1532673X11413435">Schattschneider, 1960</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-1532673X11413435">Wiggins, Hamm, &amp; Bell, 1992</xref>). When a policy proposal is surrounded by conflict, Members of Congress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1532673X11413435">Baumgartner &amp; Leech, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1532673X11413435">Price, 1978</xref>) and executive branch bureaucrats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-1532673X11413435">Wilson, 1989</xref>) both are reluctant to act on it, especially compared to the majority of cases in which conflict among groups is minimal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1532673X11413435">Baumgartner &amp; Leech, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1532673X11413435">Kingdon, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1532673X11413435">Mayhew, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1532673X11413435">Price, 1978</xref>). Conflict makes Members more sensitive to interest group pressure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1532673X11413435">Moe &amp; Wilson, 1994</xref>) and more likely to view lobbyists as harmful as opposed to helpful (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1532673X11413435">Baumgartner &amp; Leech, 1998</xref>). Bureaucrats, meanwhile, value autonomy in their work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1532673X11413435">Downs, 1967</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-1532673X11413435">Wilson, 1989</xref>) and prefer to avoid the scrutiny and criticism that can come from unhappy groups pulling a fire alarm to alert Congress that the agency is displeasing constituents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1532673X11413435">McCubbins &amp; Schwartz, 1984</xref>). Thus both Members and bureaucrats have incentives not to make controversial policy changes in the face of conflict.</p>

<sec id="section3-1532673X11413435">
<title>Majority Preferences</title>
<p>Second, the side that wins may be the side represented by more lobbyists. If an agency receives 30 comments in favor of a new rule and 25 comments against it, then a majority preference explanation of policy outcomes would predict that the agency would act in favor of the proposal. Likewise, if the Congress is lobbied by many advocates for a particular bill and a few lobbyists against it, the Congress would support the bill. This option may be the one most prescribed by proponents of pluralism (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1532673X11413435">Dahl, 1961</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1532673X11413435">Lindblom, 1965</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-1532673X11413435">Truman, 1951</xref>). Under pluralism, after an appropriate and open debate, as well as fair bargains and mutual compromise, the policy proposals that win out are those that are supported by the greatest number of interests (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1532673X11413435">Garson, 1978</xref>). Later, neopluralists studied the effects of the formidable collective action problem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1532673X11413435">Olson, 1965</xref>) and found that pluralism can generally withstand it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1532673X11413435">Lowery &amp; Gray, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1532673X11413435">McFarland, 2004</xref>). A pluralist-majoritarian theory of policy adoption would hold that the side advocated by a greater number of active interests should win out over the less numerous or less active side.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1532673X11413435">
<title>Resources</title>
<p>Third, the side that wins may be the side that has more resources, either because policymakers feel especially beholden to wealthier interests (perhaps in exchange for campaign contributions), or because they are subjected to the more effective lobbying effort such resources might buy. Many critics of pluralism cite this scenario as common, arguing that some interests unfairly have a greater ability to influence government than others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1532673X11413435">Gais, Peterson, &amp; Walker, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1532673X11413435">Lowi, 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1532673X11413435">Olson, 1965</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-1532673X11413435">Wilson, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-1532673X11413435">Walker, 1983</xref>). Schattschneider referred famously to the “upper-class accent” in the pluralist heaven (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-1532673X11413435">1960</xref>, p. 35), and a wealth of scholarship followed addressing the extent of bias in the interest group system (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1532673X11413435">Lowery &amp; Gray, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-1532673X11413435">Schlozman &amp; Tierney, 1986</xref>). Politicians themselves acknowledge that the “well-funded and the well-connected” have unfair advantages in the policymaking process.</p>
<p>Business interests in particular are believed to have better access to congressional and executive branch personnel than other interest group types. Quick access to capital and a built-in membership base are resources that may allow business groups to make more frequent, targeted, and sophisticated contacts with government staff—not to mention greater campaign contributions that may increase lobbyists’ access to policymakers (but see Chin, Bond, &amp; Geva, 2001; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1532673X11413435">Hojnacki &amp; Kimball, 2001</xref>). Public interest groups, by contrast, must work constantly to fundraise and attract and keep members (Lowry, 1997; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-1532673X11413435">Walker, 1991</xref>), and their limited resources may allow for only occasional contacts with policymakers and few campaign contributions. According to this line of thinking, business interests and those who have resource advantages are more likely to achieve their desired outcomes than public interests or those who lack resource advantages.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1532673X11413435">
<title>Institutional Influences</title>
<p>Fourth, institutional variables may matter more than the situational variables described above. I examine the effects of three institutional variables that have been considered important predictors of policy outcomes. The first of these is whether the proposal has the voiced support of the president. The literature on the extent to which presidents can influence legislative outcomes is mixed. Some find that vocal presidential support for a measure tends to increase public support for it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1532673X11413435">Brace &amp; Hinckley, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1532673X11413435">Ostrom &amp; Simon, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1532673X11413435">Rivers &amp; Rose, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1532673X11413435">Rohde &amp; Simon, 1985</xref>), or that administration opposition to a measure reduces its chances of success (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1532673X11413435">Baumgartner, Berry, Hojnacki, Kimball, &amp; Leech, 2009</xref>). Others find presidential support does little to help a proposal’s chances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1532673X11413435">Collier &amp; Sullivan, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1532673X11413435">Neustadt, 1990</xref>). And some scholars find that presidential support is conditioned on such factors as presidential approval (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1532673X11413435">Bond &amp; Fleischer, 1990</xref>), the partisanship and ideology of senators and their states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1532673X11413435">Cohen, Bond, Fleisher, &amp; Hamman, 2000</xref>), or the salience and complexity of the bill (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1532673X11413435">Canes-Wrone &amp; de Marchi, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>Another factor relating to the institutional environment is the degree of partisan polarization in the Congress. It is natural to assume that greater ideological division between the parties in Congress would increase the probability of gridlock, meaning fewer policies would be adopted, and this notion is supported in several studies at the state level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1532673X11413435">Bowling &amp; Ferguson, 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1532673X11413435">Rogers, 2005</xref>). Not all research finds such an effect, however, including one important congressional study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1532673X11413435">Mayhew, 1991</xref>, but see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1532673X11413435">Kelly, 1993</xref>). Thus an interesting question is how partisan divides in Congress affect a proposal’s chances of being enacted.</p>
<p>A third institutional factor is whether the proposal was initiated by Congress or by a federal agency. Bureaucratic agents and elected Members of Congress face contrasting incentives, and act accordingly. Members’ fear of being fired by their constituents is intense and constant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1532673X11413435">Fenno, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1532673X11413435">Mayhew, 1974</xref>), while agency bureaucrats’ jobs are relatively safe. Bureaucrats’ concerns center on maintaining autonomy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-1532673X11413435">Wilson, 1989</xref>; also see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1532673X11413435">Downs, 1967</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1532673X11413435">Niskanen, 1971</xref>) and minimizing scrutiny (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1532673X11413435">McCubbins, Noll, &amp; Weingast, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1532673X11413435">McCubbins &amp; Schwartz, 1984</xref>). Agencies are less constrained by political factors than Members of Congress, and this fact causes concern about the extent to which bureaucrats are subject to being captured by organized interests, or instead are well controlled by their political principals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1532673X11413435">Carpenter, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1532673X11413435">Eisner &amp; Meier, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1532673X11413435">Rourke, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-1532673X11413435">Scholz &amp; Wood, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-1532673X11413435">Wood &amp; Waterman, 1991</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-1532673X11413435">1994</xref>). If agencies are less sensitive than Congress is to political pressure, then policy proposals initiated by federal agencies may be more likely to be adopted than proposals initiated by Congress.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1532673X11413435">
<title>Negative Lobbying</title>
<p>In addition to these four options, I propose another: that policy outcomes can be predicted by examining the lobbying for and against a proposal. I expect that negative lobbying (lobbying against a proposal) is weighed more heavily by policymakers than positive lobbying (lobbying in support of the proposal). The greater the opposition to a bill or proposed rule, the less likely the policymaker is to pass or adopt the proposal, while the quantity of lobbying in support of a proposal has considerably less impact on the policymaker’s decision. Twenty-five lobbyists working against a proposed rule or statute may be enough to scare a bureaucrat into reducing the psychological weight of the 30 comments for it. Policymakers know that interest groups and citizens tend to mentally lump together all the positive things government does, while doing even one thing constituents do not like can bring an agency or Member of Congress enormous attention and therefore have serious consequences in the next election or budget cycle. In effect, I argue, policymakers have an asymmetric preference to avoid adopting a new law to which there is pronounced resistance, even when there is also clear support.</p>
<p>Why would policymakers treat lobbying against a measure differently from lobbying in support? Lobbying pressure in opposition to a proposal alerts policymakers to the potential of considerable public disapproval of the government action, bringing electoral risks, infringed autonomy, public embarrassment, and similar consequences.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1532673X11413435">3</xref></sup> Positive lobbying merely indicates that some interests would benefit from a measure—which is always the case. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1532673X11413435">Baumgartner et al. (2009)</xref> find systematic differences in the types of arguments used by defenders and challengers of existing policies. Status quo defenders are more likely than status quo challengers to use negative arguments focused on sowing doubt about new proposals: “it might cost more than proponents say; it might not work as intended; any tinkering with the existing policy might have serious unintended consequences” (p. 248). The nature of these common arguments supports the theory that negative lobbying sends an important signal to lawmakers: Adopting this measure will stir up fierce opposition among interest groups, and with them, the attentive public. And, the support of members of the public who are in favor of the proposal will not offset intense opposition.</p>
<p>The notion that negative lobbying outweighs positive lobbying is consistent with, but not the same as, simple bias in favor of the status quo. Status quo bias occurs when subjects overvalue the status quo relative to some new possibility, even when the expected value of the new option is the same as or even greater than the status quo value (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1532673X11413435">Kahneman &amp; Tversky, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1532673X11413435">Ritov &amp; Baron, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1532673X11413435">Samelson &amp; Zeckhauser, 1988</xref>). In the realm of policymaking, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1532673X11413435">Baumgartner et al. (2009)</xref> demonstrate convincingly that the policy landscape is biased in many ways toward supporting the status quo policy, because of the scarcity of lawmakers’ attention to new proposals, the difficulty of attracting sufficient bipartisan support to overturn current law, pride on the part of the government gatekeepers who helped write the current law, and the “information-induced equilibrium” that is stabilized by the expert policy community surrounding the issue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1532673X11413435">Baumgartner et al., 2009</xref>, pp. 248-250). I am offering a novel explanation of why the status quo tends to be preserved: that lobbying matters to the outcome of proposed policies, and further, policymakers have an asymmetric preference to avoid upsetting constituents and overseers that is greater than the benefit of pleasing them.</p>
<p>Is it reasonable to treat lobbying activity as representative of public opinion? While answering this question is beyond the scope of this article,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1532673X11413435">4</xref></sup> it is fair to say that policymakers tend to act as if interest groups accurately represent public opinion. Herbst found that, “On most issues mass opinion is unformed or very difficult to discern, so lobbyists help staffers and members with this task” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1532673X11413435">1998</xref>, p. 54). Fenno noted that when Members of Congress seek to learn their constituents’ preferences, “People are hard to find” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1532673X11413435">1978</xref>, p. 234). In interviews, legislative staffers told Herbst that interest groups communicate public will efficiently, specifically, honestly, and provide the added benefit of the “capacity to communicate the intensity of opinion” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1532673X11413435">Herbst, 1998</xref>, p. 53). Said one staffer,</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I very rarely am clueless about where that constituency is because of the interest groups keeping me informed. . . . I would have to say that from a public opinion standpoint, we don’t really care what the average Joe thinks. I don’t say that as if we’re not representing them, but we’re representing the people who represent them. It’s one step removed from the general public. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1532673X11413435">1998</xref>, p. 53)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Agency bureaucrats are also limited in their ability to get citizen feedback. The notice and comment process prescribed by the Administrative Procedure Act requires agencies to publish their proposed rule changes before they are finalized, and solicit comments from the “public.” But it is interest groups, not unmotivated citizens, who read the Federal Register and submit comments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1532673X11413435">Golden, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-1532673X11413435">Yackee &amp; Yackee, 2006</xref>). Thus while there may be noise in the translation of a message from the public at large to the interest groups lobbying about it, policymakers across government often treat interest groups as synthesizing or substituting for public opinion.</p>
<p>While I cannot directly test whether policymakers have a disproportionate fear of negative lobbying relative to positive lobbying, I can test the observable implications of this theory: I hypothesize that while greater support is likely to increase a policy proposal’s chances of being adopted and greater opposition is likely to reduce its chances, the slope will be steeper for negative lobbying.</p>
<p>The asymmetric preference for avoiding blame over seeking praise, highlighted here, is reminiscent of the prospect theory of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1532673X11413435">Kahneman and Tversky (1979)</xref>, who found that subjects routinely exhibited a steeper slope for losses than for gains. Similarly, I argue that policymakers, fond of their jobs (in Congress) or autonomy (in bureaucracies), are more interested in avoiding criticism than in receiving praise. Thus when they observe high numbers of opposition groups, their support for the proposal is likely to dwindle—even given high numbers of supporters.</p>

<title>Data on Lobbying and Policy Outcomes</title>
<p>Much of the data for this project comes from face-to-face interviews with 776 Washington lobbyists on 77 policy proposals conducted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1532673X11413435">Heinz et al. (1993)</xref>. This rich data set contains details about the background, ideology, viewpoint, actions, and assessments of an uncommonly large set of actors. It can be arrayed using the policy proposal as the unit of analysis, across all three branches of government, and as such is the best available data set to answer the question of what factors predict whether a policy proposal will be adopted or not and how successful are its proponents and opponents. No previous published study has attempted to model the outcomes of proposed public policies using such extensive information. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1532673X11413435">Baumgartner et al. (2009)</xref> perform a similar large data collection and analysis, but they do not analyze the full set of variables I use here, nor do they provide point estimates for each variable in a single model. Yet the findings using the Heinz et al. data are consistent with Baumgartner et al.’s findings, indicating that the Heinz et al. data are still representative of the lobbying that occurs in Washington.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1532673X11413435">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>Interview subjects were selected through a series of replicable procedures (such as organization name searches of <italic>The New York Times</italic> and regional newspapers) and interviews with three sets of respondents—client organizations, Washington representatives (i.e., lobbyists, whether in-house or on contract), and government officials. The resulting sample of lobbyists mimics Washington lobbying as a whole, with the most prominent and active lobbyists being the most likely to be sampled, but including a few representatives from smaller, less well-known organizations.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1532673X11413435">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>Policy proposals were selected from a review of <italic>Congressional Quarterly</italic> and the <italic>New York Times</italic> to produce a list of 22 policy proposals in each of four domestic policy areas, all represented by cabinet-level departments (agriculture, energy, health, and labor). The policy issues generated from this sampling procedure represent the more salient issues being dealt with by the federal government. This sample selection also benefits the research design: A sample of high-salience policy proposals is effectively biased against the negative lobbying hypothesis since much of what good lobbyists do is to keep unfavorable proposals off of the agenda entirely (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1532673X11413435">Baumgartner et al., 2009</xref>; Kingdon, 1995). The continued survival of these proposals suggests that their proponents, rather than their opponents, have a strong case to make.</p>
<p>The lobbyist-respondents were asked to select up to five policy proposals they had worked on most closely from a list of proposals in their policy area. On each of these proposals, the lobbyists were asked what actions they took; their position for, against, or other toward the proposal; the level of conflict surrounding the issue; and how many of their objectives they achieved. This design allows me to use the policy proposal as the unit of analysis in order to gauge the net effect of lobbying on policy outcomes. Previous studies of these data all treat the lobbyist as the unit of analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1532673X11413435">Heinz, Laumann, Nelson, &amp; Salisbury, 1990</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1532673X11413435">1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1532673X11413435">Salisbury et al., 1987</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1532673X11413435">1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1532673X11413435">Nelson, Heinz, Laumann, &amp; Salisbury, 1988</xref>). And focusing on the lobbying environment surrounding policy proposals is a complement to existing micro-level studies that examine individual decision making by lobbyists and policymakers (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1532673X11413435">Evans, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1532673X11413435">Hall &amp; Wayman, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1532673X11413435">Hojnacki &amp; Kimball, 1998</xref>).</p>
<sec id="section8-1532673X11413435">
<title>Dependent Variables</title>
<p>Two dependent variables are used in this study. The first is whether the outcome the lobbyist is working for is realized or not. The original Heinz et al. data do not include this measure. I construct this variable using the description of each policy proposal presented to respondents. These statements present a certain version of the proposal, eliminating other forms it may have taken during the legislative or rulemaking process; the statements also make clear what a positive or negative preference would be.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1532673X11413435">7</xref></sup> Using the data collectors’ description of the policy proposal, as presented to respondents, also allows me to bypass the difficult task of defining “policy proposal” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1532673X11413435">Burstein, Bauldry, &amp; Froese, 2005</xref>). I compare the lobbyist’s preference to the legislative or administrative outcome as reported in the legislative database Thomas, the annual Congressional Quarterly Almanac, the Federal Register, and in some cases newspaper articles archived by Lexis-Nexis. Descriptive statistics for this and all variables appear in the <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-1532673X11413435">appendix</xref>.</p>
<p>Second, in addition to this dichotomous outcome variable, I use as a dependent variable a continuous measure collected by Heinz et al. Lobbyists were asked how many of their objectives they achieved on each of the proposals they worked on most closely—<italic>none, few, about half, some</italic>, or <italic>most</italic>. I average this measure of success for all lobbyists in favor of a proposal and for all lobbyists opposed to the proposal.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-1532673X11413435">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>These two variables reflect different facets of success in lobbying. The dichotomous variable serves as an impartial measure of whether the lobbyist achieved his or her desired policy outcome. The continuous variable captures situations in which lobbyists are successful in garnering support or votes and then the proposal fails by a narrow margin or when compromise has altered lobbyists’ assessment of success. The continuous variable also helps capture the many paths a proposal can take as it evolves from a first draft to the draft considered by the lobbyists queried. Lobbyists were reasonably modest in evaluating their own success, reporting that they met all of their objectives on a particular policy less than 25% of the time and saying they achieved none of their objectives nearly 17% of the time.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1532673X11413435">
<title>Conflict Variables</title>
<p>The conflict hypothesis holds that greater conflict will decrease the probability that a proposal is adopted. To test the possibility that government decision makers faced with increasing conflict are more reluctant to adopt a new proposal, I include two distinct measures of conflict.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-1532673X11413435">9</xref></sup> One is the absolute-value difference between the number of lobbyists against the proposal (“antis”) and the number of lobbyists for the proposal (“pros”), taken as a percentage of the total number of lobbyists active on the proposal. I then multiply this variable by −1, since the greater the difference between the two sides is, the less conflictual the lobbying environment is.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-1532673X11413435">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>I also include an independent measure of conflict as described by the lobbyists themselves. Respondents were asked to rate on a 5-point scale the level of conflict surrounding each of the five issues they discussed in detail. These assessments are averaged together for all active lobbyists working on the same issue.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1532673X11413435">
<title>Majority Preference</title>
<p>Second, policymakers may act according to which side of a proposal has more lobbyist-advocates. The majority preference hypothesis is that the side with the greater number of lobbyists is more likely to win. This hypothesis represents the pluralist notion that outcomes reflect the balance of interests involved and the majoritarian idea that in a democracy the side supported by the greatest number of “voters” should win. To test this pluralist-majoritarian idea, I create a variable that reflects whether more pros or more antis lobbied on the measure. If the majority usually wins, then the side with the more lobbyists should significantly predict the policy outcome.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1532673X11413435">
<title>Resources Variables</title>
<p>Third, policymakers may support the side that has greater resource advantages. In particular, business interests are believed by many to have better access to and influence over congressional and executive branch personnel. The resources hypothesis argues that the side of the debate with greater financial resources will tend to win. If resource-rich interests, particularly business interests, have an inherent advantage, then as the proportion of business interests grows, the outcome they advocate should be more likely. To test this possibility, I create variables measuring the proportion of lobbyists on each side of a proposal who represent business (i.e., corporations of all sorts, and trade and professional associations) or public interests (nonprofit, citizen, and minority organizations). This allows me to test whether the effects of being a business interest outweigh the effects of negative lobbying.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-1532673X11413435">
<title>Institutional Variables</title>
<p>To assess the effect of presidential support or opposition to a measure, I use Congressional Quarterly’s annual summary of “Presidential Position Votes,” which is a list of votes on which the president took a clear stand. I supplement this using Congressional Quarterly Almanac summaries and Lexis-Nexis-archived news articles to identify agency-initiated proposals on which the president took a strong position. I code presidential support as +1, presidential opposition as −1, and no clear stand as 0. I hypothesize that presidential support will generally help a proposal become law.</p>
<p>To gauge congressional polarization, I use the difference between NOMINATE first-dimension scores for the Republican and Democratic median members, averaged between chambers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1532673X11413435">Poole &amp; Rosenthal, 2007</xref>). This variable correlates highly with other measures of divisiveness and partisanship, such as the ideology of the median Member (rho = .989; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1532673X11413435">Krehbiel, 1992</xref>) and whether or not there is divided government (rho = .969). I expect that greater congressional polarization will hurt a proposal’s ability to become law. Furthermore, greater polarization should reduce the success of both proponents and opponents of a proposal since, as with conflict, congressional polarization tends to makes policymakers’ and lobbyists’ jobs more difficult.</p>
<p>Whether the proposal is initiated by an agency or not is an indicator variable assigned based on the way the proposal was worded in the sheet shown to respondents. For example, “EPA adopts tougher sulfur emission standards for new coal-fired power plants,” is coded 1 for agency-initiated, while “Congress considers a $500 to $700 million cut in Medicare by repealing periodic interim payments” is coded 0. Because of the differing incentives facing bureaucrats and legislators—autonomy and reelection, respectively—Members of Congress may be more reluctant than bureaucrats to adopt new policies that are actively opposed by many groups. For this reason, I hypothesize that agency-initiated proposals are more likely to become law than strictly congressional proposals.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-1532673X11413435">
<title>Negative Lobbying Variables</title>
<p>The <italic>negative lobbying hypothesis</italic> holds that lobbying against a proposal is more successful than lobbying for a proposal. With data on lobbyists’ stated positions on up to five proposals they worked on closely, two variables were created to test the negative lobbying hypothesis: one set of models uses the number of lobbyists who were pro or anti as a percentage of the total number of active lobbyists working on the proposal; a second set of models uses the raw numbers of lobbyists on each side instead of the percentages. Using the quantity of lobbyists working on an issue as a way to measure pressure is consistent with previous research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1532673X11413435">Apollonio, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1532673X11413435">Austen-Smith &amp; Wright, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1532673X11413435">Baumgartner &amp; Leech, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1532673X11413435">Heberlig, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-1532673X11413435">Wiggins et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-1532673X11413435">Wright, 1990</xref>).</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-1532673X11413435">
<title>Analysis</title>
<p>The nature of the lobbying environment surrounding a policy proposal is a powerful predictor of the outcome: negative lobbying is strongly significant and outweighs nearly all other variables. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1532673X11413435">Table 1</xref> shows three models that predict whether the proposal is adopted or not using logistic regression. The antis are strong and significant. As seen in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1532673X11413435">Table 2</xref>, as the percent of antis is changed from its minimum to its maximum value, holding all other variables at their means, the predicted probability that the proposal is adopted decreases by almost 64%, and increasing the percent of antis by one standard deviation decreases the predicted probability of adoption by nearly 17%. By contrast, the effect of pros is small and nonsignificant, affecting the predicted probability of adoption by less than 3%. Model 3 includes the raw number of lobbyists on each side.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-1532673X11413435">11</xref></sup> Predicted probabilities show that one additional pro lobbyist increases the probability of adoption by .4%, while one additional anti lobbyist reduces the probability of adoption by 1.4%—an effect that is 3.5 times larger.</p>

<title>Conflict</title>
<p>If higher conflict makes policymakers reluctant to act, then the two variables tapping conflict should predict a lower probability that the proposal is adopted. Indeed, the models in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1532673X11413435">Tables 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1532673X11413435">3</xref>, and the predicted probabilities in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1532673X11413435">Table 2</xref>, show that higher conflict is associated with lower success for the proposal. But these effects are not statistically significant. Furthermore, predicted probabilities reveal that the effect of conflict on the probability of policy adoption is smaller than the effect of negative lobbying. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1532673X11413435">Table 2</xref> shows that in Model 1, as the difference between antis and pros (a measure of conflict) grows from its minimum to its maximum value, proposals are 34% less likely to be adopted, while as the number of antis grows from its minimum to its maximum value, proposals are 64% less likely to be adopted. Similar findings can be seen comparing the effects on the outcome of a one-standard-deviation change in antis (−17%) to a one-standard-deviation change in either the difference between antis and pros (–9%) or the average conflict reported by active lobbyists (–8%).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-1532673X11413435">14</xref></sup> Meanwhile, the two measures of conflict have much greater effects than positive lobbying by pros. Thus the effect of conflict on policy outcomes is less than the effect of negative lobbying but greater than the effect of positive lobbying.</p>

<title>Majority Preference</title>
<p>The pluralist-majoritarian ideal suggests that after a fair debate the point of view supported by the greater number of interests prevails. Indeed, in the data, increasing quantities of pro lobbyists help a proposal, and increasing quantities of anti lobbyists hurt it. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1532673X11413435">Figure 1</xref> shows the relationship between the predicted probabilities that the proposal is adopted, given varying levels of pro- and anti lobbying, controlling for the other independent variables. While both lines are in the expected directions, the slopes are not the same: For negative lobbying the slope is much steeper (−3.546) than for positive lobbying (.148).</p>

<p>Furthermore, comparing the side that has more lobbyists to the policy outcome reveals that the more numerous side frequently does not win. Remarkably, among the 72 cases in which the number of lobbyists on each side differs, only 38 times (or 53%) does the side with more lobbyists prevail. Thus the chance that the side advocated by more lobbyists wins is only slightly better than a coin flip. And, the variable that indicates which side has more lobbyists is not statistically significant in a model that includes all of the variables (except pros and antis, which are correlated with the more numerous side) nor in a bivariate model predicting the policy outcome (not shown).</p>

<title>Resources</title>
<p>The notion that lobbyists with greater resource advantages—measured here as those representing business interests rather than public interests—have disproportionate policy advantages is not supported in the analysis. The data actually provide evidence that the opposite may be true: public interests seem to have an advantage over business interests, especially when the public interest group is lobbying against a proposal. Importantly, this finding supports the theory that negative lobbying conveys to policymakers a warning that the public will react negatively to a proposed public policy.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-1532673X11413435">15</xref></sup></p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1532673X11413435">Table 4</xref> compares the effects of business interests lobbying on one side of an issue and public interests arrayed on the other side. The model on the left shows that public interest antis interests have a strong and significant effect on the probability of adoption, while business pros have a much weaker effect that is actually negative instead of positive. Predicted probabilities (not shown) reveal that increasing the public interest antis by one standard deviation reduces the predicted probability of adoption by nearly 20%, while increasing the number of business pros by one standard deviation actually reduces the probability of adoption by 9%. This interesting finding supports the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-1532673X11413435">Smith (2000)</xref> thesis that when businesses coalesce around an issue, the public is likely to respond by uniting in opposition, and further, that policymakers react by following the public will (also see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1532673X11413435">Kollman, 1998</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1532673X11413435">Page, Shapiro, &amp; Dempsey, 1987</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-1532673X11413435">16</xref></sup></p>

<p>In <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1532673X11413435">Table 4</xref> the antis prevail in the model on the right as well, but here, pro public interest lobbying is associated with reduced success for the proposal. The effects in this model, though not statistically significant, suggest that being opposed to a proposal has a greater effect on its outcome than simply whether the lobbyist represents business or public interests.</p>
<p>In robustness checks not shown, I change the unit of analysis to the individual lobbyist working on a particular proposal, and include a variety of variables about the lobbyist that indicate resource advantages beyond simple group type. I put the 3,206 lobbyist-proposal dyads into an ordinary least squares model that includes the lobbyist’s position on the proposal as well as numerous resource variables to predict whether the lobbyist (a) achieved his desired outcome or not and (b) how many of the lobbyist’s objectives she said she achieved. Only the lobbyist’s position against a policy proposal is significant: none of the resource variables tested—the lobbyist’s party, previous federal executive or legislative experience, education level, income, D.C. residence, tenure at the organization, and department size—were significant predictors of the lobbyist’s success.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-1532673X11413435">17</xref></sup> These rather counterintuitive findings are consistent with a growing body of research in which greater lobbying resources do not necessarily predict greater success (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1532673X11413435">Baumgartner et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1532673X11413435">Kasniunas, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1532673X11413435">Nixon, Howard, &amp; DeWitt, 2002</xref>).</p>

<title>Institutional Influences</title>
<p>Presidential support or opposition to a measure has a strong effect on the outcome of a proposal. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1532673X11413435">Table 2</xref> indicates that as the presidential support variable increases by one standard deviation, the proposal is considerably more likely to be adopted—approximately 19% to 22% more likely. In <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1532673X11413435">Table 3</xref> as well, pro lobbyist success is significantly increased and anti lobbyist success is significantly decreased depending on presidential support. If presidential support is more simply coded 0 or 1, then having the president support the proposal makes it 33% to 38% more likely to be adopted. This is strong evidence that the president’s support is exceedingly important in determining the fate of proposed legislation or regulation.</p>
<p>I also test <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1532673X11413435">Bond and Fleischer’s (1990)</xref> assertion that presidential support is conditional on presidential approval. I create an interaction term that represents the aforementioned Presidential Position Votes (supplemented by news articles for agency proposals) multiplied by the Gallup average presidential approval rating for the month in which the proposal was made (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1532673X11413435">Roper Center, 2008</xref>). Neither the interaction term nor the two constitutive terms are significant, while antis is significant. The fully standardized coefficient for the interaction term is larger than for antis, however. These findings are consistent with the models presented in the tables, which show that presidential support matters more than all other variables, whether the president is very popular or not—but negative lobbying is still quite important.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-1532673X11413435">18</xref></sup></p>
<p>Greater congressional polarization appears to hurt proposals’ chances and reduce the success of both pro- and anti lobbyists. As congressional polarization is increased by one standard deviation, proposals are 2% to 3% less likely to be enacted, as seen in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1532673X11413435">Table 2</xref>, and the effect of congressional polarization on policy adoption and success is negative in all models presented. Congressional polarization has a far smaller effect in predicting policy outcomes than the effect of opponents to a measure, however. And substituting an indicator for divided government in place of congressional polarization also does not yield significance for this variable.</p>
<p>Proposals initiated within a federal agency are significantly more likely to become law than congressional proposals are, and this is a finding not yet established in the literature. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1532673X11413435">Table 2</xref> shows that, controlling for the other variables in the models, agency-initiated proposals are about 15% to 23% more likely to be enacted than congressionally initiated proposals—an effect that is less than the effect of negative lobbying (17% to 64%). This difference between agency-initiated and congressional proposals suggests that bureaucrats are not as sensitive to negative lobbying as Members of Congress are, which is consistent with my theory that Members of Congress see negative lobbying as a warning sign that the public opposes the proposal. Previous studies have not analyzed the relative success of proposals in the two branches using a single data set, as political scientists most frequently study just one branch at a time. Furthermore, this finding is important evidence in the growing empirical literature on strategic lobbying choices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1532673X11413435">Holyoke, 2003</xref>; McKay, 2011; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-1532673X11413435">Victor, 2007</xref>), which shows that the choice of targets and tactics can help lobbyists achieve their policy goals.</p>
<p>A final institutional factor is not controlled for in the models—the bias against policy change which the Framers built in to lawmaking. The data indicate that more is going on than systematic bias against new laws. The policy proposals in this data set are all publicly salient, suggesting that their proponents have already passed numerous veto points (e.g., getting on the agenda, getting the bill introduced or the rule change proposed, attracting public attention). And the majority (53%) of the set of proposals in the data set are ultimately adopted into law, so the data are not well explained by a conclusion that the system is biased against new proposals.</p>

<title>Overall Fit</title>
<p>Heinz and his colleagues wrote that their most interesting finding was how little variation their many variables could explain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1532673X11413435">1993</xref>, p. 351). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1532673X11413435">Burstein and Linton (2002)</xref>, in a meta-analysis of 107 political science and sociology studies on the efficacy of interest groups and parties, find group influence to be substantial and significant in only 31% of cases. Baumgartner et al.’s extensive study of lobbyists and policymaking concludes that “it is difficult to find reliable predictors of policy change” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1532673X11413435">2009</xref>, p. 237). It is not surprising, then, that the maximum variance explained by the models in this study is only 23%. Nevertheless, negative lobbying and presidential support explain a good portion of the variance in the difficult-to-predict outcomes of proposed policies. The effects of negative lobbying are statistically more powerful than all alternative predictors of policy outcomes, with the natural exception of presidential support or opposition. Even models that consider an array of resources available to the lobbyist confirm the strong influence of a lobbyist’s position on his success (also noted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1532673X11413435">Heinz et al., 1993</xref> in chapter 11).</p>

<title>Discussion and Conclusions</title>
<p>The negative lobbying hypothesis holds that some lobbying groups are advantaged by their position as opponents of a proposal—and not merely by having more lobbyists than the other side, by having greater resources, or by institutional factors. The analysis shows that lobbying activity itself matters to the outcomes of proposed laws and, further, that each lobbyist against a measure is worth 3.5 lobbyists pushing for it. The act of lobbying has an effect on policymakers that is more pronounced and direct than a tendency to simply support the existing policy. This finding holds importance for policymakers and for lobbyists trying to advance or stop a policy proposal as well as for scholars who hope to better understand the conditions that help a proposal become law. Moreover, it shows that interests opposed to a new measure, who see the deck as stacked against them, may be able to attain influence equal to or greater than that of proponents of the measure–but with less effort. Negative lobbying may thus advantage disadvantaged interests.</p>
<p>For the decision-making lobbyist, the marginal benefit of lobbying in favor of a proposal appears to be quite small. Why, then, do so many lobby in favor of proposals at all? <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1532673X11413435">Holyoke (2003)</xref> shows that when opposition is present in a potential lobbying venue, lobbyists are more likely to lobby in that venue, but less likely to lobby intensely. Holyoke argues, “As the odds of victory diminish in the face of an opponent’s strength, the appeal of mounting a proforma advocacy effort to placate [group] members and demonstrate continued interest in the issue should increase” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1532673X11413435">2003</xref>, p. 327). Holyoke’s respondents behave as if additional lobbying in the presence of opposition lobbying is largely ineffective at achieving policy success, but necessary to maintain membership support (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1532673X11413435">Ainsworth &amp; Sened, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1532673X11413435">Salisbury, 1969</xref>) and to maintain good relations with policymakers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1532673X11413435">Baumgartner &amp; Leech, 1996</xref>).</p>
<p>While it is not the primary focus of the article, the data do not support the popular notion that interest groups are strongly advantaged or disadvantaged by the level of their financial and related resources. Public interests lobbying in opposition to a proposal have a far greater effect on the likely outcome than business interests lobbying for it have. But the effects of negative lobbying still seem to outweigh the resource advantages that business interests might have. Further research analyzing individual resources and using additional data should shed more light on the difficult question of how much interest group resources affect groups’ policy success.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-1532673X11413435">19</xref></sup></p>
<p>The lack of support in this study for the notion that an interest group’s resources make it easier for the group to achieve its desired policies is further support of the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-1532673X11413435">Schattschneider (1960)</xref> argument that “common interests” who are not getting their voices heard in a policy process dominated by “private interests” may be able to overcome the disparity by “expanding the scope of conflict.” The present study shows that by drawing new participants into the conflict—by enlarging the population of interests opposed to a policy change—common interests can counteract the presumed advantage of private interests, and the asymmetric weight of negative lobbying makes that feat considerably easier.</p>

<p>Interestingly, the average success is significantly higher for pros than for antis. This is consistent with my argument that pro lobbyists believe their job is more difficult than antis do, and so success is a bigger achievement for pros than for antis.</p>

<p>This “alert” may remind some of signaling theory, in which contact by a lobbyist is a signal to the policymaker that the lobbyist has private information about the state of the world (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1532673X11413435">Lohmann, 1993</xref>). I argue that the signal sent by lobbying is the public’s likely reaction to a measure, rather than the substantive policy effects.</p>

<p>The premise that lobbying is representative of public opinion has some support in the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1532673X11413435">Kingdon, 1989</xref>) but also differs from the common argument that lobbyists have the most power when the public is not paying attention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1532673X11413435">Denzau &amp; Munger, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1532673X11413435">Jones &amp; Kaiser, 1987</xref>).</p>

<p>The changes that some scholars have noted in the lobbying population between the 1980s and today are in the direction of greater proliferation, diversity, and influence of lobbyists (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1532673X11413435">Berry &amp; Wilcox, 2009</xref>, for a review). Thus relative to newer data, the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1532673X11413435">Heinz et al. (1993)</xref> dataset is likely to contain more limited evidence of my hypothesis that the lobbying environment matters to the outcome of policy proposals.</p>

<p>For example, “FDA, FTC, and USDA announce a joint initiative in food labeling, including declaration of ingredients, and extended open date and nutritional labeling in standard food items.” A nearly complete list of the proposals can be found in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1532673X11413435">Heinz et al. 1993</xref> (several proposals were part of the data collection but dropped for the book).</p>

<p>A lobbyist who is not strictly for or against the proposal is coded as neutral, and is not included in the average success of lobbyists for or against the measure. Pro success is correlated with the outcome at .56; anti success is correlated with the outcome at –.43.</p>

<p>The two measures of conflict correlate at only –.245, which allows both to be used in the same model.</p>

<p>For example, if 30 lobbyists face no opposition, the environment is less conflictual (30 − 0 = 30) than when 15 groups directly oppose 15 other groups (15 − 15 = 0). Hence, the more evenly divided the lobbying environment, the higher (less negative) this conflict variable would be (−30 and 0).</p>

<p>Consistent with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-1532673X11413435">Smith’s (2000)</xref> claim that the degree of cohesion among business affects the policy outcome, I also ran a model using the percentage of all business interests (rather than all lobbyists) who were pro or anti, with no significant change in the results.</p>

<p>None of these resource measures correlate at higher than .33, and a variance inflation test produces a mean variance inflation factor (VIF) of only 1.30, which allows all to be used in the same model (VIFs of over 10 may indicate multicollinearity).</p>

<p>I also considered the possibility that the effect of presidential support depends on whether there is divided or unified government. I interacted presidential support with unified government and included the interaction term and both constitutive terms in the three models in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1532673X11413435">Table 1</xref> (and excluding congressional polarization). Neither the interaction term nor unified government were significant, while presidential support had a large (36%-39%) and significant effect on the predicted outcome.</p>

<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1532673X11413435">Baumgartner et al. (2009)</xref> show that resources most often do not affect policy outcomes, since the resources possessed by groups on each side of a debate tend to cancel each other out. In the 15% of their cases in which resources are not evenly matched across opposite sides of the same issue, however, it is the better-resourced side that wins.</p>
