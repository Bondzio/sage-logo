            <p>Roman Catholic beliefs that form the basis for Roy’s life values are discussed to help others understand veritivity and the Roy adaptation model more clearly. Veritivity, the main philosophical assumption of the Roy adaptation model, shapes it, and Roy’s assumption of humanism in a unique way. Veritivity has a theocentric focus, with anthropological values. Roy views human beings as individuals in community with a loving Creator and with others. Truth, freedom, and moral ends are discussed in terms of veritivity and in terms of contemporary values.</p>

   <body>
      <p>Early in her life and career, Roy developed the Roy adaptation model (RAM) of nursing, which combined nursing concepts and open systems theory with Helson’s adaptation level theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0894318412447559">Roy, 1970</xref>). The first version of the RAM was written during the 1960s when Roy was a Master’s student in Dorothy Johnson’s course at University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA). It was published in 1970, a watershed year for the publication of major nursing theories. The impetus to develop and use conceptual models of nursing had gained momentum during the 1960s when the National League of Nursing required schools of nursing to base curricula on nursing theory. Thus, like other models of that era, the RAM was used at first to develop educational curricula. As the disciplinary momentum in explicating nursing’s knowledge base and language increased in the 1970s, Roy participated with other nurse theorists in conferences about nursing theory and nursing diagnosis. By the late 1970s Roy began to realize that many nurses were misinterpreting her point of view. She became engaged in explaining her perspective more clearly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0894318412447559">Roy, 1988</xref>). According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0894318412447559">Roy (1988)</xref>, she “became aware that many of the value orientations that were assumed in her work were not obvious to readers” (p. 30). Roy named and described her philosophical perspective, veritivity, so that others would be able to understand and authentically use her theory.</p>
      <p>Roy’s philosophical assumptions of veritivity and humanism correspond well with the long-standing philosophical/theological perspective held within the Roman Catholic Church. In this paper, the author addresses how the Roman Catholic Church’s perspective of dynamic human unity corresponds with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0894318412447559">Roy’s (1988)</xref> “specific life values” (p. 25) and with her writings about nursing. By comparing Roy’s ideas with those of other 20th century Roman Catholic scholars, Roy’s thinking can be clarified. Although those other scholars each had a different disciplinary interest from Roy, their writings illuminate points that Roy did not address as fully in her theoretical writings for nurses. Therefore, the approach to human beings and all creation that Roy asserted, an approach that is respectful, reverent, inclusive, and universal, without being relativistic, mechanistic, or deterministic, can be made more clear. In particular, the concepts of truth, freedom, and moral ends are examined here in light of Roy’s writings to show that veritivity is an assumption that is theocentric, and yet has anthropological values.</p>
      <sec id="section1-0894318412447559">
         <title>Background</title>
         <p>Roy first spoke publicly about veritivity in a lecture she gave in 1984 at the School of Nursing at the University of San Francisco, a Jesuit college. Four years later, the inaugural issue of <italic>Nursing Science Quarterly</italic> contained <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0894318412447559">Roy’s (1988)</xref> first explication of her two main philosophical assumptions, veritivity and humanism. In 1996, Roy spoke at a Nursing Knowledge Impact Conference and presented her epistemology of nursing knowledge in a speech entitled “Knowledge as Universal Cosmic Imperative.” In that speech, Roy compared veritivity with relativism and rationalism, and defined veritivity as “a term coined to connote the richness of rootedness in an absolute truth that leads to values of conviction, commitment and caring” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0894318412447559">Roy &amp; Jones, 2007</xref>, p. 149). Although it would seem that Roy’s definition should be clear, veritivity has not been easily or well understood by others. It seems that the life values that have informed her philosophical perspective and her conceptual model are still unclear to others.</p>
         <p>Roy has continued to write and speak about veritivity and humanism to help others understand a perspective that she said is tied to her “specific life values” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0894318412447559">Roy, 1988</xref>, p. 25). She wrote, “having deep roots in religious faith and recognizing the potential consequences of extreme forms of secular humanism, [Roy] has found it necessary to seek another way to express beliefs about human existence” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0894318412447559">Roy, 1988</xref>, p. 29).</p>
         <p>One 20th century Catholic scholar whose own work elucidates Roy’s perspective was the late Pope John Paul II. At the beginning of his encyclical, <italic>Evangelium Vitae</italic> [The Gospel of Life], <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0894318412447559">John Paul II (1995)</xref> wrote:</p>
         <p>Man [<italic>sic</italic>] is called to a fullness of life which far exceeds the dimension of his earthly existence, because it consists in sharing the very life of God. The loftiness of this supernatural vocation reveals <italic>the greatness</italic> and the <italic>inestimable value</italic> of human life even in its temporal phase. (p. 12)</p>
         <p>The quote from John Paul II’s encyclical reveals his passion for respecting the fullness of human life, while it points to the life values to which Roy alluded. Anyone familiar with John Paul II’s writings would realize that his concern as a pastor of souls was not limited to the transcendent aspect of one’s afterlife. Rather, he was deeply invested in promoting respect for the value of human life on earth. During his pontificate, John Paul II wrote and spoke often to help people understand the sacred value of human life created by God.</p>
         <p>Roy’s philosophical assumptions for the 21<sup>st</sup> century include: “Persons have mutual relationships with the world and a God-figure” and “God is intimately revealed in the diversity of creation and is the common destiny of creation” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0894318412447559">Roy, 1997</xref>, p. 45). It would be difficult for scholars who do not understand Roy’s life values to explain how the RAM can match this transcendent, dynamic view of human unity where God and human beings are in mutual interaction. Perhaps it is this view of dynamic human unity that is not well understood that led some scholars to misinterpret aspects, words, and phrases within Roy’s theoretical writings.</p>
         <p>Nursing theories have long been categorized as being either linear or non-linear. In its least helpful guise, linear thinking can be construed as concrete, methodically plodding, and deterministic, which tends to limit human creativity, insight, and free will. In its most helpful form, linear thinking is teleological and relational, which evokes images of evolution, maturation, and fulfillment of one’s potential that defies deterministic or mechanistic interpretations of linearity. The evidence contained in Roy’s writings demonstrates that the RAM is teleological, not deterministic. For example, the main concept of the model is adaptation, which means that the person has a potential to be fulfilled, but a potential is not a guaranteed outcome. Roy’s writings have always included concepts such as human unity, creativity, free will, and a sense of meaning and purpose. These concepts would not fit if the model was deterministic. Teleological linearity is a more dynamic concept compatible with Roman Catholic beliefs such as human dignity, human freedom, and free will. In order to help readers see the true difference that Roy’s specific life values make in terms of reading and using the RAM, a brief discussion of Roman Catholic beliefs is provided.</p>

         <title>Roman Catholic Beliefs and Values</title>
         <p>There are certain elements of Roman Catholic faith that are related to how human beings are viewed and how Roy’s understanding of these ideas would have affected her perspective when she first wrote the RAM. These beliefs and values have been well described in the <italic>Catechism of the Catholic Church</italic>, which was revised and released in 1994 during the pontificate of John Paul II. Those revisions were based on the discussions of Vatican Council II held from 1962-1968. Certain Roman Catholic beliefs that affect Roy’s explication of veritivity are contained in the Catechism’s explication of the Creed. For example, Roman Catholics are monotheistic, yet they believe that there are three persons in one God, the Trinity. It will be shown that this concept supports Roy’s statement about “unity in oneness.” Roman Catholics believe that Jesus Christ is the second person of the Trinity, that He is human and divine, and that His Real Presence remains on earth in the form of the Holy Eucharist. This concept and others in the Creed support the idea that Jesus is the Alpha and the Omega, the beginning (God, our Creator) and the end (God, our Redeemer and ultimate purpose). These ideas relate to Roy’s use of concepts such as purposefulness and the point Omega. The complete forgiveness of sins due to true repentance, and the resurrection of the body are additional beliefs that might not be shared by non-Catholics, but that are deeply rooted in a Roman Catholic understanding of human beings. Catholics believe that God created human beings in His image and likeness, and endowed them with free will. Understanding these Roman Catholic beliefs is crucial to understanding dynamic human unity and Roy’s philosophical assumption of veritivity.</p>
         <sec id="section3-0894318412447559">
            <title>Theocentric or Anthropocentric Assumptions</title>
            <p>According to Roy, she wanted to clarify her own philosophical viewpoint, which did not match the trend toward relativistic thinking developing in the discipline of nursing in the early 1980s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0894318412447559">Roy, 2000</xref>). She derived the word veritivity from the Latin word <italic>veritas</italic>, which means truth, so that the philosophical assumption could be differentiated from relativism. Her explanation of an error of relativistic thinking showed that Roy believed relativism could undermine nursing’s humanistic view of the human person. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0894318412447559">Roy (2000)</xref> stated:</p>
            <p>Relativism refers to the belief that there is no way to determine objective truth or objective morality. Subjectivity is emphasized and the truth becomes what is meaningful or significant, while good means pleasurable or satisfying. The person’s own thoughts and feelings are the final guide to action. (p. 126)</p>
            <p>Roy’s additional explications of truth revealed why she was concerned about how the assumption of humanism might change over time. Roy viewed objective truth as tied to the Creator, which gave Roy’s philosophical assumptions of veritivity and humanism a theocentric focus. Relativistic and rationalistic assumptions have an anthropocentric basis that matches contemporary thinking, thus a theocentric focus is no longer anticipated or easily appreciated by some contemporary scholars. Yet, two distinct types of humanism now operate in healthcare.</p>
            <p>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0894318412447559">Maritain (1938)</xref> traced the emergence of the difference between theocentric and anthropocentric worldviews back to the philosophical transition that occurred at the beginning of the 14<sup>th</sup> century. The medieval conception of the human person had its roots in the writings of the Evangelists (Matthew, Mark, Luke, John, Paul) and St. Augustine. Their ideas were further explicated by Aquinas. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0894318412447559">Maritain (1938)</xref> explained the medieval viewpoint as:</p>
            <p>A person is a unity of a spiritual nature endowed with freedom of choice and so forming a whole which is independent of the world, for neither nature nor the State may invade this unity without permission. God Himself, who is and who acts from within, acts there in a particular way and with a supremely exquisite delicacy, a delicacy which shows the value He places on it: He respects this freedom, in the heart of which He nevertheless lives; He solicits it, but He never compels. (p. 2)</p>
            <p>This theological perspective of who the human person is includes God’s grace with human freedom. In this theocentric view, human beings have the freedom to choose or reject their own salvation, but they cannot obtain their own salvation without God’s grace.</p>
            <p>Contemporary understanding of the human person had its roots in naturalistic explanations characteristic of the Age of Reason. Before the 14<sup>th</sup> century a human being was “a unity with a spiritual nature,” which referred to the unity of body and soul. In contrast, the naturalistic perspective included the Cartesian duality of body and mind. The anthropocentric view dispensed with grace as a requisite for salvation, and claimed that humankind would triumph over nature through human effort alone. This second view matches the contemporary understanding that emphasizes personal effort as high virtue. Maritain distinguished between Christian humanism and post-Reformation <italic>classical</italic> humanism, which he called a form of naturalism, and which today is called secular or atheistic humanism. “The first kind of humanism recognises [<italic>sic</italic>] that the centre [<italic>sic</italic>] for man [<italic>sic</italic>]is God . . . . The second kind of humanism believes that man is his own centre, [<italic>sic</italic>] and therefore the centre [<italic>sic</italic>] of all things” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0894318412447559">Maritain,1938</xref>, p. 19). This explanation of two types of humanism, clarifies how Roy’s assumptions of veritivity and humanism complement each other as theocentric assumptions.</p>

         <sec id="section4-0894318412447559">
            <title>Veritivity and the Properties of Truth</title>
            <p>Veritivity arises from a worldview that rests on five properties of truth: (a) unity, (b) universality, (c) teleology, (d) relationality, and (e) stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0894318412447559">Hanna &amp; Roy, 2001</xref>). Initially, Roy did not name the properties of truth in this summary manner, but rather, sought to name and explain the defining characteristics of veritivity, which are discussed later in this paper.</p>
            <p>In her first explication of veritivity, Roy emphasized that one’s view of truth is a critical element that shapes one’s worldview. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0894318412447559">Roy (1988)</xref> wrote, “In this world view, persons are discovers of the truth, and truth is viewed as a unity of oneness that is the creator,” (p. 29). The phrase “unity of oneness” can be related to the monotheistic belief in a Trinitarian God, as noted earlier. However, the phrase “unity of oneness” could be misunderstood to allude to the concept of harmony. Although harmony is a necessary sub-concept that belongs to unity, harmony is not the same as unity of oneness, which Roy has said is another name for truth and for God, the creator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0894318412447559">Roy, 2000</xref>).</p>
            <p>Roy pointed out that numerous cultures have postulated a loving creator of the universe. She said, “consider the possibility that there is a universal truth, a cosmic imperative. What possibly could convince us of such a reality?” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0894318412447559">Roy &amp; Jones, 2007</xref>, p. 146). Veritivity, she explained, “connotes the richness of rootedness in absolute truth, which leads to values of conviction, commitment and caring” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0894318412447559">Roy &amp; Jones, 2007</xref>, p. 149). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0894318412447559">John Paul II (1998)</xref> made a similar point about absolute truth in his encyclical letter, <italic>Fides et Ratio</italic>, when he wrote:</p>
            <p>Man [<italic>sic</italic>] is the only creature who not only is capable of knowing but who knows that he knows, and is therefore interested in the real truth of what he perceives. People cannot be genuinely indifferent to the question of whether what they know is true or not. If they discover that it is false, they reject it; but if they can establish its truth, they feel themselves rewarded. (p. 38)</p>
            <p>Furthermore, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0894318412447559">John Paul II (1998)</xref> spoke about absolute truth in a manner that complements Roy’s view of truth: The truth comes initially to the human being as a question: <italic>Does life have a meaning?</italic> . . .Every truth—if it really is truth—presents itself as universal, even if it is not the whole truth. If something is true, then it must be true for all people and at all times. (pp. 39-41)</p>
            <p>Roy like John Paul II points to the creator as being absolute truth. The limits of human understanding do not diminish the fullness, authenticity, or existence of truth for the creator. Veritivity opposes, in a reasoned way, the contemporary, relativistic view that maintains that truth is subjective and, therefore, different from person to person. From the perspective of Roy’s veritivity, truth transcends each human being in a universal manner, and yet, truth remains within reach to be grasped by any sincere person who seeks it.</p>
            <p>In a 1957 speech called “Truth and Human Fellowship” given at Princeton, Maritain addressed the issue of mutual tolerance, which is often cited as the basis for a relativistic view of truth. Maritain explained errors in thinking that can emerge when people hold extreme views of absolute truth and of mutual tolerance. He called <italic>absolutists</italic> those who hold to an extreme view of absolute truth. He called <italic>theorists</italic> those who hold an extreme view of tolerance. He explained that “the error of the absolutists who would like to impose truth by coercion comes from the fact that they shift their right feelings about the object [truth] from the object to the subject” (p. 9). The result of this type of error is that the person who is in error is banished from human fellowship by the absolutists. However, he also explained that “the error of the theorists who make relativism, ignorance, and doubt a necessary condition for mutual tolerance comes from the fact that they shift their right feelings about the human subject—who must be respected even if he is in error—from the subject to the object” (pp. 9-10). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0894318412447559">Maritain (1957)</xref> pointed out that those who hold a relativistic view can fail to engage with charity in true dialogue to seek the truth under the mantle of tolerance. Yet, Maritain asserted that a true middle-ground exists where people can seek truth and respect human dignity. In his way of thinking, no one would be excluded from human fellowship and neither would dialogue be sacrificed. This middle-ground is exactly what Roy has described with her philosophical assumptions. Veritivity places the fullness of truth in a supernatural realm that communicates with natural reality, whereas relativism places truth in a natural, finite realm. This was the concern that prompted Roy to explicate the philosophical assumption of veritivity.</p>
            <p>Roy set about identifying and explicating a stance that would pose underpinnings that would be the converse of relativism, and then clarifying her theoretical work in the light of that stance . . . . The core premise is that there is an absolute truth and a convergence of the universe into a unity of oneness with the truth, also known as a creator, God. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0894318412447559">Roy, 2000</xref>, p. 127)</p>
            <p>Besides truth, Roy has considered human freedom as necessarily related to truth. The concept of freedom is examined next, since together truth and freedom affect how moral ends are understood.</p>
         </sec>
         <sec id="section5-0894318412447559">
            <title>Two Views of Freedom</title>
            <p>Reverend Servais Pinckaers, Order of Preachers (O.P.) (1925-2008) was a Roman Catholic priest of the Dominican religious order who taught moral theology at the Swiss University of Fribourg. He was a talented scholar who analyzed Christian moral theology from Gospel writings and other foundational sources. His writings illuminate the post Vatican Council II Roman Catholic renewed view of moral theological teaching as presented in <italic>Veritatis Splendor</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0894318412447559">John Paul II’s 1993</xref> encyclical letter.</p>
            <p>According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0894318412447559">Pinckaers (1995)</xref>, contemporary society holds a view of freedom that Descartes called freedom of indifference. Pinckaers explained freedom of indifference as a type of freedom that depends on the power to choose between two contrary positions that are considered to be of equal value. This type of freedom is indifferent to the characteristics, qualities, and effects of choices. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0894318412447559">Pinckaers (1995)</xref> lists many examples to demonstrate the either/or tension produced by this dichotomous view of freedom (pp. 350-351). In this view people are free to live or not live, since true freedom is indifferent to either choice; each choice is considered of equal value to the other. Consider Hamlet’s famous “To be or not to be” soliloquy written by Shakespeare approximately 400 years ago. He contemplated the choice between continuing to live or committing suicide, as if the two options are objectively equal parallels. There are some end-of life discussions taking place today, especially those that defend physician-assisted suicide. From a particular world-view, the fact remains that there is a qualitative difference between being alive and being dead so these options are not objectively equal.</p>
            <p>The current rise in casuistry among secular ethicists, which is the consideration of difficult cases of conscience, depends on determining how to avoid harm in particular situations. The freedom of indifference perspective corresponds with a legalistic approach to moral issues (morality of obligation), which operates by avoiding harm. In this view, freedom itself is the endpoint or the goal of the moral act, rather than the quality of the moral act. Pinckaers’ writings on the types of freedom show why casuistry, which has been rising in popularity among secular ethicists since the 1990s, was relinquished by church authorities in 1993. After <italic>Veritatis Splendor</italic>, casuistry became an insufficient way to think through difficult moral issues, because casuistry depends on a morality of obligation or the avoidance of harm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0894318412447559">Cessario, 2001</xref>).</p>
            <p>Roman Catholic Christians are invited to develop and live within a very different view of morality based on a different type of freedom, which <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0894318412447559">Pinckaers (1995)</xref> called freedom for excellence. This view is compatible with Roy’s assumptions of veritivity and humanism and it supports the main concept of the model, adaptation. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0894318412447559">Pinckaers (1995)</xref> defined freedom for excellence as: “The power to act freely with excellence and perfection” (p. 375). Seeking excellence, especially in a business environment, is often related to preventing or reducing error. This approach is rooted in the freedom of indifference/morality of obligation perspective described above. Pinckaers described freedom of excellence in terms of achieving perfection, which means that excellence exceeds and cannot be reduced to merely avoiding mistakes. Rather, freedom for excellence rests on the idea of reaching one’s full potential, such as the well-developed expertise of a true virtuoso. When someone achieves this type of freedom, the chance for error is naturally rare, and the creative and perfect expression of one’s expertise far surpasses a routine action without error. The full development of one’s potential is much more than the absence of error. This concept can be understood best when it is considered in terms of truly great artists, or renowned scientists, people whose own knowledge was not only valid and deep, but whose knowledge surpassed that of others by being innovative, creative, and ultimately, freeing. Freedom for excellence corresponds with virtue morality, which invites human beings to seek and achieve their highest good. In this view, freedom is not the endpoint or goal of the moral act, but is the quality of the moral act that produces some good. Freedom for excellence inspires authentic relationship between the good of the individual and the common good of society. In the RAM the main concept of adaptation refers to effective development of the person, who is interdependent with others. Roy’s use of terms such as “mastery” or “integrated adaptive outcome” points to the virtue-directed vision of her nursing model.</p>
            <p>Pinckaers pointed out that any understanding of freedom or personal autonomy is based on where free will is located in relation to reason and will. For example, according to the perspective consistent with veritivity, people attain greater individual and social freedom from learning, than from not learning. The choices to learn or not learn are not equal in value, since one choice [to learn] improves and frees the person, but the other choice [to not learn] ultimately limits the person’s other choices in life. Pinckaers’ point about freedom for excellence is well made in the children’s story, <italic>Pinocchio</italic>, where the lack of an education led to a life of enslaved drudgery for Pinocchio. Once Pinocchio realized the truth of what he gave up, he repented, retraced his steps and was able to become a <italic>real</italic> boy.</p>
            <p>Since the freedom of indifference perspective predominates today, choices and facts are assumed to be value-neutral. However, where freedom for excellence prevails, choices are viewed as being at least value-distinct; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0894318412447559">Roy’s (1996)</xref> term is “value enriched” (p. 74). This means that options are considered to have different values based on whether they nurture, sustain, attack, or encumber the naturally endowed purpose or inherent reason for being of any person, creature, object, or situation.</p>
            <p>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0894318412447559">Roy and Andrews (1999)</xref> wrote, “The Roy adaptation model’s philosophic assumptions clearly recognize the ideal that each person is to have maximum freedom to realize his or her potential. This ideal stems from the belief that human life has common meaning, purpose, and destiny” (p. 331). Terms such as adaptation, mastery, growth and development, purpose, purposefulness, and destiny show that there is a definite direction toward a potential end that helps the person, even if the end is to help a person to die comfortably with dignity. Roy’s language conveys the teleological perspective found in the RAM.</p>
            <p>Besides the concept of truth, which Roy defined as “unity of oneness” Roy has used the word unity in another way within the RAM. Unity is synonymous with the word integrity. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0894318412447559">Roy and Andrews (1999)</xref> stated, “The striving for unity or integrity may well be an innate human quality that affects adaptation in the self-concept mode as well as in the other adaptive modes” (p. 398). Therefore, human unity is an explicit concept and underlying premise of Roy’s writings.</p>
            <p>Roy’s consistent reference to the importance of unity, which is a foundational property of truth, reveals additional dimensions of her philosophical assumption of veritivity. Human beings are mortal beings situated in space and time, both of which are linear and relational. Human beings are social beings situated in families, also relational. In the RAM the role function and interdependence modes assume the relationality of individuals situated in the society of others. Therefore, Roy’s emphasis on unity and on adaptation revealed the teleological and relational nature of the RAM. Not only does this emphasis on human and social unity reflect that veritivity has the same properties as truth, but it highlights the innate relationality of human beings, and their progress toward a common or shared purpose. This aspect is important to understand veritivity’s four defining characteristics, which are: a) common purposefulness of humankind, b) unity of purpose of human existence, c) activity and creativity for the common good, and d) the value and meaning of life.</p>

            <title>Defining Characteristics of Veritivity</title>
            <p>The most detailed explication of veritivity is found in the speech Roy gave at the 1996 Knowledge Conference held at Boston College in Chestnut Hill, Massachusetts. That lecture, entitled “Knowledge as Universal Cosmic Imperative,” also introduced Roy’s epistemology, her philosophy of knowledge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0894318412447559">Roy &amp; Jones, 2007</xref>). The speech was published in the conference’s proceedings, which were sold at subsequent Knowledge Conferences until the supply was exhausted in October, 2000. The speech is now contained in a text (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0894318412447559">Roy &amp; Jones, 2007</xref>).</p>
            <p>Roy’s explication of veritivity, like the RAM, rests on concepts such as the thinking, feeling human being, imbued with a sense of meaning, purpose, intentionality and free will (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0894318412447559">Roy &amp; Andrews, 1999</xref>). Roy has emphasized the importance of human diversity, but maintains that truth rises above individual attributes to unite all humankind in a universal manner. It is the universality of human experience that is conveyed in the first defining characteristic: <italic>common purposefulness of human existence</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0894318412447559">Roy &amp; Andrews, 1999</xref>).</p>
            <p>Common purposefulness can be thought of as the meaningfulness or the meaning-imbued purpose of humankind’s existence. Purposefulness, as it is used as part of the definition of veritivity refers to the inherent purpose or intrinsic reason why an individual person, who is a living, thinking, creative, self-possessed and self-determining human being is treated and valued differently from an inanimate object or an animal. The mutuality of participation within one’s community is the contribution that each person’s life makes, and it gives meaning and value to humankind’s existence. When people claim that their pet has as much status as a family member, nevertheless, they would not require their pet in its adult years to go to work to support itself or its litter of puppies or kittens. Parents do expect their adult children to become self-supporting. Mutuality related to human beings includes expectations that are different from the expectations of a beloved pet or a cherished object such as a house. Common purposefulness has another dimension related to Roy’s life values. When Roy explained that humankind shares a common destiny, that shared destiny is not merely death, which every person eventually experiences, but the supernatural afterlife beyond one’s natural death. This afterlife can be called heaven, final beatitude, nirvana, paradise, or resting in the arms of Buddha, but ultimately, it is a sustained fullness of everlasting bliss, rest, or happiness.</p>
            <p>Roy mentioned another endpoint in her writings, the Omega point convergence, which was adapted from the writings of the late French Jesuit priest, Pierre Teilhard de Chardin. Originally, Teilhard de Chardin referred to humankind’s final union with Christ who is the Alpha [beginning] and the Omega [end] as the <italic>point Omega</italic>. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0894318412447559">Roy and Jones (2007)</xref> explained, Teilhard de Chardin</p>
            <p>provides both a definition of Omega Point and his basis for postulating it with one simple statement: “At the heart of the universe prolonged along its axis of complexity, there exists a divine center of convergence . . .and in order to stress its synthesizing and personalizing function, let us call it the point Omega.” (p. 157)</p>
            <p>This quote emphasized the linear, teleological, and theocentric nature of Roy’s main philosophical assumption of veritivity, as well as of the RAM. If the universe is moving toward an end, such as point Omega, this progressive convergence implies that there is a shared human destiny and that movement toward that destiny is teleological in the sense of an evolution. The teleological nature of veritivity underscores humankind’s movement in space and time toward an ultimate, infinite good. The point Omega to which Teilhard de Chardin (as cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0894318412447559">Roy &amp; Jones, 2007</xref>) referred holds the supernatural promise of everlasting sustained perfect happiness. For this reason <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0894318412447559">Maritain (1938)</xref> maintained that Christian humanism retains the concept of God’s grace as a necessary aspect of human freedom and human dignity. Moving toward that supernatural promise, the point Omega (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0894318412447559">Roy &amp; Jones, 2007</xref>), is not truly attainable by human effort alone, but requires God’s gift of grace. Such thinking means that an anthropocentric approach to human wholeness could be ultimately unfulfilling, since maximal human effort without the possibility of such a supernatural promise is a hope in a finite, human enterprise.</p>
            <p>
               <italic>Unity of purpose of human existence</italic> is the second defining characteristic of veritivity. In order to better understand what this second defining characteristic conveys, it is necessary to understand the relationship between the words unity, purpose, and human existence. To affirm that there is a purpose for human existence is to have confidence in the meaningfulness, or the meaning-imbued purpose of human life. Given the uniqueness of each human life, the meaning of human life is imbued with mystery. Mystery and uniqueness are related to each other, but are different aspects of what makes each human life sacred and inviolable. In its own way, human mystery increases the value of human existence. In the RAM human mystery is represented in the third level of environmental stimuli called residual stimuli, which Roy said can act to influence a situation even though these stimuli are unknown. Yet, Roy’s view of unity goes far beyond human unity. It includes a cosmological perspective of person-earth unity, whereby all life forms are viewed as sacred.</p>
            <p>The third defining characteristic of veritivity is <italic>creativity and activity for the common good</italic>, which reveals the dynamism of human purpose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0894318412447559">Roy &amp; Andrews, 1999</xref>, p. 34). Dynamic purpose includes diversity within the aspect of human creativity, and contribution within the aspect of activity. To contribute one’s ideas, words, and deeds to the world is to participate with the rest of the human community. Participation within the community of humankind anticipates a common or shared good, something that considers self and others to have value. Participation is evident in the RAM by Roy’s inclusion of the interdependence mode to explain the mutuality of individuals with others. Integrated adaptation, as defined in the RAM, is not something that could ever truly be achieved by one person who forsakes relationships with the community of others. The underlying premise of a dynamic purpose, or of creativity and activity for the common good, is that it is relational in all ways.</p>
            <p>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0894318412447559">John Paul II (1998)</xref> wrote, “A philosophy which no longer asks the question of the meaning of life would be in grave danger of reducing reason to merely accessory functions, with no real passion for the search for truth” (p. 102). Likewise, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0894318412447559">Roy (1988)</xref> explained that the mutuality of goodness is affirmed by human activity and creativity for the common good and by recognizing the <italic>value and meaning of life</italic>, the fourth defining characteristic of veritivity. Life includes human life (person) and all created life forms (earth). In the scientific and philosophic assumptions of the RAM for the 21<sup>st</sup> century, Roy referred to person-earth mutuality in several ways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0894318412447559">Roy, 1997</xref>). The scientific assumptions include, “persons and the earth have common patterns and integral relationships,” and “person and environment transformations are created in human consciousness,” and, “integration of human and environment meanings results in adaptation” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0894318412447559">Roy, 2009</xref>, p. 31). Since person-earth goodness is mutual, it is manifested as a unity of purpose of the whole human community in relationship with the earth. It is mainly this common purposefulness for the good as delineated in Roy’s assumption of veritivity that renders the RAM linear, teleological, and relational. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0894318412447559">John Paul II (1998)</xref> stated,</p>
            <p>One of the most significant aspects of our current situation, it should be noted, is the “crisis of meaning.” Perspectives on life and the world, often of a scientific temper, have so proliferated that we face an increasing fragmentation of knowledge. This makes the search for meaning difficult and often fruitless . . .many people wonder whether it still makes sense to ask about meaning. (pp. 101-102)</p>
            <p>Likewise, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0894318412447559">Roy (1997)</xref> wrote, Roy recently [<italic>sic</italic>] argued for an ontology and metaparadigm of nursing that highlights the person as the primary domain concept of nursing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0894318412447559">Roy, 1996</xref>). In keeping with the demands for the future and the heritage of nursing, Roy emphasizes that a nursing ontology rests upon the need for human meaning and articulation of values about the person. Clinical knowledge development is neither perspective-free nor value-free. Rather it stems from a firm and deliberate stance. (p. 45)</p>
            <p>Roy’s views about the value and meaning of life have remained steady since the inception of the RAM, since these views are tied to Roy’s “specific life values” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0894318412447559">Roy, 1988</xref>, p. 25).</p>

         <title>Veritivity and the RAM</title>
         <p>Roy’s conceptual framework was not developed to provide theological insights for nurses, but to provide a basis for nursing practice. The RAM, like most nursing theories, can be used in practice at a basic level without a full understanding of the philosophical assumptions. However, proficient and expert use of any conceptual model is disadvantaged to the extent that the clinician, educator, or investigator does not understand its philosophical assumptions. If nursing theories and models are to be used authentically, meaning as they were originally conceived, they must be clearly understood. It is true that as time passes, modifications of theories and models might be needed. When modifications are made, they must be called a modification so that others will not become confused about the theories and models.</p>
         <p>The major concept of the RAM is adaptation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0894318412447559">Roy, 1970</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0894318412447559">1997</xref>). Roy has described adaptation to be both a process and a state. In order to fully define the adaptation model, Roy linked several concepts together through theoretical statements to show what the model is and how it works. The main concepts include the person as an adaptive system, the adaptation modes (physiologic/physical; self-concept/group identity; role function; and interdependence), internal and external stimuli (focal, contextual, and residual), coping processes (regulator &amp; cognator/stabilizer &amp; innovator), and adaptation level outcomes (integrated, compensatory and compromised). The question is: how do these main concepts relate to the philosophical assumptions of veritivity and humanism?</p>
         <p>In response to a critique written by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0894318412447559">Artinian (1990)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0894318412447559">Roy (1990)</xref> wrote, “adaptation was from the beginning, and is to this day, a core concept of the theoretical framework . . . . Adaptation is both a process and a state. As a process, it involves a systematic series of actions directed toward some end” (p. 64). This part of Roy’s response to Artinian shows that a teleological perspective is foundational to the process of adaptation, the core concept. The end, as explained above, is an inherent or intrinsic good. This good is related to the existence of a stable, universal truth, which is what veritivity purports. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0894318412447559">Roy (1990)</xref> continued her explanation to Artinian by stating,</p>
         <p>At a broad level of generalization, Roy conceptualizes this process [of adaptation] for nursing as a function of focal stimuli and adaptation level. However, it is far from being a passive process, because the adaptation level includes all the person’s capabilities, hopes, dreams, aspirations, and motivations, in other words, all that makes the person constantly move toward greater mastery. Adaptation will always be positive, active, and creative . . . . Still the theorist considers adaptation as a state, i.e., the condition of the person with respect to the environment. (p. 64)</p>
         <p>This second part of Roy’s response shows that the process of adaptation is relational. There is an internal personal relationality, something within the human person that strives for personal unity of being. There is an external, social relationality, whereby the person is in constant interaction with others and the external environment. Unity and relationality are properties of truth, and therefore, of veritivity. Finally, Roy concluded this statement by explaining that the state of the person, meaning the adaptation level as a state, is simply another way of viewing the information, which is not a contradiction of any information, but acts in a complementary manner to increase understanding of the person. “This state is the cumulative effect of the on-going adaptive process, and describing it in cross-section does not negate the dynamic process” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0894318412447559">Roy, 1990</xref>, p. 64). Roy’s response to Artinian shows how veritivity is a foundational philosophical assumption of the RAM. The five properties of truth (unity, universality, teleology, relationality, stability) and freedom for excellence are all represented within this single explanatory paragraph.</p>
         <p>Understanding the philosophical assumption of veritivity facilitates authentic use of the RAM. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0894318412447559">Dobratz (2004)</xref> used veritivity when she investigated dying and life closing spirituality. Dobratz found that life-closing spirituality shared a core theme of believing, where “believing pointed to responses that supported beliefs or belief systems in God, a higher power, or a dimension beyond self” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0894318412447559">Dobratz, 2004</xref>, p. 336). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0894318412447559">Dobratz (2004)</xref> explained that,</p>
         <p>The philosophic assumptions, as described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0894318412447559">Roy, (1988)</xref>, are based on the subjective dimensions of human behavior within the context of value and meaning. These assumptions, which include principles of value-based meanings, purposefulness-in-life, relationship to others, and holism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0894318412447559">Roy and Andrews, 1999</xref>) share a firm foundation with the other pillar of the model—the scientific assumptions. (p. 335)</p>

         <title>Conclusion</title>
         <p>Roy understood that relativism and rationalism can fall short of the moral/ethical/spiritual complexities that nurses and their patients face each day. This insight prompted Roy to engage in deeper thinking about the value and meaning of human life and the cosmos in relation to nursing. The results of that deeper thinking are that Roy has articulated an alternative philosophical perspective of substance and worth in an era when many are seeking meaning and purpose, unity and truth. This perspective is Roy’s philosophical assumption of veritivity.</p>
