<p>This issue of <italic>Theory and Research in Education</italic> brings together a number of papers initially prepared for the conference organized in 2010 by the United Nations Girls’ Education Initiative (UNGEI). This conference, entitled <italic>Engendering Empowerment: Education and Equality (E4)</italic>, was organized to mark the tenth anniversary of the formation of UNGEI. The conference, which comprised electronic and face-to-face discussions, aimed:</p>
<list id="list1-1477878512459390" list-type="order"><list-item><p>to recommit participants to the acceleration of gender equity-related actions agreed at the 2000 World Education Forum in Dakar;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>to deepen public policy advocacy and debate on girls’ education in order to accelerate action towards the attainment of Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) 2 and 3, and to inform a broad understanding of gender equity, girls’ education and the strategic actions necessary to support this (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1477878512459390">UNGEI, 2010</xref>).</p></list-item></list>
<p>The face-to-face conference met in Dakar from 17 to 20 May, for an intensive series of discussions around three themes – poverty, quality and violence. A large number of papers were presented and discussed in workshops (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1477878512459390">UNGEI/Institute of Education, 2012</xref>). This meeting also adopted the Dakar Declaration on accelerating girls’ education and gender equality, which highlighted the ways in which work in education must address poverty and violence and the development of a complex notion of quality and equity in education so that ‘gender equality might become a reality’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1477878512459390">UNGEI, 2012</xref>: v–vi).</p>
<p>Selected papers presented at the conference have been revised for this special journal issue, while a number of papers commissioned for the conference have been published by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1477878512459390">UNGEI (2012)</xref>. The articles in this special issue are particularly concerned with the problem of making gender equality in education ‘a reality’ in particular contexts. Thus a key theme across all these articles is the significance of context in relation to how meanings of education quality and gender equality are made. The data presented range from an assessment of the implementation of programmes for education quality in Cambodia, Bangladesh and Malawi (Aikman and Rao), an examination of how UNGEI’s programmes have been received in the Gambia (Manion), a consideration of approaches to implementing education policy on poverty in South Africa and Kenya (Unterhalter), to an exploration of young women’s experiences of violence in urban slums in South Africa, Ghana and Kenya (Oduro, Swartz and Arnot). All the writers emphasize the importance of understanding gender in relation to history, location, political economy, and the nuances of social and cultural relations. For all these are key processes in making sense of these particular instances of negotiation over policy implementation. The articles make clear the complexity of institutional forms and processes and the wide range of actors involved (policy makers, interpreters and actors). They highlight how there is considerable, healthy debate over definitions. There are many stances with regard to gender equality and education, which range from advocacy and support to active refusal and negation. A number of the articles explore ways of framing the space of negotiation over policy, looking at this in terms of different levels, ecological dimensions, forms of classification or knowledge making. Some of the articles highlight some of the notable social and economic shifts that have taken place since UNGEI was formed in 2000, particularly the significance of poverty in urban, not just rural settings, the emergence of private schooling, and the importance of understanding religion and culture in relation to social policy. A key aspect of all the articles is their engagement with particular theoretical resources and their analysis of a range of data gathered through empirical research. Thus, a notable advance from some of the primarily demographic studies available in 2000, when UNGEI was formed, has been the engagement with a wider set of theoretical resources and research strategies. This has helped deepen the field of inquiry and is particularly pertinent in informing the kind of vision of a future concerned with gender equality in education that the Dakar Declaration looks forward to.</p>
