<abstract>
<p>This article examines how knowledge management (KM) affects innovation performance within biotechnology firms. This is an industry in which small- and medium-sized biotech enterprises live together with the biotech divisions of large pharmaceutical firms. We conceptualize KM as a set of practices and dynamic capabilities, and hypothesize that KM dynamic capabilities act as a mediating variable between KM practices and innovation performance. We use structural equation modelling to test the hypotheses on a data set from the biotechnology industry. The results support our conceptualization and demonstrate its utility in explaining differences in innovation performance across firms. Findings have important implications regarding KM and innovation in high-tech small- and medium-sized enterprises.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>A principal concern articulated in strategic management research is to understand the reasons underlying performance differences among firms. The resource based view (RBV) of the firm offers an explanation for this phenomenon: the possession of unique organizational practices leads some firms to outperform others and thus, represents the main source of sustainable competitive advantage. In current research, this explanation is being complemented by taking into account the role of dynamic capabilities in achieving such sustainability: dynamic capabilities allow the firm to reconfigure its set of practices in order to adapt them to environmental changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0266242611417472">Teece et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0266242611417472">Zott, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0266242611417472">Teece, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Researchers are also devoting particular attention to the role of knowledge management (KM) in creating sustainable competitive advantage. Knowledge management consists of identifying and leveraging the collective knowledge in an organization to contribute to its performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0266242611417472">Von Krogh, 1998</xref>). Thus, the performance of organizations depends on the extent to which managers can mobilize all of the knowledge resources at their disposal and turn them into value-creating activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0266242611417472">Von Krogh, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0266242611417472">Alavi and Leidner, 2001</xref>). However, prior research has usually focused on specific and partial aspects of the creation and application of knowledge, such as prerequisites for effective KM, knowledge stocks and flows, teamwork, and identification and transfer of internal best practices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0266242611417472">Gold et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0266242611417472">Tallman et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0266242611417472">Palacios et al., 2009</xref>). Moreover, most of the previous findings have been obtained in the context of large firms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0266242611417472">Dalley and Hamilton, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0266242611417472">Hutchinson and Quintas, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Competitive advantage is increasingly derived from knowledge and technological skills in the creation of new products that are offered in the global market (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0266242611417472">Tidd et al., 1997</xref>). This is a challenging situation for any firm, but especially for small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). While some investigations suggest that large firms have more resources and are in a better position to innovate, other studies claim that being small might have advantages such as flexibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0266242611417472">Rogers, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>This study clarifies and measures the contribution of KM to innovation performance and thereby to the competitive advantage of a firm in an under-researched context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0266242611417472">Hutchinson and Quintas, 2008</xref>): high-tech SMEs. Innovation consists of the successful exploitation of new ideas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0266242611417472">Amabile et al., 1996</xref>) and is therefore associated with the creation and use of knowledge. We propose a high-level conceptualization of KM as a set of practices and dynamic capabilities. We formulate and test hypotheses on the respective effects of KM practices and dynamic capabilities on innovation performance in biotechnology firms. This is a specific context in which further research dealing with KM and innovation is required (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0266242611417472">Khilji et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0266242611417472">Palacios et al., 2009</xref>). Moreover, although there is general agreement on the benefits of KM, a number of studies claim that spending on KM systems might not yield the desired return (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0266242611417472">Fahey and Prusak, 1998</xref>). We argue that a KM investment requires a clear decision-making framework – one that takes into account the link between KM practices and dynamic capabilities – if this investment is to have a positive impact on innovation performance. Finally, by carefully controlling for the effects of size on innovation performance, we draw interesting implications for SMEs.</p>
<p>We make three contributions to the literature. First, we conceptualize KM as a firm function comprising organizational practices and dynamic capabilities that can create sustainable competitive advantage. This distinction between practice and dynamic capabilities facilitates the analysis of KM and explains how new sets of KM practices and dynamic capabilities are created on a continuous basis so that the firm can adapt to changing environments. Second, we explain intra-industry differences in innovation performance as a function of this decision-making framework. Third, we provide an analysis of the role of firm size in innovation performance in the biotechnology industry.</p>

<title>KM and the RBV</title>
<p>The RBV of the firm is an influential theoretical framework for understanding the creation and sustainability of competitive advantage and hence, for explaining why firms perform differently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0266242611417472">Barney, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0266242611417472">Zott, 2003</xref>). Recent research has proposed a knowledge-based view (KBV) of the firm by building upon and extending the RBV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0266242611417472">Grant, 1996</xref>). Given assumptions about the characteristics of knowledge and the knowledge requirements of production, a firm is conceptualized as an institution for creating and integrating knowledge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0266242611417472">Grant, 1996</xref>). Knowledge is embedded in multiple entities within the firm, such as individual employees, organizational culture, routines, policies, systems, and documents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0266242611417472">Alavi and Leidner, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>Fundamentally, KM consists of the creation and application of knowledge as a resource (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0266242611417472">Spender, 1996</xref>). The KBV focuses on knowledge as the most strategically important resource at a firm’s disposal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0266242611417472">Grant, 1996</xref>). Effective KM may contribute to better performance in several business processes, including the implementation of best practices and continuous improvement, operational problem solving, functional integration, and new product development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0266242611417472">Ettlie and Pavlou, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0266242611417472">Marsh and Stock, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0266242611417472">Palacios and Garrigos, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>However, prior research has generally focused on specific aspects of knowledge creation, retention and transfer. Extant literature lacks a global framework for examining the most relevant KM issues from a dynamic point of view. Moreover, further understanding is needed about the role of KM in explaining intra-industry differences in the context of innovation processes.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0266242611417472">
<title>Organizational practices and dynamic capabilities</title>
<p>Organizational practices are based on the application and use of knowledge. They consist of the operational systems, local abilities, and know-how that are necessary for day-to-day problem solving. Starting from the RBV, scholars in strategy research have shown that intangible, firm-specific, socially complex and causally ambiguous organizational practices – such as total quality management (TQM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0266242611417472">Powell, 1995</xref>) and human-related IT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0266242611417472">Mata et al., 1995</xref>) – are able to provide sustainable competitive advantage.</p>
<p>However, today’s core capabilities can become tomorrow’s core rigidities if the firm is not able to adapt them to environmental changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0266242611417472">Leonard-Barton, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0266242611417472">Newey and Zahra, 2009</xref>). Therefore, researchers have also focused on dynamic capabilities – that is, the mechanisms by which a firm is able to adapt its repertoire of organizational practices to changing environments. It has been proposed that dynamic capabilities allow the firm to integrate, build, and reconfigure internal and external competencies to address rapidly changing environments. Dynamic capabilities are based on knowledge creation and, because they facilitate the generation of unique and continually updated configurations of organizational practices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0266242611417472">Teece et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0266242611417472">Cepeda and Vera, 2007</xref>), they may constitute some of the most enduring sources of competitive advantage. It is in this context that the concept of dynamic capabilities has been used to explain why firms in the same industry perform differently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0266242611417472">Henderson and Cockburn, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0266242611417472">Zott, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Organizational practices and dynamic capabilities are closely linked. The adoption and use of local practices create expertise and learning through accumulation of experience. Dynamic capabilities arise from learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0266242611417472">Zollo and Winter, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0266242611417472">Marsh and Stock, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0266242611417472">Easterby-Smith and Prieto, 2008</xref>). Internal learning refers to new knowledge created by a firm’s own cumulative experience using its own resources. External learning refers to new knowledge created and integrated within a firm through interaction with the environment and other organizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0266242611417472">Kessler et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0266242611417472">Chang, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0266242611417472">Bapuji and Crossan, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>The repertoire of dynamic capabilities allows a firm to make subsequent changes and adaptations in local practices so that they do not become core rigidities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0266242611417472">Leonard-Barton, 1992</xref>). There is continuous interaction between established organizational practices and dynamic capabilities that lead to organizational renewal and competitiveness.</p>

<title>Conceptualizing KM practice and KM dynamic capability</title>
<p>The basic components of KM are knowledge creation, retention and transfer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0266242611417472">Grant, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0266242611417472">Spender, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0266242611417472">Spicer and Sadler-Smith, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0266242611417472">Zhang et al., 2006</xref>). Knowledge creation depends on internal and external learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0266242611417472">Bierly and Chakrabarti, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0266242611417472">Zhang et al., 2006</xref>). Knowledge retention and knowledge transfer allow the organization to have an ‘organizational memory’ by organizing and making available important knowledge, wherever and whenever it is needed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0266242611417472">Cegarra-Navarro and Sánchez-Polo, 2011</xref>). Knowledge management involves the application of knowledge through the operationalization of organizational practices to store and disseminate knowledge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0266242611417472">Alavi and Leidner, 2001</xref>). However, dynamic capabilities should also be taken into account when conceptualizing KM. Current KM practice may become inappropriate in the future; thus, KM dynamic capabilities are needed to reconfigure KM practice. New knowledge plays a crucial role in organizational transformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0266242611417472">Henderson and Cockburn, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0266242611417472">Zahra and George, 2002</xref>). Taking into account prior perspectives on KM, we propose that an organization’s KM consists of its organizational practices and dynamic capabilities regarding (respectively) the creation, retention and transfer of knowledge.</p>

<sec id="section6-0266242611417472">
<title>KM practice</title>
<p>KM practice is the result of knowledge application and consists of the KM systems, local abilities, and know-how that have been implemented in a firm-specific way so as to enable the performance of distinctive activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0266242611417472">Alavi and Leidner, 2001</xref>). KM practice deals primarily with issues of implementation and day-to-day operations; thus, it is tactical and operational in nature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0266242611417472">Tallman et al., 2004</xref>). The literature points to two main KM practices: <italic>knowledge dissemination</italic> and <italic>knowledge storage</italic>.</p>
<sec id="section7-0266242611417472">
<title>Knowledge dissemination practices</title>
<p>Knowledge dissemination practices include processes that spread explicit and tacit knowledge across the organization, through formal and informal channels, in order to facilitate the application of knowledge. Informal channels are useful in exchanging ideas, but formal ones have the advantage of being more systematic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0266242611417472">Zahra and George, 2002</xref>). Explicit knowledge is not hard to codify and disseminate. However, disseminating tacit knowledge is difficult and requires interaction among employees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0266242611417472">Nonaka, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0266242611417472">Fahey and Prusak, 1998</xref>). Although the benefits of knowledge dissemination are widely accepted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0266242611417472">Palacios and Garrigos, 2006</xref>), we have to outline that these processes might involve important costs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0266242611417472">Lapointe and Rivard, 2005</xref>). For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0266242611417472">Zhang et al. (2005)</xref> state that Enterprise resource planning implementation projects are, on average, 178% over budget, take 2.5 times as long as intended and deliver only 30% of promised benefits.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0266242611417472">
<title>Knowledge storage systems</title>
<p>They refer to a class of systems and procedures for storing and managing knowledge. These systems include IT-based solutions developed to support and enhance the processes of operational knowledge retrieval and storage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0266242611417472">Alavi and Leidner, 2001</xref>). Knowledge storage allows the organization to have an ‘organizational memory’, that is internal knowledge accumulated over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0266242611417472">Chang and Cho, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0266242611417472">Cegarra-Navarro and Sánchez-Polo, 2011</xref>)</p>
</sec>

<sec id="section9-0266242611417472">
<title>KM dynamic capability</title>
<p>Knowledge management dynamic capability focuses principally on the creation of knowledge and the long-term knowledge objectives of the firm. KM dynamic capability refers to an organization’s ability to <italic>reconfigure</italic> its KM practices – that is, integrating them in novel, specific and flexible ways to develop new KM systems when required (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0266242611417472">Zahra and George, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0266242611417472">Tallman et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0266242611417472">Cepeda and Vera, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0266242611417472">Easterby-Smith and Prieto, 2008</xref>). Based on a review of extant literature, we propose the following two dimensions for capturing the key aspects of a firm’s KM dynamic capability: <italic>external learning competence</italic> and <italic>internal learning competence</italic>. These dimensions are enablers for reconfiguring practice. They are based on a double-loop learning approach because they entail a modification of the organization’s implicit norms, practices, and objectives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0266242611417472">Argyris and Schön, 1978</xref>). Excelling along these dimensions allows the firm to utilize all the knowledge that is available through the resulting operationalization of KM practices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0266242611417472">Orlikowski, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0266242611417472">Zahra and George, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p><italic>External learning competence</italic> refers to the firm’s ability to create and integrate new knowledge created and integrated through interaction with the environment and other organizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0266242611417472">Bapuji and Crossan, 2004</xref>). It signifies a firm’s ability to reconfigure practices through transformation of knowledge – for example, by combining current knowledge with new knowledge coming from technology acquisition and from interactions with the environment and other organizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0266242611417472">Ettlie and Pavlou, 2006</xref>). New knowledge coming from external learning is included in the knowledge base of the firm and is an important input to the innovation process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0266242611417472">Chang, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p><italic>Internal learning competence</italic> refers to new knowledge created by a firm’s own cumulative experience using its own resources. Internal learning is developed mainly through research and development (R&amp;D) activities and implementation of best practices. It is also included in the knowledge base of the firm and plays an important role in the innovation process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0266242611417472">Cohen and Levinthal, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0266242611417472">Kessler et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0266242611417472">McAdam et al. 2010</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section10-0266242611417472">
<title>Hypotheses</title>
<p>The literature offers theoretical support as well as some empirical support for a positive relationship between several specific KM practices and innovation performance. The theory proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0266242611417472">Nonaka and Takeuchi (1995)</xref> on organizational knowledge creation conceives of knowledge as the main ingredient of innovation and firm competitiveness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0266242611417472">Nonaka, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0266242611417472">De Clerq and Arenius, 2006</xref>); furthermore, there is a positive effect of knowledge and learning systems on innovation processes and outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0266242611417472">Wheelwright and Clark, 1992</xref>). There is also empiricalevidence of the positive impact of learning and knowledge creation on innovation results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0266242611417472">Kessler et al., 2000</xref>). Recently, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0266242611417472">Hutchinson and Quintas (2008)</xref> outlined that most of KM research has focused on large organizations. These authors suggested that, in SMEs, knowledge is likely managed without the use of specific KM labels and ‘informal’ KM tends to be more implemented than formal KM. While we agree with these general propositions, we argue that, in the particular case of high-tech industries, SMEs might use and implement effectively informal KM as well as formal KM structures. In this line of thinking, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0266242611417472">Bell et al. (2004)</xref> found that ‘knowledge-intensive’ small firms had a different behaviour than ‘traditional’ manufacturing small firms in terms of business strategy formulation and implementation.</p>
<p>Therefore, at a process level we expect the link between KM practice and innovation outcomes to be positive.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p><italic>Hypothesis 1</italic>: The adoption and use of KM practices has a positive relationship to innovation performance.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>KM dynamic capability concerns the capacity of firms to reconfigure their KM practices as needed. This means that KM dynamic capability leads the organization to a configuration of KM practices that is specific and difficult to imitate. KM dynamic capability is used to deploy or combine KM practices in new and flexible ways to support organizational renewal, and it has a booster effect on the effectiveness of KM practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0266242611417472">Zott, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0266242611417472">Grewal and Slotegraaf, 2007</xref>). Recall that although KM systems can improve efficiency, they can also render the firm inflexible in dealing with novel situations if entrenched practices create rigidities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0266242611417472">Leonard-Barton, 1992</xref>). KM dynamic capability allows KM systems to adapt to change. For this reason, we expect the positive effect between KM practice and innovation performance to be mediated by KM dynamic capability. Support for our claim stems directly from the RBV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0266242611417472">Teece et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0266242611417472">Newey and Zahra, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Knowledge management practice plays an important role in innovation processes. However, an efficient KM practice configuration is not sufficient to achieve better innovation performance on a continuous basis: it implies a better innovation performance only for a certain period of time. Soon, competitors succeed in imitating the configuration and thereby erode the firm’s competitive advantage. In addition, technology or market changes can render a given KM practice configuration obsolete or inconvenient. Thus, the organization also needs a KM dynamic capability in order to adapt and renew this KM practice configuration so that superior innovation performance can be sustained.</p>
<p>We suggest that much of the impact of KM practices on innovation performance is indirect, affecting the dependent variable through its interaction with the firm’s KM dynamic capability.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<sec id="section12-0266242611417472">
<title>Sample and data collection procedure</title>
<p>We test our hypotheses by conducting a survey in the context of a single industry: biotechnology companies in France. French biotechnology is prominent in the international arena (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0266242611417472">Gittelman, 2006</xref>). Empirical studies that focus on a single industry are useful for identifying and measuring firms’ critical resources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0266242611417472">Hitt et al., 2001</xref>). Moreover, the analysis of a single industry may be appropriate for assessing innovation performance, since the knowledge and practices involved in innovation processes are likely to be homogeneous (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0266242611417472">Santarelli and Piergiovanni, 1996</xref>). By focusing our data collection on one industry, we reduce the range of extraneous variations that might influence the constructs of interest. We recognize the shortcoming of such sampling, but we believe that the advantages of this approach outweigh the disadvantages of limited generalizability. Furthermore, we restricted our target population to production firms with at least three years of existence, because innovation and capability generation are both time-dependent processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0266242611417472">Dierickx and Cool, 1989</xref>).</p>
<p>The questionnaire for the survey was sent to the R&amp;D director of each organization (<xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-0266242611417472">Appendix</xref>) it was undertaken between July and October 2002. Following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0266242611417472">Malhotra (1993)</xref>, we offered a feedback report on the survey results to the participating firms in order to encourage participation; the target population comprised 253 firms. A total of 132 useable surveys were returned, yielding a response rate of 52.17%. In order to check the representativeness of the sample obtained, we compared the respondents with the nonrespondents in terms of number of employees and annual turnover. This comparison did not reveal any significant differences, indicating that nonresponse bias is not a problem.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-0266242611417472">
<title>Measurement of variables</title>
<p>We developed 7-point Likert scales for the KM constructs (KM practices and dynamic capabilities) on the basis of recommendations put forward by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0266242611417472">Churchill (1979)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0266242611417472">DeVellis (1991)</xref>. Following the literature review described in the previous section, we identified two dimensions that bring together the most relevant aspects of KM <italic>practices</italic>: knowledge dissemination practices and knowledge storage systems. By means of a literature review, a pre-test, and a validation process based on exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis, we obtained a measurement scale consisting of seven items. Similarly, we operationalized KM <italic>dynamic capability</italic> through two dimensions: external learning competence and internal learning competence. Following the methodology just mentioned, we obtained a measurement scale consisting of 11 items (see the <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-0266242611417472">Appendix</xref> for both scales). We measured innovation performance by means of the <italic>Oslo Manual</italic> scale for assessing the economic results of product innovation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0266242611417472">OECD, 2005</xref>). We used this scale as a 7-point Likert scale. This scale has been successfully used in a number of recent empirical studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0266242611417472">Alegre and Chiva, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0266242611417472">López-Cabrales et al., 2009</xref>). Before launching the survey, we conducted a pre-test with 12 members of the biotechnology association of a leading business school. These respondents had at least three years of relevant work experience in that industry. The pre-test enabled us to check the comprehensibility of the questionnaire.</p>

<title>Control variables</title>
<p>Firm size and R&amp;D were included as control variables in the overall model because it has been found to impact product innovation. Both factors affect the endowment of important inputs for the innovation process such as money, people and facilities and have been shown to influence product introductions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0266242611417472">Henderson and Cockburn, 1994</xref>). We measured R&amp;D through a logarithmic transformation of two indicators: the R&amp;D budget and the number of R&amp;D employees.</p>
<p>The innovation literature explores the relationship between firm size and innovation indicating theoretical reasons and empirical findings supporting a positive relationship: firm size affects the endowment of important inputs for the innovation process such as money, people and facilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0266242611417472">Arvanitis, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0266242611417472">Moen, 1999</xref>). More specifically, firm size has been shown to influence both R&amp;D expenditures and product introductions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0266242611417472">Pla-Barber and Alegre, 2007</xref>). However, there are a number of factors that suggest small firms may have several advantages over large firms such as flexibility and fluid communication. Large size may also have other disadvantages such as inefficiency and lack of research units (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0266242611417472">Rogers, 2004</xref>). The literature offers empirical findings in this direction.</p>
<p>The biotechnology industry consists largely of SMEs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0266242611417472">Khilji et al., 2006</xref>). <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0266242611417472">Table 1</xref> shows the distribution of sample firms according to their size group according to the number of employees. We followed the European Commission criterion based on the number of employees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0266242611417472">Loecher, 2000</xref>) to classify participating firms into four groups: micro-firms (less than nine employees), small firms (from 10 to 49 employees), medium firms (from 50 to 249 employees), and large firms (more than 249 employees). Almost 92% of the sample firms can be considered SMEs. In our research model, we measured firm size through a logarithmic transformation of two indicators: turnover and the total number of employees. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0266242611417472">Table 2</xref> shows descriptive statistics for the two size indicators we use in this research: number of employees and sales volume.</p>

<p>First, the direct effect model has been satisfactorily tested. There is evidence of a positive link between KM practices adoption and innovation performance. This finding provides support for our first hypothesis.</p>
<p>Second, the inclusion of KM dynamic capabilities in the analysis helps to provide an explanation for this positive link: KM dynamic capabilities act as a mediating variable that boosts the positive effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0266242611417472">Grewal and Slotegraaf, 2007</xref>). The mediating effect of KM dynamic capabilities on the relationship between KM practice and firm innovation performance is demonstrated by the following sequence, as suggested by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0266242611417472">Tippins and Sohi (2003)</xref>: (1) there is a positive relationship between KM practice and KM dynamic capabilities; (2) there is a positive relationship between KM dynamic capabilities and firm innovation performance; and (3) the significant relationship between KM practice and firm innovation performance indicated in the direct effect model becomes lower and nonsignificant in the partial mediation model. Statements (1)–(3) provide compelling evidence of a clear mediating effect of KM dynamic capabilities on the relationship between KM practice and firm innovation performance. Thus, the partial mediation model represents a significant contribution in our understanding of the positive influence – which is supported both by theory and some previous empirical research – of KM on innovation performance. The positive impact that implementing KM practices has on innovation performance is mediated by the firm’s KM dynamic capabilities. These results provide support for our second hypothesis.</p>
<p>Finally, the relationship between firm size and innovation is low and not significant.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study examines the effects of KM on firm innovation. We take an initial step toward formulating a theoretical framework and testing empirically the relationships among KM practice, KM dynamic capabilities, and innovation performance. Given that innovation performance varies among biotechnology producers, we attempt to understand this asymmetry through the lens of firm KM practice and KM dynamic capabilities.</p>
<p>We find strong support for the comprehensive KM model and the underlying hypotheses presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0266242611417472">Figure 1</xref> – in other words, convincing evidence that KM enhances innovation performance. An analysis of the direct and indirect effects shows that the indirect effect prevails when both are taken into account. Thus, KM practice can enhance sustained competitive advantages in innovation performance, but it does so <italic>indirectly</italic> through the creation of KM dynamic capabilities. Therefore, sustained competitive advantage in the biotechnology industry does indeed require firm strategies that capitalize on KM practice. However, particular attention must be paid to KM dynamic capabilities as the impact of KM practices on innovation performance is mediated by the KM dynamic capabilities of the firm.</p>
<p>Our study contributes to the RBV by providing evidence that a firm’s innovation performance and competitive advantage are functions of complex inimitable resources embedded within the organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0266242611417472">Barney, 1991</xref>). Furthermore, it shows how dynamic capabilities provide flexibility in organizational practices. The KM practices considered in our questionnaire are all highly firm-specific, so there are no standard formulas for their implementation. KM dynamic capabilities are not only firm-specific but also are difficult to imitate, because they are based on complex organizational routines. Both KM practices and KM dynamic capabilities are valuable because they contribute to innovation performance. As a result, KM may be regarded as a substantial source of sustained competitive advantage for the firm.</p>
<p>A second, related contribution of our study is that it allows us to improve our understanding of the process of developing dynamic capabilities. Although this a complex organizational process that still requires further research, our findings allow us to suggest that the adoption of KM practice and its daily use create a repertoire of KM dynamic capabilities through the routinization of KM practice and the learning inherent in the operational problem-solving process. KM dynamic capabilities allow practice to be more effective and assure a positive impact of KM practices on innovation performance by adapting them to change – thus, overcoming the negative effects of rigid KM practices – and by creating new KM practices as they are required. This notion is consistent with and builds on some of the earlier work in this area (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0266242611417472">Zollo and Winter, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0266242611417472">Zott, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0266242611417472">Grewal and Slotegraaf, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0266242611417472">Easterby-Smith and Prieto, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>A third contribution is to the emerging KBV, which posits that knowledge is the ultimate source of competitive advantage. This study provides a clearer understanding of the effect of KM on innovation performance, one that is supported by an empirical test. Moreover, a global conceptualization of KM – taking into account organizational practices and dynamic capabilities – is provided and validated. Methodologically, the study contributes to the development and empirical validation of scales that assess KM practice and KM dynamic capability.</p>
<p>Finally, the relationship between firm size and innovation is low and not significant. This result confirms that, in biotechnology, innovation depends on size factors (e.g. resources such as people, funds, equipments, etc.) as well as on non-size factors (e.g. flexibility, communication). This finding does not imply that size factors are not important, but it reveals that they are not preponderant in this particular high-tech industry. Results also show that differences between how large firms and SMEs enact KM might be negligible in the case of high-tech SMEs.</p>
<p>Further to an academic contribution, our study also has interesting implications for practice. It shows managers how to make the most of KM. The dual structure of KM practices and KM dynamic capabilities leads to an understanding of how the adoption and use of KM practices can produce substantial benefits for the firm. Specifically, implementing KM practices is a necessary but not a sufficient condition for firms to create sustainable competitive advantage. KM dynamic capabilities are the link between KM practice and sustainable competitive advantage, so managers should take them into account when formulating the firm’s strategy.</p>
<p>Previous studies have shown that simply investing in KM systems is not enough to enhance performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0266242611417472">Tippins and Sohi, 2003</xref>). Our study extends this result: it is not a question of how <italic>much</italic> you spend but rather of <italic>how</italic> you spend the money.</p>
<sec id="section20-0266242611417472">
<title>Limitations</title>
<p>The results presented here should be viewed in light of the following limitations. First, the data were gathered at one point in time, so we can neither conclusively demonstrate causality nor rule out reverse causality. Second, this is a single-method study. Collecting the dependent and independent variables from a single informant aids the rate of response, but it does give rise to concerns about common method bias. (We performed analyses to confirm the minimal extent of this bias.) Third, even though biotechnology is a young industry, a firm’s prior experience with KM practices and/or innovative performance could influence the results; we did not control for these factors. Finally, the target population of this study was narrowly defined to include a homogeneous set of firms. Although a restrictive sampling approach enhances confidence that the findings are indeed a result of the hypothesized relationships, it may also limit the generalizability of research results.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section21-0266242611417472">
<title>Future research</title>
<p>The results of this study provide guidance for future research. The mediating effect of dynamic capabilities should be taken into account during research on knowledge and information systems that is carried out in an organizational context. Such dynamic capabilities are an important step between operational organizational practices and performance. The relationship between KM practice and KM dynamic capability needs further analysis from a longitudinal perspective. Further examination on the links between KM practice and KM dynamic capability could also benefit from using different methods. Qualitative analysis on some cases could shed more light onto these links and could be very helpful in understanding more clearly the process of dynamic capabilities creation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0266242611417472">Easterby-Smith et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Future research should control for firms’ prior experience with KM practices and prior innovative performance, and it should also examine the generalizability of our findings to other kinds of organizations. Future investigations could also distinguish between radical and incremental product innovation; this dictinction would require taking into account both adaptive and generative learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0266242611417472">Khilji et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0266242611417472">Chiva et al., 2010</xref>). The connections between KM practice, KM dynamic capability, and innovation performance with other important organizational issues such as organizational memory or knowledge strategy could also deserve further inquiry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0266242611417472">Chang and Cho, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0266242611417472">Easterby-Smith and Prieto, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Finally, knowledge-intensive industries have, for obvious reasons, been the setting for most research on KM. However, the implementation of KM in more mature industries is anticipated in the future. Hence, in line with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0266242611417472">Easterby-Smith et al. (2009)</xref>, we suggest future research to assess the extent of diffusion of KM into other than knowledge-intensive industries. Should there be a significant use of KM in these mature industries, further analyses on the dynamics between KM practice and KM dynamic capability would be required.</p>
