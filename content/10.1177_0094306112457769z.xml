<p>Jan Lin’s new work, <italic>The Power of Urban Ethnic Places</italic>, using examples from four immigrant gateway cities, states that renewed ethnic neighborhoods acquire a salience which promotes sentiment and symbolism as well as stemming urban decay. His work is extensive, covering over fifteen years of field work, and compares several Asian, Latino and African American enclaves.</p>
<p>As a continuous stream of ethnic groups cycle into and then out of these neighborhoods, the growth of ethnic cultural heritage locations promotes neighborhood stability and sustainability. The preservation of the cultural buildings, parks, monuments, art and homes gives members of the ethnic community (no matter where they live) a focal point for organizing, gathering, and renewal. As ethnic cultural tourism takes root, many of these neighborhoods become important aspects of immigrant heritage and the ethnic economy is preserved for non-ethnics. It offers them the ability to tour authentic neighborhoods.</p>
<p>In Houston and Miami, Jan Lin compares two gateway immigrant cities and their historical ethnic enclaves. At the time of Lin’s research, the black neighborhoods in Houston had not fared well. The Parkway Village housing projects and the Fourth Ward black community were purposely weakened with few plans for the future. In effect, their community was left to struggle, and any signs of a racial-ethnic heritage were reduced. Part of the problem as Lin suggests is that very little money was infused, especially money to preserve racial-ethnic heritage places. The land was much more valuable as prime real estate than for preserving or upgrading limited “locations” of racial-ethnic groups. As Lin puts it, this was an “economics vs. culture” struggle, and economics won.</p>
<p>In Miami, he points out two different scenarios. Overtown, which has a heritage of being a predominately black neighborhood, suffers because of disinvestment and the destruction of some of the original commercial and residential sections settled by the black community. However, with the reconstruction of a folklife village and the promotion of the Harlem Renaissance, tourism became the major attraction. On the other hand, in Little Havana, there is a continuous flow of investment and people into the community. Local Cuban leaders and stakeholders control Little Havana’s community and tourism development. Little Havana never contracted, and instead grew. Both communities are thriving and rely on tourism and investment to counterbalance any urban decay.</p>
<p>Last, Lin examines Chinatowns in Los Angeles and New York. In Los Angeles, the old Chinatown, a former frontier pueblo, evolved into the current global city. But the change was formidable, for amidst a removal to clear the way for Union Station, a tourist community was rebuilt with both economic and political motivations. The newest version of Los Angeles’ Chinatown is gentrifying—with huge impacts on low-income housing and the elderly. On the other hand, New York’s Chinatown remains an important enclave to those with roots there as well as to those who go there to seek cultural or ethnic enrichment. In the aftermath of 9/11, culture and entertainment have become the primary focus of development in Chinatown. Chinese ethnic places that can bring in both former residents, those with distant roots as well as tourists, are the prime targets for investment.</p>
<p>Among all of these ethnic places, Lin carefully argues that an urban racial-ethnic place is sustained when there is a confluence between residents and activists, and the larger global political economy of the place. Lin states that there is a distinction between Black and Latino interests, and Asian interests. Some residents and others interested in racial-ethnic heritage invest in the community. And this seems to occur much more often in the Latino and Asian communities he examined. In fact, Lin found that there was general disinvestment in the black communities. Fewer blacks move into these neighborhoods resulting in gentrification as wealthier whites and others moved in, thereby changing some of the intrinsic historical heritage sites. On the other hand, new Asian and Latino immigrants move into and out of the Asian and Latino racial-ethnic communities refueling creativity, jobs, and entrepreneurship. Lin argues that only the sites that have continual historical significance receive both social and capital investment.</p>
<p>Jan Lin’s book provides a richly detailed, tightly packed comparative analysis of the trends of investment and disinvestment in these communities. He succeeds in providing evidence on how ethnic urban communities survive in our contemporary global era. All of the cases are written with thick description giving one a sense of the historical and contemporary political economy and activism that is required to sustain these communities. Overall, Lin’s research and sources are excellent. His book is well organized and extremely dense. The book should be a read by anyone studying and trying to understand the contemporary ethnic urban community and why these communities matter to ethnics who do not live in these neighborhoods.</p>
