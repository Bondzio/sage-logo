<sec id="section1-0269216312464093">
<title>Background:</title>
<p>Non-pharmacological breathlessness management programmes have been shown to be beneficial in the management of lung cancer–related dyspnoea for more than 10 years. What is not so clear is how they work.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0269216312464093">
<title>Aim:</title>
<p>To evaluate how patients with intrathoracic malignancy (lung cancer or pleural mesothelioma) undergoing the non-pharmacological breathlessness management programmes benefited from the programme, using a qualitative methodology.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0269216312464093">
<title>Design and Setting:</title>
<p>Consecutive patients completing the programme were invited to be interviewed (semi-structured and audio-recorded) about their experiences of the programme, what had helped them and how. Interviews were transcribed and analysed using interpretative phenomenological analysis.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0269216312464093">
<title>Results:</title>
<p>Nine patients were interviewed. Seven major themes emerged, they are summarised as follows: (1) Mixed prior expectations of the programme, (2) flexibility of delivery and additional support needs, (3) physiotherapist attributes and skills in developing an effective helping relationship, (4) adoption of new techniques, (5) the effects and impact of the programme and new techniques, (6) difficulties and barriers to achieving change and (7) facing an uncertain future beyond the programme</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0269216312464093">
<title>Conclusion:</title>
<p>The non-pharmacological breathlessness management programme appears to offer a wide range of benefits to patients, including improving functional capacity, coping strategies and self-control. Such benefits are most likely to be due to a combination of breathing control, activity management and the therapist qualities.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Breathlessness, a common symptom of intrathoracic malignancy, can be frightening and debilitating.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0269216312464093">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0269216312464093">2</xref></sup> Each indivi-dual’s experience is unique<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0269216312464093">3</xref></sup> and should be central to assessment and development of an intervention.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0269216312464093">4</xref></sup> Qualitative research into the experience of breathlessness in lung cancer patients has shown a combination of physical and emotional symptoms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0269216312464093">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0269216312464093">6</xref></sup> that impact the lifestyle and social function of such patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0269216312464093">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0269216312464093">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0269216312464093">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>Various self-taught behavioural and cognitive strategies may be employed by patients to manage breathlessness, including avoidance of exertion, active breathing exercises, positioning, ignoring or minimising breath-lessness, endurance of the discomfort, distraction and acceptance.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0269216312464093">5</xref></sup> In the past, patients have reported clinicians to have a limited understanding of the importance and relevance of this symptom.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0269216312464093">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0269216312464093">7</xref></sup> Despite this, the management of breathlessness in advanced lung cancer is becoming a treatment priority with guidelines emphasising the importance of non-pharmacological intervention.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0269216312464093">9</xref></sup> Several authors have reported encouraging results from non-pharmacological breathlessness programmes (NPBMPs) for lung cancer patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0269216312464093">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0269216312464093"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0269216312464093"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0269216312464093"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0269216312464093">14</xref></sup> However, such quantitative evaluations do not provide an understanding of the experience of the intervention for patients and the useful components, and may not uncover all intervention effects. Furthermore, studies of this population have suffered high attrition rates of completion of the intervention, due to patients becoming frail quickly.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0269216312464093">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0269216312464093">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0269216312464093">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>A systematic review<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0269216312464093">16</xref></sup> highlighted the difficulties in identifying the optimal service delivery, effective intervention components and the mechanisms of effect due to the heterogeneity of interventions published. Due to the complex and subjective nature of breathlessness and resulting variety of individual needs, it is likely that such factors vary greatly between individuals. Limited qualitative data exist exploring the benefits of NPBMPs for lung cancer patients. A qualitative pilot investigation of a breathlessness service offered to all diagnostic groups highlighted the value of the psychosocial support, educational aspects of the service and the provision of a hand-held fan.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0269216312464093">17</xref></sup> Patients achieved increased feelings of control and a reduction in attendant anxiety. Participants in this study did not have lung cancer, and therefore, generalisations must be made with caution. A qualitative study of the experiences and benefits of an NPBMP enables us to understand how and why this intervention is beneficial. The Booth study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0269216312464093">17</xref></sup> also reported psychosocial support as being a fundamental part of symptom management programmes. NPBMPs have been developed and much of the literature has discussed the role of the nurse in supporting patients. One study using a collaborative nurse–physiotherapist approach acknowledges that both professions have core skills to offer to breathless patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0269216312464093">18</xref></sup> The NPBMP in our trust is delivered by a physiotherapist who specialises in an integrated approach and is part of the respiratory and palliative care multi-disciplinary team (MDT).</p>
<p>This study evaluates a physiotherapist-led, non- pharmacological breathlessness management service using a qualitative approach. The service has been offered to breathless patients with intrathoracic malignancy for several years and is modelled on the integrated approach to breathlessness management described by Corner<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0269216312464093">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>The intervention structure consisted of the following sessions:</p>
<list id="list1-0269216312464093" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>A pre-programme session where the intervention structure and approach to the management of breathlessness were explained to the patient, consent was gained to enter the programme and the venue for further interventions agreed</p></list-item>

<list-item><p>A one-month follow-up appointment to review techniques and offer any further advice</p></list-item>

</list>
<p>Three information booklets produced by Macmillan, on the subject of breathlessness management, were also offered to patients.</p>
<p>A quantitative evaluation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0269216312464093">14</xref></sup> showed improvements in patients on several parameters following the intervention; however, few completed the full programme due to decline in health, death or only needing certain aspects of the programme. Questions were raised about how more frail patients cope with breathlessness and how the non-pharmacological intervention can best support this group. Clinical experience and anecdotal patient reports suggest that patients with rapidly progressing disease do gain benefit even with one intervention session.</p>
<p>With a view to further exploring the benefits of and improving NPBMPs, this study used a qualitative approach to (1) explore patients’ experiences of the NPBMP, (2) identify how the programme has helped patients and (3) explore the elements of the programme that led to such effects.</p>

</list>
<p>Patients were excluded from the study if they were undergoing any disease-modifying treatment and/or had cognitive impairment or communication difficulties that would prevent them from engaging in the NPBMP and interview process.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0269216312464093">
<title>Procedure</title>
<p>Patients were offered invitation packs by the physiotherapist at the end of their agreed final session. Invitation packs comprised a participant information booklet, a covering letter with reply slip and stamped addressed envelope. Patients were asked to complete and return the reply slip within 10 days, if they wished to take part. On receipt of the reply slip, contact was made with the participant, by the psychology assistant, in order to answer questions and arrange an interview time. The psychology assistant was employed to conduct the research and was independent of the treatment team.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0269216312464093">
<title>Consent</title>
<p>Written consent was gathered from each participant immediately prior to the interview.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0269216312464093">
<title>Semi-structured interviews</title>
<p>The interviews loosely followed a topic guide that had been developed in consultation with the lung cancer MDT and the user/carer member of the project steering group. The topic guide consisted of the patient’s personal experience of breathlessness, the sessions that they had with the physiotherapist, the elements that had helped them and how, any unhelpful elements and the overall impact of the intervention. Questions were open and the interview was free to follow individual lines of enquiry. The psychology assistant (first author) conducted the interviews, either at the participant’s home or at the hospital depending on need.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-0269216312464093">
<title>Analysis</title>
<p>Interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. At the request of the participant, one interview was recorded with written notes, verbatim as far as possible.</p>
<p>Interpretative phenomenological analysis (IPA)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0269216312464093">19</xref></sup> was employed due to the complexity and subjectivity of breathlessness and to best explore the experience and impact of the intervention within the context of progressive disease. IPA allows for a rich exploration of how individuals personally make sense of a phenomenon.</p>
<p>The analysis procedure consisted of familiarisation with the transcripts, initial free noting and the identification of emerging themes. This process was carried out with each transcript to ensure themes were not imposed. Themes were then clustered to create superordinate themes. QSR NVivo8 software was used to assist with the organisation of themes and supporting quotations.</p>
<p>To enhance rigour, a validity check of an initial theme summary was carried out. Following each interview, a short summary was compiled and sent by post to the participant. A second shorter meeting, or phone call if preferred, took place 1–2 weeks later to check accuracy of themes and to give the participant the opportunity to clarify statements further. Any amendments to the summary, or additional views on the programme given by the participants after looking at the summary, were included in the analysis. All participants agreed with the summary. No corrections were made although some did add further views. The researcher received regular supervision in the analysis process. Supervisor checking, discussion of emerging themes, looking back at sections of original transcripts to ensure themes were appropriately represented and routed in the original datasets, and saturation of themes formed core parts of the supervision meetings. One transcript was looked at by the research team to validate the themes summarised by the researcher.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-0269216312464093">
<title>Sample</title>
<p>Over the 6-month recruitment period, 20 referrals to the NPBMP were identified as fitting the inclusion criteria. During the intervention, 4 patients died; therefore, 16 patients were invited to be interviewed, 9 of whom opted to take part (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0269216312464093">Figure 1</xref>). The demographic and medical characteristics of participants are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0269216312464093">Table 1</xref>. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0269216312464093">Table 2</xref> summarises the completion of the NPBMP.

<title>Results</title>
<p>Seven key themes emerged regarding experiences of the NPBMP. These encompass prior expectations, helpful aspects of the programme and its impact, and facing the uncertain future beyond the programme.</p>
<sec id="section16-0269216312464093">
<title>Mixed prior expectations of the programme</title>
<p>Participants started the programme with mixed expectations about the need for help and how the programme would be of benefit to them. This ranged from a recognition that help with breathlessness could improve quality of life, ambivalence about benefits, to surprise that help was available for breathlessness.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>the breathing is the only thing now to . . . get under control a bit better . . . the main thing is to try and improve the quality of life and that’s the breathing. (04M)</p>
<p>Hoping that something would help me but a little bit cynical as well . . . I didn’t see how anything could help improve it . . . but the other side of the coin is well perhaps it can and I shall listen and keen for whatever I can to help me. (03M)</p>
<p>they suddenly mentioned it about breathing exercises . . . I’m unaware that breathing lessons were either necessary, possible or, or wanted. (02M)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section17-0269216312464093">
<title>Flexibility of delivery and additional support needs</title>
<p>The programme delivery was tailored to individual patient needs such as location of appointment (home or hospital), timing of appointments, number of sessions required and the programme content. Overall, participants valued flexibility in appointment delivery such as arranging it on the same day as other hospital appointments, provision of written information as reminders to session content and for tips and ideas, and the presence of their carers/partners for emotional and learning support.</p>
<p>However, people had individual needs in terms of the amount of written information they required and level of carer involvement. Needs for information ranged from wanting the full amount of information available with almost a sense of urgency and ‘grabbing out at any help offered’ (04M), valuing the information as a memory aid, to not needing too much information. In terms of carer support, the majority of participants had carers present, but their roles and level of involvement differed from being heavily involved in supporting the learning of new techniques to being present for personal support.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>my wife’s always telling me the exercises . . . she’s the one that’s been trying to teach me how to do it properly. (02M)</p>
<p>I used to moan a lot about being breathless he [husband] understood what was happening . . . I just felt more comfortable with him there. (05F)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section18-0269216312464093">
<title>Physiotherapist attributes and skills in developing an effective helping relationship</title>
<p>Each participant put great emphasis on the interpersonal factors of the programme. These included valuing the personal qualities of the physiotherapist; her communication and listening skills; her interest in the whole person, not just the disease or symptom, and the way she taught interventions to facilitate learning.</p>
<sec id="section19-0269216312464093">
<title>Personal qualities of the physiotherapist</title>
<p>For a number of people, the personal qualities were seen as the most important part of the intervention. A caring approach that was attentive and sensitive to their needs and comfort in the session was highly valued.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>it’s personality you know, if you get half a dozen people doing that job and it still wouldn’t be the same, it depends on the person. (04M)</p>
<p>From meeting [physiotherapist], her very manner, the way she dealt with us, she was so caring, thoughtful . . . it was a warm day and she got a fan to cool us down, she gave us a drink and really she was just exceptionally nice. (05F)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section20-0269216312464093">
<title>Good communication skills</title>
<p>Participants valued the physiotherapists’ communication and listening skills. Honesty but with a combination of positivity and realism was found to be helpful and empowering to people in terms of what they could personally control and self-manage.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>it was realism . . . she didn’t try saying it’ll be all right, you’ll be ok, blah, blah, she was honest and knowledgeable … it was the positive fact that she put on, she told me I could be in control. (01M)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>An important aspect of the programme was also being able to talk and having someone who would listen, helping people feel validated and understood.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Just to talk to someone who understood what I was going through . . . it helped having someone know exactly how it feels. (06F)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Participants also highlighted the importance of the accessibility and presence of the physiotherapist for emotional support and advice.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>At this time you’re down and lonely anyway so having someone there for support is important. 04M</p>
<p>. . . if there’s anything I want or need some advice on she’s there, so it’s good . . . it’s only a phone call I need. (09M)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section21-0269216312464093">
<title>Physiotherapist being interested in the person not just the symptom</title>
<p>Conversation during the sessions also touched on other aspects of life such as holidays and family. One patient explained how the physiotherapist recognised and praised personal achievements.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>she was interested in little things you know, . . . there was once . . . my husband wasn’t there . . . and I went on my own and I drove the car and she was so pleased that I had done that, that I had done something properly on my own. (05F)</p>

<title>Using a ‘hands-on’ teaching style to facilitate learning</title>
<p>Modelling the breathing techniques and providing ‘hands-on’ guidance to patients helped individuals learn the technique and reassure them that they were doing it correctly.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>She felt, she could feel when I was doing it properly. (01M)</p>

<title>Adoption of new techniques</title>
<p>Following the programme, individuals described using a number of new coping techniques taught in the NPBMP. These included the use of breathing control, activity management, strategies to induce relaxation and the use of a fan.</p>
<sec id="section24-0269216312464093">
<title>Changes in breathing control</title>
<p>Each participant talked about using the breathing control techniques covered in the programme. Individuals learned to breathe differently or ‘correctly’ by using their nose and breathing deeply.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>not just breathing in and out but how to breathe in, how to hold it, how to feel it so when you’re exhaling where’s that coming from. (01M)</p>
<p>. . . you’ve got to do it the correct way . . . I didn’t breathe properly before, I inhaled and exhaled by mouth all the time and used me nose hardly but now I’m using me nose more and more . . . just adapted. (09M)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section25-0269216312464093">
<title>Changing ways of approaching activities</title>
<p>Participants reported the helpfulness of applying a range of activity management techniques they had learned in the programme to activities of daily living. These included activities such as using counting to regulate breathing, taking a break to recover breathing and using a problem solving approach to activities – identifying the activity, potential problems it may cause for breathing and planning how to carry it out so that they felt in control of their breathlessness.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I count when I walk to my sister-in-law’s and it does help. (06F)</p>
<p>she said identify something before you do it, is it going to be something that’s going to give you problems which is what I do now . . . I do it subconsciously, like a risk assessment. (01M)</p>
<p>. . . planning what you’re going to do, and make stops to take a breath here or get some deep breaths or don’t rush into it. (04M)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In addition to behavioural change, some participants described cognitive and emotional changes within themselves where they experienced a more general acceptance of having to slow down or stop certain activities and ask for help:<disp-quote>
<p>there’s some things I don’t do now, I don’t lift, carry, heavy, well not even heavy things, I get people to carry things for me because I know that it could set things off. (01M)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Having a sense of personal control over breathing and breathlessness seemed to underpin the beneficial changes to activity management. Personal control wasn’t just about actively changing the way you breathed or planning and pacing an activity but also about simply being able to accept what you can’t do any more yet still find ways around that, such as asking others for help.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section26-0269216312464093">
<title>Cued relaxation</title>
<p>Participants learnt to relax in response to the onset of breathlessness and found that dropping the shoulders was an effective cue to relax their body.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>one thing she said to me . . . remember to lower your shoulders and I thought why . . . now I know . . . I immediately felt more relaxed . . . I was amazed how it had this calming effect and my breathing was slowing down. (05F)</p>
<p>[Physiotherapist] showed me how to relax by sitting back, dropping my shoulders and letting my whole body relax. It helps my lungs to expand . . . When I feel it [breathlessness] coming on I immediately let my shoulders drop. (06F)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section27-0269216312464093">
<title>Use of a fan in enclosed spaces</title>
<p>Benefits of using a hand-held fan were reported. The fan was particularly helpful when participants were in small, enclosed spaces. They liked the sensation of air movement around the face and into the nose and felt it helped with breathing.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>She told me about having a fan. It’s amazing, it stirs the air up around my face . . . I went to visit my brother-in-law and the room was smaller so the fan helped me. (06F)</p>
<p>I’ve got a fan, one of them little fans which is dead handy when you’re sitting in an enclosed space . . . it pushes air into your nose. (09M)</p>

<sec id="section28-0269216312464093">
<title>The effects and impacts of the programme and new techniques</title>
<p>The programme and the changes that individuals had made in managing breathlessness gave rise to a range of inter-related functional, social and psychological effects. These encompassed increased endurance, perceptions of improved breathing, achieving a sense of normality, increased perceptions of personal control over breathlessness and more general coping and reduced distress as a consequence.</p>
<sec id="section29-0269216312464093">
<title>Increased endurance on activity</title>
<p>Reports included increased endurance and less disruption to physical activities, such as managing hills, stairs and talking. Participants took pleasure and pride in the fact that they could accomplish tasks more easily such as being able to complete a hilly walk (a hobby much loved by the participants prior to their lung cancer), continue on for longer before having to stop and talk for longer with family and friends.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>. . . it was hilly and it was up and down and I managed it absolutely brilliantly . . . I thought if it wasn’t for [physiotherapist] I’d be back in the car by now just getting my breath back. (01M)</p>
<p>I can get to the top of the stairs now using that method and carry on whereas before I had to stop . . . it’s helped me extend that bit . . . I’m slightly out of breath but I can still carry on . . . it’s given me that bit of extra range. (02M)</p>
<p>I can talk longer now, where before I used to have to stop . . . talking to the daughter, I can talk for ages now . . . I was talking to a friend I hadn’t seen for 20 years . . . I lasted quite a long time, I thought I wouldn’t. (09M)</p>

<sec id="section30-0269216312464093">
<title>Improved breathing</title>
<p>Some participants reported breathing more efficiently and easily, experiencing a reduction in ‘panting’ (02M; 09M).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section31-0269216312464093">
<title>Achieving a sense of normality</title>
<p>Acknowledging that their lives had changed dramatically as a result of their diagnoses and breathlessness, participants highlighted that the programme had helped them feel a greater sense of normality. Normality was achieved in individual ways: One was simply being reassured that breathlessness is normal in the context of lung cancer. Other participants felt that better control of breathlessness and an improved breathing technique meant they could still lead a relatively normal life. This included the importance of continuing with activities they have always enjoyed albeit a little slower and feeling a greater sense of being normal in social encounters.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>since then [programme] I always start breathing properly, as you’re walking down the road . . . when you’re breathing you can talk to somebody without saying I’ll have to stop now . . . now I can walk into a shop and ask for that thing . . . it makes you feel better, that I’m normal like you know. (09M)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section32-0269216312464093">
<title>Increased personal control and confidence</title>
<p>Individuals felt that the programme had helped them re-establish a sense of personal control. This ranged from increased confidence in controlling breathlessness specifically to a more general sense of being able to help themselves and cope with their cancer more broadly. Participants linked their increase in personal control with an increase in knowledge about breathlessness and breathing techniques, encouragement from the physiotherapist and the importance of knowing that they can do something to help themselves. Some participants described internal self help as very important to them, rather than just relying on external sources such as medication. As a consequence of increased personal control, reductions in feeling frightened and panicky about breathlessness were also reported.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>its happened 2 ways, the physical side and how to breathe . . . and the psychological thing of actually being put back in control of the situation and in control of myself. (01M)</p>
<p>I feel as though I’m doing something to try and help myself . . . I mean it’s [cancer] still there and I know that the whole thing is going to end in disaster but for the moment I feel as though, because of her [physiotherapist], I’m coping with things better . . . instead of moaning about it and being uncomfortable and a bit frightened and panicky, I feel that now I know what to do.

<title>Difficulties and barriers to achieving change</title>
<p>Some participants noted difficulties in applying the breathing techniques to activities. Barriers to achieving change included difficulties in changing lifetime habits, the need for practice, effort and concentration.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I always used to be a fast walker . . . that’s a hard habit to change . . . I suppose there’s still a bit of a 16 year old in me who wants to be fast . . . outside I tend to just want to be off and away. (02M)</p>

<title>Facing an uncertain future beyond the programme</title>
<p>Participants generally felt confident to finish the programme and knowing they could access help again if needed. However, uncertainties of the future were acknowledged, including issues of deterioration and uncertainty about self-management of breathlessness in the face of progression. Many preferred to focus on the short term and avoid thinking about the future.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Eventually it’ll not help [breathing techniques] . . . you’ve got to be really bad then and that’s when they put you on, what do they call it, on the bottle but up to now I’m ok. (07M)</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study has revealed the wide range of benefits gained from the intervention. The programme led to adoption of new techniques to cope with breathlessness, particularly breathing control techniques, activity planning, relaxation and use of a fan. These changes contributed to broader effects and consequences including improved endurance in activity, increased sense of control, reduced anxiety and fear upon breathlessness and maintaining a sense of normality. At the same time, a number of factors can contribute to difficulties in making changes in coping which must be addressed.</p>
<p>The patients’ relationship with the physiotherapist was emphasised and seems inextricably linked with the positive experiences of the programme and its effects. Patients valued the human contact in terms of having the hands-on guidance and modelling of the techniques and the support from a professional who was caring, positive and sensitive to the individual. The one-to-one delivery and attention were important for most patients.</p>
<p>The individuality of patient experience and benefits reflects the unique experiences of breathlessness and service needs. Key areas where this heterogeneity presented include informational needs, in terms of the amount of written information; how a sense of normality is maintained; the need for carer involvement in the service; difficulties encountered and the particular combination of management strategies used. A tailored, patient-centred service model is essential.</p>
<p>The prior expectations of the programme encompassed much uncertainty, which may be reflective of the feelings of hopelessness associated with breathlessness.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0269216312464093">6</xref></sup> Clear information about the programme offered at the point of referral may help patients feel more prepared, and they may be reassured from knowing how others have benefitted in the past.</p>
<p>It is difficult to identify the precise intervention components that helped patients, as previous authors have queried.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0269216312464093">14</xref></sup> For many patients, it was a combination of management strategies combined with the person-centred approach of the physiotherapist. Components that were mentioned by participants included deep breathing, using counting to ensure longer out-breaths than in-breaths and applying this to activities, problem solving activities by assessing risk, planning or reducing activities and dropping shoulders to relax. Two individuals commented on the benefit of having a hand-held fan. One of these talked of the exacerbation of breathlessness through environmental factors, such as warm, misty weather or enclosed spaces and how the fan worked in these circumstances. Previous studies have also emphasised the efficacy of this tool for breathless patients across diagnoses.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0269216312464093">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0269216312464093">20</xref></sup></p>
<p>An increased perception of control is a major outcome of the programme. In the context of intrathoracic malignancy, patients are likely to feel little control over their situation and future. Offering ways that they can personally make life better for themselves is vital. Increased self-efficacy has been noted as an important outcome of a breathlessness management service for patients across diagnoses.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0269216312464093">1</xref></sup>. This study shows that patients may command a sense of control in varying ways: regaining control during breathlessness episodes, having a personal role in their symptom management and feeling more in control in the wider illness context. Increased control appeared to be associated with reduced distress from breathlessness.</p>
<p>The programme also had some important social effects. It helped patients maintain some normality in a life-changing situation in terms of social interactions and engaging in daily life. Previous studies have shown a perceived loss of social role.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0269216312464093">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0269216312464093">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>The programme did not incorporate an exercise component, as is the case with other breathlessness management interventions, such as those used in pulmonary rehabilitation for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients. For patients who are more frail and nearing end of life, exercise may not be an appropriate intervention. Despite this, patients reported increased functional ability and endurance, demonstrating how this secondary benefit can be derived from an intervention that focuses on breathing control and activity management.</p>
<p>Patients expressed their uncertainties about the future and in general preferred to focus on the present and avoid knowledge of the future. Previous authors have noted the importance of health professionals acknowledging worries about the future.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0269216312464093">5</xref></sup> This must be done with great sensitivity and consideration of the patient’s desires.</p>
<p>It is important to consider the difficulties that some patients encountered. These were largely associated with changing habits, which requires patients to be motivated and ready to change. In any intervention requiring behavioural change, motivation for this should be discussed at referral to determine appropriateness and continue to be explored and addressed throughout the intervention.</p>
<p>This study gained a personal, in-depth insight into patient experience of an NPBMP, revealing information that cannot be accessed using quantitative methodology. However, less than half of the referrals to the management programme went on to be interviewed. Those patients who died during the process and those who did not wish to be interviewed may have had different needs and experiences of the programme.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section36-0269216312464093">
<title>Limitations</title>
<p>Connors et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0269216312464093">14</xref></sup> questioned whether a non-pharmacological approach is suitable for patients near the end of life. This study was unable to fully address this question; however, participants noted the effort and practice needed to learn the breathing skills and gain benefit. Individuals who have progressing disease and feel unwell and fatigued may not have the energy or concentration to engage well in a self-management approach. These individuals may benefit more from medical interventions aimed at more immediate comfort. Further exploration of this will help in the development of referral protocols and patient care pathways.</p>
<p>This study focuses specifically on the experiences of the patient. However, breathlessness also affects family and carers. It can be terrifying to see a loved one in distress and relatives can feel anxious and helpless.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0269216312464093">1</xref></sup> This may be in part due to the perceived lack of strategies that carers have to deal with in breathlessness and exacerbations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0269216312464093">21</xref></sup> Therefore, carer needs and experiences should be incorporated into the formulation and management programme.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0269216312464093">22</xref></sup></p>
<p>Carers were variably involved in the programme studied in this research. Their level of involvement was determined by the needs of the patient. Some patients were seen alone, others had carers present with varying roles and levels of involvement ranging from playing a key role in teaching patients breathing skills to offering personal reassurance and emotional support. It is important to be respectful of the individual role of carers and their potential needs for support. The impact of breathlessness on carers and relationships<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0269216312464093">6</xref></sup> and the wider constraints that lung cancer can place on spousal communication and emotional and cognitive processing of the disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0269216312464093">23</xref></sup> has been reported. However, there is limited research on the specific needs of carers/relatives/spouses in relation to breathlessness in lung cancer and how they may benefit from interventions. This is a worthy topic of future research attention.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to report on the experiences and benefits of a programme for patients with intrathoracic malignancy using a qualitative method. As well as supporting changes in coping strategies, this physiotherapist-led programme had important effects on patients, improving functional capacity and helping to establish a sense of control and normality. Such effects were due to a combination of breathing control strategies, activity management and physiotherapist factors.</p>
