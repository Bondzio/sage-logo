<p>This article examines bulk sales of municipal property tax liens in the formerly industrial city of Waterbury, Connecticut, USA, in the 1990s, in order to explore the limits and contradictions of neoliberal local governance strategies. In the USA, cities and states create property tax liens by reducing delinquent real estate taxes to a judgment that creates a legal claim against the property at issue. We argue that Waterbury's efforts to resolve its fiscal stress by enhancing short-term revenues ultimately further constrained its revenue base, the tax lien sales reflected a spatial selectivity that created barriers to revitalization when neither the city nor tax lien purchasers had incentives to foreclose on distressed properties in struggling neighborhoods, and the tax lien sales' failure to resolve the city's budget crisis set in motion new efforts at tax base enhancement through real estate-led development in the central business district that also were unsuccessful.</p>

<p>This article examines bulk sales of municipal property tax liens in Waterbury, Connecticut, USA, in the 1990s, in order to understand how city and state officials developed and applied neoliberal governance strategies in declining small cities like Waterbury, and to consider the impacts of those strategies. In the USA, cities and states create property tax liens by reducing delinquent real estate taxes to a judgment that creates a legal claim against the property at issue. This case study illustrates the limits and contradictions of such local governance strategies: Waterbury's efforts to enhance revenues at a time of fiscal crisis ultimately constrained its revenue base; the spatial selectivity of Waterbury's tax lien sales created barriers to revitalization; and the failure of Waterbury's tax lien sales to resolve the city's budget problems encouraged new efforts at tax base enhancement through real estate-led development in the central business district, also unsuccessful.</p>
<p>This case study draws from a range of data and methods. We relied on notes from public meetings; interviews with key stakeholders; public documents; documents, meeting minutes, letters, articles, and memos collected by two neighborhood housing bodies organizing around the tax lien sales in the 1990s; articles in local and regional newspapers; legal documents regarding the transfer of the liens; and tax lien data obtained from the City of Waterbury.</p>
<p>We begin by reviewing the literature on the neoliberal governance of fiscal stress at the local level, primarily through research on public finance and infrastructure privatization. We then provide background on Waterbury and on the sale of tax liens as a governance tool, and a description of how tax lien sales were used in Waterbury, and their impacts. We discuss how tax lien sales in Waterbury exemplify the contradictions of neoliberal governance strategies, highlight their spatial selectivity, and set in motion new rounds of experimentation through growth-led tax base enhancement. We situate Waterbury's use of bulk tax lien sales during the 1990s within the activist and increasingly privatized neoliberal state, implemented through local governments that vary in capacity and inclination.</p>

<sec id="sec2-0269094213485530"><title>Background</title>
<sec id="sec3-0269094213485530"><title>Neoliberal governance of fiscal stress</title>
<p>Neoliberalism became the dominant mode of governance in the US and the UK in the 1980s and 1990s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0269094213485530">Hackworth, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0269094213485530">Lake, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0269094213485530">Peck and Tickell, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0269094213485530">Prasad, 2006</xref>). As a theory it prizes entrepreneurship, free markets, and limited state intervention, with increasing autonomy for state and local governments in the US (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0269094213485530">Harvey, 2005</xref>); in practice it means that cities must compete for public and private resources, and that they have become laboratories for policy experimentation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0269094213485530">Peck et al., 2009</xref>). Researchers have differed in their evaluation of how neoliberalism affects governance at the local level: as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0269094213485530">Lobao and Adua (2011)</xref> describe, one branch of the literature argues that neoliberalism at the national level led to privatization and cost-slashing at all levels of government (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0269094213485530">Harvey, 2005</xref>), whereas another approach emphasizes the need to examine variation shaped by differences in regimes and resources at the local level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0269094213485530">Brenner, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Financialization, in which financial markets and institutions have expanded their reach and facilitated the mobility of capital, has accompanied neoliberal governance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0269094213485530">Clark, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0269094213485530">Fine and Hall, 2010</xref>), as an approach designed to alleviate budget stress and simultaneously create profits for private owners. Finance has replaced trade and commodities, or has become a commodity itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0269094213485530">Krippner, 2005</xref>). In the 1990s, capital markets expanded, investors' interest in urban development increased (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0269094213485530">Hagerman et al., 2007</xref>), and local governments developed new mechanisms in which these investors could participate. The sale of tax liens was one of these mechanisms. Neoliberalism evolved during this period, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0269094213485530">Peck and Tickell (2002</xref>: 37) have noted, shifting from the destruction of the Keynesian state to ‘the purposeful <italic>construction and consolidation</italic> of neoliberalized state forms, modes of governance, and regulatory relations’. Financialization facilitated this evolution by giving local governments the illusion of greater and more flexible resources.</p>
<p>Fiscal crises have tested neoliberalism's limits, and studies considering public finance have explored neoliberal governance of fiscal stress. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0269094213485530">Clark and Walter (1991)</xref> have noted, local governments tend to respond to fiscal stress using two types of strategies: limiting government's direct responsibilities via privatization and workforce reduction; and expanding resources by raising taxes and pursuing economic development. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0269094213485530">Lobao and Adua (2011)</xref>'s analysis of US county governments’ austerity policies between 2001 and 2008 found that government pressures shaped austerity policy responses, and that counties that sold public assets were those that had suffered greater declines in their tax bases. Moreover, they found that counties’ institutional attributes were more important in shaping policy strategies than the local government's inclination towards neoliberalism, in accordance with the ‘state-rescaling’ literature that has argued that local governments, as they take on broader governance functions that previously were the domain of the national state, adapt individually to national neoliberal trends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0269094213485530">Brenner, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0269094213485530">Brenner and Theodore, 2002</xref>). In the US counties studied by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0269094213485530">Lobao and Adua (2011)</xref>, those with stronger administrative infrastructures emphasized increasing government resources and social services, and whereas they tended to outsource services, they also oversaw those services.</p>
<p>More recent work has considered how local governments approach infrastructure needs in the face of fiscal stress. As Kirkpatrick and Smith note in their exploration of ‘back door’ financing strategies employed by California cities, neoliberal governance has meant that ‘cities have ceded many of their infrastructural responsibilities, and a significant amount of authority, to extra-local entities’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0269094213485530">Kirkpatrick and Smith, 2011</xref>: 482). As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0269094213485530">Torrance (2008)</xref> describes, infrastructure privatization also has created an expanded role for private owners – engineering companies and financial institutions – that are geographically distant from the projects that they own, leading to ‘glocal’ governance structures that oversee political and policy decisions with local impacts. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0269094213485530">Torrance (2008</xref>: 5) defines glocal as describing ‘infrastructure assets that are owned by global equity parties, while being mainly locally controlled by public regulators’, which is analogous to the operation of tax lien sales in Waterbury, where tax liabilities became a product like urban infrastructure. This ‘unbundling’ of infrastructure networks happens frequently as a response to fiscal stress: in the case examined by Torrance, a Toronto toll road was privatized shortly before an election so that the existing government could show steps towards achieving a balanced budget.</p>
<p>Some of these modes of neoliberal governance have resulted in financial mechanisms that result in spatial selectivity that generates new forms of uneven development at the local level. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0269094213485530">Jones (1997)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0269094213485530">Gleeson and Low (2000)</xref>, among others, have described, the transformation of local governance entwined with strategic spatial planning has meant that the state selectively privileges certain geographic places, both materially and ideologically, which results in the production and reproduction of uneven development, and ultimately the undermining of the territorial coherence of many cities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0269094213485530">Vigar et al., 2005</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0269094213485530">Jones (1997</xref>: 855) argues that ‘spatial selectivity is both intended as an explicit object of strategy and as an unintended side-effect of strategy’.</p>
<p>This research considering public finance, and, more recently, infrastructure investment, illuminates many of the complexities and contradictions of neoliberal governance. Tax lien sales, however, which are neither privatization nor outsourcing, although the strategy incorporates elements of both, have not been studied in the context of neoliberal governance. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0269094213485530">Gotham's (2006)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0269094213485530">Weber's (2010)</xref> analyses reveal, and our research in Waterbury substantiates, liquidity, globalization, and financialization are not exclusively linked to privatization and a retreat from state involvement in real estate and infrastructure, as some narratives emphasize – instead, the neoliberal state often shapes these transformations, at times more intentionally than others, and at times with greater success than others. The case of Waterbury illustrates the limits of neoliberal governance of fiscal stress at the local level, as the local government transformed the tax debts of individual property owners into negotiable financial instruments and then tried – and failed – to create a new market for these instruments.</p>

<sec id="sec4-0269094213485530"><title>Waterbury, Connecticut, USA</title>
<p>Waterbury's history is a classic story of deindustrialization and its impact. Located in Connecticut's Naugatuck Valley, in the 19th and 20th centuries Waterbury was known as the ‘Brass City’ because of its metal manufacturing mills. In 1960, 51.7% of employed Waterbury residents worked in manufacturing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0269094213485530">Kodrzycki et al., 2009</xref>). Like other industrial cities in the Northeast and Midwest of the United States, the city then lost much of its manufacturing base, and its economy stagnated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0269094213485530">Bluestone and Harrison, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0269094213485530">Mayer and Greenberg, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0269094213485530">Rae, 2005</xref>). The number of jobs in the Naugatuck Valley brass industry fell from 50,000 at its peak, to less than 5000 by 1980. In 1992, <italic>Connecticut Magazine</italic> and <italic>Money Magazine</italic> both awarded Waterbury poor ratings for its quality of life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0269094213485530">Brecher, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0269094213485530">Brecher et al., 1982</xref>). <italic>Forbes</italic> gave it ‘the booby prize’ in its 2008 survey of best places to do business (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0269094213485530">Randall, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>The city became smaller and poorer. Waterbury was the only city in the Central Naugatuck Valley Region to lose population during the 1990s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0269094213485530">Phillips Preiss Shapiro Associates, 2005</xref>). The former industrial Connecticut cities of Hartford and New Haven experienced similar population losses in the last decades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0269094213485530">US Census Bureau, 1990</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0269094213485530">2000</xref>), even as in 2009 Connecticut had the second-highest median household income in the country (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0269094213485530">US Census Bureau, 2009</xref>). Adjusting for inflation, Waterbury's median household income decreased by 16.2% between 1990 and 2000, as Connecticut's median income decreased by only 3.5% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0269094213485530">Phillips Preiss Shapiro Associates, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Waterbury's government has a history of corruption and scandal. Mayor Edward D Bergin Jr was arrested in 1987 for accepting a bribe from a towing contractor. Mayor Joseph Santopietro, who defeated Bergin in 1985, was imprisoned for tax evasion and accepting a bribe during his terms as mayor. Mayor Philip Giordano was sentenced to a 37-year prison term in 2003 for sexual molestation charges; he also admitted receiving bribes. The city also experienced serious fiscal stress: in March 2001, a state-appointed Financial Planning and Assistance Board assumed control of the city's finances, and Waterbury faced a two-year projected deficit of $50m to $60m. In 2008 Mayor Michael Jarjura appointed John Rowland, Connecticut's governor from 1995–2004 and a Waterbury native son, who had recently served a prison term for fraud, as a consultant to the Greater Waterbury Chamber of Commerce (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0269094213485530">Randall, 2008</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-0269094213485530"><title>Property tax liens and tax lien sales</title>
<p>The process of creating property tax liens in the US, when a city or state reduces delinquent property taxes to a judgment, is governed by US state law, and varies somewhat from state to state. Property tax liens have ‘super priority status’, which puts them first in line for payment when a property is sold, often ahead of mortgages that existed before the property's real estate taxes went unpaid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0269094213485530">Alexander, 2000</xref>). When a city or third-party purchaser of a tax lien forecloses on that lien, the foreclosure extinguishes all previous private liens, such as mortgages, and the foreclosing entity takes the property unencumbered. The super priority status thus gives property tax liens high investment potential, particularly when the properties by which they are secured have high values. Additionally, penalties and interest accrue to the investor from the date of its purchase of the lien, and can mean that the total amount owed, particularly in declining neighborhoods, can grow to exceed the value of the property on which the lien is secured (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0269094213485530">Poindexter et al., 1997</xref>).</p>
<p>The ability to transfer property tax liens is distinct from the ability to impose them, and also is governed by state law. Most US states have allowed local governments to transfer liens for delinquent taxes to third parties for some time, but the practice of selling tax liens became prevalent in the US in the 1980s, as federal and state funding to cities was cut, and they sought to enhance revenue without raising property taxes.</p>
<p>US municipalities sell tax liens through three primary mechanisms: auction, in which individual liens are sold; negotiated bulk sale, in which a group of liens is sold as a package, typically for less than the face value of the liens, because the package includes liens that are likely to be collectible and those that are not; and securitization, in which the municipality issues bonds backed by the revenue stream of the liens, and the bonds are repaid as the tax debt is collected. Individual lien auctions have occurred for decades and in some states, for centuries, but bulk sales and securitizations are more recent. Not all states allow bulk sales and securitizations, and securitizations are relatively rare, given their complexity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0269094213485530">Alexander, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0269094213485530">Perine et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0269094213485530">Poindexter et al., 1997</xref>).</p>
<p>Tax lien sales in Waterbury in the 1990s used the negotiated bulk sale method, as well as some individual auctions of liens. Bulk tax lien purchasers assume that they will not be able to collect on all of the liens that they purchase, and will charge homeowners who are unable to pay their liens 18% annual interest on the debt, which is a standard interest rate imposed by states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0269094213485530">Alexander, 2000</xref>). Depending on the structure of the bulk sale, the interest collected goes to the tax lien purchaser, the city, or is divided between the two entities. The tax lien purchaser will tend to foreclose on and sell its most valuable properties, and abandon those for which the accumulated liens plus interest are worth more than the value of the property (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0269094213485530">Alexander, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0269094213485530">Bass P, 2001</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec6-0269094213485530"><title>Tax lien sales in Waterbury<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0269094213485530">1</xref></sup></title>
<p>In 1993, the Connecticut legislature passed legislation allowing municipalities to assign property tax liens to third parties through resolution of their legislative bodies. The statute provides that the municipality and the lien assignee should negotiate the price of the liens, and that the assignee should have the same rights as the municipality would have in terms of ‘the precedence and priority of such lien, the accrual of interest and the fees and expenses of collection’ (PA 93–434; Conn. Ch. 205 Sec. 12–195h). Representative Richard Mulready, who introduced the provision, argued that it would support ‘many municipalities that have delinquent property taxes on their books and are in significant need of cash’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0269094213485530">Rappa, 1994</xref>).</p>
<p>In 1994, with a record $21.4m in delinquent real estate taxes, and facing a large deficit for 1993–1994, Waterbury became the first city in Connecticut to sell its real estate tax liens. It sold bundles of liens that included ‘defective’ and ‘uncollectible’ liens (because the owner was in bankruptcy, or the lien was otherwise unenforceable); under the terms of the sales, the purchaser could ‘swap’ these liens for collectible ones. In August 1994, Waterbury sold a package of 2234 individual liens worth a total of $7.25m ($6m in overdue taxes, $1.2m in interest, and $54,000 in lien fees) for $6.2m to GTL Investments Limited Partnership, based in San Francisco. GTL also acquired the right to accrue 18% annual interest on these liens. In 1995, the city sold additional liens to GTL for a total of $8.1m; their total value turned out to be closer to $13.1m. The city and GTL had a number of transactions during 1995, many of which included ‘swapping’ of liens that GTL claimed were defective, so it is impossible to determine the value of all of the transactions. In 1996, GTL sold all of its liens to First Union Bank, based in New Jersey. In 1996 and 1997, the city sold a total of 3145 liens, with a total value of $6,524,489, to First Union/Capital Asset Research Corporation. It is unclear what First Union paid for these liens. GTL eventually returned $3.5m in ‘defective’ liens, which Capital Asset Research Corporation purchased in August 1997 for $3.17m. The city only sold liens through the 1997 tax rolls, and a few 1999 liens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0269094213485530">Dorr, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0269094213485530">McCormick, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>In 1997, Waterbury also sought to privatize its tax collection, and combined this function with more sales of liens. In August 1997, after Capital Asset Research Corporation was one of two responders to an RFP that Waterbury issued for privatization of its tax collections, the city and Capital executed a contract in which Capital purchased all remaining tax liens for 1982 through 1995. It was later reported that Capital agreed to pay a finder's fee of $531,000 to former state officials who helped to coordinate the sale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0269094213485530">Associated Press, 2001</xref>). In April 1998, the city signed a second contract with Capital for the tax collection function, in which Capital promised the city a 99.25% collection rate on its taxes for Fiscal Years 1997–1998, 1998–1999, and 1999–2000. After entering into this contract with Capital, the city, with the approval of the Connecticut Office of Policy and Management, began to budget a 99.25% tax collection rate, rather than the 93% rate mandated by the city's charter. The actual collection rate, however, remained lower than the amount budgeted. City officials had intended the 6.25% difference in collection rates to add approximately $7m to the city's budget, allowing the mayor to achieve a balanced budget without raising taxes or cutting services, but it was unsuccessful (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0269094213485530">McCormick, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>The city did not expressly provide in its closing agreements that subsequent delinquent taxes and tax liens would maintain first priority, so it appeared that all tax proceeds would need to be paid first to third-party creditors. Since municipal tax liens have first priority, the city and the third-party lien holders hold equal priority. This is not an uncommon problem with tax liens, because laws are not consistent in how they prioritize liens for prior and subsequent years of unpaid taxes, and how they prioritize other public liens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0269094213485530">Alexander, 2000</xref>: 771; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0269094213485530">Poindexter et al., 1997</xref>: 171). Accordingly, in Waterbury, when a property is encumbered with liens from both the city and the third-party creditors, the city cannot foreclose on the property unless it pays the other lien holders what they are due, and third-party creditors cannot foreclose without paying the city what it is owed. It is not unusual for a property to be encumbered with both third-party and municipal liens, because it is unlikely that a delinquent property owner would subsequently begin paying taxes again. This situation creates particular difficulties when the value of the liens exceeds the value of the property, as the two competing lien holders have little incentive to foreclose, since they have no chance of recovering the value of their liens. Neighborhood activists refer to these properties as ‘frozen’.</p>
<p>In 1999, Capital Asset Research Corporation transferred its tax lien contract to Angram Business Services, which filed for bankruptcy in 2000. Waterbury then contracted with TaxServ LLC, based in Virginia, to manage its municipal tax collection. In an attempt to address the problems with properties with competing third-party and municipal liens, the city attempted to negotiate with TaxServ to share revenue where the taxes owed exceeded the value of the property. The negotiations were unsuccessful. The city has not sold any tax liens since 1997, with the exception of a very small number of liens that were sold in 1999. The city and TaxServ have each accused the other of breaching their contract (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0269094213485530">Gambini, 2005</xref>).</p>

<sec id="sec8-0269094213485530"><title>Tax liens in Waterbury: Preventing redevelopment and creating decline</title>
<p>We examined property tax liens in Waterbury held by third parties and by the city. A limitation is that we only have data from the City of Waterbury on liens that existed as of 2007, 10 years after most of the tax lien sales were completed and when we conducted the bulk of our research. The city did not track liens that were sold to third parties in the bulk sales of the 1990s and that were subsequently either resolved through tax collection, or foreclosed upon.</p>
<p>Out of a total of 34,380 properties in the city, 469 properties had third-party liens in 2007, of which 424 also had city liens.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0269094213485530">2</xref></sup> There were 2849 properties with city liens only. Properties with tax liens held by third parties had from one to 15 distinct liens; the total number of distinct third-party liens was 2674; and the median number of third-party liens per property was five. The total dollar amount of third-party liens ranged from $16 to $622,968; the median amount was $4922.</p>
<p>City liens were substantially larger on properties that also had third-party liens. Properties with third-party liens that also had city liens had one to 68 distinct city liens, with a median number of city liens per property of nine, and a total number of city liens of 4089. The aggregate dollar amount of city liens on these properties ranged from $76 to $2,408,722, with a median amount of $8994. Considering all properties with city liens, with or without third-party liens, there was a median number of city liens per property of one, a total number of city liens of 8131, and a median lien amount of $2329.</p>
<p>Waterbury's tax lien sales sought to address the city's fiscal crisis, but did not meet that goal, and instead set in motion new dynamics of decline that will affect the city's future. In neighborhoods with low property values, the combined value of the remaining tax liens often exceeds the value of the properties, particularly given the 18% interest that the lienholder can assess. Lien purchasers bought these liens as part of a bulk sale, so the over-leveraged properties were combined in the sale with more valuable ones. Purchasers already have collected delinquent taxes or foreclosed on the more valuable properties in their portfolios, which could result in profit; remaining properties generally are in poor condition and in distressed neighborhoods. In many cases, because the liens have been through multiple transactions, it is impossible to tell which investor holds the lien on a particular property, and thus who to contact in order to seek a resolution.</p>
<p>The ‘frozen’ properties with competing city and third-party liens are caught in a legal limbo such that organizations seeking to revitalize the neighborhoods where they are clustered are unable to take ownership. They can raise private funds in order to pay off liens, and have had some luck negotiating with the third-party lien holders, but this strategy is inefficient and time-consuming. Neighborhood Housing Services, the primary non-profit housing organization working in Waterbury, has shifted its revitalization strategy and now pursues properties with current taxes, rather than those with delinquencies, where its intervention may be most needed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0269094213485530">Bass C, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>Properties with delinquent tax liens fall into several different categories: some with small delinquencies may have low income or senior citizen homeowners who need assistance preserving their properties; others with large delinquencies may be owned by absentee investors; still other properties may have been abandoned years ago. For individual taxpayers, the sale of tax liens to third-party purchasers means that they face barriers to negotiating payment of their delinquent taxes, as they may not know that the lien was sold, may be unable to identify the new lien holder, and may have lost an opportunity to dispute the amount of the underlying tax delinquency. The city imposed a substantial property tax increase, effective in 2010, so the problem of tax delinquencies is likely to become more severe.</p>

<sec id="sec9-0269094213485530"><title>Tax liens in Waterbury: The limits of neoliberal local governance</title>
<p>The tax lien market's expansion and increasing complexity in the 1990s gave local governments throughout the US the mechanisms to transform an immobile local asset into a liquid one. Waterbury's experience with that market illustrates how the imperatives of financialization, driven by neoliberal governance, can offer hope to unsophisticated leaders of a cash-strapped city, and then leave it worse off than it was before. The tax lien market brought global circuits of capital into marginal neighborhoods, so that even those residents who technically owned their homes ended up as tenants of capital, and the city's real estate market became hostage to the ‘frozen’ properties with liens from both third parties and the city. The city negotiated a deal with Capital, in the form of Capital Asset Research Corporation, one of the lien purchasers; and it simultaneously negotiated a deal with capital in a larger sense, turning the fate of its buildings and residents over to capital as their owner as it ceded its governance responsibilities.</p>
<p>The spatial selectivity of Waterbury's tax lien sales is a clear example of what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0269094213485530">Jones (1997)</xref> labels as a simultaneous object and side-effect of strategy. The nature of tax liens means that those located in struggling neighborhoods tend to be less ‘successful’ for bulk purchasers, and thus are neither foreclosed upon nor collected. Because the liens are bundled into pools that include a mix of more and less valuable liens – in some cities, carefully screened, as in the case of New York City's more recent lien sales (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0269094213485530">Perine et al., 2010</xref>), and sometimes less so, as in Waterbury – poor neighborhoods are more likely to end up with distressed properties held by absentee corporate owners. The object of the tax lien sales is to extract capital from properties with tax delinquencies, and a side-effect is that the neighborhoods where the most distressed properties are concentrated are selectively shut out of development opportunities, because it is too complex and risky for non-profit or for-profit developers to secure ownership of the properties.</p>
<p>Given Waterbury's troubled history, it is tempting to blame a void in leadership for the failure of bulk tax lien sales to address the city's fiscal problems, and their impediments to the city's revitalization. But the choice to allow the bulk sale of tax liens was in itself a governance strategy that reflected the priorities of Connecticut's and Waterbury's leadership, which emphasized growth and the need to attract capital at a time of fiscal stress. Certainly the lack of sophistication among city leaders meant that they did not negotiate sales agreements that were beneficial to the city or its communities in the short or long term, and thus that the implementation of neoliberal governance, at the local level, led to distress both directly and indirectly. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0269094213485530">Lobao and Adua (2011)</xref> found, strong local governments tend to outsource services but also have the capacity to monitor and modify that outsourcing. The Waterbury case study shows how a weak local government cannot maintain such control.</p>
<p>In Waterbury, tax lien sales failed to address the city's fiscal crisis, but this failure then led the city to explore new rounds of experimentation, through the more traditional method of growth-led tax base enhancement via downtown redevelopment. Waterbury officials, working in concert with civic and business leaders, embraced a pro-growth approach to the city's troubles in the early 2000s. The city used eminent domain and public funding to facilitate a $161m downtown redevelopment that included construction of a new University of Connecticut Waterbury campus, and redevelopment of the city's East Main Street (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0269094213485530">Marks, 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0269094213485530">2001a</xref>). The city moved forward with this redevelopment even as it struggled with a substantial budget deficit, with the belief, according to the director of its economic development agency, that ‘these projects will help increase the city's tax base and give people reason to come to an area that is now underutilized’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0269094213485530">Marks, 2001b</xref>). Moreover, much of the redevelopment was financed with state funding, and Connecticut's governor at the time, John Rowland, came from Waterbury. As governance approaches, neither the tax lien sales nor the downtown development were effective ultimately, as they did not consider the broader sources of economic stagnation or multi-pronged strategies to address it.</p>

<sec id="sec10-0269094213485530" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Beginning in the 1990s, tax debt, like mortgage capital in the next decade, became commodified, packaged and sold to the highest bidder, and segmented from the housing and communities where it originated. The speculation and abandonment of the 1970s has been replicated, but on a more attenuated scale, with little to no direct link to the property whose value is the subject of the speculation. Larger Rust Belt cities like Detroit and Cleveland have borne the brunt of disinvestment and foreclosures, and are struggling to address the ensuing abandonment and distress. Smaller cities like Waterbury have garnered less popular and scholarly attention, but illustrate how neoliberal governance, and particularly its local implementation, has not only facilitated decline in a spatially selective manner, but has also undermined efforts to stabilize and revitalize struggling communities.</p>
