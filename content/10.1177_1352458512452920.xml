<title>Objective:</title>

<sec id="section2-1352458512452920">
<title>Methods:</title>
<p>A self-administered questionnaire on reproductive practices was mailed to 13,312 registrants of the North American Research Committee on Multiple Sclerosis (NARCOMS) database who met inclusion criteria for the study.

<title>Results:</title>
<p>Among 5949 participants, the majority of respondents (79.1%) did not become pregnant following diagnosis of MS. Of these, 34.5% cited MS-related reasons for this decision. The most common MS-related reasons were symptoms interfering with parenting (71.2%), followed by concerns of burdening partner (50.7%) and of children inheriting MS (34.7%). The most common reason unrelated to MS for not having children was that they already have a “completed family” (55.6%). Of the 20.9% of participants who decided to become pregnant (or father a pregnancy) following a diagnosis of MS, 49.5% had two or more pregnancies.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Multiple sclerosis (MS) is the most commonly acquired non-traumatic neurological disorder affecting young adults.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1352458512452920">1</xref></sup> Females are affected approximately three times as often as males.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1352458512452920">2</xref></sup> Historically, it was common to have a long lag time (time from the onset of clinical signs and symptoms to clinical diagnosis of MS). As a result, many pregnancies occurred after the onset of MS but before an actual diagnosis was made, and the need for MS-related childbearing considerations was largely unrecognized. Current advances in the diagnostic procedure and revisions of diagnostic criteria to include magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1352458512452920">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1352458512452920"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1352458512452920">5</xref></sup> have reduced the lag time from clinical onset to diagnosis of MS to as short as a few weeks or months. This will be even more evident in the future with the 2010 revised diagnostic criteria<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1352458512452920">4</xref></sup> that allow for MRI changes to be considered evidence for dissemination in either time or space. Therefore, the present MS population is diagnosed at a younger age, usually before or during their childbearing years, which highlights the increasing need of making informed reproductive decisions after diagnosis.</p>
<p>Limited data is available on the safety of many MS treatments during pregnancy and/or breastfeeding; this is especially true for disease-modifying therapies (DMTs),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1352458512452920">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1352458512452920"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1352458512452920"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1352458512452920">9</xref></sup> which are usually offered relatively early in the course of MS, when patients tend to be younger and less disabled and therefore more likely to contemplate a pregnancy.</p>
<p>In general, pregnancy is not contraindicated for women with MS.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1352458512452920">10</xref></sup> Although relapse rates tend to increase in the first three months post-partum, pregnancy does not seem to be a detriment to the long-term progression of MS and gestation seems to have a protective effect on the course of MS, especially during the third trimester.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1352458512452920">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1352458512452920">11</xref></sup> Although previous studies have suggested that multiple pregnancies may be protective in the long-term course of MS,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1352458512452920">12</xref></sup> more recent work (correcting for age of onset) argue against a protective effect and/or a biological role of pregnancy in the etiology of MS.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1352458512452920">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1352458512452920">14</xref></sup> Rates of pregnancy termination and childlessness remain high for women with MS compared to the general population.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1352458512452920">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>Available literature is scant with regard to reproductive practices and the attitude of men and women toward reproduction after being diagnosed with MS. One study investigated the concerns of women with MS at different stages of motherhood and identified main themes to be considered when contemplating reproduction, including the mother’s own health concerns, her ability to cope with parenting and societal attitudes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1352458512452920">16</xref></sup> Another study indicated that the unpredictability of the natural history of MS together with specific concerns about the effect of pregnancy on the clinical course were the two strongest themes that emerged among female MS patients contemplating a pregnancy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1352458512452920">17</xref></sup> However, in both these studies,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1352458512452920">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1352458512452920">17</xref></sup> the sample size was small (<italic>N</italic> ≤ 20) and included only female patients. Recognizing that issues surrounding gestation and delivery do not apply to males with MS, any assessment of reproductive attitudes among the MS population must look at males and females separately. Nonetheless, it should be recognized that males with MS must also make reproductive decisions.</p>
<p>Here we present data on reproductive practices and attitudes of North American males and females who were diagnosed with MS during the past 15 years, a period highlighted by the advent of earlier diagnosis by including MRI findings and the use of DMTs in clinical practice rather than just research trials.</p>

<title>Ascertainment source</title>
<p>MS patients were identified through an international US-based online self-registry, the North American Research Committee on Multiple Sclerosis (NARCOMS). NARCOMS was initiated in 1993 by the Consortium of Multiple Sclerosis Centers (CMSC) to promote and facilitate multi-center clinical and epidemiological research on MS.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1352458512452920">18</xref></sup> NARCOMS is an active patient-driven, self-reported database that includes demographic and clinical information collected semi-annually on more than 35,000 individuals with MS. The majority of registrants live in the United States but some are from Canada and other countries. The diagnostic reliability of NARCOMS has been validated<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1352458512452920">19</xref></sup> but is not as reliable as physician-based diagnostic information for certain types of research, e.g. clinical trials. For this study, the important factor was that the respondent (NARCOMS self-registered MS patient) believes he/she has a diagnosis of MS.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1352458512452920">
<title>Inclusion criteria</title>
<p>Male and female NARCOMS registrants who met the study’s inclusion criteria were identified by NARCOMS personnel in accordance with NARCOMS database research protocol. Inclusion criteria were related to age at the time of diagnosis of MS to reflect gender-specific estimates of reproductive periods. Eligible males and females had to be aged 18–59 and 18–45 at the time of diagnosis, respectively.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1352458512452920">
<title>Questionnaire</title>
<p>A self-administered questionnaire about reproductive decisions and whether these were related to the diagnosis of MS was developed for this study and validated on patients presenting at the University of British Columbia (UBC) MS Clinic (See Appendices 1 and 2). The validated questionnaires were sent out by NARCOMS personnel in accordance with NARCOMS database research protocol to registrants who met the inclusion criteria. The completed questionnaires were then returned by mail to the authors of this paper in an anonymous format. If any identifying information was provided by the respondent, it was discarded prior to data entry and analyses.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1352458512452920">
<title>Statistical analyses</title>
<p>The chi-square (<italic>X</italic><sup>2</sup>) test was used to assess significance when comparing the frequency of two independent samples. The <italic>z</italic>-test was used to compare the means of continuous variables for two independent groups. Bonferroni correction was applied to adjust the significance level for multiple tests. Since there were 35 tests, the significance level, alpha=0.05, was divided by the number of tests being performed. Thus, the adjusted alpha was 0.0014.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1352458512452920">
<title>Ethics approval</title>
<p>This study received ethical approval from the University of British Columbia Clinical Research Ethics Board and was also conducted in accordance with research ethical guidelines governing NARCOMS.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-1352458512452920" sec-type="results">
<title>Results</title>
<p>A total of 13,312 questionnaires were sent to eligible NARCOMS registrants. Of those, 6050 questionnaires were returned to the UBC study center (response rate 45.4%). One hundred and one (1.7%) returned questionnaires were excluded by UBC study personnel because registrants did not meet one or more of the eligibility criteria for the study. Partial data were entered for 489 (8.2%) questionnaires that were returned incomplete (e.g. blank fields or missing pages). The final study size included 5949 participants (4408 females and 1541 males) for a female to male ratio of 2.9 to 1.</p>
<p>Male participants (mean age: 56.7 years, SD: 10.5) were significantly older than female participants (mean age: 49.6 years, SD: 9.2) at the time the questionnaire was completed (<italic>z</italic>= 23.5, <italic>p</italic>&lt; 0.0001). The average age at which males were diagnosed with MS (mean age: 37.9, SD: 9.5) was also significantly older than that of females (mean age: 33.2, SD: 7.0) (<italic>z</italic> = 17.7, <italic>p</italic>&lt; 0.0001).</p>
<p>We felt it important to compare “responders” (questionnaires returned) to “non-responders” (no questionnaire returned) but in accordance with NARCOMS protocol, it was impossible to obtain detailed demographic data on “non-responders.” However, we were able to compare all the eligible NARCOMS registrants who were sent the questionnaires with the study’s subset of survey respondents in terms of gender and current age (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1352458512452920">Table 1</xref>).</p>

<p>There was no significant difference in age of MS diagnosis between male responders and the NARCOMS mailing list cohort for this study (<italic>P</italic>&gt;0.05). In contrast, female survey respondents were significantly younger when diagnosed with MS compared to all females in the mailing list cohort, perhaps reflecting a greater interest in the study topic.</p>
<p>The majority of the NARCOMS registrants in the study cohort were non-Hispanic whites (92.2%), had more than 12 years of education (98.0%), with an annual family income of $30,000 or more (71.4%), although they themselves were unemployed (60.8%) and were married (65.4%) (data not shown).</p>
<p>Among 5949 participants, the majority of respondents (79.1%) did not become pregnant or father a pregnancy. Participants who reported having no pregnancies after being diagnosed with MS were given a list of possible reasons for their decisions and instructed to select “all that apply.” Space was included for respondents to comment on any “other” reasons for their reproductive choices if these were not generated on the questionnaire.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1352458512452920">Table 2a</xref> summarizes MS-related and non-related reasons given for influencing the decision whether to have children after the diagnosis of MS.

<p>“Symptoms interfering with parenting” was the most commonly selected MS-related reason why males (55.0%) and females (75.0%) decided not to have children because of MS.

<p>The most commonly selected non-MS-related reason why all MS patients decided not to have children after receiving a diagnosis of MS was that they had “completed their family prior to the MS diagnosis,” although this was more likely reported by males (62.3%) than females (53.2%), <italic>p</italic>&lt; 0.0001 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1352458512452920">Table 2b</xref>).

<p>A subset analysis was performed for those born after 1970 and diagnosed after 1990 to test whether patients at younger ages who may have been closer to the age of decision making and those who were diagnosed recently and probably benefited from recent knowledge about outcomes and heritability would have similar concerns. The only MS-related reason that remained more significantly reported among females compared to males was worrying about the effect of prescription interactions (see Appendix 3). No significant differences between male and female patients reporting non-MS-related reasons remained with this subset analysis (Appendix 4). Of all respondents, 1244 (20.9%) (962 females and 282 males) have become pregnant or fathered a pregnancy after being diagnosed with MS, with 50.5% having (or fathering) more than one pregnancy. The rates were similar between males and females (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1352458512452920">Table 3</xref>).</p>

<p>Female patients reported that 75.7% of all pregnancies resulted in a live birth compared to 91.6% of pregnancies fathered by a male with MS. The reported rate of miscarriages for MS females (15.1%) was higher than for partners of MS males (2.3%) (Fisher’s exact <italic>p</italic>-value&lt; 0.000). However, the difference was not statistically significant for the reported incidence of stillbirth (Fisher’s exact <italic>p</italic>-value= 0.21) or for the presence of birth defects or other medical conditions (Fisher’s exact <italic>p</italic>-value= 0.10), which were also reported more frequently by female than by male patients. In terms of medication use, male patients were more likely to take DMTs or Mitoxantrone either before or at the time of conception compared to female patients. A minority of male and female patients used an aid(s) for sexual functioning in preparation for reproduction (6.2%). Among female respondents, 7.7% (<italic>N</italic>=131) reported a relapse during pregnancy and of these, 2.7% (<italic>N</italic>=46) received a medication for it. Relapses occurred more frequently postpartum, with 17.8% of females having reported a relapse within the first three months postpartum and 12.7% between four to six months postpartum. The increase in postpartum relapse rates has been reported in earlier studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1352458512452920">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1352458512452920">11</xref></sup></p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This is the first study exploring reproductive attitudes and behavior of males and females after receiving a diagnosis of MS. The majority of MS patients (males and females) chose not to have children following the diagnosis and many “MS-related” and “non-MS-related” factors in the decision making were common across sexes. Female respondents who became pregnant following an MS diagnosis had a higher rate of miscarriages and were also more likely to terminate their pregnancies than female partners of male MS patients. There may, however, be reporting bias for the latter group regarding miscarriages and terminations given that the information was obtained through the male MS patient rather than the female pregnant partner. A minority of female patients reported having a relapse during pregnancy and/or receiving symptom-specific therapy.</p>
<p>Our results showed that patients’ concerns related to MS revolved around fear of (i) inadequate parenting abilities, (ii) passing on MS to a child and (iii) possible risks associated with exposure to medications during pregnancy, especially DMTs. These results were similar to those of previous studies with female-only cohorts.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1352458512452920">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1352458512452920">17</xref></sup></p>
<p>Many of our survey respondents were concerned about MS being inherited by their child. This decision was most probably made in the absence of genetic counseling, a service often overlooked by the MS community. Carefully replicated data show that lifetime risk for the offspring of a parent with MS to develop the disease is 3%–5% in comparison with the 0.2% rate for the general population (i.e. equivalent risk for the general population to have a child with a congenital malformation or handicapping condition recognized by age one).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1352458512452920">20</xref></sup> Recurrence risk estimates can be further refined with additional information about the family including other members with MS, consanguinity among parents, human leukocyte antigen (HLA) type, etc. It should be noted that despite this concern, pregnancy terminations among patients with MS have been shown to usually be for social reasons or due to the mother’s disease course and/or use of DMTs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1352458512452920">20</xref></sup></p>
<p>Many of our respondents expressed concern regarding possible risks associated with exposure to medications during pregnancy, especially DMTs. Only one woman reported taking Methotrexate, an established mutagenic and teratogenic agent that is contraindicated at the time of conception and/or during pregnancy. However, 14% of all pregnancies were reported to have taken DMTs at the time of conception and/or during pregnancy. Data on the safety or risk of DMTs during pregnancy remain limited. Although there is some consensus that beta interferon therapy in the first trimester may pose a slightly elevated risk of spontaneous abortions,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1352458512452920">9</xref></sup> fetal loss and low birth weight,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1352458512452920">6</xref></sup> the most commonly used DMTs today are not associated with teratogenic risks great enough to support the option of pregnancy termination. Each exposure during pregnancy should be evaluated based on the most recent data so that patients may make an informed and accurate decision regarding pregnancy management.</p>
<p>Among male patients, DMTs were more commonly taken (25.5% before conception and 24.5% at time of conception). Even though it is recommended that DMT therapy be stopped when male MS patients start planning a family (or that they freeze sperm), there is limited data on DMT intake among male patients and pregnancy outcome. A recent German report, with its data collected through a nationwide questionnaire,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1352458512452920">21</xref></sup> investigated the clinical outcome of pregnancies fathered by MS patients taking DMT and found no significant reduction in birth weight of newborns from MS fathers taking DMT compared to healthy controls.</p>
<p>The fact that female MS patients who became pregnant reported a lower rate of live births and a higher rate of miscarriages compared to the reported outcome of pregnancies fathered by male patients could be attributed to gender bias reporting.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1352458512452920">22</xref></sup> A tendency of under-reporting miscarriages by male patients is expected, as males are often less aware of their partners’ early pregnancies or miscarriages, compared to females who are more accurate in recalling and reporting their own miscarriages. Previous studies on pregnancy outcome for female MS patients reported no elevation in the risk of miscarriage, stillbirth, infant mortality and/or congenital malformations or other adverse outcomes in comparison to the general population.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1352458512452920">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1352458512452920"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1352458512452920"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1352458512452920">26</xref></sup> It is important to note that our study is an observational one on attitudes of reproduction and not an analytical study where we analyze associations of adverse reproductive outcomes in patients of MS in relation to MS or its treatments. Therefore, we cannot compare our findings of the rates reported of obstetrical complications to those of other analytical studies or present an issue of bias. Also, our survey respondents are asked about whether their pregnancy resulted in a birth defect or other medical conditions, so the patients may have reported cases of major and minor malformations as well as other conditions that may not have been necessarily classified as malformations; and therefore, a reported rate of 10.1% among females in this “general category” of birth defects may not be considered higher than that encountered in the general population.</p>
<p>Our study benefits from its large population size covering a random sample of the US MS population. A major limitation of the NARCOMS database is the self-reporting of the MS diagnosis. However, the validity of such reports have been investigated and supported.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1352458512452920">19</xref></sup> We were also unable to define the geographic location of the respondents, as the information was not available. This would have been useful in determining whether registrants from different states may have responded differently to some of the questions, or whether our sample was geographically dispersed enough to be generalized to the US MS population. Although we had only a 45% participation rate, we were able to confirm that the group of patients who responded was a relative representation of all NARCOMS registrants in terms of age. Our study also lacked information on the subtypes of MS the patients reported being diagnosed with, disease duration, disease severity or estimated disability scores, which could have influenced the patients’ reproductive decision making. These characteristics were not asked in the questionnaire because there would be no clinician input, as per NARCOMS protocol of self-registration.</p>
<p>Given that approximately 80% of our respondents reported no pregnancy following diagnosis suggests that MS patients’ reproductive concerns remain largely unaddressed by health care professionals. Prunty et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1352458512452920">15</xref></sup> carried out a randomized controlled trial to evaluate a decision aid for women with MS considering whether to enlarge their families. Their decision aid provided general background information about MS, its types and prognosis, along with psychosocial impacts of MS on lifestyle factors related to pregnancy and parenting. Their results showed increased knowledge about MS, higher efficacy and certainty and decreased decisional conflict in women who received the decision aid compared to those in the control group.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1352458512452920">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>The decision whether to have a child when one (or both) parent(s) has MS is complex. Accurate and up-to-date information on various reproductive topics must be considered and thoroughly discussed by the MS patient, his/her partner and their health care provider to allow for a fully informed decision-making process. These topics include, but are not limited to: the effects of pregnancy on MS symptoms and disease course, the effects of MS on pregnancy outcome, possible teratogenic effects of MS treatments (including DMTs), MS recurrence risks and psychosocial considerations such as financial and family support and parenting capabilities.</p>
<p>Even though the majority of patients in this study did not become pregnant following an MS diagnosis, only about one third cited MS-related reasons for their decision. Our study indicates that pregnancy remains to be considered for many MS patients. However, future studies characterizing MS duration or severity could add more input to reproductive decision making among MS patients.</p>
