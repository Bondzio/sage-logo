<abstract>
<p>A previous report explored the impact of a brief (four session) acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) intervention as compared with treatment as usual (TAU) on rehospitalization over 4 months in a sample of 80 inpatients with psychosis. The present study extended the follow-up period to 1 year and used a more sophisticated survival analysis to take previous hospitalization and length of the current hospitalization into account. Those in the ACT condition showed reduced hospitalization as compared to those in TAU at 4 months post discharge and again at 1 year post discharge. A test of proportionality of hazard showed that survival curves continued to diverge in the 5- to 12-month postdischarge period after adjusting for differences in the 0 to 4 month period. Future directions are discussed.</p>

<body>
<p>Serious mental illnesses are costly to the individual and to society. The social, health, and financial costs of schizophrenia in particular are extremely high (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0145445511427193">Knapp, Mangalore, &amp; Simon, 2004</xref>, for a recent meta-analysis of such studies). Treatment adherence, relapse, and inpatient admission are three elements that make an especially large contribution to the economic cost of schizophrenia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0145445511427193">Knapp, 2005</xref>). Developing and disseminating efficacious and cost-effective interventions for these problems that can be widely disseminated is imperative.</p>
<p>Although antipsychotic medication is generally the first line of treatment, many patients do not take medication as prescribed, whether as a reasoned choice or as a consequence of cognitive impairment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0145445511427193">Bellack, 2006</xref>). Among those who do take medications as prescribed, many continue to experience residual positive and negative symptoms, complain of significant side effects, and fail to show improvements in social functioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0145445511427193">Pfammatter, Junghan, &amp; Brenner, 2006</xref>). There is compelling evidence that outcomes are improved when psychosocial interventions are combined with medication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0145445511427193">Lehman et al., 2004</xref>). The schizophrenia Patient Outcomes Research Team (PORT) has specifically recommended that “Persons with schizophrenia who have persistent psychotic symptoms while receiving adequate pharmacotherapy should be offered adjunctive cognitive behaviorally oriented psychotherapy to reduce the severity of symptoms” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0145445511427193">Dixon et al., 2010</xref>, p. 52).</p>
<p>There have been several recent outcome studies on the effectiveness of cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) for schizophrenia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0145445511427193">Kuipers et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0145445511427193">Mueser et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0145445511427193">Tarrier &amp; Wykes, 2004</xref>). CBT has been shown to be useful in preventing those with prodromal or subthreshold symptoms from progressing to a full-blown psychotic state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0145445511427193">Kuipers et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0145445511427193">Turkington, Kingdon, &amp; Weiden, 2006</xref>), to treat early schizophrenia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0145445511427193">Naeem, Kingdon, &amp; Turkington, 2008</xref>), and to deal with treatment resistant patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0145445511427193">Turkington et al., 2006</xref>) among other areas.</p>
<p>Acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0145445511427193">Hayes, Strosahl, &amp; Wilson, 1999</xref>) is a contextual form of CBT that utilizes six core processes aimed at increasing psychological flexibility. ACT attempts to build greater psychological openness with unwanted thoughts and feelings that are unlikely to be amenable to direct change strategies (e.g., residual symptoms of schizophrenia), to increase perspective taking skills, and to increase value directed action even in the presence of difficult or entangling private experiences. Since the publication of the first investigation of the effectiveness of ACT as a treatment for psychosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0145445511427193">Bach &amp; Hayes, 2002</xref>), there has been increased interest in ACT and slow but steady progress in developing the psychological flexibility model as applied to serious mental illnesses. The original outcome study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0145445511427193">Bach &amp; Hayes, 2002</xref>) found an impact on rehospitalization through 4 months of follow-up using survival analysis. A smaller replication using somewhat stronger controls by another research team (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0145445511427193">Gaudiano &amp; Herbert, 2006</xref>) found benefits on the psychotic symptoms evident in a clinical interview and other measures. An open trial suggested that ACT can usefully be delivered in a group therapy format to persons experiencing symptoms of psychosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0145445511427193">Morris &amp; Oliver, 2008</xref>). Assessment devices specific to a psychological flexibility model of psychosis have been developed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0145445511427193">Shawyer et al., 2007</xref>), and several psychopathology studies have demonstrated the importance of experiential avoidance and perspective taking to psychotic phenomena (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0145445511427193">Fliss &amp; Bach, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0145445511427193">Udachina et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0145445511427193">Villatte, Monestes, McHugh, Freixa i Baque, &amp; Loas, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>One area where there is an immediate need for more information is regarding the long-term impact of contextual CBT methods for psychosis. A primary aim of the present study was to report 1 year follow-up results for the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0145445511427193">Bach and Hayes (2002)</xref> study. If this intervention maintained effects longer than 4 months, it would lend support to the idea that ACT may be able to be developed into a useful approach for psychotic disorders.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<p>The methodological details of the present trial can be found in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0145445511427193">Bach and Hayes (2002)</xref>. More attention is given in the present report to characterizing the sample and the institutional context, and describing the actual sessions in this intervention.</p>
<p>Inpatients at a Nevada state psychiatric facility based in Reno were recruited to be participants. Reno is a small city surrounded by rural areas with minimal public mental health facilities; the nearest city with a public psychiatric hospital (Sacramento, California) is more than 100 miles away and the nearest public hospital in Nevada is 450 miles away. The trial was set up to take advantage of this circumstance: Given the limited alternatives, public records of hospitalization maintained by the mental health institute housing the project serve as useful data on the impact of treatment.</p>
<p>Inclusion criteria were that the participant was experiencing auditory hallucinations or delusions at the time of their admission and would be receiving outpatient treatment at the facility following their discharge from the inpatient unit. Potential participants were excluded if given a diagnosis of substance-induced psychosis; if their symptoms occurred as part of a dementia, delirium, or medical condition, or if they had a diagnosis of mental retardation on Axis II of the <italic>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</italic> (4th ed., <italic>DSM-IV</italic>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0145445511427193">American Psychiatric Association, 1994</xref>). Potential participants were asked to participate as soon as their condition was stable enough to allow them to understand what was being asked of them.</p>
<p>Because the primary data of interest was public records of rehospitalization, individuals who would not be receiving outpatient treatment at the mental health institute on discharge were excluded. This exclusion group consisted primarily of individuals who lived out of state, or in distant rural areas within the state, or who were being discharged to another locale.</p>
<p>Inpatients at the psychiatric facility (<italic>N</italic> = 87) were recruited for the study. Seven participants were discharged from the inpatient unit before they could be randomized and begin treatment, leaving 80 participants who were randomized to receive the ACT intervention or treatment as usual (TAU).</p>
<p>In the original report, 10 of the 80 randomized participants were not included in the results. One participant in each arm of the study was incarcerated in correctional facilities and the ethics review committee prohibited collection of post data; 1 participant in TAU committed suicide while 1 in the ACT condition died under ambiguous conditions—being hit by a vehicle on a freeway. Three ACT participants and 2 TAU participants relocated out of the area, making it impossible to track their rehospitalization, and 1 TAU participant was in town but no longer willing to be in contact with the hospital. This participant was included in the present report however, because hospitalization data were available. Participant characteristics for the 71 patients are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0145445511427193">Table 1</xref>.</p>

<title>Procedure</title>
<p>All participants received medication and generally participated in three or more weekly or twice weekly psychoeducational groups. Assignments to these psychoeducational groups were made by an interdisciplinary treatment team on the basis of the participants’ diagnosis and symptoms. All groups were run by a licensed clinical psychologist, licensed clinical social worker, or registered nurse. Participants who remained in the inpatient unit for more than a few days also participated in individual psychotherapy sessions with a psychologist or psychology trainee at least once a week. After discharge, TAU generally consisted of case management services and monthly meetings with a psychiatrist for medication management or assertive community treatment and/or psychosocial rehabilitation. Approximately half of the participants (<italic>n</italic> = 21 TAU and 20 ACT) participated in psychosocial rehabilitation and/or assertive community treatment after discharge.</p>
<p>In addition to this TAU, ACT participants received four sessions of individual ACT intervention provided by one of the authors (P.B.), each lasting 45 min. These four sessions will be described in some detail.</p>
<p>The first session took place within around 72 hr of the participant consenting to participate in the experiment. First, the purpose of the experiment was explained and informed consent was obtained. The treatment began with an exploration of the participant’s previous approaches to coping with symptoms of psychosis, how successful the approaches were, and what the consequences of the approaches were. The therapist then suggested that the problem was not symptoms per se but how one responds to them. Participants were encouraged to describe how they tend to respond to their symptoms. The session then shifted to discussion of the believability of the thoughts or symptom content, that is, the extent to which one believes the content of a thought describes reality. The client was then taught a few strategies for observing and defusing from their thoughts, and to notice that they can have symptoms without acting on them or trying to change them. The importance of treatment adherence was also raised, and the participant was invited to discuss how it might be related to goal attainment.</p>
<p>The second session was held within 72 hr of the first session and began with a review of the first session. Participants were then invited to describe their specific symptoms in detail, including the content, when they tended to occur and not to occur, and how distressing they were. A discussion of how the participant typically coped with symptoms was held to identify avoidant coping strategies. The workability of these strategies was discussed and if the participant reported that strategies “work” because they alleviate symptoms, other negative consequences such as hospitalizations, legal problems, difficulty maintaining relationships, housing, or employment were examined. The therapist then led a discussion about the futility of attempts to control unwanted thoughts. The therapist presented the option of letting go of this struggle, using a metaphor in which struggle to control thoughts was likened to a game of tug of war with a monster, where the only way to end the struggle was to drop the rope (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0145445511427193">Hayes et al., 1999</xref>), rather than to struggle harder. This allowed the participant to consider the possibility of new ways of behaving in relation to his or her symptoms.</p>
<p>The concept of accepting one’s symptoms even though one may not like them was discussed; doing what one wants to or what the mind tells one to do versus doing what works. The notion that acceptance of the need for treatment may give them more options in life was emphasized. Client objections to this notion were addressed.</p>
<p>The third session was held within 3 to 5 days of the second session and began with a review of previous material. The third session focused further on the notion of accepting symptoms rather than trying to rid oneself of them and on defusing from symptom content. The therapist recommended the participant use an ACT verbal convention to aid in recognizing that thoughts, even if experienced as powerful or as outside voices, are merely thoughts that may or may not correspond to reality. The participant was invited to describe the consequences of accepting their specific symptom without trying to change it or act on the content versus the consequences of past attempts to change or act on symptom content. The participant was asked about his or her specific goals and most frequently reported goals of having a relationship with a significant other, being employed, and living independently. The participant was asked to explore how past attempts to control symptoms may have interfered with the attainment of their goals. The therapist then lead a discussion about acceptance as increasing willingness to do what was in one’s best interest, and that what action was in one’s best interest depended on the context or situation, and that thought content often does not dictate what action one should take. The participant was assisted in generating new strategies for managing symptoms focusing on activities that address the process rather than content. Strategies often included activities such as talking to someone, making an appointment with a mental health worker, or practicing coping skills. The participant was reminded that the purpose of such activities was not to decrease the frequency of symptoms but to aid participants in temporarily carrying out daily activities in spite of the occurrence of symptoms.</p>
<p>The fourth and final session was held within 72 hr of the client’s discharge from the inpatient unit. In most cases, this session was just prior to discharge; however, in some cases, when the hospitalization was brief, this session was held at the outpatient unit of the same facility in the first 72 hr after discharge. In the final session, the concepts described in the first three sessions were reviewed. The emphasis was on the continuity of symptoms with normal private events, acceptance of symptoms and distinguishing the process from the content, distancing from private events, and successful working toward the attainment of individual goals. The participant’s goals and new strategies for managing symptoms were reviewed.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0145445511427193">
<title>Rehospitalization Data</title>
<p>The data in the present report consist of system records regarding rehospitalization. The number of days from the previous hospitalization until the current hospitalization was taken from patient charts. Patient’s oral reports of hospitalization elsewhere was not considered reliable, and thus a conservative approach seemed to be to include in the primary analysis only those patients who were part of the mental health institute system during the previous year. Five patients in the TAU condition and two in the ACT condition did not have reliable data regarding previous hospitalization and thus were excluded, yielding 64 patients in the primary analysis of 1 year outcomes.</p>
<p>On discharge, the length of the current hospitalization was recorded. After discharge, with the assistance of facility staff and the case workers assigned to specific cases, participant rehospitalization was monitored from patient charts and was double checked against weekly reports by the institute of new admissions. The status of each participant who was not rehospitalized was tracked with case managers at 60, 90, 120, 180, 270, and 365 days post discharge. In the absence of hospital admission, those known to be living in the area and participating in outpatient care were recorded as out of the hospital (in no cases were patients known by case workers to be admitted to private hospitals while under care). Those who had moved away or were no longer maintaining contact were recorded as missing during the year after discharge from the inpatient unit. In a supplementary intent to treat analysis, these patients were included under the assumption they were not hospitalized.</p>
<p>It should also be noted that the original report provided documentation that medication compliance did not differ significantly between conditions during inpatient care. At the end of follow-up (at 4 months), 69% of ACT participants and 77% of TAU participants reported complying with their medication regimen; these reports were checked against collateral reports such as injection records or laboratory reports when available (as they were in about 40% of the cases) and were shown to be accurate in 82% of the cases. All inaccuracies were in the direction of overestimation of compliance. Furthermore, information on medication compliance after 4 months post discharge was not collected, but to that point any differences in outcomes favoring the ACT condition could not be explained by medication compliance.</p>

<sec id="section5-0145445511427193">
<title>Primary Data Analytic Strategy</title>
<p>Data were transformed as needed to fit with analytic assumptions. A Cox regression was the primary method used to evaluate the differential impact of treatment condition over and above the predictive value of the length of time to the previous hospitalization assessed during the year preceding the current admission, and the length of hospitalization during the current admission. Cox regression is a semiparametric method of survival analysis that is used to estimate the relative risk ratios or hazard rates of an outcome controlling for the time at risk and any covariates entered into the model. Cox regression analysis produces an exponent, Exp(β), that describes the change in outcome rate (in this case, hospitalization during the year following current admission) for each unit change in the particular predictor variable.</p>
<p>Two types of Cox regression analyses were conducted. The primary analyses compared postdischarge hospitalization rates for each condition, controlling for the time to the previous hospitalization and length of the current hospitalization. Analyses were conducted at 120 days post discharge (replicating the original analysis in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0145445511427193">Bach &amp; Hayes, 2002</xref>, but with the addition of time to previous hospitalization and length of current hospitalization as covariates) and at 365 days post discharge. In these analyses, Exp(β) for treatment condition is the ratio of the estimated hazard for a participant in TAU as compared to a participant receiving ACT. An Exp(β) value of 1 would indicate equal risk.</p>
<p>The Cox regression model assumes proportional hazard, meaning that the failure rate ratios are relatively constant across the range of time; a second type of Cox regression analysis was conducted to test if this assumption was warranted. The second analysis examined whether relative rehospitalization rates continued to diverge throughout the rest of the year after accounting for the differences found at 4 months of follow-up. This analysis was conducted by using sum to zero coding for two categorical variables covering Day 0 to Day 119 post discharge (termed <italic>early readmission</italic>) and Day 120 to Day 365 post discharge (termed <italic>late or no readmission</italic>). In the early readmission period, day of readmission to the hospital was coded 1 or −1 depending on treatment condition and 0 if there was no readmission. This was repeated for the late or no readmission period except values were coded for those with readmission or no admission, and 0 for those admitted in the early period. Values of 365 (i.e., no readmission throughout the year) were treated as censored values. Missing values were treated as missing. Because of the sum to zero coding, any significant effect for early readmission, or for late or no readmission, as categorical variables in the regression model is a treatment condition difference during that period indicating continuing divergence of the survival curves.</p>

<sec id="section6-0145445511427193">
<title>Relation of Past and Current Hospitalization to Postdischarge Hospitalization</title>
<p>A Kaplan–Meier survival analysis showed that hospitalization outcomes were not significantly different among the 64 participants with reliable data on the time to the previous hospitalization and the 7 without it (<italic>p</italic> &gt; .34). The time to the previous hospitalization correlated Spearman’s <italic>r</italic>(64) = .40, <italic>p</italic> = .001 with time to hospitalization at 120 days post discharge and Spearman’s <italic>r</italic>(50) = .58, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001 with time to hospitalization at 365 days post discharge, indicating the importance of using previous hospitalization as a factor in the evaluation of treatment outcomes. The length of current hospitalization was available for all analyzed participants; with 3 extreme outliers removed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0145445511427193">Tukey, 1977</xref>), there were no significant differences between conditions in length of time hospitalized during the current hospitalization, <italic>t</italic>(64) = −1.55, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .13. Length of current hospitalization did not correlate significantly with time to hospitalization at 120 days post discharge (<italic>p</italic> &gt; .2) overall or in either arm of the study, but in the TAU condition, there was a trend toward such a relationship at 1 year post discharge, <italic>r</italic>(28) = .33, <italic>p</italic> = .09, indicating the need to control for length of current hospitalization in evaluating outcomes.</p>

<p>The first analysis replicated the survival analysis reported in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0145445511427193">Bach and Hayes (2002)</xref> but with the addition of the time to previous hospitalization and length of the current hospitalization as covariates. The Cox regression analysis showed a significant effect for the previous hospitalization covariate, β = −.006, <italic>SE</italic> = .002, Wald = 6.21, Exp(β) = .994, <italic>p</italic> = .013; a nonsignificant effect for the current hospitalization covariate, β = −.327, <italic>SE</italic> = .403, Wald = .659, Exp(β) = 1.387, <italic>p</italic> = .42; and a significant effect for treatment condition, β = 1.19, <italic>SE</italic> = .524, Wald = 5.17, Exp(β) = 3.29, <italic>p</italic> = .023. This value corresponds to a 229% hazard rate increase in the TAU condition as compared to the ACT condition over the 4 months post discharge, after adjusting for the covariates.</p>

<title>Outcomes at 1 Year Post Discharge</title>
<p>The second Cox regression analyzed whether the treatment impact on relative rehospitalization rate was maintained at 1 year post discharge, using the same time to previous hospitalization and length of current hospitalization covariates. This was the primary analysis in the present study. Postdischarge hospitalization data for 1 year were available for 51 of the 64 participants (80%) with previous hospitalization information. A survival plot is presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0145445511427193">Figure 1</xref>. The Cox regression analysis showed a significant effect for the previous hospitalization covariate, β = −.008, <italic>SE</italic> = .002, Wald = 15.56, Exp(β) = .992, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001; a nonsignificant effect for the current hospitalization covariate, β = .507, <italic>SE</italic> = .361, Wald = 1.97, Exp(β) = 1.66, <italic>p</italic> = .16; and a significant effect for treatment condition, β = 1.26, <italic>SE</italic> = .428, Wald = 8.71, Exp(β) = 3.54, <italic>p</italic> = .003. This value corresponds to a 254% hazard rate increase in the TAU condition as compared to the ACT condition over the 1 year post discharge, after adjusting for the covariates.</p>

<title>Testing the Assumption of Proportional Hazard Before and After 4-Month Follow-Up</title>
<p>The proportional hazard assumption was examined by assessing whether the relative hazard ratio of the two treatment conditions continued to diverge during the last 8 months of the follow-up after adjusting for the covariates and accounting for the treatment effects observed during the first 4 months of follow-up. The analysis of the first 4 months of data was identical to the 120-day analysis described earlier except that only those 51 participants who had 1 year post discharge data were examined so that the first 4 months of response could be subtracted. As would be expected, 4 month treatment effects were virtually identical as those reported early, β = 1.21, <italic>SE</italic> = .479, Wald = 6.39, Exp(β) = 3.36, <italic>p</italic> = .012. After accounting for these effects at 120 days, there was a significant further impact of treatment condition in Days 120 through 365 post discharge period, β = .481, <italic>SE</italic> = .242, Wald = 3.95, Exp(β) = 1.62, <italic>p</italic> = .047, indicating that the survival differences were not just maintained but continued to diverge between the two treatments during the final 8 months of follow-up. Both legs of the analysis were then formally compared, yielding a nonsignificant difference (Wald = 1.21, <italic>p</italic> = .27). So although the treatment effect estimates were descriptively different in the two phases, as indicated by our different estimated hazard ratios, there was not sufficient evidence to conclude that the magnitude of the treatment effects in the two phases were different. Taken together, the significant treatment effects in both legs and the lack of a significant difference between them indicated that the assumption needed for use of Cox regression was met.</p>

<title>Impact Without Missing Data</title>
<p>To examine the impact of ACT on hospitalization with all participants included, whether they moved away or had previous hospitalization information, a final Cox regression analysis was conducted on all 80 original participants, recording dates of death as hospitalizations and using multiple imputation through expectation-maximization (SPSS V. 18) of all missing data (dates to previous hospitalization, length of current hospitalization, and days to hospitalization 1 year post discharge). Five imputed complete data sets were analyzed. This final, full intent to treat analysis of 1-year postdischarge outcomes was significant—pooled β = .678, <italic>SE</italic> = .305, Wald = 5.67, Exp(β) = 1.97, Exp(β) = 95% confidence interval [1.08-3.59], <italic>p</italic> = .027—and corresponded to a 97% hazard rate increase in the TAU condition as compared to the ACT condition over the 1 year post discharge, after adjusting for the covariates.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>These results provide incremental evidence that ACT may be developed into an effective intervention for persons with serious mental illnesses. Both the early trials of ACT for psychosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0145445511427193">Bach &amp; Hayes, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0145445511427193">Gaudiano &amp; Herbert, 2006</xref>) were designed as “proof of concept” studies with extraordinarily brief treatment input (four and three sessions, respectively) and limited outcome targets. The present study focused on hospitalization alone and extended the 4-month follow-up findings of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0145445511427193">Bach and Hayes (2002)</xref>. As compared to TAU, participation in ACT was associated with reduced rehospitalization at 1 year post discharge for inpatients with psychotic disorders and mood disorders with psychotic features after controlling the length of previous and current hospitalization. A replication by another research group with mostly racial and ethnic minority patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0145445511427193">Gaudiano &amp; Herbert, 2006</xref>) showed a significant drop in scores on the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale as compared to a TAU group, suggesting decreased psychiatric symptoms. What the present study adds is evidence that some of the effects of these early pilot studies of ACT for psychosis may be relatively long-lasting.</p>
<p>Although medication is almost always indicated for persons with persistent psychosis, there is a convincing, and growing, body of evidence that treatment outcomes are improved when medication is combined with psychosocial interventions such as motivational interventions, family interventions, cognitive remediation, or CBT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0145445511427193">Lewis, Tarrier, &amp; Drake, 2005</xref>). ACT is part of CBT writ large and most CBT interventions for psychosis are fairly extensive, averaging about 14 sessions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0145445511427193">Gould, Mueser, Bolton, Mays, &amp; Goff, 2004</xref>). Some empirically supported approaches require up to 9 months of weekly individual or group meetings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0145445511427193">Mueser et al., 2006</xref>). These interventions often target broad outcomes not yet addressed in the ACT literature on psychosis such as skills acquisition and employment.</p>
<p>ACT could be included in such broad packages, especially if its core messages (e.g., to learn to create watch symptoms without psychological avoidance; to focus on values) could be integrated with the set of methods delivered. There may also be a role for very brief stand-alone interventions when longer interventions are impossible. Several ACT interventions reported in literature are as brief as what was used in the present study while still producing significant and long-lasting treatment outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0145445511427193">Hayes, Luoma, Bond, Masuda, &amp; Lillis, 2006</xref>). ACT can be done in longer formats, however, and thus another approach would be to examine the impact of ACT for psychosis with a more extensive protocol. The protocol development and piloting work for that approach is underway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0145445511427193">Morris &amp; Oliver, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>It is both a weakness and a strength of the study that the data consisted of a system measure of rehospitalization. On the negative side, rehospitalization is determined by environmental, economic, legal, and housing issues that are not under the control of patients, and thus is a blunt measure of treatment impact. On the more positive side, rehospitalization is known to relate to psychiatric severity and treatment adherence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0145445511427193">Mitchell &amp; Selmes, 2007</xref>) and is systemically important because of cost. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0145445511427193">Marcus and Olfson (2008)</xref> estimated the annual cost of hospital admissions in the United States for persons with schizophrenia alone at US$806 million. Medicare costs of inpatient psychiatric hospitalization in 2010 were estimated at US$651 per day (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0145445511427193">National Government Services, 2009</xref>); even a small reduction in rates of rehospitalization can add up to significant savings.</p>
<p>The present study used system data only, eschewing all forms of self-report. Use of system data is made possible by the financial and physical isolation of Reno, Nevada: There are no other affordable or readily available treatment options for the patients in the present study. In most other locations, systemic data could be far less complete in the absence of state or region-wide tracking systems. It is a weakness that this approach led to some missing data, although a full intent to treat analysis using multiple imputations was still significant. Also because medication compliance was recorded from self-report, there is no additional information on compliance after 4 months post discharge because the formal study was completed and only systemic records were available. These were too limited to enable examination of medication compliance after 4 months post discharge, and it is possible that medication compliance could have changed in the 4 to 12 month period in the present study.</p>
<p>The actual model by which ACT impacts psychosis is still a bit unclear. Recent work on psychosis specific measures of experiential avoidance has shown that its focus on hallucinations appears to have toxic effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0145445511427193">Shawyer et al., 2007</xref>), as it leads to the development of paranoia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0145445511427193">Udachina et al., 2009</xref>) and delusions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0145445511427193">Goldstone, Farhall, &amp; Ong, 2011</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0145445511427193">Gaudiano, Herbert, and Hayes (2010)</xref> recently found that the decreased believability of symptoms mediated reductions in hallucination distress in their original study, suggesting that cognitive defusion may be a particularly important pathway of change in ACT for psychosis. It is not known if this applies to hospitalization per se. More work needs to be done on these questions as well as examining a broader range of ACT relevant processes such as experiential avoidance, perspective taking, and values.</p>
<p>It is important not to overstate the current evidence of ACT for psychosis. The studies so far were small and psychotic populations are diverse. The possibility of Type 1 errors in existing data sets exist. Although larger randomized trials are needed, it is also important to take the time to go through processes of pilot testing and treatment development as early proof of concept studies are applied in practical settings. It seems quite possible, for example, that the basic acceptance and values-based message of ACT could be integrated into a recovery model (see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0145445511427193">Bellack, 2006</xref>), but learning how to do so will require a careful step by step process of treatment development. Nevertheless, although the exact model is still unclear and outcome data are preliminary, the present study provides incremental evidence that contextual CBT approaches such as ACT may provide new ways to think about psychotic symptoms and assist those suffering with them.</p>
