<abstract>
<p>Selective inhibitors of cathepsin K, which has a major role in the degradation of bone collagen, are potential new treatments for osteoporosis. The pharmacokinetics and the pharmacodynamic effects on biochemical markers of bone turnover of the new cathepsin K inhibitor, ONO-5334, were investigated in a multiple ascending dose, phase 1 study. A total of 120 healthy postmenopausal women were enrolled, and doses of 10 to 600 mg once daily and 50 and 300 mg twice daily were evaluated in 15- and 28-day multiple-dosing cohorts. Plasma ONO-5334 concentration reached steady state within 2 days. Twenty-four hours after the last dose in the 15-day multiple-dose cohort, 100, 300, and 600 mg once daily reduced urinary C-terminal telopeptide of type I collagen by a mean (± standard deviation) 44.9% ± 13.6%, 84.5% ± 4.4%, and 92.5% ± 1.3%, respectively. The 28-day cohort showed similar effects. There were far smaller effects on bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (B-ALP), tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase 5b (TRAP5b), or osteocalcin (OC) (measured after 28 days). ONO-5334 was well tolerated up to 600 mg/d and for up to 28 days of multiple dosing. Multiple dosing with ONO-5334 100 mg resulted in considerable suppression of bone resorption markers with no appreciable effects on bone formation markers (B-ALP, OC) or osteoclast number (TRAP5b).</p>

<body>
<p>Cathepsin K is a member of the papain cysteine proteinase superfamily and has a critical role in the bone resorption process.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0091270011399080">1</xref></sup> Cathepsin K is highly expressed in osteoclasts and is excreted into the resorption lacunae beneath the ruffled border of the osteoclast, where it degrades the organic matrix of bone. The major organic components of bone and cartilage, collagen types I and II, are degraded by cathepsin K. Peptides of cathepsin K–mediated type I collagen degradation, C-terminal telopeptide of type I collagen (CTX) and N-terminal telopeptide of type I collagen (NTX), have been used as biochemical markers to assess bone resorption status and efficacy of medications for bone metabolic diseases.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0091270011399080">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>Humans who lack cathepsin K exhibit pycnodysostosis, which is characterized by osteosclerosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0091270011399080">3</xref></sup> Cathepsin K–deficient mice show osteopetrosis and display features characteristic of pycnodysostosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0091270011399080">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0091270011399080">5</xref></sup> Given this knowledge, specific inhibitors of cathepsin K potentially could provide a new therapeutic option for diseases that have elevated bone resorption, such as osteoporosis.</p>
<p>Although no cathepsin K inhibitor is available on the market, some have been or are being developed for osteoporosis or bone metastasis, such as balicatib, relacatib, and odanacatib. Of these, only odanacatib remains in clinical development (post phase 1). Efficacy on bone mineral density in postmenopausal women with low bone density has been demonstrated with balicatib and odanacatib.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0091270011399080">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0091270011399080">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>ONO-5334 (N-((1S)-3-{(2Z)-2-[(4R)-3,4-Dimethyl -1,3-thiazolidin-2-ylidene]hydrazino}-2,3-dioxo-1-(tetrahydro-2H-pyran-4-yl)propyl)cycloheptanecarboxamide) (Ono Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., Osaka, Japan) is a low-molecular-weight synthetic inhibitor of cathepsin K and is being developed as an oral therapeutic agent for bone metabolic diseases, including osteoporosis. ONO-5334 has shown potent and selective inhibition of cathepsin K in vitro and has demonstrated improvements in both bone mineral density and bone strength in the ovariectomized monkey osteoporosis model.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0091270011399080">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0091270011399080">11</xref></sup> We conducted a phase 1 multiple-dose study to investigate the effect of ONO-5334 on a variety of established biochemical markers of bone turnover as well as its pharmacokinetics, safety, and tolerability in healthy postmenopausal women.</p>

<title>Study Design</title>
<p>A total of 120 postmenopausal females were enrolled in the study, having given written informed consent. The study was approved by the local ethics committee. Subjects had to be aged 45 to 75 years with body mass index (BMI) between 19 and 32 kg/m<sup>2</sup>. Subjects were excluded if they had any relevant medical history, including osteoporosis, severe allergic reaction, or drug or alcohol abuse, or if they had other clinically significant abnormalities at screening. Subjects were also excluded if they had smoked within the last 6 months, drank more than 14 units of alcohol per week, or had received prescription drugs within 28 days prior to dosing (St John’s wort within 6 weeks), nonprescription drugs within 28 days prior to dosing, or over-the-counter drugs within 48 hours unless such drugs were deemed necessary by the principal investigator and did not interfere with study procedures or subjects’ safety. Strenuous exercise, caffeine, and alcohol were prohibited for 48 hours prior to study start and during the study.</p>
<p>At screening, health status was determined by prestudy medical history, physical examination, vital signs, 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG), continuous ECG monitoring, BMI assessment, and routine clinical laboratory tests, including tests for drugs of abuse. Postmenopausal was defined as being amenorrheic for more than 1 year if older than 50 years and more than 2 years if 45 to 50 years with an appropriate clinical profile and confirmed at screening by estradiol and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) levels consistent with menopause (FSH &gt;30 IU/L, estradiol &lt;92 pmol/L).</p>
<p>Following confirmation of eligibility and on entry into the study on admission, subjects were randomly assigned to ONO-5334 or placebo. There were 8 dose groups in the 15-day cohort and 2 dose groups in the 28-day cohort. Each dose group had a total of 12 subjects, 9 for ONO-5334 and 3 for placebo.</p>
<p>As a rationale for the doses used, in a single ascending dose study, ONO-5334 was generally well tolerated and found to be safe when administered in single oral doses from 3 to 600 mg to healthy postmenopausal women.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0091270011399080">12</xref></sup> The current study was undertaken to evaluate the effect of repeated dosing of ONO-5334 on pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics, safety, and tolerability up to a total daily dose of 600 mg. The twice-daily treatment groups were chosen to compare the efficacy and safety profile of 2 different dose regimens (with 100-mg and 600-mg total daily dose) because the outcome may suggest development of a sustained-release formulation. For an effect to be observed on bone formation, longer treatment is expected; therefore, the study duration was extended to 28 days in 2 dose groups, 100 and 600 mg once daily.</p>
<p>Standard safety assessments were performed throughout the study including vital signs, physical examination, 12-lead ECG, continuous ECG Holter monitoring, hematology, biochemistry, urinalysis, and adverse event monitoring.</p>
<sec id="section3-0091270011399080">
<title>Fifteen-day multiple-dosing cohort</title>
<p>We assessed 10-, 30-, 50-, 100-, 300-, and 600-mg once-daily treatment and 50- and 300-mg twice-daily treatment. Subjects received ONO-5334 or placebo 30 minutes after a standardized breakfast with approximately 200 mL of water. In the twice-daily groups, the evening dose was provided 30 minutes after dinner, 12 hours after a morning dose. In all dose groups, subjects were followed for 48 hours after the first morning administration (day 1) without further dosing in order to assess the PK. After this follow-up, subjects were dosed for 14 consecutive days (days 3-16) according to the treatment assigned. In the twice-daily group, dosing was completed with the morning dose on the last day (day 16). This study design was intended to investigate possible effect of repeated dosing on PK by comparing those profiles between the first and the last dosing. Subjects were admitted to the study unit on the day before the first dosing and were followed for 72 hours after the last dosing before being discharged. A follow-up visit was arranged for each subject 5 to 7 days after the last dose.</p>
<p>PK blood sampling was performed on the first (day 1) and last (day 16) day of administration at baseline (before dosing) and at 15 minutes, 30 minutes, and 1, 1.5, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24, 36, and 48 hours after dosing (48 hours: before morning administration on day 3). To evaluate steady-state PK, predose (trough) PK samples were obtained on days 5, 7, and 9 (before the morning administration) and days 3, 5, 7, and 9 (before the evening administration for the twice-daily regimen group).</p>
<p>To assess the effect of ONO-5334 on bone resorption, serum and urine were collected. Serum CTX and serum NTX were assessed at baseline and at 4, 8, 11, and 24 hours after administration on days 1 and 16. Predose (trough) levels were assessed on days 3, 5, 7, and 9 and again at the follow-up visit (5-7 days post treatment). Urine from the second morning void was obtained prior to morning administration on days 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 9, 16, 17, and 18 and at the follow-up visit (5-7 days post treatment).</p>

<sec id="section4-0091270011399080">
<title>Twenty-eight-day multiple-dosing cohort</title>
<p>We assessed 100- and 600-mg once-daily treatment. Subjects received ONO-5334 or placebo 30 minutes after a standardized breakfast with approximately 200 mL of water. A dosing design similar to that received by the 15-day cohort was selected, that is, 1 morning dose (day 1) with 48-hour assessment followed by 27 days of consecutive daily doses (days 3-29). Subjects were admitted to the study unit on the day before the first dosing and remained until day 16, after which time they were discharged. Subjects were readmitted to the unit on the day before the last dosing. After the last dosing, subjects were followed up for 72 hours in the unit. A follow-up visit was arranged for each subject 5 to 7 days after the last dose.</p>
<p>Blood samples (7.5 mL) were collected for PK analysis on the first day (day 1) and the last day (day 29) of administration at the same times as described for the 15-day cohort. Trough (predose) samples were also obtained on days 9, 16, 23, and 29 (baseline for the last dosing). The plasma samples obtained were divided into 3 sample tubes and stored at −20°C.</p>
<p>Serum markers of bone turnover were assessed at baseline and days 9, 16, 23, and 29 (predose levels). Urine from the second morning void was obtained prior to morning administration on days 1, 2, 3, 9, 16, 23, and 29.</p>
<p>This study was conducted at Kendle International B.V., Clinical Pharmacology Unit (the Netherlands).</p>

<sec id="section5-0091270011399080">
<title>Analysis</title>
<p>Clinical laboratory tests were conducted at Eurofins Medinet BV (the Netherlands). Plasma ONO-5334 assays were performed by Sumika Chemical Analysis Service, Ltd (Sumika, Japan).</p>
<p>Plasma concentrations of ONO-5334 were determined by a validated liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectroscopy method with a lower limit of quantification of 0.02 ng/mL. ONO-5334 was extracted from plasma samples using a solid-phase extraction column followed by quantification. The precision of the ONO-5334 assay was less than 15% (coefficient of variation), and the accuracy of the assay was within 15% of the actual value for ONO-5334.</p>
<p>To investigate the effect of ONO-5334 on biochemical markers of bone turnover, we assessed serum and urinary CTX (CrossLaps enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay [ELISA], Nordic Bioscience Diagnostics A/S, Herlev, Denmark), serum and urinary NTX (Osteomark NTX diagnostic kit OsteoMark Wampole Laboratories, Princeton, USA), and deoxypyridinoline (DPD) (ELISA Quidel UK Limited, Hannover, Germany) in both cohorts (15 and 28 days). In the 28-day cohort, procollagen type I intact N-terminal propeptide (PINP) (Orion Diagnostica UniQ PINP RIA Orion Diagnostica, Espoo, Finland), bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (B-ALP) (Metra BAP immunoassay kit Quidel UK Limited, Marburg, Germany), osteocalcine (OC) (Metra Osteocalcin EIA kit Quidel UK Limited, Hannover, Germany), and tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase isoform 5b (TRAP5b) (METRA TRAP5b Enzyme immunoassay Quidel UK Limited, Hannover, Germany) were assessed. Assays were performed by Charles River Laboratories (Edinburgh, United Kingdom).</p>
<p>PK analysis was performed by Ono Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. using WinNonlin 4.0.1 software (Pharsight Corp, Mountain View, California). Maximum concentration (C<sub>max</sub>; ng/mL), time to C<sub>max</sub> (t<sub>max</sub>; hours), area under the concentration–time curve to the last measurement (AUC<sub>last</sub>; ng*h/mL), AUC to infinity (AUC<sub>inf</sub>; ng*h/mL), and half-life (t<sub>1/2</sub>; hours), were calculated for ONO-5334. Observed accumulation factors (R<sub>obs</sub>) with 95% confidence interval (CI) and predicted accumulation factors (R) were calculated for C<sub>max</sub> and AUCτ. AUCτ indicates AUC<sub>0-24h</sub> for once daily treatment and AUC<sub>0-12h</sub> for twice daily treatment, respectively. R<sub>obs</sub> was calculated as the ratio of geometric mean dividing AUCτ or C<sub>max</sub> obtained after the last administration by the value obtained after the first administration. R was calculated as the ratio of the predicted PK parameter determined after the last administration, divided by the value obtained after the first administration. The predicted PK parameters after the first and last administration were calculated from the plasma concentration–time profile predicted from the actual mean plasma concentration–time profile after the first administration using the 2-compartment model.</p>
<p>For bone turnover markers, the percentage change from baseline was summarized using descriptive statistics for each treatment and time point. Urinary markers were corrected for creatinine. Any values below the limit of quantification (BLQ) were assigned the BLQ value for the assay (BLQs: serum CTX &lt;0.173 µg/L, urinary CTX &lt;99 µg/L, urinary NTX &lt;20 nM bone collagen equivalent [BCE], urinary DPD &lt;15 nmol/L).</p>
<p>An analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was performed for serum CTX, serum NTX, urinary CTX, and urinary NTX at day 16 (before dosing) for the 15-day multiple-dosing cohort and for PINP, B-ALP, OC, and TRAP5b at day 29 (before dosing) for the 28-day multiple-dosing cohort. This ANCOVA was not a prespecified analysis but was performed after review of the data to gain an understanding of statistically significant differences versus placebo after multiple dosing.</p>
<p>For each dose of ONO-5334, the log-transformed percentage change from baseline was compared with log-transformed percentage change from baseline for placebo using ANCOVA with treatment as a fixed effect and baseline value as a covariate. <italic>P</italic> values were calculated, and no adjustments were applied to the type I error to account for multiple treatment comparisons for this exploratory analysis. All tests were 2-tailed and performed at the 5% significance level.</p>
<p>Safety analyses of the study population were summarized by treatment with descriptive statistics and frequency tables. A treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) was defined as an adverse event that occurred or worsened after the first investigational product intake.</p>

Serum markers of bone resorption were suppressed quickly (at least within 4 hours), and the maximum effect was observed mainly within 8 hours after dosing (except for 600 mg once daily on serum NTX, where the maximum suppression occurred at 11 hours after dosing). Twenty-four hours after single-dose administration, 100, 300, and 600 mg of ONO-5334 reduced urinary CTX by 1.7% ± 23.2% (n = 9), 63.0% ± 6.2% (n = 8), and 86.4% ± 2.5% (n = 9) and urinary NTX by 19.2% ± 5.8% (n = 9), 48.7% ± 5.3% (n = 9), and 72.6% ± 4.2% (n = 8), respectively (mean ± standard error).</p>

After multiple dosing, sustained reduction of both serum CTX and serum NTX was observed at doses of more than 100 mg. With the high doses, 300 and 600 mg, suppression of serum CTX and serum NTX was maintained throughout the study period; even at the follow-up visit (5-7 days after the last dose), levels had not returned completely to baseline. Twenty-four hours after the last dose, 100, 300, and 600 mg of ONO-5334 reduced urinary CTX by 44.9% ± 13.6%, 84.5% ± 4.4%, and 92.5% ± 1.3% and urinary NTX by 38.0% ± 4.7%, 67.0% ± 6.2%, and 84.4% ± 2.1%, respectively. There was no apparent suppression of serum markers of bone resorption with 50 mg once daily or lower. There seemed to be a more variable and inconsistent dose–response effect on urine markers at 50 mg once daily.</p>

<title>Safety Assessments</title>
<p>In the 15-day multiple-dosing cohorts, the incidence of subjects reporting at least 1 TEAE was between 56% (300 mg once daily) and 100% (placebo twice daily, 50 mg twice daily, and 100 mg once daily) across the treatment groups. The most commonly reported TEAEs were within the nervous system disorders, general disorders and administration site conditions, musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders, and gastrointestinal disorders system organ classes (SOCs) and occurred evenly throughout the whole dose range including placebo. Thirty-four subjects across all treatment groups reported 61 headaches with no evidence of any dose relationship. Twenty-two hot flushes were reported by 15 subjects, the majority of which occurred in the 10-mg dose group. Twenty subjects across all treatment groups except the 100-mg once-daily group reported 1 incidence each of catheter site–related reaction, and 15 subjects from a number of treatment groups who received up to 100 mg of ONO-5334 in a day reported 19 episodes of back pain. Nausea was the most frequently reported adverse event in the gastrointestinal disorders SOC and accounted for 9 reports from 7 subjects, again from the lower dose groups. Only 2 subjects experienced vomiting, both in the placebo group.</p>
<p>In the 28-day multiple-dosing cohorts, the most commonly reported adverse events were within the gastrointestinal disorders, general and administration site conditions, nervous system disorders, skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders, and musculoskeletal disorders SOCs and occurred in all treatment groups including placebo. A total of 15 headaches were reported by 7 subjects, of which 11 were reported by 4 subjects who received 600 mg of ONO-5334 once daily, suggesting an increased incidence on the highest dose level. Flatulence was reported on 7 occasions by 7 subjects, but these subjects were all receiving either placebo or the 100-mg dose of ONO-5334 once daily, suggesting no dose relationship. There were 5 reports of skin reaction to ECG/telemetry patches by 5 subjects, and again none of these subjects received the 600-mg dose of ONO-5334. No other adverse event was reported by more than 3 subjects (12.5%) across the total study population. More subjects reported musculoskeletal events in the 600-mg group, but the nature of these events varied.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>During multiple dosing of ONO-5334, the predicted plasma concentration–time profiles during multiple dosing, simulated from PK data of single doses, were visually similar to the plasma concentrations observed at all doses. The observed accumulation factors for C<sub>max</sub> and AUC were not substantially different from the predicted accumulation factors for all doses and length of treatment. Plasma concentrations of ONO-5334 rapidly reached steady state, and the trough concentration remained almost unchanged from the second day of dosing. From these findings, we concluded that there was no accumulation of ONO-5334 or any evidence to show that ONO-5334 plasma concentrations can be reduced with repeated dosing.</p>
<p>A single dose of at least 100 mg of ONO-5334 showed consistent suppression of the bone resorption markers serum CTX and serum NTX. The effect appeared maximal between 8 and 11 hours after dosing regardless of dose (in general). ONO-5334 doses of 300 and 600 mg continued to suppress serum CTX and serum NTX for at least 24 hours after treatment.</p>
<p>At the end of the follow-up period (5-7 days after 15 days of multiple dosing), the suppressive effect of 300 mg and 600 mg of ONO-5334 remained (eg, 56.1% on urinary CTX and 50.2% on urinary NTX, respectively). This may suggest that higher doses of ONO-5334 could be used as once-weekly medication.</p>
<p>A similar but smaller dose suppression response on DPD was observed (compared with urinary CTX and NTX), and there was no reliable suppression of DPD at the follow-up visit. Whether these differences in effect on bone resorption markers are specific to the mechanism of action or ONO-5334 metabolism is unknown.</p>
<p>Fracture risk reduction is the ultimate goal of osteoporosis prevention and treatment. This may be achievable through an increase in bone mineral density and suppression of bone resorption markers. CTX and NTX are recognized markers of bone resorption and are used to evaluate osteoporosis treatment. Bisphosphonates show a characteristic bone resorption profile with these markers. In this study, ONO-5334 suppressed serum CTX and urinary NTX by approximately 60% to 80% compared with baseline. Recently, the cathepsin K inhibitor odanacatib showed a similar suppression on these markers (approximately 60%) and clear increases in bone mineral density.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0091270011399080">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0091270011399080">13</xref></sup> Marketed antiresorptive agents, such as bisphosphonates and denosumab, suppress these markers with similar magnitude by approximately 60% to 70%,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0091270011399080">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0091270011399080">16</xref></sup> and although it is too early to confirm an effect on fracture risk reduction for ONO-5334, the suppression of CTX and NTX shows potential antiresorptive efficacy.</p>
<p>There may be a difference in dosing regimen, highlighted by the observation that 50 mg twice daily consistently showed greater suppression of bone resorption markers compared with 100 mg once daily. Although there was no difference between 300 mg twice daily and 600 mg once daily, it may be that maximal suppression was already achieved and thus differences attributable to dose regimen may not be apparent at higher doses. However, this suggests that the use of a sustained-release formulation that can keep higher trough concentration for 24 hours may be of interest (at certain doses) for further development of ONO-5334.</p>
<p>There were no apparent effects on TRAP5b levels during 28 days of multiple treatment, indicating that osteoclast number is not affected by ONO-5334.</p>
<p>In contrast to the clear suppressive effects of ONO-5334 on bone resorption, there were far smaller changes during 28 days of multiple dosing in the bone formation markers PINP, B-ALP, and OC. However, changes in PINP with 600 mg of ONO-5334 once daily may suggest a slight suppression in bone formation with high doses. It is difficult to conclude what effect ONO-5334 has on bone formation markers since this short-term study may not be sufficiently long to show a change in bone formation, especially considering the complex biochemical interaction between osteoclasts and osteoblasts. No dynamic histomorphometry data are available for ONO-5334 on measures such as osteoclast number or activation frequency to confirm any effect on bone formation. However, the cathepsin K inhibitor odanacatib has shown an increase in BMD without reducing bone formation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0091270011399080">17</xref></sup> In a monkey ovariectomized model, Yamada et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0091270011399080">18</xref></sup> showed that ONO-5334 significantly prevented the increase in bone formation and bone resorption markers due to ovariectomy with a corresponding increase in BMD.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0091270011399080">18</xref></sup> The magnitude of effect on bone resorption markers was far greater compared with bone formation markers. Tanaka et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0091270011399080">19</xref></sup> reported that ONO-5334 increases cortical thickness and bone mass and considered that these effects may be attributable to the fact that ONO-5334 exerted no significant effect on bone formation while suppressing bone resorption at cortical surfaces. Given that currently available antiresorptive agents clearly suppress both bone formation and bone resorption<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0091270011399080">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0091270011399080">16</xref></sup> and considering the lack of effect on these formation markers in our study, assessment with longer term treatment is of interest to explore ONO-5334’s mode of action on bone remodeling further in humans.</p>
<p>In conclusion, ONO-5334 was generally well tolerated up to a dose of 600 mg/d for 28 days. Plasma ONO-5334 concentration reached steady state after 2 days of administration and provided fast onset of pharmacodynamic effects on bone resorption markers and a sustained suppression 5 to 7 days after dosing with high doses. The magnitude of effect of ONO-5334 on bone resorption markers suggests that ONO-5334 may show potential as an antiresorptive agent in the treatment of osteoporosis, but unlike traditional antiresorptive agents like bisphosphonates, ONO-5334 (depending on dose) may show little or no effect on bone formation. Although effective in treating osteoporosis, bisphosphonates are known to suppress bone formation, and hence bone turnover is reduced. Whether reducing bone turnover for many years gives rise to complications such as atypical fractures of the femur is a cause for concern.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0091270011399080">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0091270011399080">21</xref></sup> New treatments for osteoporosis are therefore still of interest.</p>
