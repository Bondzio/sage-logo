<p>Describing capitalism as a “structural genocide” might strike conservative thinkers as typical leftist hyperbole. But many genocide scholars themselves have recently asked whether iniquitous economic systems might represent instances of structural violence. For example, Adam Jones, known for his work on genocide studies, has examined such cases as global poverty, privatization, state corruption, and regimes of sanction and embargo as worthy of greater investigation under the rubric of genocide studies; he even suggests that the modern world’s inability to tackle the problem of genocide stems from a failure to recognize the part played by institutional violence. Garry Leech’s <italic>Capitalism: A Structural Genocide</italic>, therefore, lies within a growing mainstream of current thought among those who take seriously the myriad problems currently facing humanity.</p>
<p>Leech’s thesis is that “social injustice and inequality are inherent in capitalism, and the resulting structural violence constitutes … a class-based structural genocide that targets the poor,” such that capitalism “should not be viewed as a legitimate system under which to organize society” (p. 7). The author opens with a survey of the literature defining structural violence and the varying definitions of genocide in currency before proceeding to examine the logic of capital. According to this logic, “society exists to serve the economy, rather than the reverse,” and “individual and property rights prioritized under liberal democracy—and enforced by the rule of law—do not ensure freedom for all people, but rather maintain the conditions of inequality under which some individuals are free to exploit others” (pp. 26, 27).</p>
<p>As he later notes, the emphasis upon the human rights of the individual belies a hostility toward collective rights, both social and economic. To reinforce these claims, Leech offers several present-day case studies of capitalism as genocide: 1) the forced displacement of agricultural workers in Mexico due to that country being flooded with subsidized American agricultural goods, thanks to NAFTA; 2) the dramatic rise in suicides among farmers in India who see death as the only way to escape from a cycle of debt promoted by the neoliberal restructuring of the national economy; 3) the ongoing exploitation of sub-Saharan Africa, where agricultural land is dominated by crops for export while millions starve locally because “[c]apitalist logic requires that food be distributed to those who can … purchase as much as their gluttonous appetites desire” (p. 67); and 4) global climate change, which constitutes “structural genocide against future generations” (p. 93).</p>
<p>How has such a system as capitalism been allowed to emerge triumphant in a post–Cold War world as <italic>the</italic> legitimate means for ordering economy and society? The usual suspects raise their heads here: the education system, the corporate media, the military-industrial complex, and even the role of private philanthropy, whereby the wealthy “promote charity as the solution to the structural violence inherent in the very system they used to get rich, thereby suggesting that equality and sustainability can be achieved under capitalism” (p. 102). Because capitalism itself cannot be reformed, being inherently violent, Leech advocates for the socialist alternative, surveying the advances (albeit imperfect) in social and economic equality brought about in such nations as Venezuela, Cuba, and Bolivia, which have turned to socialism after long experience with early colonialism and later “free market” exploitation.</p>
<p>Nearly short enough to be read in one sitting, but so powerful that its arguments will survive the ages, Leech’s <italic>Capitalism: A Structural Genocide</italic> proves itself anything but an exemplar of hyperbole. Instead, this book constitutes a measured and scholarly analysis that convincingly illustrates the exterminationist nature of an economic system whose primary products are poverty and pain. It is also an impassioned defense of true democracy, for “participatory democracy cannot exist as long as people lack a meaningful voice in the economic sphere of their lives” (p. 117). By identifying the structural evils of capitalism, Leech gives us hope that they can be dismantled before it is too late.</p>
