<p>Governments around the globe are currently developing new and inclusive social policies to benefit their older adult population. Virtually every nation in the world is facing the rather difficult task of implementing social policies and programs that will sustain or improve the quality of life of their older adults, with special emphasis given to policies related to the health care domain. There is much to learn about the way other countries are approaching this issue. However, there has been a dearth of literature available from these countries successfully comparing and contrasting aging social policies among them. This was until Robbyn R. Wacker and Karen A. Roberto, whose research in aging issues spans almost three decades, assigned themselves the task of researching these policies and documenting them in a single volume.</p>
<p><italic>Aging Social Policies: An International Perspective</italic> is intended for use in college courses addressing aging, social, and public policies at the introductory level. As stated, its purpose is ‘to describe US aging social policy alongside a select sampling of other countries’ aging social policies…’ (p. vii). Some of these countries include the United Kingdom, Canada, India, Spain, Brazil, Japan, Netherlands, Australia, Italy, Sweden and France, among a handful of others. It is important to note that not every country is represented in every chapter, which could be a major drawback for some readers.</p>
<p>The book is organized into 11 chapters and divided into three parts. Chapters one and two in the first part address the aggregate context of aging social policies, introducing the reader to the demographics of aging around the world and to a discussion of the policymaking process. Part two comprises chapters three through nine. This part is the core of the book, where the reader can compare and contrast US aging social policies to their equivalents in three to five other countries. The authors discuss policies of retirement income, employment, housing, health care, mental health, community support and family caregiving. Each policy takes up one chapter and is explained briefly for the US, as well as for its counterpart in other countries.</p>
<p>The way the information is presented in each of the chapters makes it easier for the reader to analyze, as each country has its own section and the authors avoided giving their own interpretation of whether a specific policy of any country could be better than that of others. Throughout the chapters the reader will find text boxes with policy-to-people links, mostly extending information of country-specific programs for older adults, organizations, and services, as well as a web link for future access. At the end of each chapter the reader will find additional resources for further exploration and a transcription of an interview with an older adult, further connecting the policy-person link.</p>
<p>The third part is a summary of the authors’ approach to analyzing and comparing the different aging social policies, as well as a discussion of future challenges governments around the world will probably face as the phenomenon of population aging evolves. The authors address how the social contract and ‘locus of responsibility’ affect a universalistic approach in which social policies are directed. The revolving motion of aging social policies is discussed as we face the challenge of an ever-graying population that, as portrayed in the media, will upset the ‘stability’ the system. This part may be of specific interest for social work practitioners in the social policy development and evaluation arenas and for social work researchers who may want to further contribute to the field.</p>
<p>The authors’ successful attempt to connect the macro and micro (policy-person link) in analyzing aging social policy is a particular characteristic of the book that makes it memorable. First, in chapter one the authors introduce us to the case study of Luciana, which the reader can use as an analysis tool in understanding how her life might have been different depending on what part of the world she might have lived in. Social work practitioners will find end-of-chapter interviews very helpful in understanding how everything exposed in the text, the whole macro component on aging social policies, affects the lives of older adults and their family members somewhere in this world. I believe this to be the essence of the book: it emphasizes how social policies have an impact on individual lives.</p>
<p>Overall, the book serves its purpose of describing an international spectrum of aging social policies. Those who only need an introduction to these policies will be pleased and will also benefit greatly from this publication. Those readers who were expecting an in-depth analysis of every policy for every country would be disappointed. The book will be useful for a wide array of professionals in gerontology, social work and related fields as it pertains to the analysis of aging social policies. It is also useful to expand our views and scrutinize whether the policies we have in place right now are indeed the best set of policies we can implement, compared to what other countries are doing, while evaluating their strengths and shortcomings.</p>
