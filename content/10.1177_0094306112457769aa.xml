<p>Most of the now voluminous literature on the recent financial crisis explores the proximate causes of the crisis, taking a narrow slice through the complex, concatenating events that pushed the U.S. economy over the abyss in 2008 and 2009. Jeff Madrick’s unwieldy, entertaining, and ultimately illuminating history of the crisis is different. Madrick’s account is wide-ranging, searching out the longer-term causes of the crisis in the rise of a free market ideology and the associated deregulation of the U.S. economy in the period since the 1970s. Both of these developments were important, Madrick suggests, in giving free reign to greed. Like most economists, Madrick sees greed (or more blandly, self-interest) as deeply ingrained in human nature; unlike most economists, he bemoans the weakening of social institutions that could restrain this destructive impulse. Untrammeled greed resulted not only in a financial cataclysm, but less dramatically (although perhaps with a greater human cost) in the gradual reorientation of the American economy away from manufacturing to increasingly wasteful speculative activities that Madrick believes have hollowed out American prosperity over several decades.</p>
<p>There is no single villain in this well-told tale, but the central conceit of the book is that the “age of greed” was not the result of inevitable (read structural) forces but rather “made by people” (or rather <italic>men</italic>, since all of Madrick’s protagonists are men) (p. x). Accordingly, Madrick organizes his analysis around a series of miniature biographies of key figures of the age of greed. We are presented with the usual suspects—Milton Friedman, Jimmy Carter, Paul Volcker, and Ronald Reagan all make dutiful appearances—as well as introduced to some lesser known figures such as Lewis Uhler, Joe Flom, and Tom Peters. If the compelling personal stories of these figures make for an accessible, if scattershot, narrative, they also make it somewhat challenging to follow the central analytic threads of Madrick’s account. Like a novel written from the perspective of multiple narrators, the story line feels a bit disjointed, and tends to overwhelm Madrick’s simple thesis. As Madrick himself acknowledges, many of his protagonists were not motivated primarily by pecuniary gain: Volcker was famous for his cheap suits, Carter was a champion of austerity, and even Reagan was a moralist who celebrated American self-sufficiency rather than naked self-interest.</p>
<p>Notably, the structural factors that Madrick wishes to sideline also have a way of creeping back into his narrative, although typically as background rather than foreground: there is the inflation crisis, declining productivity in the economy, the oil shocks and the lagging stock market of the 1970s. It is difficult to assess the relative importance of these various developments against the factors that Madrick is more centrally concerned with in <italic>The Age of Greed</italic>: was it the inflation crisis that doomed financial regulation, or Milton Friedman’s ideological assault on regulated capitalism? More to the point, how did structural change in the U.S. economy create conditions propitious for the ideological revolution that Madrick so ably describes? Unfortunately, Madrick’s analysis does not provide many tools for sorting out what is essential from what is merely incidental in his comprehensive account.</p>
<p>Ironically, my own nomination for the central protagonist in Madrick’s story is not any of the various individuals chronicled, but an <italic>institution</italic>, the takeover market. Two of the most illuminating chapters in the book (on takeover artist Joe Flom and General Electric Chief Executive Officer Jack Welch, respectively) detail the evolution of the hostile takeover market and its consequences for the growing orientation of the American economy to financial activities (an account consistent with work by economic sociologists such as Gerald Davis, Neil Fligstein, Wendy Espeland, Paul Hirsch, and Frank Dobbin, among others). As Madrick explains, a low stock price relative to the value of a corporation’s real assets invites other firms to obtain these assets at bargain prices through a takeover bid. Anti-trust laws initially afforded firms some degree of protection from hostile takeovers, but once the Reagan administration relaxed enforcement of anti-trust laws in the early 1980s, it was hunt or be hunted. In this predatory environment, executives had little choice but to cater to the stock market in order to increase their share price and obtain some degree of protection from takeover attempts. Madrick’s account convincingly shows the effect of these dynamics on General Electric, the quintessential manufacturing firm turned bank.</p>
<p>Madrick has a gift for clear exposition of complex topics, and <italic>The Age of Greed</italic> serves as a useful primer on many of the most important developments shaping our economy in the period since the 1970s. If <italic>The Age of Greed</italic> raises more questions than it answers, these are very important questions, and Madrick’s accessible and compelling book offers a good place to begin engaging with them.</p>
