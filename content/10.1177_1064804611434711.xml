<p>In response to requests for a link between research and practice, we have launched an EID Web page that incorporates a blog and provides an opportunity for HF/E professionals to exchange ideas.</p>

<p>Welcome to the first issue of our 20th anniversary volume! I have the privilege to thank those who pioneered <italic>Ergonomics in Design</italic> and the many people who supported the journal through the years. Thanks are certainly due to the past editors for their time and commitment: Norman Schwalm, Daryle Jean Gardner-Bonneau, John Shafer, John (Jeff) Kelley, and Melody Carswell. A thank-you also goes to the many Editorial Board members and occasional reviewers who have evaluated the articles of their peers to help make this publication technically accurate and reliable for, and interesting to, our audience. In addition, <italic>EID</italic> would not have become so successful without those who submit articles - thank you.</p>
<p>To mark our 20th anniversary, <italic>EID</italic> has an exciting year ahead. You may notice this issue looks very different - we celebrate Volume 20 with the first significant redesign since the quarterly’s inception. Also, in response to requests for a link between research and practice, we have launched an <italic>EID</italic> Web page that incorporates a blog and provides an opportunity for human factors/ergonomics professionals to exchange ideas. Go to <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ergonomicsindesign.hfes.org">http://ergonomicsindesign.hfes.org</ext-link> to read the latest posts and comments. This new <italic>EID</italic> site serves as a forum that we anticipate will become the “go-to” page for our profession and those interested in our field.</p>
<p>Also during this notable year, we will offer podcasts featuring interviews that showcase the work published in <italic>EID.</italic> To reflect the international prominence of HF/E, we are also planning a special issue on global ergonomics, guest edited by Thomas J. Smith.</p>
<p>An article on a fundamental HF/E topic seems appropriate for launching Volume 20. When one is embarking on the analysis of a system or training program, there are many task analysis methods from which to choose, yet how to select an appropriate approach is not well defined. In their lead article in this issue, authors Adams, Rogers, and Fisk not only guide readers on which method to choose but also discuss the benefits of using a combination of methods to gain different perspectives from the analyses.</p>
<p>Benden, Miller, Wilke, and Ibarra next propose a method for comparing alternative design concepts. Determining which among a group of usable designs is the best can be difficult, especially with a cross-functional, multidisciplinary selection team. The authors describe a new method, using a combination of traditional scaling methods, to select the most usable medical transport vehicle seat.</p>
<p>This issue brings a “how-to” paper from Pavlas, Lum, and Salas for building an affordable eye-tracking system. They discuss the high cost of many systems, which has been prohibitive for some researchers and practitioners, and describe five steps for selecting hardware and software to achieve a low-cost tool.</p>
<p>Last, but not least, I thank Guest Editors Linda Angell and John Lee for their hard work to gather together the outstanding October 2011 special issue on driver distraction.</p>
