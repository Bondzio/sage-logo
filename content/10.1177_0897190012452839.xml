<p>Pharmacologic response is a phenomenon with substantial interpatient variability.  Many factors for the observed variability have been known for years—age and weight are perhaps the best known such factors. However, it has long been observed that a subset of patients may have little or no response to a given medication, while another subset may experience what appear to be dose-related adverse effects while receiving standard doses. </p>
<p>Over the last several years, it has become recognized that genotype contributes to patients’ responses to medications.  Pharmacogenetics is the study of how gene variations produce interpatient variation in drug response.  In the special issue of the <italic>Journal of Pharmacy Practice</italic>, the current state of field of pharmacogenetics is updated in a manner that is both accurate and relevant to current clinical pharmacy practitioners.</p>
<p>The first article, “Tailoring Drug Therapy Based on Genotype” by Dr Larisa Cavallari, is an updated overview, setting definitions, explaining the scientific backdrop, and providing occasional examples of the field. We are indebted to Dr Cavallari for presenting this difficult subject in a flair of general readability, no simple task.</p>
<p>The second article, by Dr Jaekyu Shin, takes a closer look at 2 of the more well-known pharmacogenetics examples today—warfarin and clopidogrel. Probably all pharmacists regularly see these drugs in clinical practice, many have noticed some patients receiving very low or surprisingly high doses of warfarin in the past, and more recently, many have even read of the progress made in the understanding of the polymorphisms in the <italic>CYP2C19</italic> and <italic>VKORC1</italic>.  As the author explains, the metabolism clopidogrel is also subject to significant polymorphic variation, again due to <italic>CYP2C19.</italic> Whether a test needs to be performed prior to or at some point during clopidogrel therapy to identify “nonresponders” (and thereby provide them with alternative antiplatelet therapy) is still undergoing extensive debate/ Dr Shin does a fine job in explaining the issues involved.</p>
<p>Drs Joseph Ma, Kelly Lee, and Grace Kuo then focus on 3 drugs (or drug classes) whose pharmacogenetic variation is perhaps less well known to practicing pharmacists—proton pump inhibitors, codeine, and carbamazepine. And in the final article, Drs Ogechi Ikediobi and Christine Walko shift gears toward perhaps the least well understood—yet conceivably most clinically significant area of pharmacogenetic research—that of cancer chemotherapy and related drugs used in patients with malignancies. For example, thiopurines are used in the treatment of leukemia and are metabolized by thiopurine <italic>S</italic>-methyltransferase (TPMT).  Patients who have TPMT deficiency are at risk for life-threatening myelosuppression, whereas those with increased enzymatic activity may be at risk for treatment failure. Another example is Tamoxifen, whose metabolism is dependent on cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6), also susceptible to polymorphic variation.</p>
<p>It is hoped that these articles bring a greater understanding and appreciation of pharmacogenetics among clinical practitioners.</p>
