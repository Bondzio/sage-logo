<abstract>
<p>Jacobs argued that grand planning schemes intending to redevelop large swaths of a city according to a central theoretical framework fail because planners do not understand that healthy cities are organic, spontaneous, messy, complex systems that result from evolutionary processes. She argued that a gradual pace of redevelopment would facilitate maintenance of existing interpersonal ties. This paper operationalises the concept of pace of development within a cross-sectional framework as the ‘age diversity of housing’. Analysis of a population-based multilevel community survey of Chicago linked with census housing data predicts individual perceptions of neighbourhood social relations (cohesion, control, intergenerational closure and reciprocal exchange). A gradual pace of redevelopment resulting in historical diversity of housing significantly predicts social relations, lending support to Jacobs’s claims.</p>

<title>Community Social Relations</title>
<p>A large literature in social science and public health documents the importance of social relations in residential neighbourhoods for a broad variety of health and social outcomes for individuals and communities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0042098013477698">Entwisle, 2007</xref>). Some of this work is motivated by a claim that community informal social networks may be weakening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0042098013477698">Putnam, 1995</xref>) within and across all social groups and by concern that changes in community social networks will hurt members of the poorest urban communities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0042098013477698">Klinenberg, 2002</xref>) who may lose networks they previously relied on without gaining access to emergent social relational formats. Others have pointed out that dense social ties in communities may not always be beneficial; cohesion may foster pressure to conform and even contribute to problematic social organisations such as gangs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0042098013477698">Sampson, 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>Most research on community social relations has focused on neighbourhood social composition, but there is good reason to believe that the built environment may be important too. Research in a variety of literatures, including urban planning, criminology, environmental psychology, landscape architecture and early work from the Chicago School, describes urban design’s implications for the interaction between people and their environments by influencing opportunities for surveillance and casual encounters. Widely discussed theories such as New Urbanism and defensible space, along with research on the health effects of housing, transport, and commercial development, can also inform research on neighbourly social relations.</p>
<p>Sociologists of the early Chicago School promoted theoretical approaches that took seriously the role of the physical environment in shaping social processes over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0042098013477698">Sampson and Morenoff, 1997</xref>). Of course, these physical ecological dynamics are themselves moulded by local governments, institutions, social movements, developers and others who influence policy and market structure to shape neighbourhood trajectories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0042098013477698">Brown and Chung, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0042098013477698">Massey <italic>et al</italic>., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0042098013477698">Rothwell and Massey, 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0042098013477698">2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0042098013477698">Sampson and Morenoff, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0042098013477698">Taub <italic>et al</italic>., 1984</xref>). These ecological approaches are still available to us, and indeed the ability to measure physical characteristics of neighbourhoods has undergone a revolution due to advances in geoprocessing and neighbourhood-based survey methodology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0042098013477698">Diez Roux and Mair 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Measurement may have improved, but theory has not kept pace, to the extent that a focus on methods has eclipsed a great deal of valuable theory. Rich theoretical narratives are not only valuable in framing and motivating urban research, but can also be a great source of testable hypotheses for empirical examination. This is why it makes sense to turn to the work of that most beloved of urban planning theorists, Jane Jacobs.</p>
<p>This paper first presents an overview of Jacobs’s concept of development pace and very briefly summarises research to date on community social relations, focusing on work linking housing and social behaviour. The analysis then operationalises historical development pace as a measure of the diversity of housing ages and uses this measure along with controls (individual sociodemographics and neighbourhood built and social characteristics) to predict four measures of neighbourly social relations in a multilevel framework using data representative of the city of Chicago in 2000.</p>

<title>Jacobs on Neighbourhood Change and Social Ties</title>
<p>Jacobs’s book <italic>The Death and Life of Great American Cities</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0042098013477698">1961</xref>) opposed ‘one size fits all’ planning approaches and large building schemes, emphasising instead allowing places to evolve gradually through natural selection and infill development, with minimal government intervention and in careful consultation with local residents. Many of her comments were attacks on urban planning movements of the early 20th century, such as Ebenezer Howard’s Garden City movement, which sought to replace slums with planned, wholesome communities with plenty of green spaces; the grand designs of Le Corbusier’s high-density aesthetic Radiant City; and Robert Moses’s emphasis on freeways as a means to modernity. These reformers disliked the mix of land uses and architecture styles and the high-density and chaotic street life of (usually poor) urban neighbourhoods; they thought that planning for separated and distinct spaces for home, outdoor leisure, employment and commerce would improve urban life and modernise cities. They saw themselves as the continuation of a history of public health benefits from urban planning changes, such as sewage systems, decreased crowding resulting in lower infection rates and separation of toxic land uses from housing areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0042098013477698">Perdue <italic>et al</italic>., 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Jacobs argued that grand planning schemes intending to redevelop large swaths of a city according to a central theoretical framework fail because planners do not understand that healthy cities are organic, spontaneous, messy, complex systems that result from evolutionary processes. This suggests that neighbourhoods that have experienced gradual rather than intensive redevelopment would experience better allocation of land uses, perhaps resulting in more walking, less vacant area and a greater diversity of uses. Encouraging disinvestment in a community (to clear the way for extensive redevelopment of land) rather than fostering the local reallocation of buildings and land uses would also break up existing social relationships. Other, more recent urban policy researchers, including <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0042098013477698">Galster (1987)</xref>, have also emphasised the importance of neighbourhood reinvestment.</p>

<sec id="section3-0042098013477698">
<title>Housing, Social Composition and Social Relations</title>
<p>There are three main sociological approaches to the study of neighbourhood social relations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0042098013477698">Swaroop and Morenoff, 2006</xref>), aside from a perspective focusing on the concentration of poverty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0042098013477698">Wilson, 1987</xref>) and the emphasis on the negative externalities of urban living itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0042098013477698">Wirth, 1938</xref>). The systemic or social disorganisation perspective emphasises the role of residential stability (low population turnover) in supporting social relations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0042098013477698">Kasarda and Janowitz, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0042098013477698">Shaw and McKay, 1942</xref>), particularly for informal exchanges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0042098013477698">Sampson, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0042098013477698">Sampson and Groves, 1989</xref>). The social needs perspective suggests that challenged communities may actually interact more in the attempt to resolve problems or seek protection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0042098013477698">Kasarda and Janowitz, 1974</xref>), although the empirical support for this view appears to be limited to community problem-solving behaviour in the face of challenges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0042098013477698">Woldoff, 2002</xref>). Finally, the limited liability approach suggests that instrumental participation and formation of ties serve as strategies to protect the safety and well-being of household members and property and to solve collective problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0042098013477698">Greer, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0042098013477698">Guest <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>By contrast, studies of crime and health policy sometimes address features of the physical environment such as land use, accessibility, access to goods and services, exposure to physical hazards and ‘walkability’. The ‘built environment’ consists of the human-modified components of the physical environment, such as housing and commercial land use, transport networks and landscape design, and the accompanying benefits and risks (such as traffic risks, access to parks). Although these two dimensions (social and physical) are considered to be interlinked spatial and temporal processes, very little work has investigated the complex relations among physical and social neighbourhood-level characteristics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0042098013477698">Dannenberg <italic>et al</italic>., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0042098013477698">Roman and Chalfin, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0042098013477698">Singh <italic>et al</italic>., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0042098013477698">Srinivasan <italic>et al</italic>., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0042098013477698">Wen and Zhang, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>A few studies have examined how housing building types predict neighbourhood social relations. Respondents in townhouses or villas reported higher and those living in duplexes and apartments or flats reported lower levels of social capital than residents of detached houses in Australia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0042098013477698">Wood <italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0042098013477698">Glaeser and Sacerdote (2000)</xref> found that residents of large apartment buildings have more social connections but less involvement in local politics; residents of areas around apartment buildings experienced more robberies and auto thefts. Public housing developments may have stronger social interaction when low-rise buildings are close together than when high-rise buildings are set far apart (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0042098013477698">Amick and Kviz, 1975</xref>). The positioning of doors, paths, and common spaces has been shown to predict social contacts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0042098013477698">Festinger <italic>et al</italic>., 1950</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0042098013477698">Gans, 1962</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0042098013477698">Michelson, 1970</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0042098013477698">1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0042098013477698">Talen, 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>Some recent work has described a possible change in the worth of older housing that the earlier neighbourhood change models did not reflect. Although affluent households still choose newer housing and moderately older housing still portends a neighbourhood economic decline, older housing is becoming more attractive for gentrification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0042098013477698">Rosenthal 2008</xref>), even as there is increased demand for access to the amenities (for example, shops, restaurants and services, but also including positive neighbourly social relations) provided in denser cities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0042098013477698">Glaeser and Gottlieb, 2006</xref>). Aside from a considerable body of descriptive analysis of specific redevelopment projects, especially public housing, little empirical work has considered the implications for social relations of housing age and development trajectories over larger area. In one exception, older local housing was positively related to social interaction and organisational participation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0042098013477698">Guest <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>). Despite these efforts to understand the influence of housing age and type on social relations, Jacobs’s narrative describing the benefits of gradual evolutionary redevelopment has still received little attention. Specifically, she proposed that a “district must mingle buildings that vary in age and condition, including a good proportion of old ones” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0042098013477698">Jacobs, 1961</xref>, p. 187). It remains to be seen whether the diversity of forms created by gradual development in fact predicts better neighbourly social relations.</p>

<title>Analytical Plan</title>
<p>This analysis provides an empirical test of Jacobs’s narrative assertion that gradual neighbourhood development predicts a more sociable climate. To assess this claim, historical development pace is operationalised in a cross-sectional framework as age diversity of housing units, while neighbourly social relations are represented by four measures common to health and social research to represent neighbourly social relations: cohesion, control, intergenerational closure and reciprocal exchange (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0042098013477698">Sampson <italic>et al</italic>., 1999</xref>). Linking a representative survey of Chicago in 2001–03 with objective and new census-based measures of the neighbourhood housing environment, this paper examines linkages between the housing environment and neighbourly social relations. The specification of housing includes a new measure, age diversity, inspired by Jacobs’s writings on the benefits of gradual rather than wholescale development for neighbourhood social vitality, as well as new factors representing housing construction eras.</p>
<p>Multivariate hierarchical linear models with neighbourhood random effects and robust standard errors are presented. All models control for basic individual-level sociodemographic composition. For each outcome, associations of housing building type and housing age factors with the outcome are first presented in separate models (models 1 and 2) to establish that these measures are in fact appropriate built environment controls. Model 3 adds the key variable of interest, the housing age diversity measure, along with the housing building types and housing age factors. The final model (model 4) additionally incorporates controls for neighbourhood social composition.</p>

<title>Data and Methods</title>
<sec id="section6-0042098013477698">
<title>Survey Data</title>
<p>The Chicago Community Adult Health Study (CCAHS) is a multilevel probability sample of 3105 adults aged 18 and older living in the city of Chicago, with a response rate of 71.8 per cent for face-to-face interviews. Content includes the individual socioeconomic, psychosocial and behavioural factors on health, and the social and physical characteristics of neighbourhoods. The CCAHS built on the clustered sampling framework of the Project on Human Development in Chicago Neighborhoods (PHDCN), drawing an average of 9 respondents from each of the 343 neighbourhood clusters (NCs) covering the entire city. These NCs are groups of contiguous census tracts, grouped to reflect physical barriers, local cultural knowledge and cluster analyses of census data, so they are relatively homogeneous (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0042098013477698">Sampson <italic>et al</italic>., 1999</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0042098013477698">
<title>Perceived Neighbourly Social Relations</title>
<p>An important component of the CCAHS was the community survey, a portion of the questionnaire that covers perceptions of the respondents’ neighbourhoods along a wide range of domains. Of these, four are most pertinent. Social cohesion assesses closeness and shared values among neighbours, a form of bonding capital that emphasises the social networks among individuals who agree to a shared system of norms, at times to the exclusion of individuals on outer rings of a concentric network of trust (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0042098013477698">Fukuyama, 2000</xref>). Informal social control taps into the shared beliefs and expectations of a community that they can and will intervene for the collective good. When social cohesion and control are combined, they constitute a shared willingness to take action to enforce collective norms, known as ‘collective efficacy’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0042098013477698">Sampson <italic>et al</italic>., 1997</xref>). Intergenerational closure assesses the extent to which adults and parents in the neighbourhood are aware of and looking out for local children. Reciprocal exchange focuses on the exchange of favours, advice, material goods and information that makes up a social support network within the community; the exchange is reciprocal because of the tacit expectation that this care may be repaid in the future, although possibly in a different mode and by unspecified neighbours (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0042098013477698">Portes, 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>The four continuous standardised neighbourhood social relations outcomes each come from principal components factor analysis of five items measured on Likert scales. Imputed versions from the public version of the dataset were used; the imputation considered basic sociodemographics. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0042098013477698">Tables 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0042098013477698">2</xref> report scale component item descriptions and summary statistics. Scale items display acceptable levels of internal reliability (Cronbach’s alpha, 0.79–0.83) and levels of reliability of OLS estimates across neighbourhoods based on the random effects of level 1 intercepts (0.47–0.60). Intraclass correlations assess the extent to which a single variable varies by neighbourhood—that is, the proportion of overall variance attributed to the neighbourhood level by the random-effects model. The intraclass correlations of 0.09 (reciprocal exchange) to 0.14 (control) indicate considerable agreement about social relations within neighbourhoods, greater than that for most health outcomes frequently studied in neighbourhood context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0042098013477698">King, 2012</xref>).</p>

<title>Individual Sociodemographic Controls</title>
<p>Individual-level controls are included to account for factors that may affect reports of neighbourly social relations: race/ethnicity (non-Hispanic Black, Hispanic, non-Hispanic other, with non-Hispanic White as the reference category), variables indicating whether the respondent is female or is an immigrant, and dummy variables for age (30–39, 40–49, 50–59, 60–69 and 70 years and over, with 18–29 as the reference group), education (12–15 years or 16+ years, with 0–11 years as the reference category) and annual income of respondent and their spouse if applicable (less than $5000, $15 000–39 999, and $40 000 and over, with $5000–$15 000 as the reference category). In models not shown, additional controls were examined including individual home and car ownership, household structure, residential tenure and walking, but they did not substantively affect the central relationship.</p>

<title>Neighbourhood Built Environment</title>
<sec id="section10-0042098013477698">
<title>Housing</title>
<p>The census housing building type categories include buildings with 50 or more units (also called high-rises), with 5–49 units, with 2–4 units and non-standard types (units attached to non-residential buildings, mobile homes, boats and motor vehicles, and other types of housing), with detached single-unit homes as the reference group. Housing building type patterns show a clear concentric ring pattern, with high-rises concentrated along Lake Michigan (and a slight spoke-and-hub pattern around highways), 3- to 4-unit buildings in a smooth ring distant from the Loop and a gradual transition to single-family houses towards the city outskirts.</p>
<p>Housing remaining from before 1940 is more common on the north side of Chicago, Uptown, and curving along the river, as well as in Hyde Park and Beverly. Housing from the 1940s is more spatially dispersed, but located away from the Loop. Construction in the 1950s occurred at a fairly even prevalence across the city except for concentrations on the outskirts of the city. The 1960s and 1970s saw considerable investment in the waterfront and the Loop and redevelopment in the South Side and outskirts, especially around Lake Calumet and near Ashburn and Belmont. Waterfront redevelopment continued in the 1980s and in the 1990s spread to the west away from the waterfront.</p>

<sec id="section11-0042098013477698">
<title>Redevelopment pace/historical diversity</title>
<p>The next step is to operationalise the measure capturing an element of urban design suggested by Jacobs as important to neighbourhood social relations, but that has not yet been empirically analysed: the historical age diversity of the housing stock (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0042098013477698">Figure 1</xref>). Jacobs argued that diversity of physical form, especially the gradual repurposing, reconstruction and infilling of newly developing properties, is essential to maintaining a dynamic flexibility necessary to keep an urban neighbourhood thriving. The gradual redevelopment of housing properties is captured by applying a common measure of ecological diversity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0042098013477698">Talen, 2010</xref>), the Simpson diversity index (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0042098013477698">Simpson, 1949</xref>) (also known as a Herfindahl index), which measures the diversity of a distribution among categories.

<title>Additional Measures</title>
<p>An extensive set of alternate and additional measures of the neighbourhood built environment were also considered, but they did not alter the substantive findings. First, given the claims of New Urbanism that walkability and walking promote social relations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0042098013477698">Leyden, 2003</xref>), walkable urban form (operationalised using residential density, street connectivity and land use mix) was examined. Next, other measures of variability in the housing environment such as building type diversity and variation in the number of bedrooms, were examined. Results were also robust to separate inclusion of a long list of variables including vacancy rates, physical disorder, ambient stressors, Hispanic/foreign-born composition, open space, physical barriers, commercial destinations and industrial facilities.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-0042098013477698">
<title>Neighbourhood Social Composition</title>
<p>Five measures of social composition are included as controls: disadvantage, affluence, residential stability and the proportions of residents who are under 18 and 65 and older, based on census data for 2000.</p>
<p>Recent studies have tended to approach neighbourhood social composition by using factor analysis of census social composition data to create scales (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0042098013477698">Land <italic>et al</italic>., 1990</xref>), most often disadvantage and affluence, but also including Hispanic/foreign-born composition, family structure and older age composition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0042098013477698">Sampson and Morenoff, 1997</xref>). Disadvantage is characterised by large positive loadings on measures such as low income, public assistance, unemployment, female-headed households, low education and young age structure, whereas affluence is characterised by large positive loadings on measures such as high education, professional/managerial occupation and middle age composition. These are not merely opposites: although almost no neighbourhoods are both affluent and disadvantaged, many neighbourhoods have low levels of both. Incorporating the affluence dimension captures important variation in neighbourhood socioeconomic composition; affluence is a powerful predictor of health and health behaviour as well as of the racial disparities therein. Neighbourhood affluence appears to have strong positive associations with intergenerational relations (closure), reciprocal exchange, social control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0042098013477698">Sampson <italic>et al</italic>., 1999</xref>) and social interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0042098013477698">Guest <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>), whereas social control is lower in disadvantaged areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0042098013477698">Sampson <italic>et al</italic>., 1999</xref>). The literature has paid little attention to age composition.</p>
<p>The disadvantage and affluence scales used here were constructed by calculating the average value of a set of standardised census-based variables for each NC, informed by prior exploratory factor analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0042098013477698">Morenoff <italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>). The socioeconomic disadvantage scale (Cronbach’s alpha = 0.96) loads positively on low family incomes and high levels of poverty, public assistance, unemployment and vacant housing, and negatively on high family incomes. The affluence scale (Cronbach’s alpha = 0.94) consists of three components: the proportions of the population with professional/ managerial occupation, with less than 12 years of education (reverse coded) and with more than 16 years of education. Residential stability, or the proportion of residents in place for five or more years, and the proportions of minors and older adults, were also standardised.</p>

<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0042098013477698">Table 4</xref> gives summary statistics for neighbourhood-level variables. On average within NCs, buildings of 2–4 units were the most common building type (38 per cent), while 22 per cent of units were in buildings containing 5–49 units, 8 per cent were in buildings with at least 50 units, 28 per cent were in stand-alone single-family houses and 4 per cent were in less standard building types (mobile units, housing attached to non-residential properties and other units). However, NCs ranged widely in distributions of building types. The modal housing unit was built in the 1930s or earlier (39 per cent in the average neighbourhood), with on average more than 10 per cent of units built in each of the 1940s, 1950s and 1960s, and little construction thereafter. However, some NCs were substantially redeveloped in any of the post-war decades, ranging as high as 64 per cent of units constructed in the 1960s in one NC. To reduce the dimensionality of the housing age categories, principal components analysis is employed. Two factors have eigenvalues over the conventional critical value of 1.0 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0042098013477698">Table 5</xref>); these factors are interpreted as representing first, recent and, secondly, mid-century construction. The Simpson diversity index for housing construction decades averages 0.38 (0.13–0.54).</p>

<p>The standardised principal components measures of disadvantage and affluence are similar to those used in prior studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0042098013477698">Morenoff <italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>) but have not been rotated to achieve orthogonality and so have a correlation of -0.49. On average, 56 per cent of respondents had been in their homes for at least 5 years, but some neighbourhoods had as many as 83 per cent or as few as 20 per cent of their residents staying in a home that long. NCs averaged 28 per cent minors and 10 per cent older adults.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-0042098013477698">Table 6</xref> reports neighbourhood-level coefficients from four hierarchical linear models for each of the four outcomes. Models 1 and 2 report associations of housing building type and housing age factors respectively, with the outcomes. For cohesion and closure, increasing proportions of large building types are associated with increasing negative associations with social relations, compared with proportions of single-unit houses; these associations are not monotonic for control. A significant difference between proportions of houses and buildings with 5–49 units is also found for reciprocal exchange. No significant differences between proportions of houses and of other building types is found. The mid-century building factor is significantly associated with higher levels of all four types of social relations, but recent construction is negatively associated only with social control. When all three sets of housing measures are included in model 3, the other housing features become non-significant (except proportions of large buildings vs houses with cohesion). However, age diversity of housing is significantly associated with all 4 social relations outcomes. The addition of social composition controls in model 4 gives a similar pattern: among the housing measures, only age diversity of housing is significant.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The primary aim of the analysis was to assess the potential contribution of a concept from Jacobs’s <italic>The Death and Life of Great American Cities</italic>: the importance of gradual rather than large-area redevelopment (resulting in historical diversity) for place-specific social ties. Empirical results show significant links between housing age diversity (historical development pace) and four measures of neighbourly social relations, even when controlling for other neighbourhood housing features, social composition and individual sociodemographics. It may be that gradual redevelopment preserves community ties, which may take decades to form and which new residents may ‘inherit’ from previous neighbours. Alternatively, the significant association of historical diversity may not be due to Jacobs’s explanation and may instead have other interpretations. Historical diversity may result from the continued vibrancy of neighbourhoods across previous decades (a reciprocal effect of social relations) or may arise in neighbourhoods that contain more local physical or social barriers to large-area redevelopment, barriers that somehow foster social interactions. The finding should be repeated in other contexts, with longitudinal data, and for other outcomes to reach a better understanding of whether we should interpret it as evidence that Jacobs’s narrative was correct.</p>
<p>The previous pages discussed some ideas of Jacobs and others about how physical features of places predict local social relations, but in evaluating the results, it is imperative to avoid what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0042098013477698">Glaeser (2011)</xref> calls the ‘edifice complex’—the idea that built features are sufficient in themselves to bring about desired outcomes. The analyses presented here do not establish any kind of causality and it would be dangerous to attempt to dictate precise policy prescriptions on the basis of descriptive analysis. Rather, these cross-sectional results on several measures of the social climate in a single city suggest the validity of Jacobs’s argument for further analysis using other methods, in other locations and over time. This approach was informed by the belief that in evaluating current conditions to inform urban planning, health and social policy, one should work with natural patterns of human–environment interaction rather than against them, and to this end, to seek to reach a better understanding of those patterns before turning to the investigation of causality.</p>
<p>There are several limitations to this research. First, although urban planning and social policy can benefit greatly from research on the effects of the built environment on quality of life, evidence is needed at the ‘design level’—the level at which intervention in the built environment is possible. The present analysis may cover larger neighbourhood sizes that may not match up well with what residents consider as their neighbourhoods, although these larger spatial units may do a better job than building-level studies of capturing the neighbourhood context into which buildings and block faces are set. This study has made no effort to consider the spatial context of the NCs, either by controlling for the context of surrounding NCs or by specifying aspects of location such as distance to downtown or from Lake Michigan. In addition, this analysis deals with a case in which the neighbourhoods had had established housing stocks for decades, so this research does not apply to greenfield development. Future research should examine the social capital implications of additional built environment features such as transport, commercial and institutional features of places; the narrow focus here was on investigating how development pace may be related to neighbouring over and above associations with housing and walkable urban form.</p>
<p>It merits attention that neighbourhoods fared better when construction was more evenly distributed over time than when there were large redevelopments in particular decades. For one thing, if it is really the gradual evolutionary pace of redevelopment that matters for neighbourly social relations, massive interventions to redevelop troubled areas may not succeed as well as small projects. This might even be the case for supposedly evidence-based communities master-planned along New Urbanist lines. Also, large-area zoning frameworks that discourage transitions (such as the current trend to redevelop industrial spaces as loft apartments) may be even more problematic than previously thought, and infill development even more promising. However, further investigation is necessary in order to understand more fully the association between construction patterns and social outcomes before concrete policy recommendations can be made. For instance, investigation of how changes in the housing environment and changes in social composition (such as gentrification, White flight) dynamically and jointly influence social behaviour would be very informative. Equally importantly, social interaction is only one of many domains on which to consider urban policy.</p>
