<p>“Television is not dead.” This was one of the answers offered at a recent conference exploring the question, what is television? Phil Oppenheim from Turner Broadcasting explained that he often receives condolences about the end of television, to which he responds: “Television has always been rapidly changing and often threatened with existential crises. [But] television is not dead.” Indeed, Oppenheim’s sentiment was echoed by other industry professionals and academics who attended this conference. Many pointed out that television has shifted and morphed over the decades, as television content is now produced using a wide range of digital technologies, distributed via the Internet, mobile devices, and miscellaneous video formats, and viewed at the convenience of consumers. Change seems to be everywhere. Narrative is changing. Distribution is changing. And, reception, by way of interactivity and a proliferation of platforms, is changing, as well. But the fact that people still watch television in some form or another has not changed.</p>
<p>This issue of <italic>JCI</italic> presents some of the papers and presentations from “What is Television? A Conference to Explore the Past, Present and Future of Television,” held at the University of Oregon’s Turnbull Center in Portland, Oregon, March 1-3, 2012. The conference followed a previous event that focused on the question of “What is Film?,” also held in Portland, November 2009. We began with the questions: What is television these days? How are digital technologies changing television? How are the Internet and other new media changing the television industry’s model of production, distribution, and consumption? What is the future of television? Other questions included the following:</p>

<list-item><p>How are television audiences changing?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>What can television history teach us about the future of television?</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>The conference featured a unique coalescing of video and television professionals, media scholars and students, government and community officials, as well as community groups and the public. Thus, the event featured a variety of participants who attempted to answer questions about the changing nature of television.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0196859912459653">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>Of course, there was no definitive answer to the broad question, what is television? And, obviously, there has been no single perspective to approach these questions. Conference participants probed the nature of television when it is understood in the context of nation and identity, or when television resides in museums as an extension of public history and memory, or how our viewing experiences may change as distribution platforms provide us with different opportunities to watch television outside of the living room. Panels about distribution highlighted how alternatives to broadcast television offer new ways to view television, but also pointed out how the industry is still very much the same in terms of content delivery.</p>
<p>Other conference participants pointed to the web as a site for the convergence of production, distribution, and reception, especially providing viable alternatives to not only “traditional” television viewing, but also what we might consider as television programming. And surely, television is not all about entertainment—presentations emphasized the changing demands and outcomes in television newsrooms, shifts in advertising models, and various dimensions of television labor, such as the legal limits on reality television participants. One panelist turned the question of what is television into what is a television set, shifting our attention toward the physical, tangible impacts of the actual object on the environment and health.</p>
<p>The mix of perspectives sparked several debates that continued from session to session and in the hallways. While some emphasized the technology, many more spoke of television as content and storytelling. And, while a somewhat artificial debate developed about how television could be experienced and viewed without the technology, even those who continually defined television as content and only content, paid some attention to the technologies and platforms that enable the modes of storytelling that we experience. Content may be king, but themes of technological convergence, platform-ambivalent television, and the decreasing costs in production and distribution technologies undergirded arguments that television is ultimately about stories and shared experiences. A futurist from Intel who participated in the closing plenary explained that <italic>physically</italic> “television is just glass; all I need to have is projection”; however, television is about storytelling, seriality, and creating intimacy between the viewer and the screen.</p>
<p>Another debate centered on the oft repeated notion of “the democratization of the medium,” as viewers now have access to seemingly limitless choices for not only content, but opportunities to view television across platforms. But does the increase in programming, distribution channels, and devices mean more choice? The discussion culminated in the final plenary on the future of television. As one speaker spoke about “democracy in content” and proliferation of various economic models to support such diverse content, participants in the audience raised concerns about the limits to this claim. For example, the predominant focus on the U.S. broadcast system eclipses an international perspective, where “choice” may be far less of an issue. Similarly, government policies, conditions of production, and <italic>who</italic> has the opportunity to have choices are vital dimensions that complicate and challenge the idea of democratization.</p>
<p>Some of these themes are represented in this special issue of <italic>JCI</italic>, which includes the transcript for one of the plenary panels and four papers developed from this conference. “Legacies from the Past: Histories of Television” includes plenary comments by Michele Hilmes, Horace Newcomb, and Eileen Meehan, who explore the importance of appreciating the history of television in order to understand its current status and any attempts to predict its future.</p>
<p>In the first selection of original papers that follows, Lee McGuigan considers the role of television audiences in “Consumers: The Commodity Product of Interactive Commercial Television; or is Dallas Smythe’s Thesis More Germane than Ever?” McGuigan tests Dallas Smythe’s thesis of the audience commodity against emergent marketing paradigms and commercial models organized around interactive television. Television technologies, including various Internet-connected content delivery platforms, increasingly combine the technical and administrative infrastructure to support direct conversion of viewers into consumers of the products displayed in advertisements and programs. Through a broad reading of the audience commodity, McGuigan suggests that, contrary to most appraisals, Smythe recognized audiences as both economic products <italic>and</italic> social products—people living as producers and consumers in capitalism. He further notes that Smythe’s thesis has particular currency in relation to an interactive television storefront because the essence of the audience commodity resides in the capacity of viewers to consume branded goods and services. This argument is ever more salient as ongoing developments in database marketing and electronic commerce illustrate that advertiser-supported television manufactures consumers as economic and social products within a nearly ubiquitous digitized marketplace.</p>
<p>Aymar Jean Christian’s paper, “The Web as Television Re-imagined? A History of Early Web Programming,” explores the early history of episodic web programming, such as web series, webisodes, bitcoms, web television and, in its earliest form, cybersoap. He notes that producers of these programs hoped to replicate, but also reinvent, television. Christian’s discussion notes that from the time the Internet became available to most consumers, and even before, companies such as Microsoft and NBC, as well as independent production outfits and advertising firms, declared that the web was the newest form of television. Thus, “television” in the convergence era became a malleable concept through which Hollywood insiders, outsiders, financial backers, and artistic leaders brought their hopes of media domination in a period of instability.</p>
<p>The next paper, “From An Era of Plenty to An Era of Overflow: ‘What Shall I Watch?’” by Jonas De Meulenaere, Wendy Van den Broeck, and Bram Lievens, focuses on how viewers decide what to watch in a context of almost infinite video content availability and the expansion of the process of digitization. Through a focus group research they investigated to what extent viewers apply an active search process toward video content. They found that the search process was guided by a combination of contextual, content-related,and personal factors, which simultaneously freed as well as restricted viewer choices. The conclusion is that a gradual shift is taking place in who is fulfilling the gatekeeper’s role in current television viewing.</p>
<p>The final paper is Micky Lee’s “Time and the Political Economy of Financial Television.” She calls attention to the importance of time as a vantage point from which the intersection between finance, media, and information can be critiqued. Lee argues that neoliberal temporality is constituted by both abstract time and historical time of the media. She then explores the sense of abstract time constructed by financial television and argues that the paradox of low production cost of television programs and high commercial value of advertisement spots represents the inherent contradictions of capitalism. Furthermore, the existence of financial television relies on the creation of new financial markets and the centralization of information about financial transactions. Lee concludes that both phenomena ought to be understood in the context of the historical time marked by neoliberalism since the 1970s.</p>
<p>While the goal of the conference was not to determine a specific definition of television, the discussions represented diverse perspectives and modes of inquiry into the subject. Although we may not be able to pinpoint <italic>exactly</italic> what television is these days, the conference demonstrated that television continues to be dynamic and context dependent, and is best approached in many different ways. In the end, the path to determining the meaning of television proved to be far more engaging than finding a precise definition.</p>
