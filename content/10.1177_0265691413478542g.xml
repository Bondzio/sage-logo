<p>A diplomat, spy, writer and Freemason, Charles-Geneviève-Louis-Auguste-André-Timothée d’Éon de Beaumont must be one of the most fascinating and intriguing characters of eighteenth-century France. Spending half of his adventurous life as a man and the other half playing a woman’s role and using his transgenderism to his own advantage, he attracted the attention of his contemporaries; consequently and inevitably, in the early nineteenth century, historians and novelists and, later, filmmakers, psychologists and cultural theorists discussed and wrote about the chevalier d’Eon. Since then, some twenty books, mostly biographies, have been published. Gary Kates’s <italic>Monsieur d’Eon is a Woman</italic>, published in 1995, was the last of these. It is partly building on Kates’s arguments that the editors of this book have brought together 15 essays – plus an introduction, a note on d’Eon’s archive in Leeds University Library and a follow-up by Kates himself – shedding light on various aspects of the chevalier’s life and on the social, political and cultural contexts he/she moved in. In this respect, the book offers a captivating and highly readable perspective on eighteenth-century French society, looking at issues which are often neglected or under-researched.</p>
<p>The book is divided into three sections. The first focuses on d’Eon’s political and diplomatic career during the first part of his life. A remarkable essay by Edmond Dziembowski discusses the chevalier’s skills as a diplomat and a writer and the ways in which, at the end of the Seven Years’ War, he used them to further his political career and improve his social status. Simon Burrows’s essay highlights instead the importance d’Eon attached to his popularity – stressing, in doing so, an interesting distinction between <italic>fame</italic> and <italic>celebrity</italic>. The complex relationship between d’Eon and Beaumarchais, an adventurous relationship worthy of a novel, is described in a chapter by Donald C. Spinelli. The second section of the book looks at d’Eon’s transgenderism and how his ‘public’ perceived and imagined his personage. The essays by Stephen Brogan and Valerie Mainz explain the different ways in which this ‘monster of metamorphosis’ was represented by his viewers; visual and textual materials are intelligently used by the authors to show how a man who dressed as a woman could maintain and possibly even strengthen his masculinity. Another interesting chapter is the one by Chrisman-Campbell, who, thanks to remarkable research in the archives of the University of Leeds Library, describes the daily difficulties that d’Eon experienced in dressing as a woman – highlighting interesting aspects of the history of French fashion. The third and last section, entitled ‘Heroes and Heroines’, focuses on the literary, historical and fictional figures with which d’Eon associated himself or was associated with. Particularly interesting is the chapter by Alexandre Stroev, who analyses how the myth of the Amazons, often used at the time to set forth feminists’ demands and to support new social principles, was manipulated by the chevalier for his own objectives.</p>
<p>Like any edited volume, <italic>The Chevalier d’Eon and his World</italic> is difficult to evaluate. However, it might be said that in spite of its internal coherence, there is an imbalance between the issue of gender representation on the one hand, and d’Eon’s political and diplomatic life on the other. But this, of course, is only a minor flaw. What is remarkable is the way in which many of the authors use cultural theories in a way that not only helps to shed light on the history of eighteenth-century France but also contributes to the problematization of some issues of cultural theory. From this angle, the volume represents an important meeting point of different disciplines. Moreover – though unfortunately this is not true for all chapters – d’Eon is intelligently placed in his own cultural and social context so that the book represents an important contribution to the history of the period more generally. Its relevance clearly goes beyond the study of d’Eon. If, then, the book offers a number of fascinating accounts that question a series of unexplored issues related to d’Eon’s personal story, it also, and importantly, sheds light on many of the chevalier’s worlds.</p>
