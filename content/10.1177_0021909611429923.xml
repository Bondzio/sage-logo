<abstract>
<p>This article considers the views that Chinese diplomats have developed on contemporary India. Using Chinese-written memoirs and essays, as well as discussions with active or retired diplomats of the People’s Republic of China who served in India, this research explores the diversity of the Chinese elite’s perceptions of the emergence, domestic politics and cultures of India today. It will be argued that four main sets of rather negative perceptions are produced: (1) candid views describing India in naïve, passionate or diplomatic ways; (2) judgemental opinions perpetuating a dirty-cum-messy image of India; and (3) more specifically of its corrupt and volatile communalism-prone society; and, finally, (4) more subtle insights on India’s current polity. But, given the perpetuation of rather stable, yet tense, Sino–Indian interactions at the dawn of the 21st century, conclusions will be drawn on the relatively-low impact that Chinese critical perceptions of India have had on Beijing’s recent policymaking towards New Delhi.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>For many in China and India, the ‘hindi-chini bhai bhai’ era (or ‘Indians and Chinese are brothers’) is long gone. Since Prime Ministers Jawaharlal Nehru and Zhou Enlai enthusiastically shook hands in the early 1950s, interactions between Asia’s two giants have been epitomized by a rather intense hostility. Recurrent border clashes over a long-standing territorial dispute, an armed conflict in 1962, and a series of salient hot spots (Tibet, Pakistan, and the nuclear issue, for instance) have deeply antagonized the two neighbours. However, as New Delhi and Beijing have been experiencing a tremendous rise to regional (if not global) power since the end of the Cold War, they have opted for a stabilizing rapprochement based on a rocketing bilateral trade (from US$1 billion in 2001 to US$61 billion in 2010), as well as a limited range of political confidence-building measures. Still, more intimate Sino–Indian interactions beyond the dialogue promoted by their respective leaderships at the turn of the 21st century are hardly foreseeable. The fact is, both neighbours appears to still distrust – even dislike – each other, and their elites are still struggling to understand each other more familiarly, despite the recent promotion of cultural exchanges, academic research about the other, and high-level diplomatic trips.</p>
<p>Among international scholars and policymakers alike, there has been a lively interest in the evolution of this post-Cold War China–India dyad (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0021909611429923">Garver, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0021909611429923">Frankel and Harding, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0021909611429923">Holslag, 2010</xref>). Whether Sino–Indian relations will head for rivalry and conflict, or rather towards the construction of a synergetic relationship between two non-Western emerging powers, is a captivating question. Conjectures on power struggles and a rising Sino–Indian rivalry still dominate the literature, especially in the West (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0021909611429923">Frazier, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0021909611429923">Egreteau, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0021909611429923">Scott, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0021909611429923">Manson, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0021909611429923">Frankel, 2011</xref>). In contrast, a marginal, yet rising, indigenous school of thought focuses on the tremendous potential that a China–India symbiotic cooperation can offer to 21st century Asia. In the mid-2000s, this perspective even generated the original concept of ‘Chindia’, since then vividly promoted by various academic and policymaking circles in both India and China (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0021909611429923">Ramesh, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0021909611429923">Yin, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0021909611429923">Zheng, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0021909611429923">Chung and Liu, 2007</xref>). More recently, international academia has developed the ‘cooperation-cum-competition’ framework as a way to better construe the China–India dyad (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0021909611429923">Zheng, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0021909611429923">Yuan and Singh, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0021909611429923">Malone and Mukherjee, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0021909611429923">Holslag, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0021909611429923">Saalman, 2011</xref>). It conveniently interprets the two emerging countries as now aiming to both engage and compete with each other. This academic reading has met considerable success in China proper (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0021909611429923">Pei Yuanying, 2005b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0021909611429923">Cheng, 2006b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0021909611429923">Zhang, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0021909611429923">Zheng, 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0021909611429923">2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0021909611429923">Yuan, 2009</xref>). But scholars remain increasingly stuck in this basic conflict/cooperation dialectic and there is a need to find other frameworks – especially ones based on cultural and perceptive instruments, not <italic>Realpolitik</italic> approaches – to decipher China–India relations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0021909611429923">Singh, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0021909611429923">Zhang, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>This article will therefore draw on the recent literature that aims to explore Sino–Indian ‘mutual perceptions’. A new area of research attempting to go past the focus on mere geopolitical stakes, the study of Chinese and Indian reciprocal perceptions examines cultural backgrounds, national psyche, and collective memories developed by state actors and/or public opinions. It therefore seeks to understand how reciprocal images, knowledge and understanding of the other are constructed and what impact these perceptions defined by China and India (their state elites and society) have on subsequent policymaking. While Indian perceptions have been widely described in the past decade (through English-written publications), in this article, the focus will be put on the Chinese side of the dyad, thanks to the use of non-translated Chinese language written material and personal interactions with active or retired Chinese diplomats. More specifically, this research intends to explore the views of India and its contemporary polity, which have recently been developed by Chinese diplomatic representatives recently posted there, whether in New Delhi, Kolkata (formerly Calcutta) or Mumbai (formerly Bombay).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0021909611429923">1</xref></sup> Thanks to articles, essays and personal memoirs available in the public domain – enlivened by several informal discussions conducted by the author – this research intends to highlight personal impressions, perceptions or <italic>a priori</italic> ideas that key Chinese foreign policymakers have nurtured on the emergence of India, its domestic politics, cultural values and economic strengths at the turn of the 21st century. It will be argued that four main sets of Chinese perceptions of India can be identified: (1) candid views describing India in emotional, naïve or passionate ways, drawing on the diplomatic necessity to praise an important regional player; (2) judgemental perceptions pointing out an enduring ‘dirty-cum-messy’ image of India; (3) critical opinions of a corrupted polity and volatile poly-religious Indian society; and (4) more subtle and perceptive assessments offering insightful descriptions of contemporary India’s state of affairs. But, despite the salience of negative clichés, Chinese diplomats appear to have generated acute expertise on India in recent years. Conclusions will thus be drawn on the gradual disconnection between critical perceptions of the other (here, India) and policymaking among Beijing’s decision-makers. Contrary to what is claimed in the literature, negative, judgemental or naïve views of India indeed still do not prevent China from promoting a rather constructive and stable Sino–Indian relationship based on national and state interests rather than on emotion or aversion.</p>

<title>The Study of China–India Mutual Perceptions: A Review</title>

<title>Perceptions and Foreign Policy</title>
<p>Since the early 2000s, the most promising field of research on China–India strategic interactions has certainly been that of ‘mutual perceptions’. How does India (its state structures, policymakers and non-state circles influencing decision-making processes, including public opinion and the media) perceive China, its polity, society and culture – and vice-versa? As American scholar Robert Jervis argued in the 1960s–1970s, collective and individual perceptions, views of identities and ideologies, (mis)understandings of the other self, as well as social and cultural beliefs are key elements of state foreign policymaking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0021909611429923">Jervis, 1968</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0021909611429923">1976</xref>). For him, there is an evident impulse for state actors – and hereafter, Chinese and Indian policymakers – to try to predict how other states and their leaders would (and will) behave or respond to their own policies or past and present decisions. The role of stereotypical images in shaping foreign policies has also been an important international research agenda (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0021909611429923">Hermann et al., 1997</xref>). According to which sets of imagery, cognitive constraints and cultural understanding would a policymaker formulate a policy? How have perceptions and foreign policy become intertwined? Which socio-historical processes, values and basic perceptions of threat or affinity have then influenced Chinese and Indian elites, and their policy formulation towards each other in recent years? Are traditionally-critical perceptions directly connected to the making of specific decisions and policies?</p>

<title>Extant literature on Sino–Indian Mutual Perceptions</title>
<p>The individual or collective perceptions that postcolonial India and the People’s Republic of China’s leaderships have developed since the 1940s have largely been examined, starting with the pioneering works of American political scientist <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0021909611429923">John Garver (2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0021909611429923">2003</xref>). Exploring the ‘asymmetric perceptions’ of mutual threat between the two neighbours, he stated that Indian policymakers have traditionally been far more apprehensive regarding China than the reverse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0021909611429923">Garver, 2003</xref>: 109). Since 1962, the Sino–Indian war has indeed left deeps scars in India. New Delhi has never hidden the strategic, cultural, and commercial threats it has conceived of its Chinese neighbour. Echoing Garver’s arguments, most of his followers – notably among Western and Indian academe – have through the 2000s extensively examined how and why the Indian national psyche is still increasingly portraying China as a potential menace, despite a post-Cold War rapprochement envisioned by (the late) Rajiv Gandhi after his 1988 trip to Beijing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0021909611429923">Yuan and Singh, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0021909611429923">Han, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0021909611429923">Singh, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0021909611429923">Holslag, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0021909611429923">Li, 2009</xref>). As a consequence, the salience of these asymmetrical perceptions has consolidated the image among social scientists and security analysts that an unbalanced Sino–Indian rivalry had been taking shape in the early 21st century – with India seriously considering it, and China not being adverse to the idea but prioritizing its relations with the United States hegemon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0021909611429923">Frazier, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0021909611429923">Shirk, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0021909611429923">Egreteau, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0021909611429923">Scott, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0021909611429923">Manson, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>More interestingly, recent literature has revealed, however, that these Sino–Indian mutual perceptions have significantly evolved during the 2000s. Both among China and India’s policymakers, more expertise about the state of affairs of the other has become available; more diplomatic, commercial and educational networks have developed between the two societies; and pre-existing images of the other have been resolutely questioned (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0021909611429923">Singh, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0021909611429923">Holslag, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0021909611429923">Zhang Guihong, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0021909611429923">Saalman, 2011</xref>). Beyond the use of official documents and public statements by New Delhi and Beijing, academics have also investigated a series of polls and public opinion surveys to highlight these evolving perceptions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0021909611429923">Malone and Mukherjee, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0021909611429923">Holslag, 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0021909611429923">2010</xref>: 103–19). Although mostly conducted by foreign institutions in both India and China, these surveys have offered key illustrations of the mistrust, ambivalence and, above all, lack of deep knowledge both societies (and people influencing them) still have of each other. Other research projects have based their analysis on extensive interviews with social scientists and think-tanks analysts (see more specifically <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0021909611429923">Randol, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0021909611429923">Holslag, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0021909611429923">Saalman, 2011</xref>). Lastly, examination of media perceptions has proposed new explanations for the formulation of negative images and the perpetuation of negative clichés on both sides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0021909611429923">Mei, 2010</xref>).</p>

<title>A Chinese ‘Idea of India’</title>
<p>This article focuses on the current Chinese knowledge about contemporary India, its polity and regional rise, expertise which has been appreciably enhanced during the 2000s. The increase in India-focused research capacities in Chinese universities and think-tanks, the visibility of their work (more often published in English), and their ever-growing sources of funding have been hailed internationally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0021909611429923">Huang Jinxin, 2005a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0021909611429923">2005b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0021909611429923">Randol, 2008</xref>). Regular interactions with Chinese scholars and diplomats have showed us that boundaries between active diplomats, government officials and academics are often blurred.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0021909611429923">2</xref></sup> Research on the China–India contemporary dyad is therefore mostly guided by political will. Aiming at more exposure and expertise-gathering, new centres of research have been sponsored, beyond Shanghai and Beijing-based research institutions – attesting a top–down willingness to further scientific knowledge about India and South Asia. There is a manifest interest of the Chinese political leadership to know more about an emerging country which is now construed as more than a mere ‘regional’ middle power. For the Chinese elites, India is rising and therefore China should pay more attention to this strategic neighbour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0021909611429923">Yuan, 2009</xref>). Also, the exponential growth of Sino–Indian business exchanges has meant that more familiarity with India’s markets, economic potential, and tradition of business is desperately needed in China – not to let Chinese business circles solely rely on Hong Kong-based Indian or Western networks of information.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0021909611429923">3</xref></sup> New channels of communication, dialogue and knowledge-gathering have been created in recent years: for instance, India-oriented university chairs are now offered in China for Indian senior scholars, a Chinese Consulate-General was opened in Kolkata in 2008<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0021909611429923">4</xref></sup> in parallel to the inauguration of an Indian Consulate-General in Guangzhou.</p>
<p>Yet the topics and methodological patterns of Chinese research conducted on contemporary India still obviously reflect China’s central state preoccupations. Many analysts have described the divisions of interpretations that still linger in Chinese policymaking circles, especially between hawkish security institutions (Ministry of Defence and Army, for instance) and diplomats or academics who aim to know India more broadly and engage it beyond traditional security issues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0021909611429923">Holslag, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0021909611429923">Saalman, 2011</xref>). For a long time, the Chinese psyche has opportunely defined India as a regional middle-power unsuited to be labelled a serious challenger to China’s own global emergence in the late 20th century (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0021909611429923">Gupta, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0021909611429923">Zheng, 1993</xref>). Recently, however, a few authors have contended that Chinese perceptions of India are gradually shifting and that a new ‘Idea of India’ is emerging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0021909611429923">Guang, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0021909611429923">Huang, 2005a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0021909611429923">2005b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0021909611429923">Randol, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0021909611429923">Zheng, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0021909611429923">Yuan, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0021909611429923">Holslag, 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0021909611429923">2010</xref>). Twenty years ago, India was indeed mostly understood by Beijing as a state stuck in poverty, plagued with centrifugal political forces due to the poly-ethnic and multicultural nature of its society and ‘democratic’ institutions. As in the West, this idea of a ‘backward’ India – compared to a successful, organized and developed China – now seems to be met with fewer supporters at the very top level, although it is still very much accepted. Most Chinese academics and diplomats interviewed in recent years agreed on the fact that sustainable transformations have occurred in India since the 1980s. India (partially) liberalized its economy, strengthened its military and deterrence abilities (especially with the 1998 nuclear tests), and gained diplomatic respectability, which is critical in Beijing’s views of the international order. The fact that Western perceptions of India have swiftly changed since the 1990s has also had a great impact over China’s changing discourse in the 2000s. India will have a greater role to play in the world in the 21st century – as the West is ready to offer New Delhi this new role (to a certain extent) – and, subsequently, China should be ready to take this into account, many Chinese academics have argued.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0021909611429923">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>The concept of ‘Chindia’ has therefore gradually been included in the Chinese rhetoric, as highlighted by numerous articles and books published in Chinese on the issue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0021909611429923">Yin, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0021909611429923">Chung and Liu, 2007</xref>). But ongoing research has underscored that the concept itself has rarely been defined in academic terms in this type of domestic literature (nor in international works), which tends to use it only rhetorically. It remains used as a descriptive and convenient qualification of the China–India dyad among Chinese intelligentsia. Yet old perceptions die hard. Many Chinese analysts and diplomats still feel that India – with all its polity flaws and societal burdens – is not mature enough to be in a position to exert effective diplomatic pressure regionally or worldwide (as Beijing is) or gain valuable strategic leverage beyond South Asia, despite New Delhi’s recent forays in Southeast or West Asia.</p>

<title>Methodological Note: India Through the Lenses of Chinese Diplomats</title>
<p>To further illustrate my argument, this article explores the views publicly expressed by some key Chinese diplomats as well as other mid-ranking Chinese administrators and civil servants having recently served in China’s diplomatic representations in India. Beyond official statements released by the Chinese government, the focus on individuals will enable us to examine China’s semi-official discourse and the more popular perceptions nurtured by Chinese bureaucrats and, sometimes, their relatives. The analysis of their memoirs or essays (in Chinese), and discussions conducted by the author, aim to comprehend how India is construed by either top-level Chinese diplomacy makers, or lower-ranking Chinese bureaucrats posted in India, to then evaluate the impact over Beijing foreign policymaking towards India. In a valuable article published after 2007 fieldwork in China, political scientist Shaun Randol surveyed Chinese-written material dealing with contemporary India and interviewed various Chinese academics to conclude that it is necessary to (re)-read Chinese sources focused on Indian affairs, not to rely only on biased English-published sources – as Western and Indian academia tend to do (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0021909611429923">Randol, 2008</xref>: 224). Drawing on his appeal to diversify the study of vernacular sources, this research looks at memoirs published in Chinese by some of China’s former ambassadors to New Delhi, edited volumes gathering travelogues or opinion pieces written by Chinese embassy or consulate employees, and articles released in China by diplomats having visited India.</p>
<p>In particular, the analysis of: the memoirs published by Li Lianqing, China’s ambassador to India in 1984–7, entitled ‘My Life as an Ambassador in India’ (<italic>Wo Zai Yindu Dang Dashi</italic>); the volume ‘Under the Bodhi Tree’ (<italic>Puti Shu Xia</italic>) edited by former Chinese ambassador to New Delhi from 2005–7, Sun Yuxi (which interestingly gathers several opinion articles from his former subordinates in New Delhi); the book ‘Feels India’ (<italic>Guanshou Yindu</italic>) written by Yuan Nansheng, former Consul-General in Mumbai from 2002–5; the book released by Zheng Ruixiang, earlier Consul-General in Mumbai from 1995–8, ‘The Rise of India and China–India Relations’ (<italic>Yindu De Jueqi Yu Zhong Yin Guanxi</italic>); and finally the various articles published by the prolific Cheng Ruisheng, former Chinese envoy to New Delhi in 1991–4, constitute the main basis for our argumentation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0021909611429923">Sun, 2005a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0021909611429923">Cheng, 2006a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0021909611429923">2006b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0021909611429923">2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0021909611429923">Yuan, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0021909611429923">Zheng, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0021909611429923">Li, 2007</xref>). This survey was completed by numerous discussions, mostly informal, conducted by the author among active or retired Chinese diplomatic circles in New Delhi, Kolkata, Mumbai and Beijing from 2009. The main findings reveal that four different types of perceptions of India can be easily identified in the discourse of these diplomatic circles, hereafter examined.</p>

<title>The Candid Chinese: Passion, Naïvety, and Diplomatic Praise</title>
<p>Traditionally, Chinese historians researching ancient linkages binding the Indian and Chinese civilizations, as well as their religious interactions, have been the most enthusiastic about Sino–Indian cultural synergies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0021909611429923">Chung, 2006</xref>). In recent years, however, Beijing’s top-brass political leaders have followed up and embraced the very same rhetoric on the enduring cultural friendship between the two neighbours. To secure the pacification of the bilateral relationship and its economic drive, Chinese diplomats have painstakingly praised the greatness of India. Prime Minister Wen Jiabao, during a December 2010 visit to New Delhi, even delivered ‘China–India Friendship Awards’ to Indian civil society groups and individuals for their ‘invaluable contributions’ to the strengthening of friendly bilateral ties based on cultural dialogues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0021909611429923"><italic>The Hindu</italic>, 2010</xref>). Discussions, as well as the examination of several books and papers written by other Chinese leaders, reveal some trickle-down effect of this passionate (and official) description of Sino–Indian relations. Former Chinese political counselor (1979–83) and then-ambassador in New Delhi (1991–4), Cheng Ruisheng, has relentlessly emphasized the mutual sympathy shared by Indian and Chinese people, whose ‘ancestors braved hardships, climbed mountains and crossed rivers to promote exchanges between the two civilisations, leaving behind a brilliant chapter in the history of cultural exchanges’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0021909611429923">Cheng, 2002</xref>: 90).</p>
<p>Well trained before their postings in India, Chinese diplomats have spared no effort in trying to better understand the civilizational background of India and its impact on the county’s modern society and polity, the reading of their memoirs reveals. Some – rare though – have stressed their fascination with India’s management of its cultural and ethno-religious diversity and the way the latter has been constantly reshaped in modern times. Zheng, a former consular officer in New Delhi (2001–5) showed a clear interest in how the Indian ‘identity’ was constructed thanks to Hinduism, but also through 20th century anti-colonial and anti-imperial struggles – inevitably drawing parallels with China’s own experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0021909611429923">Zheng, 2005</xref>: 136). Finding ideological affinities between the two neighbours is today critical, and many Chinese circles have sought to understand (and perhaps, in the long run, emulate) India’s independent path of state-building and political construction of diversity. Translating these personal interests and somehow ardent views of India’s cultural background into an effective political impact has been a key task of Chinese cultural attachés and consular officers, especially in China’s diplomatic representations in Kolkata and Mumbai. Through cultural activities sponsored, China has been tempted to portray a passionate (and positive) history of Sino–Indian interactions. Better to insist on ancient sociable and peaceful relations than on contemporary estranged ones, especially when so much is at stake in terms of bilateral commerce or geostrategic stakes.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0021909611429923">6</xref></sup> Also, the patronage of a well-respected personality has helped smoothing distrust about Chinese cultural activities on Indian soil. Ambassador Cheng Ruisheng and (the late) Indian President K. R. Narayanan (1930–2008) had shared a three decade-long friendship since the latter had become Indian ambassador to Beijing in 1976, and both relentlessly worked on promoting brighter readings of past and present China–India interactions.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0021909611429923">7</xref></sup> Yet personal stories of intimate relationships between Chinese and Indian leaders remain scarce.</p>
<p>Deeper knowledge of each other is quite lacking. Repeatedly, Chinese diplomats joining their new postings in India have offered naïve accounts of their first impressions of what India is, and their first ideas of the Indian society and identity. ‘Upon my arrival, I felt a conspicuous difference between reality and the India of my imagination’, wrote former Chinese ambassador to New Delhi Pei Yuanying (1995–8), ‘However, I gradually found out that behind the undisguised phenomenon of decadence, India is a country with great potentiality and outstanding achievements’, he continued (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0021909611429923">Pei, 2005a</xref>).</p>
<p>A former third secretary at the Chinese embassy in New Delhi, Zhang Zhixin, rejoiced the Indians seemed to always look like ‘happy people’, continuously enjoying religious holidays, feasting on any occasions, whether for a religious ceremony or a cricket match (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0021909611429923">Zhang, 2005a</xref>). The wife of a former commercial attaché in Delhi wrote she was paradoxically ‘fascinated’ by the beauty of the ruins in Old Delhi, despite the ‘dirtiness, disorder and decadence’ that emanate from them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0021909611429923">Ma, 2005</xref>: 25–6). On a more amusing note, former Consul-General in Mumbai Yuan Nansheng noted that a ‘problem’ seems to be a notion completely unknown to Indian people: when you receive the reply ‘no problem’ in India – and you hear this very answer quite a lot – this means to the contrary that you might be about to face ‘lots of problem ahead’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0021909611429923">Yuan, 2006</xref>: 85). ‘Poor without complaint’ he continues in his memoirs, Indians are, however, rich in spiritual life, a remarkable situation that for him prevents lingering social conflicts from exploding within an Indian society where, strangely enough, the poor do not resent the wealthy, unlike in China (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0021909611429923">Yuan, 2006</xref>: 9, 26, 372). Yet these candid views of India remain what they aim to be, merely a smoothed-over standard rhetoric and a commonly-heard diplomatic discourse praising the other’s achievements, culture and history.</p>

<title>The Judgemental Chinese: Dirty, Messy India</title>
<p>In the writings and personal accounts analyzed here, most Chinese officials rather tend to portray contemporary India with less enthusiasm and positive wording. The very name of India has often been associated in the world with stereotypes of poverty and dirtiness of a caste-ridden society. This ‘Mother Teresa image’ many have developed, despite the country’s most recent rise to power and wealth, is also very perceptible through the eyes of Chinese diplomats today. Judgemental views of India’s dirty landscape, messy and confusing society, and thorny domestic politics are recurrent in the memoirs gathered and translated for this research. Like many outsiders, Chinese scholars and diplomats hardly understand, when visiting India for the first time, how such a visibly-poor country can be rising to the status of an internationally-recognized power. Sun Yuxi was the Chinese envoy to New Delhi from 2005–7. Accustomed to hardship postings (as China’s former ambassador to Afghanistan or deputy head of mission in North Korea), he however recalls his first – quite negative – impression of Mumbai, economic lung of India in the mid-2000s, when flying over the city and landing at Chhatrapati Shivaji airport (‘A Bird View of Mumbai’):
<disp-quote>
<p>[. . . ] Mumbai is like a borderless refugee camp if we look from the plane. There is no clue that it is a modernized metropolis [. . .] It is definitely not comparable with Shanghai. Even in the poorest provinces in China, it would be difficult to find a place which is as dirty, chaotic, and inferior as Mumbai. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0021909611429923">Sun, 2005b</xref>: 3)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Former ambassador Pei Yuanying (1995–7) expressed similar bewilderment: ‘In the suburban areas of the capital city New Delhi and a big city like Mumbai, the amount of slums is really astonishing’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0021909611429923">Pei, 2005a</xref>).</p>
<p>In another blunt piece (<italic>The Chandni Chowk</italic>) that could have been written by any Western backpacker discovering Old Delhi and its main bazaar, Chandni Chowk, former first secretary of the Chinese embassy in New Delhi, Li Hubing bashed the place for its overcrowding and dirtiness, stressing his disgust of ‘urination in public’, and fearing for the safety of one of the major market hubs of India’s capital (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0021909611429923">Li, 2005</xref>: 27–35). After a visit in Kolkata – a place still stuck with a ‘City of Joy’ image – a former Chinese cultural attaché, Guo Shaowen, appeared confused and disturbed by the city’s extreme dirtiness and ‘lack of dignity’ when faced with the distressing number of beggars lying in the streets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0021909611429923">Guo, 2005</xref>: 36). In his article ‘An Impression of Calcutta’, he comparatively praised the Chinese clean and tidy living environment. Feeling ‘lucky to be Chinese’, he uncouthly harangues: ‘Yes! You were a shining civilization, a big country. So what? Look at your people’s living condition, in the famous city of Calcutta’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0021909611429923">Guo, 2005</xref>: 38).</p>
<p>Cultural attaché Wang Yamei (in New Delhi during 2001–2) similarly denounced the lack of valuable touristic infrastructures able to welcome foreign visitors. The latter often find a lavish five-starred palace or a gruesome backpacker guesthouse, their only choice of lodging throughout India (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0021909611429923">Wang, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Also the outcome of certain exasperation about the media and diplomatic buzz built up around the 21st century rise of India, such discourse reveals the highly-nationalistic opinion Chinese bureaucrats have cultivated. Other diplomats preferred lighter tones to underscore their puzzlement about India’s culture and manners. Yuan Nansheng has always been baffled by high-ranking Indian officials and their ‘dirty’ habits; he indeed recounts in his memoirs:
<disp-quote>
<p>[. . .] Dirty habits appear nearly everywhere. Even the officials and wealthy people are not clean in their daily life. Once I was attending one of my Indian friends’ birthday party, he used a fork to put a cake in my mouth. After I ate a little bit, he uses the remained part and put it into my wife’s mouth. After that, he put the same cake into the mouth of the Deputy Consul-General of Republic of Korea. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0021909611429923">Yuan Nansheng, 2006</xref>: 176)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Bewilderment, disgust, and incomprehension of India’s visible dirtiness and global image of poverty are commonly highlighted through these personal and rather undiplomatic – yet published – accounts. Criticism of a ‘not-so-democratic’ India is even better illustrated.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0021909611429923">
<title>Of Corruption, Cast and Communalism: A Not-So Democratic India</title>
<p>Disparaging views of modern India expressed by Chinese diplomats are no aberration. Western observers describe the same flaws and regularly point out the same obvious dysfunctional patterns of the contemporary Indian polity and society. Although democratic, India is still perceived by many Chinese observers as a messy institutional system, with an even more messy socio-cultural landscape still very much misunderstood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0021909611429923">Sun, 2005a</xref>: 211). Above all, two major concerns have captured the attention of Chinese officials, who have underlined in their writings – sometimes with irony – the salience of privilege and corruption, as well as a threatening rise of communalism and religious strife. They identified them as essential to explain India’s incomplete democratic and development achievements. And they often articulate blunt critics in their memoirs.</p>
<p>Corrupt behaviour is frequently underscored.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0021909611429923">8</xref></sup> India is a ‘democracy with corruption’, stresses Li Wenzhu, a former commercial attaché in New Delhi’s embassy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0021909611429923">Li, 2005</xref>: 161). He argues that, in India, more democracy means less efficiency in terms of economic development, as the governing ‘democratic’ authorities are inevitably divisive, corruption-tempted and, therefore, powerless. That alone explains why India lags behind China. ‘Two decades behind us’ even noted down the wife of Ambassador Sun Yuxi, when arriving in New Delhi in 2005 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0021909611429923">Ma, 2005</xref>: 184). The Indian capital’s brand new underground metro system, if modern, is however plagued by mismanagement and corruption, laments a young political counsellor who was posted in Delhi when the subway was inaugurated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0021909611429923">Yang, 2005</xref>: 193–9). Former Consul-General in Mumbai Yuan Nansheng, while posted in Mumbai, also despaired of the ‘bribing’ Indian culture:
<disp-quote>
<p>In the end of 2002, China’s Consulate-General in Mumbai imported some goods from Hong Kong for diplomatic use. According to international and diplomatic laws, these goods are duty-free. However, the Indian customs used various reasons to make the goods remained at the port for more than a month, just because we did not bribe them. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0021909611429923">Yuan Nansheng, 2006</xref>: part 5, chapter 2)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Also, again highlighting the privileges asked by Indian officials, especially regarding Chinese visa applications, Zhang Biao, a former head of the visa section in New Delhi’s Chinese embassy wrote:
<disp-quote>
<p>They also ignore our office hour in the morning and come in the afternoon. Sometimes, [they] will give us a call, emphasizing elegantly but proudly that they know somebody and ask for special help for the visa application process [. . .] Special requests by Indian officials are far from democracy, and these make me sick. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0021909611429923">Zhang Biao, 2005</xref>: 171)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Elections in India are a good illustration of the dysfunctionalities slated by Chinese diplomats. Expensive and mostly funded by local tycoons and the private sector, electoral campaigns involve huge amounts of money, underlines Yang Lin, who was a 25-year-old political officer in China’s embassy in New Delhi back in 2004 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0021909611429923">Yang, 2005</xref>: 177). Hence, he explains, the temptation for politicians to ‘buy votes’ and rig local elections, which are commonly based on patronage relationships, caste, religion and social class. Lambasting what he calls the ‘Dirty Minister’ phenomenon, he confessed to have been taken aback by the fact that even individuals with criminal records (‘murderers’) can be elected in India (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0021909611429923">Yang, 2005</xref>: 176). Former ambassador Li Lianqing noted that children usually joined electoral campaigns just ‘in exchange for candies and toys’ – concluding that the appellation ‘greatest democracy in the world’ was quite abused when applied to a country which granted such political responsibilities to under-aged people or worse, illiterate ones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0021909611429923">Li, 2007</xref>: 143–4).</p>
<p>With some dose of irony, a former third political secretary at the Chinese embassy in Delhi, Zhang Zhixin, narrates ‘how to become a successful politician’ in one of his articles. You just need to have a ‘strong body’ and ‘a loud voice’ to sustain endless public meetings, a ‘thick face’ to support constant criticism, and build up for yourself (read buy) a strong and positive reputation through highly-publicized actions before any election (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0021909611429923">Zhang, 2005b</xref>: 178–80). India’s version of democracy is, therefore, interestingly openly criticized by Chinese bureaucrats much inclined to defend their own country’s political record and concrete and sustainable rise to power.</p>
<p>Besides, patent expressions of communalism in India have disillusioned some Chinese observers, who have outspokenly disagreed with the general praise of India’s cultural and religious diversity management. For instance, when Ambassador Li Lianqing took up in 1984 his new position in New Delhi, it was a time of great internal volatility in northern India, with the unfolding of Sikh separatism and the struggle for an independent Khalistan in Punjab – which eventually led to the assassination of Prime Minister Indira Gandhi in October 1984. He then summarized the extremely tense situation:
<disp-quote>
<p>The Sikh people just run away and their houses are destroyed, including those of civil servants [. . .] We walked on the streets of New Delhi, and saw lots of the houses burning, cars being destroyed. It is extremely messy everywhere. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0021909611429923">Li Lianqing, 2007</xref>: 139)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Irrational behaviours and manifestations of religious hatred have often puzzled Chinese diplomats, uneasy at contemplating the salience of ethno-religious strife in India – and elsewhere in South Asia. Prompt to flatter China’s comparatively safer and pacified environment in the 1980s and 1990s, many have tended to tone down eulogistic discourse of India’s handling of its poly-ethnic and communal diversity. The same analysis has been offered by Cheng Ruisheng who was China’s ambassador in India during the Ayodhya temple dispute and the subsequent Mumbai anti-Muslim riots in 1992. He noted that the situation was then ‘unstable and misty’, especially during the visit to Mumbai he supervised for the Vice-Chairman of China’s People’s Congress in December 1992 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0021909611429923">Cheng Ruisheng, 2006a</xref>: 258–9). Yet it is worth noting that this global criticism of the intricacies of an India portrayed as a messy, dirty, and corrupted but ‘democratic’ country is not peculiar to Chinese observers. Many India-watchers in the West or in Asia would portray it the same way.</p>

<sec id="section11-0021909611429923">
<title>The Perceptive Chinese: Should we Nonetheless Learn From India?</title>
<p>Despite both the emotional descriptions and blunt criticism of India’s contemporary polity, perceptive views of India have been nurtured by Chinese India-watchers. Far more moderate and lucid about India’s recent rise and its implications, insightful comments made by some Chinese policymakers translate the concrete understanding of India’s political culture and state of affairs they have developed. Some have even argued that China should emulate India’s achievements. It is unnecessary to ‘look down on India’ and highlight only its development failures, insists, for instance, former commercial attaché Li Wenzhu (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0021909611429923">Li, 2005</xref>: 167). After all, China remains far behind Western societies in terms of socio-economic achievements, and struggles with corrupt behaviour patterns.</p>
<p>A former Consul in Mumbai in the 1990s, Zheng Ruixiang describes India’s political and institutional system in far more positive terms than most of his colleagues. In the introduction of one of his edited books, he spotlighted that, beside a vague period of trouble during the emergency rule in 1975–7, India has never experienced any military coup or political watershed since it gained independence in 1947 – contrary to its Pakistani, Bangladeshi or Nepali neighbours (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0021909611429923">Zheng, 2006</xref>: 8). Thanks to a robust yet regularly-amended 1950 constitution, India’s political institutions have proved to be less a mess than often perceived – which is an ‘uncommon example’ among Third World countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0021909611429923">Zheng, 2006</xref>: 8). India’s strengths clearly lie in the valuable rule of law implemented since 1947, and in the public administration system inherited from the British, he argues. The Indian policymaking process and reform implementation mechanisms might be slower, he further reckons, but <italic>in fine</italic> they have stronger bases than in many other developing states – including China (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0021909611429923">Zheng, 2006</xref>: 9). His tome on ‘The Rise of India and China–India Relationship’ (<italic>Yindu De Jueqi Yu Zhong Yin Guanxi</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0021909611429923">2006</xref>), as well as a short essay on ‘Personal Immersion in “Bhai-Bhai” Sentiments’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0021909611429923">Zheng, 2007</xref>) both reflect his subtle personal insights on a country where he has lived and which he refuses to fustigate.</p>
<p>Other Chinese bureaucrats have encouraged Chinese leaders – and people – to emulate India’s most recent successes, notably in its capacity to resist the thrust of Western cultures. Former ambassador Yuan Nansheng pointed out that, despite strong colonial legacies and postcolonial Western influence (through higher education, English language and the media notably), India boasts very powerful indigenous traditions, social beliefs, and cultural values that enable its society to resist utter Westernization – which many among China’s leadership seem to revile at the dawn of the 21st century. For him, the impact of the modernization imposed by the West is far less visible in India than in China, where the thrust of American culture and soft power is unmistakable among the elite, especially with the younger generations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0021909611429923">Yuan, 2006</xref>: 258). Indian leaders would, for instance, more commonly wear traditional Indian suits during official meetings, while Chinese politicians and businessmen would systematically put on Western suits. Here China could find some source of inspiration, he claims. He also seems to admire the ability of India’s civil society to challenge top leadership political circles. Fascinated by the Indian academia, Yuan Nansheng compliments in his book Indian intellectuals and scholars for daring to argue with state officials’ conduct and policies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0021909611429923">Yuan, 2006</xref>: 33). Indian research institutions are indeed not as dependent on the state as they are in China, and they can work on themes irrelevant to the central government’s prime interests, while promoting fundamental research far removed from daily concerns of the state. Chinese elites would, then, have much to learn about India, he concludes, despite recognizing that, overall, it would remain difficult to bind two countries that have utterly different political cultures, one encouraging cultural diversity and political multiplicity and the other promoting national unity and cultural homogeneity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0021909611429923">Yuan, 2006</xref>: 258–60).</p>

<sec id="section12-0021909611429923" sec-type="conclusions">
<title>Conclusion: Disconnecting Chinese Perceptions and Policymaking?</title>
<p>In the 1980s, Ambassador Li Lianqing asked his embassy staff to personally befriend the Indian media and publish op-eds, or short opinion articles, to promote friendly views of China and the value of a strong Sino–Indian relationship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0021909611429923">Li, 2007</xref>: 161–2). Three decades later, the examination of the very same opinion pieces, essays and memoirs published in Chinese reveal that the promotion of friendly reciprocal views between India and China is still a work-in-progress. With the notable exception of a few insightful comments made by some well-versed Chinese diplomats, the common Chinese bureaucrat posted in India would hardly marvel at India’s poly-religious society and ‘messy’ state of political affairs. A Chinese academic recently told us in Beijing that most Chinese political leaders still have the image of a ‘slum and caste-plagued India’, and that this negative perception is not about to change.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0021909611429923">9</xref></sup> For, when they go there, that is very much indeed what they see as soon as they land in New Delhi or Mumbai.</p>
<p>However, these sets of heteroclite and sometimes highly-distrustful imagery that Chinese policymaking circles have nurtured about contemporary India have not prevented them from searching to establish a rather constructive and stable relationship with India at the turn of the 21st century. This article aimed to demonstrate that critical views and stereotypical images of India explicitly developed by Chinese diplomatic elites have not directly translated into hostile state policymaking since the 1980s. The abundant literature promoting the ‘cooperation-cum-competition’ framework has underscored how both Indian and Chinese policymakers now appear willing to forge stronger bilateral interactions, despite negative perceptions of the other and a legacy of mutual mistrust – or at least not to prop up openly-conflictual relations for the years to come. True, deciphering their memoirs, Chinese leaders prove reluctant to further promote intimate interactions with their Indian counterparts. But their political decisions vis-à-vis India over the past decade have highlighted their willingness to disconnect basic perceptions and official foreign policymaking. When national interests lie in a more strategically-stable partnership, the likelihood of traditionally-critical views and hostile imagery of India negatively influencing policy appear to significantly decrease in this case study. It further highlights the rationality and long-term coherence of China’s India policy, despite regular deviance and flare-ups resulting from popular emotions and cultural beliefs. Indian and Chinese might not be brothers, as the song goes, but they can be partners when state interests command it.</p>
