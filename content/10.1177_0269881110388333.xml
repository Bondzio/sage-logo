<abstract>
<p>Reactivation of cocaine-associated memories plays a critical role in reinstating the cocaine-seeking behavior and causing relapse. Cocaine-induced conditioned place preference (CPP) was used as a behavioral paradigm indicative of cocaine-associated memory and repeated cocaine-free preference tests served as a behavioral procedure to retrieve such a memory in this study. Since D-cycloserine was reported to eradicate drug-associated memories, two other N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor agonists were assessed for their efficacy on facilitating the extinction of cocaine-induced CPP. Although D-cycloserine (30 mg/kg) abolished cocaine (10 mg/kg)-induced CPP, sarcosine (300 and 600 mg/kg) and D-serine (600 mg/kg) diminished the expression of such a cocaine memory. Sarcosine (600 mg/kg) and D-serine (600 mg/kg) did not affect the storage of this cocaine memory. It was of interest to note that D-cycloserine facilitated the extinction of cocaine-induced CPP in a fast and early-onset manner, while sarcosine and D-serine decreased cocaine-induced CPP expression in a delay-onset manner. D-cycloserine (30 mg/kg), D-serine (600 mg/kg) and sarcosine (600 mg/kg) did not affect the consolidation of cocaine (5 mg/kg)-induced CPP. Finally, sarcosine (at 600 mg/kg/day for 3 consecutive days) and D-serine (at 600 mg/kg/day for 3 consecutive days) did not produce observable aversive effect associated with their administration in a conditioned place aversion paradigm. Likewise, a similar dosing regimen of sarcosine or D-serine did not cause evident activity-impairing effect. In addition to D-cycloserine treatment, our results indicate that long-term treatment with D-serine and sarcosine may afford a therapeutic advance in suppressing the expression of cocaine-associated memory.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>A growing body of evidence has suggested that drug-associated cues can reinstate the drug-taking/seeking behavior during withdrawal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0269881110388333">Dravolina et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0269881110388333">Feltenstein and See, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0269881110388333">Lee et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0269881110388333">Moffett and Goeders, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0269881110388333">Rogers and See, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0269881110388333">Yan et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0269881110388333">Zhao et al., 2006</xref>). Cocaine-related cues have been proposed to reactivate the cocaine-associated memory, and subsequently to motivate the cocaine-seeking behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0269881110388333">Berke and Hyman, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0269881110388333">Ciccocioppo et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0269881110388333">Hyman and Malenka, 2001</xref>). Therefore, one reasonable treatment target for cocaine dependence is the cocaine-associated memory. In this study, cocaine-induced conditioned place preference (CPP) was used as a behavioral paradigm indicative of the cocaine-associated memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0269881110388333">Lien et al., 2004</xref>). Repeated cocaine-free preference tests were employed as a procedure partly to reactivate cocaine-induced CPP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0269881110388333">Bernardi et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0269881110388333">Kelley et al., 2007</xref>) and partly to reveal the maintenance of such a cocaine memory. Previously, we and others have demonstrated that psychostimulant-induced CPP was long-lasting and resistant to extinguish for weeks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0269881110388333">Achat-Mendes et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0269881110388333">Lien et al., 2004</xref>). Since D-cycloserine was found to facilitate the extinction of cocaine-induced CPP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0269881110388333">Botreau et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0269881110388333">Thanos et al., 2009</xref>), two other glycine site compounds were, thus, examined for their effects on facilitating the extinction of this cocaine-induced CPP in this study.</p>
<p>Glycine is a co-agonist amino acid with glutamate on the NMDA receptor. D-cycloserine is a partial agonist on glycine site of the NMDA receptor, whereas D-serine is a naturally occurring full agonist on glycine site in this regard (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0269881110388333">Stahl, 2008</xref>). Sarcosine is a naturally occurring inhibitor of the glycine transporter-1, which is in charge of synaptic glycine reuptake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0269881110388333">Stahl, 2008</xref>). Sarcosine may thereby potentiate NMDA receptor activity indirectly by increasing synaptic glycine levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0269881110388333">Stahl, 2008</xref>). Lately, D-cycloserine, an N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) agonist, was documented to facilitate the extinction of cocaine-induced CPP in rodent models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0269881110388333">Botreau et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0269881110388333">Thanos et al., 2009</xref>). Moreover, D-cycloserine-caused cocaine memory extinction seemed to be long-lasting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0269881110388333">Paolone et al., 2009</xref>). Since the findings that activation of the NMDA receptors was necessary for the consolidation of many drug-induced CPP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0269881110388333">Harris et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0269881110388333">Popik et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0269881110388333">Sakurai et al., 2007</xref>), it was reasonable to hypothesize that D-cycloserine caused the extinction of cocaine-induced CPP probably by facilitating the reconsolidation of extinction training (to associate original cues with no drug) in those studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0269881110388333">Botreau et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0269881110388333">Thanos et al., 2009</xref>). Given the findings that D-cycloserine can facilitate the extinction of cocaine-induced CPP memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0269881110388333">Botreau et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0269881110388333">Thanos et al., 2009</xref>), we decided to examine the modulating effects of D-serine and sarcosine on the extinction of cocaine-induced CPP in a mouse model.</p>

<title>Animals</title>
<p>Male C57BL/6NJ mice, at 8–10 weeks of age, were group housed in plastic cages (four per cage) in a temperature- and humidity-controlled colony room on a 12-h light/dark cycle with lights on at 07:00. Mice had access to food (Purina Mouse Chow, Richmond, IN) and tap water <italic>ad libitum</italic>. All experiments were conducted in a temperature- (23 ± 1°C) and humidity-controlled (70%) laboratory. This study was performed in accordance with the National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (NIH Publications No. 80-23) revised in 1996. All procedures were approved by the local Animal Care Committee at National Cheng Kung University College of Medicine.</p>

<title>NMDA ligands</title>
<p>D-cycloserine at a dose of 30 mg/kg was reported to facilitate the extinction of cocaine-associated memory in rodent models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0269881110388333">Botreau et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0269881110388333">Thanos et al., 2009</xref>). However, a previous study revealed that D-cycloserine at a dose of 30 mg/kg produced a mild aversive effect in rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0269881110388333">Nummink et al., 2007</xref>). Therefore, one maximal dose (30 mg/kg) of D-cycloserine was used in mice. Intraperitoneal pretreatment with D-serine at 560 mg/kg has been demonstrated to effectively modulate the anti-tonic seizure effect of MK-801, an NMDA antagonist, in Balb/c mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0269881110388333">Long et al., 2006</xref>). Latent inhibition on water-licking behavior was reversed by multiple injections of D-serine (600 mg/kg) in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0269881110388333">Labrie et al., 2008</xref>). Accordingly, a daily dose (600 mg/kg/day) of D-serine did not appear to cause an obvious toxic effect in mice. Likewise, intraperitoneal pretreatment with sarcosine at 300 mg/kg was found to ameliorate prepulse inhibition deficits in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0269881110388333">Chen et al., 2010</xref>). A recent study documented that high dosages of sarcosine were safe and effective in clinical use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0269881110388333">Lane et al., 2008</xref>). Therefore, 300 and 600 mg/kg were chosen for daily administration of D-serine and sarcosine in this study.</p>

<sec id="section5-0269881110388333">
<title>Pretest, training and test protocol for cocaine-induced CPP experiments</title>
<p>An unconditioned preference pretest, cocaine-induced CPP training, cocaine-free preference test and cocaine priming test were all conducted in commercial chambers designed for mice (MedAssociates Inc., Georgia, VT, USA) as described in our previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0269881110388333">Cherng et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0269881110388333">Kuo et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0269881110388333">Lai et al., 2008</xref>). A total of 166 mice were used in examining the modulating effect of NMDA ligands on the extinction of cocaine-induced CPP. In brief, mice were placed in any randomly chosen chamber and allowed a 15-min free navigation. In this pretest, the time spent in the two side compartments was used to indicate their unconditioned preference. In an attempt to avoid obvious unconditioned preference toward any compartment, 21 mice spending more than 40% of the time in any side or center compartment were excluded from the following experiments. For cocaine-induced CPP training, mice receiving an intraperitoneal injection of cocaine hydrochloride (10 mg/kg) were confined in their non-preferred compartment for 30 min (around 08:00 in the morning). At least 8 hours apart (around 16:00 in the afternoon), mice receiving an equivalent volume of saline injection were confined in their preferred compartment for 30 min. These procedures were repeated for another 2 days. Approximately 20 hours after the last bout of saline–compartment training (around 12:00), mice were placed in the center compartment of their corresponding chamber with guillotine doors open, starting a 15-min cocaine-free preference test for evaluating mice’ acquisition of cocaine-induced CPP memory. In the test, 12 mice spending longer than 20% of the time in the center compartment were excluded from further experiments because their cocaine-induced CPP could be confound by a substantial preference toward the neutral, center compartment. The magnitude of cocaine-induced CPP was represented by subtracting the time spent in the saline-paired compartment from the time spent in the cocaine-paired compartment for each individual mouse. A similar cocaine-free preference test was then repeated for the following few days partly to reactivate cocaine-induced CPP memory and partly to examine the magnitude of such a memory.</p>

<title>Modulating effect of D-cycloserine, D-serine and sarcosine in conjunction with a CPP test (extinction training) on the extinction of cocaine-induced CPP</title>
<p>Mice received a daily intraperitoneal injection with D-cycloserine (30 mg/kg), sarcosine (300 and 600 mg/kg), D-serine (300 and 600 mg/kg) or an equivalent volume of saline immediately after each cocaine-free preference test (T/1, T/2, T/3, T/4 and T/5). Maintenance of cocaine-induced CPP was finally assessed by a cocaine (10 mg/kg) priming test following T/5.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0269881110388333">
<title>Modulating effect of D-serine and sarcosine alone on the maintenance of cocaine-induced CPP</title>
<p>In order to examine the possibility that treatment with D-serine and sarcosine alone may affect the expression of cocaine-induced CPP, mice received no retest (omission of T/1, T/2 and T/3) but three injections (600 mg/kg/day for both sarcosine and D-serine). These mice were assessed for their cocaine-induced CPP on T/4, approximately 24 hours after the third injection. Since these mice displayed negligible cocaine-induced CPP on T4, their cocaine-induced CPP was continuously assessed for the following days (T/5, T/6 and T/7) after the cession of NMDA agonist injections.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0269881110388333">
<title>Modulating effect of D-cycloserine, D-serine and sarcosine on the acquisition of cocaine-induced CPP</title>
<p>One group of 47 mice was used to examine the modulating effects of D-cycloserine, D-serine and sarcosine on the consolidation of cocaine-induced CPP memory. Similar protocols for unconditioned preference pretest and cocaine-induced CPP training were used as mentioned previously. A training dose of cocaine was reduced to 5 mg/kg to avoid the ceiling magnitude of cocaine-induced CPP. An intraperitoneal injection with D-cycloserine (30 mg/kg), sarcosine (600 mg/kg), D-serine (600 mg/kg) or an equivalent volume of saline was given immediately before each cocaine-compartment and saline-compartment conditioning.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0269881110388333">
<title>Potentially aversive or activity-impairing effects of D-serine or sarcosine</title>
<p>A 15-min unconditioned preference pretest was employed in mice as described previously. In an attempt to examine a possible aversive effect associated with D-serine or sarcosine injection, mice receiving an intraperitoneal injection of sarcosine (600 mg/kg) or D-serine (600 mg/kg) were immediately confined in their preferred compartment for 30 min. At least 8 hours apart, mice receiving an equivalent volume of saline injection were confined in their non-preferred compartment for 30 min in the corresponding chambers. This procedure was repeated for 3 consecutive days in total. Approximately 20 hours after the last bout of training, mice placed in the center compartment of their corresponding chamber with guillotine doors open, started a 15-min free navigation test at a D-serine- or sarcosine-free status. The test was conducted to assess possible expression of D-serine- or sarcosine-induced conditioned place aversion (CPA). Magnitude of D-serine or sarcosine-induced CPA was represented by subtracting the time spent in saline-paired compartment from the time spent in D-serine or sarcosine-paired compartment for individual mouse. To explore an activity-impairing effect associated with multiple injections of D-serine (600 mg/kg/injection) or sarcosine (600 mg/kg/injection), a 10-min free navigation activity was monitored immediately before D-serine (or sarcosine) treatment and 24 hours after the third injection of D-serine (or sarcosine) by Optovarimax (Columbus Instrument, Columbus, OH, USA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0269881110388333">Lai et al., 2008</xref>).</p>

<p>Student’s <italic>t</italic>-tests were used to determine reliable acquisition of cocaine-induced CPP memory in the cocaine-free preference test (versus unconditioned preference pretests). Repeated-measure analyses of variance (ANOVAs) were employed to examine differences of cocaine-induced CPP magnitude across post-treatment tests and cocaine priming test followed by Bonferroni tests if appropriate. One-way ANOVAs were employed to examine unconditioned preference bias toward side compartment, effects of D-cycloserine, D-serine and sarcosine on the consolidation of cocaine-induced CPP, and aversive or activity-impairing effects of D-serine and sarcosine treatment.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We found that D-cycloserine, sarcosine and D-serine all diminished the expression of cocaine-induced CPP. D-cycloserine persistently abolished the expression of cocaine-induced CPP memory probably via a reconsolidation-related mechanism. In contrast, sarcosine and D-serine diminished cocaine memory expression irrelevant to a reconsolidation mechanism. Although treatment with D-cycloserine persistently changed cocaine-induced CPP, sarcosine and D-serine treatment did not affect the storage of such a cocaine memory. Moreover, it was of interest to note that D-cycloserine facilitated the extinction of cocaine-induced CPP in a fast and early-onset manner. However, sarcosine and D-serine decreased cocaine-induced CPP expression in a delay-onset mode. Such an expression-decreasing effect exerted by sarcosine and D-serine was short lasting. Furthermore, we found that six consecutive injections of D-cycloserine (30 mg/kg), sarcosine (600 mg/kg/injection) or D-serine (600 mg/kg/injection) did not affect the consolidation of cocaine-induced CPP. The implication of the latter finding was that chronic treatment with D-cycloserine, sarcosine and D-serine at the current doses used was less likely to facilitate the establishment of a new cocaine-supported memory. Finally, sarcosine (at a dose of 600 mg/kg) and D-serine (at a dose of 600 mg/kg) did not produce aversive or activity-impairing effect.</p>
<p>D-cycloserine, sarcosine and D-serine may decrease the expression of cocaine-induced CPP via different mechanisms. Recently, reactivation of a memory has been hypothesized to induce a labile period during which the memory could be modified or reconsolidated as its original form. Therefore, one possibility is that the NMDA agonists act to impair the reconsolidation of cocaine-induced CPP memory. Originally established cocaine-induced CPP, accordingly, ought to be partly or completely changed. The other possibility is that the NMDA agonists facilitated the extinction training. Finally, treatment with NMDA agonists may affect the retrieval of acquired cocaine-induced CPP memory. The latter two possibilities predict that the acquired cocaine memory is intact. D-cycloserine (30 mg/kg) was found to persistently decrease the expression of cocaine-induced CPP memory in the experiment designed for D-cycloserine administration after the memory reactivation; therefore, D-cycloserine was likely to impair the reconsolidation of the acquired cocaine-induced CPP memory. In fact, D-cycloserine-treated mice exhibited a negligible CPP magnitude in the cocaine-priming test. Although the observed effect of D-cycloserine on cocaine memory is in agreement with other work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0269881110388333">Paolone et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0269881110388333">Thanos et al., 2009</xref>), whether D-cycloserine can eradicate the cocaine memory via disturbing reconsolidation or facilitating extinction training remains to be determined. After all, a thorough modification of acquired memory by replacing it with a new memory in the reconsolidation phase is anticipated to render similar results to the establishment of a new learning (extinction training). Sarcosine (300 and 600 mg/kg) and D-serine (600 mg/kg) treatment may diminish the expression of cocaine-induced CPP memory by disrupting the retrieval of acquired cocaine memory for two reasons. First, sarcosine (600 mg/kg) and D-serine (600 mg/kg) treatment decreased cocaine-induced CPP even when the memory reactivation procedure was omitted. Second, sarcosine (300 and 600 mg/kg) and D-serine (600 mg/kg)-treated mice all displayed an intact cocaine memory in the cocaine-priming test. Since sarcosine and D-serine can mitigate the retrieval of cocaine memory without a prerequisite of memory reactivation, the expression-disrupting effects of sarcosine and D-serine should be independent of the reconsolidation hypothesis. Cocaine memory-disrupting results of sarcosine and D-serine can be more likely attributed to these drug effects on the retrieval of cocaine memory. The CPP expression-decreasing effect of sarcosine and D-serine disappeared 4 days after the cession of sarcosine and D-serine treatment, suggesting a short-lasting character for their effect. A long-term treatment with sarcosine and D-serine should be examined to extend the understanding for their cocaine memory-inhibiting and potential side effects.</p>
<p>Activation of the NMDA receptor has been demonstrated to be involved in the reconsolidation of a reactivated Pavlovian memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0269881110388333">Torras-Garcia et al., 2005</xref>). Moreover, cumulative data have indicated that the NMDA receptor is responsible for the consolidation of associative memories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0269881110388333">Riedel et al., 2003</xref>). Nevertheless, pretreatment with D-cycloserine (30 mg/kg), sarcosine (600 mg/kg) and D-serine (600 mg/kg) did not affect the consolidation of cocaine (5 mg/kg/conditioning)-induced CPP memory. These findings, taken together, suggest that D-cycloserine (a total of 180 mg), sarcosine (a total of 3.6 g) and D-serine (a total of 3.6 g) treatment do not facilitate establishing a new cocaine-supported learning. Therefore, D-cycloserine, sarcosine and D-serine at the present doses used may warrant a clinical use to suppress the retrieval of cocaine-supported memories.</p>
<p>D-cycloserine worked best when it was given at the early phase of the extinction training with few times (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0269881110388333">Paolone et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0269881110388333">Ressler et al., 2004</xref>). We repeated and extended these findings by indicating that even one injection of D-cycloserine (at 30 mg/kg) immediately following the CPP test diminished later expression of cocaine-induced CPP. While D-cycloserine abolished cocaine-induced CPP in an early-onset manner, sarcosine and D-serine diminished cocaine-induced CPP in a slow-onset manner. Moreover, D-cycloserine, but not sarcosine or D-serine, treatment decreased the expression of cocaine-induced CPP in the cocaine-priming test. These results indicated that the underlying mechanisms for the cocaine-induced CPP-inhibiting effect produced by D-cycloserine and sarcosine/D-serine were different. Furthermore, D-serine is an agonist on the glycine site of the NMDA receptor, while sarcosine is a glycine transporter-1 inhibitor. Given activation of the glycine site of NMDA receptor is critical for the inhibiting effect of these two ligands used on cocaine-induced CPP expression, it is reasonable to predict that D-serine could be more potent than sarcosine in decreasing cocaine-induced CPP. We demonstrated that sarcosine (at 300 mg/kg) effectively diminished cocaine-induced CPP, while D-serine (at 300 mg/kg) did not exert such an inhibiting effect on cocaine-induced CPP. The implication of these results is that glycine site activation, at best, plays a partial role in determining the onset of such a cocaine-induced CPP-decreasing effect produced by sarcosine and D-serine.</p>
<p>Although we found that D-serine treatment (600 mg/kg/injection) along with the CPP test did not affect cocaine-primed CPP performance, D-serine (100 mg/kg) was reported to effectively reduce cocaine-primed reinstatement of cocaine-taking behavior in two studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0269881110388333">Kelamangalath et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0269881110388333">Kelamangalath and Wagner, 2010</xref>). The discrepancy may arise from the differences in species and conditioning paradigm used, as well as total cocaine amount that animals received between our and other studies. CGS19755, an NMDA antagonist, decreased striatal dopamine release in rats but did not alter dopamine release in mouse striatum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0269881110388333">Waters et al., 1996</xref>), suggesting that mice and rats could hold various densities of meso-limbic NMDA receptors and/or these two species display different NMDA-mediated physiological functions. Accordingly, D-serine can exert distinctive effects on the expression of cocaine-associated memory in rats and mice. Moreover, a few studies documented that presentation of the drug alone failed to make animals recall drug-produced Pavlovian conditioning following its extinction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0269881110388333">Milekic et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0269881110388333">Valjent et al., 2006</xref>). We, thus, proposed that certain extinction process used in Pavlovian conditioning might serve as an aversive experience to partial out the hedonic value of drugs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0269881110388333">Cherng and Yu, 2009</xref>). In contrast, the extinction process used in operant conditioning manifested the reinforcing efficacy of drugs due to animals’ development of drug dependence by previous drug self-administration training. In addition, many lines of evidence demonstrated that different anatomical substrates were responsible for drug-primed and conditioned context/cues-primed drug-seeking behavior in drug self-administration studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0269881110388333">Fuchs et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0269881110388333">Grimm and See, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0269881110388333">McLaughlin and See, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0269881110388333">Meil and See, 1997</xref>). For example, a previous study even demonstrated that the NMDA receptor was involved in cocaine-primed, but not conditioned context/cues-primed, reinstatement of the cocaine-taking behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0269881110388333">Kelamangalath et al., 2007</xref>). Therefore, the underlying mechanisms for drug-primed reinstatement of conditioned behavior in Pavlovian and operant conditioning paradigms are most likely different. Thus, D-serine might exhibit a distinctively modulating effect on cocaine-primed conditioned behavior in cocaine-induced CPP and cocaine self-administration paradigms.</p>
<p>Although we did not examine the modulating effect of D-cycloserine, D-serine or sarcosine on natural reward-supported memory expression, a few studies revealed that D-cycloserine and D-serine did not seem to affect such memory expression. For example, D-cycloserine did not affect stress-reduced sucrose intake in rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0269881110388333">Papp and Moryl, 1996</xref>). Moreover, D-serine treatment did not affect sucrose-primed reinstatement of sucrose-seeking behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0269881110388333">Kelamangalath et al., 2009</xref>). Therefore, the memory expression-decreasing effect of these NMDA ligands could be specific to cocaine-associated memory and did not generalize to natural reward-supported memory expression. Since D-cycloserine, sarcosine and D-serine all diminish the expression of cocaine-associated memory but fail to facilitate the acquisition of cocaine-associated memory, we suggest that long-term treatment with these NMDA agonists may afford a therapeutic advance in suppressing cocaine relapse.</p>
