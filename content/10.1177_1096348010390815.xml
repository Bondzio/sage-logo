<abstract>
<p>Planning or deciding where to vacation may rely on nonrational thought and be influenced by imaginative processes such as creating visions of oneself in future consumption experiences together with associated emotions. This study examined the influence of pictorial and textual stimuli on dimensions of consumer consumption vision. It also tested whether elaborate and quality consumption visionary responses to print advertising, mediated by emotional responses, result in heightened product interest and expedited purchase decisions. Two hundred and sixty community members participated in the study measuring consumption vision, emotions, and decision making by responding to simulated advertising material. Pictures together with concrete words influenced consumption vision elaboration, whereas instructions to imagine alone versus concrete words influenced consumption vision quality. A series of standard regression analyses tested these propositions and confirmed emotion as a mediating variable for consumption vision and vacation purchase decisions.</p>

<p>Tourism and consumer behavior research has focused increasingly on the more symbolic and emotive components of consumer behavior (see, e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1096348010390815">Branthwaite, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1096348010390815">Gnoth, Zins, &amp; Lengmueller, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1096348010390815">Goossens, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1096348010390815">Laros &amp; Steenkamp, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1096348010390815">Miller &amp; Stocia, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1096348010390815">Petrova &amp; Cialdini, 2005</xref>). Such research represents an emerging shift of attention toward some important but previously neglected aspects of the consumption experience. It has been suggested that tourists’ vision of their future vacation, referred to in this article as “consumption vision,” plays a major role in the information search process, providing the tourists with an intrinsic information source that is often consulted throughout the decision-making process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1096348010390815">Crotts, 1999</xref>). The potential tourists also refer to the affective or emotional response of these visions as they provide the psychological cues that are said to direct them to their final purchase decision (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1096348010390815">Neelamegham &amp; Jain, 1999</xref>). However, the relationship between these two phenomena (consumption vision and emotion) and their subsequent influence on tourism consumers’ purchase decision remains largely unexplored within a tourism context.</p>
<p>This study aims to investigate the impact of the interrelationship of consumption vision and emotion on tourists’ decision-making behavior. For this research, consumption vision is defined as the visual images that consumers create in their minds when considering the purchase or use of a product (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1096348010390815">Phillips, Olson, &amp; Baumgartner, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1096348010390815">Walker &amp; Olson, 1994</xref>). Consumers who experience elaborate consumption visions are generally able to vicariously experience the self-relevant “experiences” and “consequences” of the product’s or service’s usage. Consumers are therefore provided with immediate feedback that informs them of the potential product-related benefits they may encounter should they decide to purchase the product or service (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1096348010390815">Dann, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1096348010390815">Phillips et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1096348010390815">Schwarz, Zuma, &amp; Clore, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1096348010390815">Tuan Pham, 1998</xref>). Previous research in this specific area (see, e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1096348010390815">Bone &amp; Ellen, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1096348010390815">Branthwaite, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1096348010390815">Keller &amp; McGill, 1994</xref>) has confirmed a positive relationship between ad-evoked consumption vision and the consumer’s emotional response to various print advertising stimuli. For example, it has been revealed that should an advertiser be successful in evoking elaborate consumption visions among consumers, they in turn can expect consumers to experience heightened emotional responses to their advertising efforts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1096348010390815">Keller &amp; McGill, 1994</xref>). However, to date, research has yet to reveal conclusive findings that attempt to explain how this relationship affects the tourism consumers’ decision process when considering their destination choice. More specifically, the extent to which tourism consumers’ consumption vision, when mediated by emotional response, contributes to their inclination to expedite their tourism purchase is yet to be explored. This study aims to contribute to this growing area of tourism consumer research by investigating the influence of these two advertising-induced intrinsic variables on the tourists’ propensity to bypass the alternative evaluation phase of the decision process and seek immediate closure on their tourism purchase.</p>

<title>Consumption Vision</title>
<p>Consumption vision is a form of mental imagery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1096348010390815">Phillips et al., 1995</xref>). From a consumer behavior perspective, mental imagery is defined as a nonverbal memory process that entails “sensory representations” of ideas, feelings, and objects or experiences with objects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1096348010390815">MacInnis &amp; Price, 1987</xref>). It is said to involve a cognitive process in which perceptual information is represented in working memory via the creation of daydreams, fantasies, and imaginative construction. With relation to intangible or experiential purchases, consumers’ mental image of a product is at times the only source of information available to assist them in forming a judgment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1096348010390815">Schwarz, 1986</xref>). In other words, if the target is not present in the direct physical environment, people may still perform their evaluations by examining their mental representation of the target, or the image that comes to mind when they imagine their consumption experience. It was <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1096348010390815">Walker and Olson’s (1994)</xref> interpretation of this form of mental imagery that led to the creation of the term <italic>consumption vision</italic>, formally defined as “ visual images of certain product related-behaviours and their consequence—they consist of concrete and vivid mental images that enable consumers to vicariously experience the self-relevant consequences of product use” (p. 27).</p>
<p>Previous research has revealed that mental imagery/consumption vision is a multidimensional construct (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1096348010390815">Babin &amp; Burns, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1096348010390815">Bone &amp; Ellen, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1096348010390815">Miller, Hadjimarcou, &amp; Miciak, 2000</xref>). According to these studies, there appears to be general consensus that marketing communication can evoke mental imagery that can be defined in terms of quantity, vividness, intensity, clarity, and extent of elaboration. Elaboration refers to the extent to which the individuals elaborate on the mental images that come to mind as a result of their viewing an advertisement, whereas quantity, vividness, intensity, and clarity of the images represent the quality of the consumption vision. Several streams of research in consumer behavior have also revealed that information can be processed at different levels of cognitive elaboration (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1096348010390815">Cacioppo &amp; Perry, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1096348010390815">Greenwald &amp; Leavitt, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1096348010390815">MacInnis &amp; Price, 1987</xref>). For example, according to the elaboration likelihood model, information processed at low levels (nonelaborate) is said to elicit only a recognition response, whereas information that is processed at higher levels of elaboration is said to involve the integration of data from multiple knowledge structures, which in turn influences affective or emotional experiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1096348010390815">Cacioppo &amp; Perry, 1984</xref>).</p>
<p>Consumption vision is conceptually different from, and not to be confused with, consumer expectations. The construct of consumption vision is based on the process of mental imagery, a process whereby a person calls into working memory a range of images that are associated with beliefs and feelings. A consumption vision is generally triggered by some sort of stimulus target/event (e.g., an advertisement). Consumption vision is about imagery and potentially transporting oneself into an imagined “consumption experience.” The concept differs from consumers’ expectations in that it is more about mentally experiencing or trying out a range of consumption experiences. Within an imaginary consumption experience the potential consumer can engage or alter what product attributes are imagined and experienced. Expectations are more the standards by which the product is evaluated. Although it is possible that expectations can be formed as a result of the consumption vision, the two constructs are temporally distinct: consumption vision is the imaginative present experience whereas expectations are the standards against which the actual experience is judged.</p>

<sec id="section3-1096348010390815">
<title>Consumption Vision and Emotion</title>
<p>Consumers are likely to express various emotions when experiencing their consumption visions, largely as a result of the positive affect that often accompanies visions of desired future situations. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1096348010390815">Hirschman (1985)</xref> revealed that mental imagery acts as a form of emotional stimuli, particularly if the available external information does not directly stimulate the emotional senses. This finding suggests that consumers are not always solely dependent or influenced by external stimuli alone when making their purchase choices; rather, they construct their own images or consumption visions that contain much more than just the external cues provided by the advertiser. Additional support for this relationship is presented by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1096348010390815">Goossens (1994)</xref>, who claims that consumers who imagine themselves interacting with a particular experience have to activate relevant “self-experience” knowledge structures in memory. Consequently, consumers also indirectly activate the emotional structures that align with such experiences. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1096348010390815">Schwarz et al. (1988)</xref> further demonstrates this relationship with their “how do I feel about it” heuristic. This heuristic implies that rather than basing their evaluations on a gradual analysis of the available facts, consumers may take a short cut and refer to the emotional responses to their consumption vision as a significant source of relevant information and ask themselves “how do I feel about it?” <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1096348010390815">Tuan Pham (1998)</xref> claims that the “how do I feel about it” heuristic is significantly higher when consumers have consummatory motives that are intrinsically rewarding, such as planning a holiday, as opposed to instrumental motives that involve decisions that are seldom rewarding or undertaken to achieve some other goal (e.g., planning a business trip). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1096348010390815">Keller and McGill (1994)</xref> present additional support for the consumption vision–emotion relationship with their “imagery heuristic.” Not unlike the “how do I feel about it” heuristic, this heuristic proposes that consumers often evaluate a certain product’s desirability based on their emotional response to their consumption vision.</p>

<title>The Evocation of Consumption Vision</title>
<p>According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1096348010390815">Rossiter (1982)</xref>, advertisers have long realized the importance of advertising that creates mental images in the targeted buyer’s mind while they are conducting their external information searches. Furthermore, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1096348010390815">Kim, Hwang, and Fesenmaier (2005)</xref> suggest that the effectiveness of advertising and promotional literature is not limited simply to the purchase of the product itself but is extended to a range of psychological and cognitive aspects that in turn may have a substantial influence on the target’s attitudes toward the object. This finding is supported by two primary theories—the availability valence hypothesis and the dual-coding hypothesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1096348010390815">Bone &amp; Ellen, 1992</xref>). Availability valence hypothesis claims that information processed using mental imagery is more likely to be elaborated on, which, in turn, may enhance attitudinal judgments toward the advertised product (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1096348010390815">Kisielius &amp; Sternthal, 1984</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1096348010390815">1986</xref>). Dual coding hypothesis suggests that information processed using imagery is stored as both semantic codes and imagery, which again potentially results in stronger attitudes toward the product featured in the advertisement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1096348010390815">Unnava &amp; Burnkrant, 1991</xref>). Both these hypotheses tend to position mental imagery as having primary influence on the feelings and attitudes generated by advertising (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1096348010390815">Bone &amp; Ellen, 1992</xref>). Further research has also revealed that advertising that features imagery-inducing stimuli has the potential to influence the consumer to bypass rational defenses and evaluations; foster a richer, more direct emotional experience; clarify goals and ideas; and stimulate self-persuasion and produce self-fulfilling fantasies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1096348010390815">Branthwaite, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1096348010390815">Miller and Stocia (2003)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1096348010390815">Goossens (2000)</xref>, for tourism destination advertisements to be effective in evoking mental imagery they must contain vivid information. Vivid information has been defined as that which draws and holds attention and excites the imagination because it evokes concrete and mental imagery, is emotionally interesting, and stimulates the senses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1096348010390815">Nisbett &amp; Ross, 1990</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1096348010390815">Miller and Stocia (2003)</xref> contend that the key process in producing vividness effects is the mental imagery evoking quality of the information, which has been shown to moderate both attitudinal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1096348010390815">Babin &amp; Burns, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1096348010390815">Bone &amp; Ellen, 1992</xref>) and memory responses to advertising (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1096348010390815">Burns, Biswas, &amp; Babin, 1993</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1096348010390815">Unnava and Burnkrant (1991)</xref> contend that pictorial images, concrete words, and instructions to imagine—that is, textual copy that encourages the viewers to imagine themselves experiencing the advertised destination—are the three main forms of external stimuli known to stimulate mental imagery. Consistent with these findings, a study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1096348010390815">Burns et al. (1993)</xref> revealed that the use of concrete wording was more effective than abstract wording with regard to effectiveness in evoking mental images. However, despite this knowledge pertaining to the successful evocation of visual images that moderate the consumer’s attitudinal responses to advertising, little is known with regard to the influence of ad-induced consumption visions on the tourism consumer’s decision behavior.</p>

<sec id="section5-1096348010390815">
<title>Consumption Vision, Emotion, and the Tourism Consumer’s Purchase Decision</title>
<p>Prior research efforts have visited the notion of imagery and tourism. However, it is apparent that these attempts have predominantly focused on destination image. The main difference between destination image and consumption vision is that the former refers to the publicly held perception of the destination, whereas the latter refers to the process of imagining one to experiencing the destination. Given the intangible and experiential nature of the tourism product, from a practical sense, the successful evocation of consumption vision should be considered a priority by destination marketers as it assists the tourism consumer to anticipate and vicariously participate in tourism experiences prior to purchase and mentally “try out” the different choice alternatives before they buy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1096348010390815">Goossens, 2000</xref>). According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1096348010390815">Etzioni (1988)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1096348010390815">MacInnis and Price (1987)</xref>, if the consumption vision generates an emotional response, tourism consumers may be more inclined to seek further information regarding an advertised product as opposed to searching for alternatives and evaluating other options. It has also been suggested that when consumers respond to their emotions throughout their decision process, they are more likely to purchase the product in an impulsive manner as a result of their forming an emotional attachment to the product (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1096348010390815">Elster, 1985</xref>). However, empirical evidence supporting these propositions is yet to be revealed. Prior research has been successful in theorizing the influence of ad-induced mental imagery on attitude formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1096348010390815">Kisielius &amp; Sternthal, 1984</xref>), product recall (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1096348010390815">Unnava &amp; Burnkrant, 1991</xref>), attraction (liking; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1096348010390815">Decrop, 2007</xref>), and emotion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1096348010390815">Goossens, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1096348010390815">Hirschman, 1985</xref>). However, researchers have yet to examine the mediating influence of emotional reactions to elaborate and quality consumption visions have on the consumer’s final purchase decision. To address this gap, we examine the following research question:</p>

<title>Sample</title>
<p>The sample for this study comprised 260 respondents. A randomly selected sample of 2,300 Australian residents, drawn from a consumer database known as “The Australian Master File,” was invited to participate in the study. The consumers on the list had previously nominated themselves as interested and willing to participate in consumer-based research, thus meeting Privacy Laws. Data were collected using a mailed questionnaire and resulted in an 11% response rate. Wave analysis was applied to check for nonresponse bias associated with nonreturns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1096348010390815">Creswell, 2003</xref>). This technique involved the examination of the returned questionnaires week by week to determine if the responses on select items changed in conjunction with the time in which the participants took to respond to the questionnaire. There were no apparent differences, in terms of the survey responses, between those who returned the questionnaire within the first week and the fourth week of the data collection period. The sample was evenly distributed in terms of age group, and the majority of the respondents were of Australian origin (90%). Sixty-eight percent of the respondents were female. Almost 70% of the respondents were either married or in a partnership.</p>

<title>Stimuli</title>
<p>The data used in this research were based on a 2 (picture: present or absent) × 2 (text: instruction to imagine or concrete words) research design whereby the respondents received one of four simulated print advertisements designed to depict a fictional island holiday scene (see <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-1096348010390815">Appendix A</xref> for examples of the advertisements). We chose a beach holiday destination as our focus as this is a reasonably familiar holiday product.

<title>Variables</title>
<sec id="section11-1096348010390815">
<title>Consumption vision</title>
<p>After reviewing the advertising stimuli, respondents completed a 14-item scale designed to measure the extent of <italic>elaboration</italic> of a participant’s consumption vision (see <xref ref-type="app" rid="app2-1096348010390815">Appendix B</xref>). Ten of the items (adapted from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1096348010390815">Phillips et al., 1995</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1096348010390815">Walker &amp; Olson, 1994</xref>) were specifically designed to enable the respondent to record their visionary and imaginary responses to the presented advertisement. Respondents were asked to rate their level of agreement with statements such as: “While reviewing the attached advertisement many images came to mind,” “I could easily construct a story about myself and the destination based on the mental images that came to mind,” and “It was easy for me to imagine being at the destination portrayed in the advertisement.” The remaining four items were adapted from the Miller et al.’s (2000) Ad-Evoked Imagery Scale, whereby respondents were asked to rate the <italic>quality</italic> of their mental images on four dimensions—vividness, clarity, intensity, and clarity.

<title>Emotional responses</title>
<p>Respondents’ emotional response to the stimuli was measured using nine items, five of which were adapted from the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1096348010390815">Well’s (1964)</xref> Emotional Quotient Questionnaire and four that were developed from the literature (see <xref ref-type="app" rid="app2-1096348010390815">Appendix B</xref>). Examples of the types of questions that emerged from the literature surrounding the emotional construct included the following: “This advertisement makes me feel good” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1096348010390815">Emmons, 1986</xref>), “This advertisement stimulates a desire within me to experience the destination” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1096348010390815">Keller &amp; McGill, 1994</xref>), and “I feel an emotional attachment to the destination” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1096348010390815">Etzioni, 1988</xref>). A 7-point Likert-type scale was again employed to measure the responses, with 1 representing low levels of agreement and 7 representing high levels of agreement.</p>

<title>Decision making</title>
<p>Finally, respondents’ <italic>decision making</italic> with respect to level of product interest and propensity to want to expedite their purchase decision was measured. A 9-item scale was conceptualized on review of the relevant literature and an examination of existing measures of buyer behavior. The items were adopted from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1096348010390815">Macleit, Allen, and Madden’s (1993)</xref> “Brand Interest” Scale and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1096348010390815">Murray’s (1985)</xref> Non-Search Purchase Tendency Scale. Macleit et al.’s scale was designed specifically to measure the <italic>extent of interest</italic> a consumer has on a particular product or brand, whereas Murray’s scale measured the probability that a consumer would forgo much, if not all, systematic prepurchase information search activity by making an almost <italic>immediate product selection.</italic> Again, responses to this scale were captured using a 7-point Likert-type scale (1 = <italic>strongly disagree</italic> and 7 = <italic>strongly agree</italic>).</p>

<title>Manipulation Checks</title>
<p>To check the effectiveness of the stimuli in terms of its imagery evoking ability, the advertisements were subjected to manipulation checks. To test for the imagery evoking ability of the images, participants were asked, “When you first looked at the picture in the ad, how easy was it to recognize that it was a picture of an island destination?” Participants responded via a 7-point Likert-type scale ranging from 1 = <italic>extremely difficult</italic> to 7 = <italic>extremely easy</italic>. For the concrete words variable, respondents were asked, “Were you able to form a mental picture in your mind of the objects or images that these words were representing?” They responded by circling either “yes,” “no,” or “unsure.” Finally, for the instructions to imagine stimulus, respondents were asked, “Did these instructions to imagine tell you to imagine or picture something in your mind?” Again the participants were given the choice of “yes,” “no,” or “unsure.” These manipulation checks were adapted from a study conducted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1096348010390815">Babin and Burns (1997)</xref>, which measured the effectiveness of similar stimulus and were shown to be very efficient in terms of their reliability. Realism checks were also included to ensure the content presented in the advertisement was typical of what one would observe in a tourism advertisement.</p>

<title>Procedure</title>
<p>Each member of the sample population received an advertisement and corresponding instructions requesting that the respondent review the enclosed advertisement and then complete the questionnaire containing items to measure consumption vision, emotional response, and decision behavior. One $200 and two $100 department store gift vouchers were offered through a prize draw as an incentive to participate. A reply paid envelope was also included with the questionnaire. Ethical clearance was sought and received to conduct the research.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>A series of independent groups <italic>t</italic> tests revealed no significant differences in terms of the respondents’ age, gender, origin, and marital status and their visionary and emotional responses to the advertisements used in this study. Next, we report on the scale properties, followed by the hypotheses testing.</p>
<sec id="section17-1096348010390815">
<title>Scale Dimensionality and Reliability</title>
<p>The items comprising the <italic>consumption vision scale</italic> were considered satisfactory for factor analysis with the Keiser–Meyer–Olkin (KMO) test measuring .93 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1096348010390815">Coakes &amp; Steed, 2003</xref>). In addition, Bartlett’s test of sphericity was significant, providing further support for the factorability of the items. The rule of thumb for sample size in a factor analysis states that there must be a minimum of five responses per item (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1096348010390815">Hair et al., 2006</xref>). Given that the consumption vision scale had 14 items, the current study’s sample size of 260 was considered sufficient. A review of the correlation and anti-image matrices also confirmed the factorability of the items, with several considerable correlations among the items and all measures of sampling adequacy above .5. The analysis was performed using Varimax rotation. Examination of the eigenvalues suggested a two-factor solution for the scale accounting for a total of 72% of the variance. Nine of the 10 elaboration and vividness items loaded cleanly on the first factor (labeled elaboration), and all four quality items loaded onto the second factor (labeled quality). The item “The mental images that came to mind were clear and specific” raised slight concern for the content validity of the scale, as the factor loadings suggested it could belong to both the elaboration and quality dimensions. After careful review of the item and consideration of the item and its role in the scale, a decision was made to omit the item as the clarity and specifics of the visions are adequately measured via the quality dimension of the scale. <xref ref-type="app" rid="app2-1096348010390815">Appendix B</xref> presents the items of the consumption vision scale and their factor loadings. A reliability analysis was performed on the elaboration and quality dimensions of consumption vision, revealing Cronbach αs of .94 and .92, respectively. These results confirmed that the two dimensions are both reliable and internally consistent.</p>
<p>The <italic>emotion scale</italic> items were subjected to a principal components factor analysis and a reliability analysis revealing a 9-item unidimensional scale accounting for 77% of the variance with a Cronbach α of .96 (see <xref ref-type="app" rid="app2-1096348010390815">Appendix B</xref>).</p>
<p>A robust two-factor solution for the <italic>decision behavior scale</italic> was found accounting for 80% of the variance. The first dimension, labeled <italic>product interest</italic>, comprised five items that were representative of the respondents’ interest in the advertised tourism product. The second dimension, labeled <italic>purchase immediacy</italic>, comprised four items representing the respondents’ willingness to buy the advertised product without seeking information on alternatives and their confidence that the product was the right choice for them. The scale proved to be internally consistent presenting Cronbach αs of .92 for the product interest dimension and .91 for purchase immediacy. <xref ref-type="app" rid="app2-1096348010390815">Appendix B</xref> presents the items belonging to the decision behavior scale and their corresponding factor loadings.</p>

<sec id="section18-1096348010390815">
<title>Realism and Manipulation Checks</title>
<p>A mean of 6.0 signified that the respondents did not experience any difficulties identifying the island scene depicted in the advertisement, and the majority of respondents (more than 96%) were able to generate a mental picture of the images the concrete words were representing. The instructions to imagine were also effective with 93% of respondents agreeing that this stimulus instructed them to imagine being at the destination. In terms of the realism of the advertisement, 94% of the respondents agreed that the content was representative of that type of advertisement one would likely see in a “real-world” printed tourism advertisement. The results confirmed that the manipulations were effective.</p>

<sec id="section19-1096348010390815">
<title>Hypotheses Testing</title>
<p>To test Hypotheses 1 and 2, two 2 × 2 analyses of variances (ANOVAs) were conducted. First, we tested the effect of the pictorial and text stimuli on the extent of <italic>elaboration</italic> of consumption vision. Although there was no main effect, there was an interaction effect for the elaboration, <italic>F</italic>(1, 244) = 5.45, <italic>p</italic> = .002. For the text × picture interaction, simple effects tests, <italic>F</italic>(1, 245) = 8.93, <italic>p</italic> = .00, showed that consumption vision elaboration was greater when a picture was present (<italic>M</italic> = 5.24) versus absent (<italic>M</italic> = 4.51) for the concrete words condition. There was no significant difference for picture within the instructions to imagine condition. There was a significant effect, <italic>F</italic>(1, 247) = 5.70, <italic>p</italic> =.002, for text within the absent picture condition, with instructions to imagine rated higher (<italic>M</italic> = 5.08) than concrete words (<italic>M</italic> = 4.51) for consumption vision elaboration. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1096348010390815">Figure 1</xref> illustrates the interaction effect. In respect of Hypothesis 1(a), exposure to pictorial stimuli resulted in greater consumption vision elaboration but primarily when coupled with concrete words. Thus, only partial confirmation of the hypothesis was found. For Hypothesis 2(a), partial support was found with exposure to instructions to imagine resulting in greater consumption vision elaboration than concrete words but only when the picture was absent.</p>

</fig>
<p>Second, we tested the effect of the pictorial and text stimuli on the <italic>quality</italic> of consumption vision. There was a main effect for text, <italic>F</italic>(1, 256) = 5.92, <italic>p</italic> = .002, on the quality of consumption vision. The quality of consumption vision was greater for instructions to imagine (<italic>M</italic> = 4.93) versus concrete words (<italic>M</italic> = 4.42), confirming Hypothesis 2(b). No other main or interaction effects were significant. No support was found for Hypothesis 1(b) as exposure to pictorial stimuli did not result in higher quality consumption vision.</p>

<title>Mediation Tests</title>
<p>The primary aim of the research reported in this article was to examine the extent to which tourism consumers’ consumption vision, when mediated by emotional response, contributes to their propensity to bypass the alternative evaluation phase of the decision process and seek immediate closure on their tourism purchase. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1096348010390815">Baron and Kenny (1986)</xref>, cause-and-effect relationships are often mediated by psychological processes that occur simultaneously to those purposefully evoked by the independent variables. As argued previously, the participants’ emotional response to their consumption vision is proposed as a psychological process that mediates the influence of the consumption vision on their actual purchase decision behavior. The current study, like others (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1096348010390815">Escalas, 2004</xref>), adopted Baron and Kenny’s method for mediation testing to test Hypotheses 3 and 4.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1096348010390815">Baron and Kenny’s (1986)</xref> method for mediation testing involves the estimation of the following three regression equations. First, the mediator is regressed onto the independent variable and the independent variable must affect the mediator. Second, the dependent variable should be regressed onto the independent variable and a significant effect of the independent variable must hold. Third, the dependent variable should be regressed on both the independent variable and the mediator and the mediator must affect the dependent variable. Should these conditions hold in the predicted direction, then the effect of the independent variable on the dependent variable must be less in the third equation than that in the second. The results of this analysis are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1096348010390815">Table 1</xref>.</p>

<p>The results of the regression analysis indicate that emotional response acted as a significant mediator between consumption vision elaboration and both the product interest and purchase immediacy dimensions of decision behavior. As required by the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1096348010390815">Baron and Kenny (1986)</xref> test, to demonstrate mediation the beta weight reduced considerably for the consumption vision elaboration variable on both the decision behavior components, being highly significant in Equation 1 to nonsignificant in Equation 3. Sobel’s <italic>z</italic> test was used to confirm that the indirect pathway was significantly different from zero. For the elaboration–emotion–interest model, Sobel’s <italic>z</italic> test = 7.50, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001. For the elaboration–emotion–immediacy model, Sobel <italic>z</italic> test = 5.03, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001. As this was the case in this analysis, support was found for both Hypotheses 3a and 3b.</p>
<p>The regression results presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1096348010390815">Table 1</xref> also revealed support for Hypotheses 4a and 4b, providing confirmation that emotional response also plays a mediating role between quality dimension of consumption vision and the participants’ product interest and purchase immediacy. Sobel’s <italic>z</italic> test was used to confirm that the indirect pathway was significantly different from zero. For the quality–emotion–interest model, Sobel’s <italic>z</italic> test = 9.24, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001. For the quality–emotion–immediacy model, Sobel <italic>z</italic> test = 6.39, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001.</p>
<p>These results allow the researchers to accept all four hypotheses investigating the mediating role of emotional response on all dimensions of both the independent variable (consumption vision) and the dependent variable (decision behavior).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The results of the ANOVAs showed general, but qualified, support for Hypotheses 1 and 2. For consumption vision elaboration, the most effective combination of stimuli was a picture combined with concrete words, whereas the least effective combination of stimuli comprised concrete words and no pictorial image. According to a study conducted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1096348010390815">Edell and Staelin (1983)</xref>, the extent to which the information presented in a print advertisement will be mentally elaborated on will differ depending on the pictorial and text message congruency. The authors claim that the more compatible the two sources of stimuli, the more cognitive attention the participant will devote to the advertisement. The current research incorporated rich descriptive textual content that was complementary to the concrete picture. Given that the participants were more responsive to this particular combination in terms of the extent to which they elaborated on their consumption visions, the results of the study lend further support to the implications of picture/text congruency.</p>
<p>For quality of consumption vision, the use of instructions to imagine was particularly effective, with or without pictorial stimuli. This finding not only resembles that of previous research, which suggests information high in imagery evoking capabilities, such as instructions to imagine, results in high levels of mental imagery processing regardless of whether or not a pictorial image is present (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1096348010390815">Unnava &amp; Burnkrant, 1991</xref>), it also suggests that consumers can create a high-quality consumption vision without pictorial information if primed to do so.</p>
<p>The series of multiple regression analyses offers significant support for all mediation hypotheses, suggesting that consumption vision can heighten tourism consumers’ product interest and increase their propensity to bypass the alternative evaluation phase of the decision process and seek immediate closure on their purchase via consumers’ elicited emotional response. Hence, a detailed explanation of the individual roles that the components of the consumption vision phenomena (elaboration and quality) play in terms of their emotion mediated influence on tourism consumers’ decision behavior is warranted.</p>
<p>The elaboration component of consumption vision refers to the extent to which the individuals elaborate on the mental images that come to mind as a result of their viewing the advertisement. Several streams of research in consumer behavior have revealed that information can be processed at different levels of cognitive elaboration (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1096348010390815">Cacioppo &amp; Perry, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1096348010390815">Greenwald &amp; Leavitt, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1096348010390815">MacInnis &amp; Price, 1987</xref>). As mentioned earlier, information processed at low levels (nonelaborate) is said to elicit only a recognition response. Information that is processed at higher levels of elaboration is said to involve the integration of data from multiple knowledge structures, which in turn influences affective or emotional experiences. This research is in partial agreement, in that support is provided for the imagery elaboration continuum. However, contrary to research by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1096348010390815">MacInnis and Price (1987)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1096348010390815">Park and Mittal (1985)</xref>, who claim that elaborate imagery in choice contexts does not imply that the consumer ignores information about alternatives, confirmation of Hypotheses 3a and 3b indicates that as a result of highly elaborate imagery and the associated emotional responses, product interest is heightened and the need for alternative evaluation is lessened.</p>
<p>With reference to Hypothesis 4b, the results revealed that when a consumption vision is elaborated on and an emotional response occurs, the tourism consumer’s level of purchase immediacy is high. This result suggests that when tourism consumers experience an elaborate consumption vision, they are more likely to bypass the alternative evaluation phase of the decision process and seek closure on their purchase decision. A logical explanation for this result is provided by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1096348010390815">Dann (1981)</xref>, who contends that when tourism consumers project themselves visually into an imagined future consumption, the projections they experience are often translated into the goals they wish to achieve as a result of their tourism purchase. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1096348010390815">Dann (1981)</xref> claims that these fantasies and images then become responsible for directing the tourism consumer’s information search activities. Therefore, the respondents’ high level of product interest and immediate desire to purchase the product that occurred as a result of their elaborate consumption vision and associated emotional response can potentially be explained by the presumed ability of the featured destination to satisfy their fantasy derived goals.</p>
<p>According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1096348010390815">Uzzell (1984)</xref>, potential tourism consumers are often swayed into an imaginative state as the advertiser manipulates the consumers by constructing advertising material in a form that is most appealing to their emotions and desires. This in turn is said to make them feel as though the destination is somewhere they want to be as it possesses something they need to experience and achieve. Uzzell argues that to have this effect the consumer must be given the opportunity to ascribe personal meanings to the interpretive process and actively participate in the translation of the material presented in the advertisement. In other words, when designing their advertising stimulus, advertisers must ensure that they focus on the attributes of the destination that allow the consumers to assume any identity they wish to undertake, providing them only with the “tools” necessary to create their own fantasies and meanings. The method employed to operationalize the current research adhered to this rule, by providing the respondents with imagery-evoking strategies that invited them to imagine themselves experiencing the featured destination. The results of the research present further empirical evidence to support <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1096348010390815">Uzzell’s (1984)</xref> argument, with those respondents who elaborated on their induced fantasies experiencing stronger emotional responses and demonstrating higher levels of product interest and purchase immediacy than those who did not.</p>
<p>In respect to the purchase immediacy dimension of decision behavior, the fact that the imagery-evoking stimulus was designed to encourage the respondents to imagine themselves experiencing the tourism product possibly contributes to the nature of the findings surrounding consumption vision. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1096348010390815">MacInnis and Price (1987)</xref> propose that self-related imagery is more likely to have an effect on purchase intentions, as such imagery has been shown to be more emotionally provocative than imagery that is other oriented. With further reference to the intermediary role of the participants’ emotional response to their consumption vision, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1096348010390815">Hirschman and Holbrook (1982)</xref> suggest that consumers often choose to impulsively purchase hedonic type products with the intent of generating the same emotional response derived from their imagined future consumption experience.</p>
<p>The quality component of an individual’s consumption vision refers to the vividness, clarity, intensity, and sharpness of his or her mental images. In the current study, those respondents who experienced consumption visions that rated highly on all four of these elements reported a stronger emotional response to the advertisement, higher product interest, and were more likely to seek immediate closure on their purchase decision.</p>
<p>According to a study conducted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1096348010390815">Petrova and Cialdini (2005)</xref>, mental imagery that is vivid and clear produces stronger product preferences. Further explanation regarding this finding is offered by prior research, which suggests that consumers who experience vague and unclear mental images are unlikely to generate affective responses to the advertisement, as their cognitive information source fails to provide them with concise detail regarding the outcomes of their product choice (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1096348010390815">Miller &amp; Marks, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1096348010390815">Oliver Robertson &amp; Mitchell 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1096348010390815">Phillips et al., 1995</xref>). The current study has revealed a follow-on effect of this previously determined outcome on the individual’s purchase decision behavior. That is, the results pertaining to Hypotheses 3a, 3b, 4a, and 4b indicate that the consumers’ nonaffective responses that occurred as a result of their poor-quality consumption vision can result in a decrease in product interest and an increased propensity to delay their purchase decision by seeking further information about alternative destinations.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>These results regarding the impact of tourism consumers’ visionary and emotional responses to advertising on their purchase decision behavior provide support for the importance of the consideration of the tourism consumers’ imaginative and affective response when executing destination promotion campaigns. By revealing that an elaborate and quality consumption vision, mediated by an emotional response, can significantly influence the tourism consumers’ interest in an advertised product to the point where they are likely to seek closure on their decision and make an immediate purchase, the results of this study have presented a theoretical contribution to the body of knowledge surrounding the tourist’s decision-making process and tourism marketing communications.</p>
<p>This study was undertaken in response to a significant knowledge gap identified in the tourist behavior literature. To our knowledge, no research to date has investigated the influence of psychological variables such as mental imagery and emotion on the alternative evaluation stage of the tourist’s decision process. Furthermore, despite the efforts of previous research in confirming the relationship between mental imagery and emotion, such research did not extend to investigating the influence of these cognitive and affective responses on the tourism consumer’s final purchase decision. The current article has addressed these knowledge deficit areas, providing a significant contribution to the existing body of knowledge surrounding the tourism consumer’s decision-making process.</p>
<p>With regard to implications for managerial practice, this study provides the tourism industry with valuable information regarding the internal stimulus often referred to by consumers as an information source when considering the purchase of tourism-related products. The findings will be of value to the tourism industry’s marketing professionals, particularly those who choose to distribute their information via various types of print advertising sources such as travel guidebooks, brochures, newspapers, magazines, and billboards. For example, the results of this study imply that when employing print advertising media, the correct manipulation of imagery-evoking stimuli can potentially improve tourism marketers’ chance of selling their destination. Should advertisers be successful in generating elaborate and quality consumption visions among consumers, they can expect heightened product interest and an expedited purchase decision. This in turn can lead to enhanced productivity among the tourism sales force as the time attributed to each sales attempt potentially decreases. Overall, an understanding of imaginative and emotive forces identified in this study and their influence on the tourism consumer’s purchase decision is of particular importance to the tourism promoter given the intangible nature of the tourism product.</p>
<p>The results of this research must be considered in light of some limitations. The environment in which the self-administered questionnaire created for this study was completed was beyond the control of the researchers. As a result, the authors remain uninformed of the possible environmental influences that may have affected the respondents’ ability to give their full and undivided attention to the task. For example, respondents may not have been able to generate consumption-related imagery as a result of distractions from others, background noise, or other disruptions in their immediate environment. Hence, their recorded responses may not have been truly representative of their actual interpretation and response to the stimulus presented in the advertisement. On the other hand, the various conditions under which the questionnaires were completed could be viewed as representative of the everyday environments that the general public actually reviews print advertising material.</p>
<p>A further limitation surrounding this study involves the respondent’s actual cognitive ability to imagine—a potential moderating variable that was not accounted for in this research. Past research in this area (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1096348010390815">Childers &amp; Houston, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1096348010390815">Phillips et al., 1995</xref>) has posited the ability to imagine as a predictor variable. Individual differences in imagery processing style have been found to affect the incidence of using consumption visions to guide decision making. The implications of this unaccounted for covariate is that in some cases the participants’ failure to experience a consumption vision may not have been entirely related to the effectiveness of the stimulus combination featured in the advertisement but rather their inability to engage in visual processing. The measurement and control of the participants’ ability to imagine may have enhanced the reliability and validity of the conclusions drawn from this research. However, to date no conclusions have been drawn regarding the moderating effect of the ability to imagine on the relationship between imagery-evoking strategies and imagery processing or communication effects.</p>
<p>Despite these limitations, the researchers remain confident that the findings of this investigation into the tourism consumer’s decision process were supported by a sound methodological procedure. Furthermore, the acknowledgement of these limitations also provides scope for future research directions that will not only strengthen the theoretical standing of the findings of the current study but also provide further contributions to this emergent and valuable field of study.</p>
<p>The current research presents a number of opportunities for further enquiry in this area. Natural extensions to this research can be conducted to overcome limitations. The inclusion of two additional scales, one to measure and control for any moderating effects of the participant’s ability to imagine and another to inform the researcher of any potential distractions in the environment in which the participant is reviewing the advertisement, can be incorporated into future research design. A confirmatory analysis of the Consumption Vision Scale using new data will enhance the validity and reliability of the scale’s literature driven factor structure to produce the most comprehensive measure of ad-evoked consumption vision. Future research could include multiple advertisements featuring a variety of destinations to eliminate possible bias associated with the participant’s holiday preferences. The scope of the research can also be expanded to a wider range of products and services.</p>
<p>Previous research in this area has implied that self-related imagery pertaining to future consumption experiences can at times also instill unrealistic expectations of the actual product offering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1096348010390815">Hirschman, 1985</xref>). Therefore, the likelihood that consumers will be dissatisfied with their purchase as they partake in the postpurchase evaluation phase of the decision-making process may increase. Further research could provide additional clarification of this disparity by examining the consequences of consumption-related imagery and its subsequent decision behavior on the consumers’ postpurchase satisfaction levels. An understanding of the triggers that result in this potentially negative implication would be of great benefit to both industry and academe.</p>
<p>In the meantime, practitioners and the academe can move forward with the knowledge that elaborate and quality consumption visions play a vital role in shortening the tourist consumers’ decision-making processes. Such knowledge provides considerable opportunities for the promotion of tourist destinations.</p>
