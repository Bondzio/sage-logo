<p>When Upton Sinclair’s expose of the Chicago meat packing industry, <italic>The Jungle</italic>, was released in 1906 President Theodore Roosevelt initially rejected the work, referring to Sinclair as a “crackpot.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0160597612451246">1</xref>
</sup> Only after labor commissioner James P. Neil and social worker James Reynolds confirmed Sinclair’s findings in Chicago did Roosevelt support regulating the meat packing industry. The influence of Sinclair’s work eventually led to the passage of the Meat Inspection Act, the Pure Food and Drug Act of 1906, and the office that would eventually become the Food and Drug Administration. Had Sinclair published his work in a premier academic journal of his day would it have had such an influence? And, can we say that Sinclair’s work is sociological if he was not trained as a sociologist?</p>
<p>This issue of <italic>Humanity and Society</italic> examines an understudied area of our discipline—sociology of art. Many of us believe in the transformative power of the arts and of creativity. We recognize the very important role that art has played in communicating issues of social justice to a broader public. Indeed, we see the ways that art itself is a form of public sociology. In putting this issue together, we wanted to highlight sociologists who are examining the very important role that art plays in raising social consciousness, facilitating social activism and inquiry, and teaching sociology.  To use the words of Valerie Chepp, author of the first article in this issue, we invite readers to “consider the unique role of art in the pursuit of social justice and change.” We are pleased to have a range of scholars contribute to this issue, from advanced doctoral candidates and newly minted PhDs to colleagues who have published extensively in the area and activists who are using art as means of social change.  </p>
<p>Katherine Everhart’s article “Cultura = Identidad: The Use of Art in the University of Puerto Rico Student Movement, 2010” examines the use of art within the University of Puerto Rico student movement protests. Based on her own observations and interviews with student activists, faculty, and artists, Everhart explores how the movement used art to mobilize and form collective identity, commitment, and solidarity. Her work highlights a range of artistic forms and functions, with particular interest in the impact art has on the movement itself. Attention to this topic is particularly timely, given the use of art and creative tactics by other movements, such as Occupy Wall Street. </p>
<p>In her article, “Art as Public Knowledge and Everyday Politics: The Case of African American Spoken Word,” Valerie Chepp draws on ethnographic fieldwork to explore how African American spoken word can provide a unique lens to examine creative and artistic inquiry as a site of both social analysis and social change. She examines the intersection of public knowledge, everyday politics, and creativity.  Chepp lays out a typology of features of African American spoken word traditions and then discusses a broader framework for understanding the specialized political practices and public knowledge projects employed by present-day young adult spoken word performance poets. Her work encourages us to reconsider existing approaches to understanding social activism. </p>
<p>We are pleased to also have the contributions of Patricia Leavy, whose previous innovative scholarship has greatly contributed to dialogue linking the arts and social sciences. Her research note, “Fiction and Critical Perspectives on Social Research: A Research Note,” examines the ways in which social researchers use fiction to produce and disseminate research, build critical consciousness,  and gain insight into the lesser known aspects of the human experience. Her work not only provides us with new pedagogical possibilities, it also encourages us to reconsider our definitions of public scholarship, and even public sociology. </p>
<p>Moving into the music realm, Adrienne Trier-Bieniek’s action note, “Women’s Musical Activism Motivated by an Activist Musician,” explores links between music, feminism, activism, and healing. Drawing on observational data and interviews with fans of Tori Amos, Trier-Bieniek explores the influence of feminist music on fans, as well as important social action being done by Tori Amos through the Rape, Abuse and Incest National Network (RAINN). Her note challenges us to re-examine the influence and role of activist music and to reconsider portrayals of women as “fanatical” fans. This is a particularly poignant issue at a time when a struggling music industry is eager to depoliticize their “products.”</p>
<p>This issue’s book reviews also examine important links between art and culture. Jonathan Torn reviews <italic>Apocalypse Jukebox: The End of the World in American Popular Music</italic>, which in Torn’s words, is a “survey of all things eschatological in post WWII pop music.” Ben Brucato’s hybrid review of <italic>The Beach Beneath the Street</italic> includes an interview with its author, Mckenzie Wark (an original member of the Situationist International).  The issue concludes with provocative piece of visual sociology by photographer and educator Dustin Hiles. </p>
<p>
<italic>Humanity and Society</italic> has a “tradition” of publishing sociological work outside of the mainstream—work that is engaged, activist, and interdisciplinary. We hope that this issue fits into that tradition but, that also encourages you to reconsider the boundaries of your own research, teaching, and activism.</p>
