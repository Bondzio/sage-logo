<abstract>
<p>A user-friendly system that yields operational benefit results from data-driven prototype evaluations and benefits analyses that iteratively feed back into the prototype design and development. In this study, initial requirements development and field evaluations were conducted using a shadow operations technique at the center tower backup Dallas–Fort Worth International Airport air traffic control tower (ATCT). Results are discussed in reference to the design process of the Tower Flight Data Manager (TFDM) prototype. Nonintrusive measures for quantitatively validating human–systems design issues were identified for this study, including visual gaze analysis and verbal command sequence analysis. Behavioral validation of design issues simplifies the process to prioritize beneficial design changes. The iterative process used resulted in an interim TFDM prototype that was rated by active air traffic controllers as both beneficial and usable in an operational ATCT environment.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Development of air traffic control (ATC) advanced information tools necessarily requires an iterative design process to ensure that the tool is effectively integrated into the operational environment. In this article, some current techniques of air traffic control prototyping will be discussed, and an innovative approach to the decision support development process will be presented. An example of this process’s use will be detailed in a description of the development cycle for the Tower Flight Data Manager (TFDM), a prototype of an integrated decision support system for the ATC tower (ATCT) environment.</p>
<sec id="section2-1555343412470947">
<title>Decision Support Development Process</title>
<p>In reviewing the literature for studies addressing the process of ATC system design, we discovered three approaches to system design: those processes that involve improving the functionality focusing on some operational metric (without explicit user consideration), those processes that actively include the users in the evaluation and focus on user acceptability, and those processes that involve some combination of the previous two approaches.</p>
<p>Metric-driven design includes studies such as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1555343412470947">Mulfinger and Sadovsky (2011)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1555343412470947">Jung and Monroe (2005)</xref>. In Mulfinger and Sadovsky, fast-time simulations were used to generate case studies from which to evaluate the benefits of arrival scheduling capabilities. The benefits analyses were performed with the assumption that the scheduling recommendations would be executed appropriately, although no human interaction with the scheduling capability was evaluated. In Jung and Monroe, two decision support tools (DSTs) were integrated together, and the resulting improved metric prediction performance was then measured (independently of its operational usage). These studies focus the evaluation on the functionality designed, without discussion of system performance when a human is involved. Depending on user training and the incorporated use of the system into the operation, the fielded system may or may not yield the actual operational benefits that it was designed to achieve. In the case in which the operational benefits are not achieved, it can be argued that, ultimately, the system was not successful. Additional iterations of the system design and/or modifications of the training and procedural implementation should necessarily follow to achieve the operational benefit.</p>
<p>Alternatively, a different approach places the human user at the front and center of the system evaluation. Human-centered design studies specific to the ATC domain include <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1555343412470947">Bagassi, DeCrescenzio, and Persiani (2010)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1555343412470947">Reisman and Brown (2006)</xref>. Situation awareness and workload ratings were collected in Bagassi et al. from participants after they viewed traffic scenarios with or without the “four-dimensional” ATC display. Controller performance on the aircraft separation task was not evaluated in this study. In Reisman and Brown, an augmented reality display for ATCT controllers was designed and evaluated with controller participants. Performance was not measured in this study, but questionnaire data were gathered from the participants at the end of the trial. These studies focus on the evaluation of the system from the perceptual, cognitive, and usability perspectives. Although the usability and acceptability of the system are necessary to achieve a successful system, by themselves, these attributes are not sufficient. A highly usable and acceptable system may be ineffective and therefore unsuccessful at achieving any operational benefit (e.g., improved efficiency, improved safety).</p>
<p>Thus, a benefits-driven system design process, with the human user as the key component of that system, is suggested as a means to design and evaluate a system’s effect on the operational environment. In this process, shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1555343412470947">Figure 1</xref>, a measurement process first occurs to develop an understanding of the state of the system. First, the system’s effectiveness is measured—what aspects are successful and what are problematic? This measurement process involves both quantitative and qualitative data to define the system state. Operational data, such as system delay statistics or environment impact assessments, are collected and analyses are performed with respect to hypotheses made about problems with the current operation. Concurrently, field visits are performed to understand the operation itself, including procedures followed and system constraints. Hypotheses about the potential problems with the current system can be collected as decision support suggestions as well. These hypotheses can then be evaluated in operational data analysis.</p>

<p>The data-confirmed operational problems, procedures, and constraints then inform the designer’s <italic>operational model</italic> of the system. The operational model is defined as the designer’s understanding of the entirety of the system of interest. It is composed of the controller’s functions (as discovered from a work analysis), the functions of the current information systems, the functions of the rest of the system environment with which the controller interacts (e.g., pilots and aircraft, other ATC facilities, airport facilities), and the interfaces between these entities. As more data are collected from both field observations and analyses, this model is iterated to reflect the designer’s current understanding of the system. From this operational model, a set of decision support requirements is then developed, reflecting the particular problem(s) identified in the system. A means of providing the decision support is then designed, resulting in a new human–machine interface (HMI), training regimen, and/or operational procedure. The effective implementation of the means of decision support (tool, procedure, training) should then affect the key variables of the operational system, resulting in a measurable operational benefit.</p>
<p>One aspect of the design that is critical to success is the iterative nature of this process. It is likely on the first pass of the design that the operational benefits achieved are less than satisfactory. Thus, field observations of the tool in use should illuminate possible requirements or design specification issues that can be corrected in the next iteration.</p>
<p>This process has been used successfully in the design of the air traffic management DST Route Availability Planning Tool (RAPT), which is used by ATC facilities in convective weather (thunderstorms; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1555343412470947">Davison Reynolds, DeLaura, &amp; Robinson 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1555343412470947">DeLaura &amp; Allan, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1555343412470947">Robinson, Underhill, &amp; DeLaura, 2009</xref>). In RAPT, a simple red-yellow-green indication provides decision support to New York air traffic managers about whether a departure route out of an airport will be affected by weather. Despite the simple concept, years of iteration occurred to smooth out algorithmic issues, such as recommendations flickering back and forth between colors and where the red-versus- yellow and yellow-versus-green thresholds should be drawn to yield the most effective recommendation. Using the method of collecting operational data, designers discovered in 2008 that the main issue with the effective use of departure routes was not aiding users in determining when to close routes but aiding them in opening the departure routes as soon as possible after a storm had passed through. After the provision of a simple alteration to the RAPT HMI coupled with training on the issue, departure delay savings attributable to RAPT more than doubled in 2009.</p>
<p>Whereas the RAPT prototype was deployed and iterated in the field (in which actual operational benefits can be assessed), authors of other studies have analyzed advances in automation through measuring operational performance metrics in a human-in-the-loop experimental environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1555343412470947">Nagle et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1555343412470947">Prevot et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1555343412470947">Swieringa, Murdoch, Baxley, &amp; Hubbs, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>In the RAPT program, the designers were incredibly fortunate to have had the opportunity to prototype the system in the field and to collect operational data along the way to evaluate the effectiveness of the system. In this article, the benefits-driven decision support design process was followed in the TFDM prototype program; however, because of the safety-critical nature of the system, the prototype was fielded in a shadow operations environment. The remainder of this article describes the TFDM prototype program and the design process followed to enable data-driven design iteration, even though it was outside of the operational environment.</p>

<title>Current ATCT Environment</title>
<p>In today’s ATCT environment, there are usually at least four positions that are active in the larger tower facilities—flight data, ground control, local control, and supervisor or traffic management coordinator (TMC). The flight data position ensures that each departing flight has an ATC-acceptable route. This route is shown on small, paper flight strips—one for each flight—that can be written on and resequenced by the controller. After the flight has received a route clearance by flight data, the flight strip is then physically passed to the ground control position. Ground control issues taxi clearances to the flight after it pushes back from the airport gate. Ground control can view the flight out the ATCT window and can often see the flight’s icon on the airport surface detection equipment (ASDE), a surveillance display of the airport and its surrounding airspace (approximately 5 nm). The departing flights are then sequenced for departure by ground control to maximize the departure efficiency while adhering to constraints (such as wake vortex separation or traffic flow separation constraints) affecting individual flights.</p>
<p>After the flights have been sequenced and have entered the departure queue, ground control passes control and the flight strip to the local control position. Local control then makes final adjustments to departure sequence and clears the flights to take off. Local control also manages arriving flights to the airport and flights that are intending to cross active runways. The primary information source to local control is an out-the-window view of the arriving and departing flights, but the position is also supported by the information on the flight strip, the remote ARTS color tower displays (RACD; surveillance information extending up to 60 nm from the airport), and the ASDE. Overseeing the ATCT operation is the supervisor or TMC, who is responsible for ensuring that the airport is in the optimal airport configuration (direction of runway landing and departing) for the conditions. The supervisor or TMC also ensures that the traffic flow management restrictions are coordinated with other ATC facilities and that new restrictions placed on departing aircraft are passed to ground and local control for implementation. These restrictions are typed into the information display system for all of the ATCT positions to see. The flight data, ground control, local control, and TMC are certified professional controller (CPC) positions, and the supervisor is a front line manager (FLM) position.</p>
<p>Because of the complex nature of the work that ATCT controllers perform, outlining a full work analysis is not provided here. However, an example of a small portion of the work analysis performed for the ATCT environment is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1555343412470947">Figure 2</xref> to illustrate the rationale behind some of the human performance metrics chosen for the prototype evaluation. The abstraction–decomposition table provides a goals–means description of some of the overarching motivations for the ATCT controllers (e.g., safety and efficiency) and how they go about achieving these goals (e.g., verbal commands). Expanded for the specific function of “accepting responsibility for new flights” is the flow diagram next to the abstraction–decomposition table. This flow diagram depicts the process that is adhered to when a tower controller is accepting a new flight into his or her area of responsibility. This process involves identifying the aircraft visually on the surface, understanding where the aircraft is going, and making a plan to efficiently get the aircraft where it is going while maintaining separation from other aircraft in the area of responsibility.</p>

<p>Some of the key information sources and command means are evident from this flowchart. The controllers use out-the-window information to both identify the incoming aircraft and monitor aircraft conformance to the plan and instructions issued. The flight strip is relied on to convey both pilot intent and controller tactical plan information from one controller to another. Because this process could occur on the order of 40 times per hour and there are other functions that the controller must perform in parallel, any change to this process and/or information sources must not add unnecessary time and workload. Thus, in the prototype evaluation described in later sections, a focus on the key metrics indicative of controller performance was on verbal control command instructions, time spent looking out the window, and workload induced by an alternative flight strip HMI.</p>

<title>TFDM Prototype</title>
<p>The TFDM prototype is an iteration of the future ATCT surveillance, flight data, and traffic management information system. The NextGen Implementation Plan describes a few of the goals of future air transportation system technologies. These goals include reducing delays, improving flexibility in times of weather, and reducing the environmental impact of aviation, while maintaining high levels of safety (Federal Aviation Administration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1555343412470947">[FAA], 2012a</xref>). The purpose of TFDM is to integrate stove-piped information sources within the tower environment and to use the integrated information to provide additional decision support capabilities to increase departure efficiency and reduce fuel burn and emissions in accordance with NextGen goals. MIT Lincoln Laboratory was tasked to build a prototype of TFDM for proof-of-concept purposes and to aid in generating system design requirements for the production TFDM system. The TFDM prototype has a Net-centric information architecture, including an information bus by which it shares information between sensors, such as ASDE-X surface radar, HMIs, DSTs, and other information sources.</p>
<p>Three HMIs were developed for the prototype, including a surveillance display, a flight data manager, and a supervisor display. The Tower Information Display System (TIDS; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1555343412470947">Figure 3</xref>) is an enhanced surveillance display building on the existing tower surveillance system, the ASDE-X display. Controllers are able to zoom, scroll, and create individualized picture-in-picture windows on the TIDS to match their operations. Data-block colors indicate whether a flight is airborne (cyan) or on the surface (white). Proportionately sized aircraft icons indicate the type of aircraft, and aircraft icon colors indicate whether it is a small, large, or heavyweight class. Wake vortex timers in orange at the end of the departure runway indicate the time since a heavy aircraft has taken off. Approach bars in green at the end of the arrival runway indicate the location of an arriving aircraft on the approach path before its icon is visible on the display.</p>

<p>The flight data manager (FDM; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1555343412470947">Figure 4</xref>) is an electronic flight data display in which electronic flight data entries are able to be interacted with via touch-screen display as well as mouse and keyboard. Surveillance and flight data are linked in TFDM, allowing a selection on the TIDS display to highlight its corresponding flight strip on the FDM and vice versa. The flight data entry (FDE) information layout is similar to a paper flight strip, with some minor changes. Previous work on flight strips was considered heavily during the design (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1555343412470947">Bos, Blanken, &amp; Huisman, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1555343412470947">Dowell, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1555343412470947">Durso et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1555343412470947">Gronlund et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1555343412470947">Mackay &amp; Fayard, 1999</xref>).</p>

<p>The FDE has a flight status icon, which indicates whether a flight is a departure or an arrival and whether it is active (flight has pushed back from gate). The FDE can be expanded to display more information about the flight, including the entirety of its filed route. Individual FDEs can be resequenced, edited, and highlighted, similar to what controllers do with their paper flight progress strips. “Hot” buttons were provided to allow controllers to perform the most frequent actions on an electronic flight strip (e.g., departure runway assignment) in a simple and quick way. An information window at the right of the display provides a means to communicate alarms, alerts, and decision- support prompts to the controllers. Information from surveillance allows movement of FDEs to automatically progress to queues on the basis of aircraft position on the surface (e.g., from the left-most Pending queue to the center Ready to Taxi queue when a flight is detected at the Ready to Taxi spots on the airport surface).</p>
<p>The supervisor display (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1555343412470947">Figure 5</xref>) is a tab-based display that provides the tower supervisor or TMC the ability to view and manage tower operations in aggregate. The supervisor or TMC is able to view expected airport demand, weather impacts on departure routes and individual departures, traffic management restrictions, and individual flight information that is also displayed on the FDMs. On the supervisor display, the supervisor or TMC can change or schedule a change in airport configuration, add or modify traffic management restrictions, and view the effect of these changes on the arrival or departure demand. In the screenshot in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1555343412470947">Figure 5</xref>, each timeline represents a runway at Dallas–Fort Worth International Airport (DFW), with the expected arrival times of flights in blue and expected departure times of flights in green. At the top right of the display, the current airport configuration (“Southflow”) is indicated. The left panel provides the ability to change this configuration, add traffic management restrictions, and other actions. The tabs above the panel with the runway timelines provide the ability to switch to view other information about the ATCT operation, such as viewing the departures by assigned departure routes and indicating the departure route’s coordinating weather status instead of by departure runway.</p>

<p>The TFDM prototype supports a variety of DSTs, including runway assignment, departure metering, sequencing and scheduling, airport configuration, and departure routing. The airport configuration DST provides the ability to alter or schedule a change in airport configuration. The runway assignment DST automatically assigns departures and arrivals with a runway assignment on the basis of a basic rule set. A feature in the supervisor display allows this rule set to be altered. The departure-metering DST suggests to the controller the rate at which departures should be released onto the taxiway to maintain pressure on the departures while minimizing surface congestion. The sequencing and scheduling DST provides an estimated wheels-off time for departures and an estimated wheels-on time for arrivals that can be viewed on a timeline on the supervisor display. The departure-routing DST estimates and displays the departure route weather blockage by departure route and overlays the estimated departure wheels-off times on departure route timelines to allow the supervisor to see which departures are predicted to be affected by convective weather (incorporating the RAPT functionality).</p>
<sec id="section5-1555343412470947">
<title>Initial TFDM Requirements Development</title>
<p>An initial set of system design requirements for the TFDM prototype system were built with the use of three primary sources: TFDM operational benefits research, ATCT site visits, and input from a national TFDM user group. The TFDM benefits research revealed that 39% of surface inefficiencies were attributable to inefficient timing of pushback of the aircraft from the gate. Secondarily, 33% of the inefficiencies were attributable to inefficient sequencing of flights departing, and 12% were attributable to inefficient airport resource planning (e.g., changing airport configuration too late to allow taxi planning). The reader is referred to related publications that include discussion of the benefits methodology and results in detail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1555343412470947">Jordan, Ishuktina, &amp; Reynolds, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1555343412470947">Reynolds, Jordan, Ishuktina, Seater, &amp; Kuchar, 2010</xref>). By using the operational data (e.g., ASDE-X, FAA terminal area forecasts, and other sources), the benefits team was able to identify the key decision support requirements for which the TFDM prototype should be designed. On the basis of this research, the DSTs that were projected to provide the most benefit to surface inefficiency included departure metering, sequencing and scheduling, and airport configuration capabilities.</p>
<p>In addition to investigating potential operational benefits, we conducted ATCT field site visits to better understand and model the current tower operations. Towers with distinctive operations were visited, including Boston, Chicago, DFW, New York’s John F. Kennedy, and Newark, New Jersey, airports. For each of the towers visited, information was collected to form the operations model of the ATCT operation, including process models, cognitive work identification, information systems analysis, communications analysis, and procedures aggregation. Work process models detailed the information flow between tower positions, such as that which occurs in the progression of a flight from gate to departure. The specific cognitive work of the different tower positions (beyond that of simply following procedure) was also identified. Specific cognitive work of the ground controller included, for example, sequencing aircraft for departure and determining the appropriate time and number of flights to cross active runways. These tasks are similar to chess in that the ground controller must always be thinking several control clearances ahead to stage the departures and arrivals in the most optimal sequence that is cognitively manageable.</p>
<p>The information systems in the tower were collated and analyzed for the information used operationally by the tower positions, and sources for information needs were prioritized on the basis of tower use and preference. Whom each tower controller, TMC, and supervisor communicated with was also noted, including the frequency of communication and the information distributed or acquired. In addition, any procedures used by the tower that illuminated the rationale behind the operational procedures for each facility, including the ATC manual (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1555343412470947">FAA, 2012b</xref>), facility standard operating procedures, and letters of agreement between facilities and airlines, were also collected. By using these overlapping but different methods of work discovery alongside periodic user validation exercises, an acceptable operational model of the tower environment and its individual positions was developed.</p>
<p>The national TFDM user group provided another source of initial requirements information for the program. Every 2 to 3 months, a group of seven ATCT supervisors, one airline ramp supervisor, one air route traffic control center supervisor, and one ATC terminal supervisor would provide input on the TFDM program. The main focus for the user group was a series of discussions on potential future capabilities of TFDM and how they could or could not be effectively operationally implemented.</p>
<p>For example, when considering a departure metering DST, each of the user group members would discuss why he or she thought metering would or would not work in his or her particular facility and provide suggestions about what information would be required to present the most effective metering guidance to controllers. This discussion allowed the requirements to include information about the type of departure metering (e.g., rate of departure release as opposed to indications for individual aircraft release or displaying a recommendation of departure release time or sequence) to implement in the prototype, how and where this metering recommendation would best reside in TFDM, and requirements for controller acceptability. The user group also was instrumental in aiding the iteration of the layout of the electronic flight strip information (e.g., aircraft identifier, aircraft type, destination, proposed departure time, route) on the FDM. In addition, during the user group meetings, members would use iterations of the TFDM prototype in representative tower scenarios, commenting on the functionality and usability.</p>
<p>Using the operational model developed from the benefits analysis, field visits, and user group meetings, an initial set of TFDM functional requirements was developed. These requirements, as well as some indications of TFDM design specifications suggested by the user group or FAA procedures, were used as a basis for the design of the initial TFDM prototype. This initial prototype was then evaluated and iterated in the field during two successive field demonstrations at the DFW International Airport.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1555343412470947">
<title>Field Demonstrations and Evaluations at the DFW International Airport</title>
<p>Two field demonstrations at DFW were conducted to prove the concept of the TFDM prototype and to iterate on the initial requirements of the TFDM system. The initial demonstration (DFW-1), in August of 2010, tested the TFDM Net-centric infrastructure, the TIDS, the FDM, and the runway assignment DST. In the second demonstration (DFW-2), in April and May of 2011, the supervisor display and the initial iteration of the other four DSTs were introduced.</p>
<p>The field demonstrations were both conducted in the DFW center tower, an operational but not regularly used ATCT that serves as a backup for the east and west DFW towers. In DFW-1, there were two test positions, ground control and local control. Each had a TIDS and an FDM HMI. In DFW-2, an additional supervisor-TMC position consisting of a TIDS and a supervisor display was added. In both demonstrations, a flight data and clearance delivery position was manned by the research personnel, and this position had an FDM that could modify and transfer control of electronic flight strips to ground or local control positions to maintain operational validity of the demonstration.</p>
<p>Both demonstrations were conducted as shadow operations of the DFW’s east tower operations. In a shadow operation, according to test protocol, participants were requested to issue verbal commands and update information systems as if they were actually controlling air traffic, but the actual clearances were issued by, and separation responsibility remained in, the east tower. Participants heard both the pilots and east tower controllers on the frequency, but neither the pilots nor east tower controllers could hear the center tower participants. For data analyses, video data of participants and audio data of both participants and east tower controllers were recorded.</p>
<p>Both field demonstrations were 2 weeks long, with 3 days of demonstration each week. During DFW-1, each day, a different pair of DFW CPCs switched between ground and local control throughout the day, resulting in 12 total controllers evaluating the system. The average experience of the participant controllers was 17.6 years with a minimum of a half year and a maximum of 32 years. In DFW-2, two DFW CPCs and one DFW FLM or TMC shadowed the operation. CPCs switched between ground and local, and the FLM or TMC remained at the supervisor-TMC position. A total of 12 CPCs, three FLMs, and three TMCs evaluated the TFDM system in DFW-2. The average ATCT experience of CPCs and FLMs was 21.1 years with a minimum of 4 years and a maximum of 30 years.</p>
<p>Each demonstration day had a similar schedule for controllers in both demonstrations. The demonstration day lasted from approximately 7 a.m. to 2:45 p.m. Each morning consisted of a training session in which participants were introduced to the system via training slides and hands-on exploration. When the participant agreed that he or she felt comfortable to begin, the shadow operations proceeded for three sessions of 45 min before lunch, separated by 15-min breaks to replicate actual operational conditions. Another two shadow operations sessions were conducted after lunch. Initial questionnaires about participant experience were issued immediately before lunch, and final questionnaires were issued at the end of the demonstration day. The demonstration day was rounded out with a verbal discussion with the participants that allowed them to voice reactions to the system, ask questions, and provide guidance to system improvements and future functionality. In DFW-2, instead of shadow operations, the FLM and TMC participants were guided through a schedule of supervisor display functions under evaluation and were also requested to keep the system updated with the current operational information (e.g., correct airport configuration, current traffic management restrictions). In this report, because of space limitations, the results discussed will be focused on the TIDS-FDM portion of the system.</p>

<title>DFW-1</title>
<p>In DFW-1, the primary means of gathering data were field observations, questionnaires, and postdemonstration discussions. For each participant during the demonstration, two research personnel were assigned to both answer the participant’s questions during the day and take observational notes on the use of TFDM. Structured forms were used to organize and direct the observations. Date, time, position, participant, airport configuration, and weather status were noted. Alongside the freehand observation, the research personnel were asked to note which display a comment pertained to and to code the observation by type (e.g., interface problem, performance issue, functionality liked, functionality suggestion, adaptation observed, workload, out the window, and benefit observed). In DFW-1, another observation form was populated to determine how the participant interacted with the system (e.g., mouse, touch screen, virtual keyboard, actual keyboard) to aid in identifying whether designing the system for touch screen was a fruitful endeavor. Controllers rated on a scale of 1 to 5 the accuracy, acceptability, usefulness, and usability of different aspects of the TIDS, FDM, and the interaction between TIDS and FDM. Open-ended questions were also included to allow controllers to document their reactions and suggestions in their own words as well.</p>
<p>A substantial amount of technical system performance data and subjective human factors data were collected from this field demonstration. The technical system performance data were reported to the sponsor in a technical report. In this article, only select cognitive engineering results affecting future design are discussed.</p>
<p>Overall, the TFDM prototype was well received in the DFW-1 demonstration. More than 100 individual questions were answered by the participants; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1555343412470947">Figure 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-1555343412470947">Figure 7</xref> provide an overall indication of how the participants viewed the HMIs for the system. A majority of the responses were positive regarding the interfaces’ role in performing critical ATC tasks, the ease of use, and benefit afforded to tower controllers. These responses provide an indication, apart from performance implications, of how acceptable controllers find the system, which in itself is a critical factor in the overall successful implementation of TFDM or any modification to the ATC system.</p>

<p>Hundreds of observations and suggestions were documented from DFW-1. The problems experienced by at least 30% of the participants (four CPCs) centered on either TFDM’s misinterpretation of current procedure (e.g., the wrong wake vortex timer setting) or not accounting for critical key functionality of the current operation (e.g., providing the ability to “cock” or offset electronic flight strips in the strip bays). Suggestions primarily involved providing a means to perform functionality of the systems today (e.g., “cocking,” highlighting, showing beacon code) or better using the electronic information functionality (e.g., suggesting hot buttons, expanding touch screen to TIDS).</p>
<p>The use of the FDM touch screen was also evaluated. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1555343412470947">Table 1</xref> describes the results of analyzing 357 sample interactions (e.g., moving a flight strip from queue to queue, adding an altitude clearance to a flight strip) noted for the six CPCs. Overall, the CPCs made considerable use of the touch screen, and these data supported the decision to continue further iterations of the TFDM prototype with a touch-screen FDM. In addition, there was greater use of the touch screen by local-control participants as compared with ground control. This finding is likely the result of the following: (a) There appeared to be less need to interact with the data on the electronic flight strips and their sequence at the local control position, and (b) there appeared to be more of a need at the local control position to be “heads up” to constantly monitor the progress of imminently arriving and departing aircraft because of the speeds involved.</p>

<p>On the basis of the DFW-1 demonstration results, a significant number of improvements were made to the TFDM prototype before the DFW-2 demonstration. All of the top problems and suggestions were addressed. The wake vortex timer was modified to be triggered by Boeing 757 aircraft. Means of drawing attention to both the electronic flight strip as a whole as well as to individual information fields were added, including the ability to “flip” an electronic flight strip (i.e., remove all information from the electronic flight strip except for its aircraft identification, which is an electronic analogy to flipping over a physical flight strip), the ability to change the flight status icon to an exclamation point as a substitute for cocking, the ability to highlight an individual field with a yellow background, and the ability to change text in an individual field to red. The requested hot buttons were added to the FDMs, and the beacon code was added to the expanded electronic flight strip.</p>

<sec id="section9-1555343412470947">
<title>DFW-2</title>
<p>The data collection methods between DFW-1 and DFW-2 varied in the method of human–systems integration data collection. The methods in DFW-1 provided initial guidance on problem areas in the TFDM design that could be improved before DFW-2. However, in DFW-2, steps toward understanding the TFDM system’s effect on a controller’s behavioral performance were taken. In addition to field observations, questionnaires, and postdemonstration discussions, a video and audio playback system was created that allowed performance analyses to occur postdemonstration. In the interests of brevity, only the questionnaire review of the new electronic flight strip attention features and the video and audio playback analysis will be discussed in detail.</p>
<p>The means to draw attention to the electronic flight strip and its fields, which were integrated into the prototype for the DFW-2 demonstration, were received well by the participant controllers, as seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-1555343412470947">Figure 8</xref>. Both the field highlighting feature and the application of red text to a field in the electronic flight strip were considered useful features by the participant controllers. From the participant feedback, it appears that the user interface used to highlight a field and to change a field’s text color requires further consideration. This need to modify the design of the highlighting and text color change features was also discovered in the observations in which these features required too many FDM inputs to achieve the desired state. In the revisions made after the DFW-2 demonstration, the user interface used to highlight fields and change field text color were revised, and the requirement was modified to reduce the number of inputs required to apply these changes.</p>

<p>The postdemonstration analyses were conducted via an audiovisual playback system. Video was chosen as the most noninvasive and inconspicuous option for capturing the participants’ actions during the field demonstration. Real-time screen recordings of the TIDS, FDM, supervisor display, and Cohu camera out-the-window display screens were also captured with a tool called Epiphan. By capturing screenshots and video, exactly what the participants were looking at and doing on-screen could be replayed. Audio recordings of participant controllers issuing shadow verbal commands were captured through use of a small microphone worn around their neck, and audio recordings of east tower controller and pilot communication frequencies were provided by the DFW tower. During playback analysis, all of these data were gathered into and synched together with Adobe Premiere so that a video playback complete with participant controller, east tower controller, and pilot audio could be heard. A clock displaying the Coordinated Universal Time of the demonstration was added to the center of the playback for timing purposes. A screenshot of this video playback system is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-1555343412470947">Figure 9</xref>.</p>

<title>Verbal Command Analysis</title>
<p>During DFW-1, research personnel observed that many participant controllers issued instructions for the same flights before east tower controllers did. Occasions in which participant controllers issued control commands later appeared to be generally attributable to a problem understanding the user interface or another workload-inducing situation. Control issuance for the participant shadow controllers could be considered a “secondary task,” since their primary task was using and evaluating the TFDM prototype system. Since the verbal command required auditory-verbal as well as visuospatial demands, it appeared to be a reasonable secondary task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1555343412470947">Wickens, 1992</xref>). Previous studies present similar instances in which dual-task training conditions affected participant learning or active performance of a simple task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1555343412470947">Frensch &amp; Miner, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1555343412470947">Shanks &amp; Channon, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1555343412470947">Shanks, Rowland, &amp; Ranger, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1555343412470947">Stadler, 1995</xref>). As a result, it was hypothesized that the order in which participant and east tower controllers issued verbal commands could indicate their cognitive workload.</p>
<p>Although authors of previous studies have analyzed ATC commands for cognitive workload, none has compared commands between test and control ATC samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1555343412470947">Ayaz et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1555343412470947">Embrey, Blackett, Marsden, &amp; Peachey, 2006</xref>). However, these studies support the notion that comparing the times at which similar instructions were issued between participant and east tower controllers can aid in measuring the extent of cognitive workload, since a longer response time on behalf of the participant controllers meant a larger cognitive workload for them as well. Nonetheless, although evidence has been provided to suggest that verbal command analysis may be indicative of cognitive workload, the purpose of this measure in the demonstration was to identify potentially problematic TFDM functionality.</p>
<p>Quantitative measures of controller responses were used to demonstrate the level of cognitive workload each participant experienced. The order in which participant and east tower controllers issued commands for the same flights was evaluated to get the controller <italic>response rate</italic>, that is, the percentage of time participants issued a command first, second, and at the same time as (neutral to) their corresponding east tower controller. The issuance time for each command was recorded as “hours: minutes: seconds” (hh:mm:ss) with use of the on-screen clock timer. The difference in command issuance time between participant and east tower controllers was also calculated in hh:mm:ss and termed the <italic>gap time</italic>. Verbal command data were recorded throughout the shadow operations sessions. These shadow operations sessions were variable in length and ranged anywhere between 30 and 60 min. Attempts were made to analyze the verbal command data from ground control during the entire shadow operations session. However, instances in the audiovisual data that exhibited extensive controller–observer interaction were not used in the data analyses. Three 5-min stretches of data were analyzed for local control. One sample was chosen randomly near the end of the first shadow operations session, and the other two were chosen roughly at the beginning and end of the second shadow operations session. Again, extensive controller–observer interaction periods were specifically avoided.</p>
<p>Gap times were rounded to the nearest second to account for lower levels of precision inherent to a manual recording method. Since data recording was subject to decreased precision, data analyses emphasized differences in gap times longer than 2 s. Additionally, because the exact points at which instructions were issued were used only to calculate gap times, consistency was considered highly important and was promoted through the use of a single person to code data. Verbal control command analysis is a novel approach to cognitive workload estimation. Although our results are indicative of trends, sources of error discussed later in this article can be used to apply verbal command analysis in a more robust fashion in future efforts to quantify ATC cognitive workload.</p>
<p>Verbal command data were analyzed through two-way Welch <italic>t</italic> tests to compare between participant controllers and their east tower counterparts. Data were also analyzed within subjects with paired <italic>t</italic> tests to examine individual differences between participants’ respective ground and local controller roles. With these quantified results, individual participant trends were further investigated to identify specific causes of long gap times and to potentially formulate design requirements and/or correct specifications to address these issues.</p>
<p>Participants were successful at issuing the majority of their verbal commands (75% for ground and 69% for local participant controllers) before or at the same time as east tower controllers (<italic>t</italic> = −6.74, <italic>df</italic> = 19, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01), as seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-1555343412470947">Figure 10</xref>. Considering the issuance of verbal control commands as a secondary task indicative of cognitive workload, it appears from these results that for a majority of the instances of control commands, participant controllers were not negatively affected by cognitive workload issues while using the TFDM suite.</p>
<fig id="fig10-1555343412470947" position="float">

<p>Average gap time measurements were an investigation into the instances when verbal commands were issued second by ground and local controllers. However, no significant difference was revealed between ground participant controllers and ground east tower controllers or between ground and local participant controllers. Thus, there did not appear to be any significant difference in the ability to use the TFDM suite between ground and local controller participants in terms of verbal command gap times.</p>
<p>Consolidating gap time and response rate data revealed individual controller trends in the form of gap time plots. From these plots, instances in which participants had longest gap times were correlated with actions in video recordings to reveal potential avenues of TFDM design improvement. According to the results, ground participant controllers experienced the most frequent lags in issuing instructions when interacting with electronic flight strips on the FDM, especially when searching for, moving, and editing them (23 of 54 instances). Local participant controllers also lagged when interacting with the electronic flight strips although to a smaller degree (8 of 37 instances). In future FDM iterations, designers may consider improved participant controller interaction with electronic flight strips for reduced controller cognitive workload.</p>
<p>Also, both ground and local participant controllers demonstrated instances in which instructions were issued immediately after their east tower counterparts, prompted by hearing them, as evidenced in the video playback (19 of 91 instances). In many of these cases, participant controllers began issuing commands as soon as they heard east tower controllers but before east tower controllers finished their own commands. This finding indicates that participants were clearly influenced by their ability to hear the east tower control group. Although this limitation is innate to the method, it does not appear to skew our results significantly: The less-than-1-s gap in the majority of these cases provides evidence that participants were not copying east tower controller clearances but were prompted to execute their own formulated clearances when hearing east tower controllers.</p>

<sec id="section11-1555343412470947">
<title>Visual Gaze Analysis</title>
<p>Scanning data were gathered to quantify head-up and head-down time and to evaluate attentional demands of the TFDM test environment. For each participant controller, five 1-min samples of video data from each shadow operations session were analyzed to capture eye scanning behavior. The first 10 min of each shadow operations session was omitted from analysis to reduce noise caused by controller unfamiliarity with the TFDM system or by controller readjustment to the system after a break. Data samples during which participant controllers were interacting too heavily with observers were not recorded, and instead, the next minute during which there was little interference was analyzed. As a result, sample minutes were not all spaced evenly apart in time.</p>
<p>To quantify participant controller eye movements, we assigned each potential dwell area a numerical code, called a <italic>dwell code</italic> (i.e., 1 = FDM, 2 = TIDS). For a given sampled minute, each of the controllers’ individual gazes was recorded as a dwell code along with its duration. An offline calibration of gaze with an ATC subject matter expert was held to determine gaze direction. Each point at which the participant controller changed his or her focus, video playback was paused and the time at which the dwell began was recorded through use of the on-screen clock timer (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-1555343412470947">Figure 9</xref>). The difference between beginning and end time for this fixation was calculated in hh:mm:ss and was termed the <italic>dwell duration</italic>. The screen timer included precision up to 1/100th of a second, but times were rounded to the nearest second to account for lower levels of precision inherent to the manual recording method. Recording dwell codes resulted in numerical sequences that were analyzed in the form of the following variables: total dwell time per 1-min sampling session, average single dwell length per code, and dwell frequency.</p>
<p>Although manual observation of visual gaze is not as accurate as that of an eye tracker, previous studies have shown that the human eye is accurate in distinguishing gaze direction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1555343412470947">Schieber, Harms, Berkhout, &amp; Spangler, 1997</xref>). In <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1555343412470947">Schieber et al. (1997)</xref>, researchers assessed the accuracy and precision of participants judging the gaze locations of a vehicle driver looking between the instrument panel of a car and outside of his or her windshield. Participants’ precision reflected how consistently they assigned a specific gaze to one area of the panel, and participants’ accuracy reflected whether their assignment was indeed correct. The average accuracy of estimated location was within 8.45 cm, and precision was within 12.2 cm. These measures are sufficient for DFW-2 testing since dwell recordings supported a more gross level of observation and dwell code areas were at least several inches apart from each other. In DFW-2, head positions, concurrent mouse movements, and contextual information also aided in distinguishing participant gaze location. Also, Epiphan data of TIDS and FDM screens provided an unobstructed view of participant controllers’ screen usage simultaneous to viewing their general gaze direction.</p>
<p>Visual gaze data were analyzed with paired <italic>t</italic> tests to examine scanning differences between participant controllers in respective ground and local controller roles. Using quantified results, we further investigated individual dwells to identify specific causes of increased dwell duration and to formulate potential design requirements and modify specifications to address these issues.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11-1555343412470947">Figure 11</xref> indicates that participant controllers spent significantly more time heads down than heads up (<italic>t</italic> = −17.12, <italic>df</italic> = 43, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001), and significantly more time was spent looking out the window (heads up) than at other dwell areas (<italic>t</italic> = −7.87, <italic>df</italic> = 43, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001). Information categorized within the <italic>other</italic> category comprised instances when the participants viewed miscellaneous objects (such as a coffee cup) and when they were looking at the observer. In addition to spending almost 50 s per sampling minute viewing head-down information, test controllers also spent longer individual dwells viewing and gathering information from head-down displays when compared with heads up (<italic>t</italic> = 10.61, <italic>df</italic> = 43, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001). A significant amount of attention was clearly directed toward displays and information within the tower as opposed to outside of it or to miscellaneous noninformational areas, which is natural since evaluating the TFDM display suite was the primary task requested of the participant controllers. In nonshadow operations, these measures would be particularly important for evaluating the goal of the TFDM suite to support the controllers in ensuring separation (which is currently procedurally required using out-the-window information) while minimizing heads-down time in the display suite. In future demonstrations, the implications of heads-down time on the comparable safety of the current information systems should be thoroughly considered. This study’s investigation focused on minimizing unnecessary heads-down time through system design modifications.</p>

<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11-1555343412470947">Figure 11</xref> also shows that the top three areas particularly focused on by both ground and local participant controllers were the TIDS, FDM, and head-up areas. Total dwell time comparisons of ground and local participant controllers revealed a statistically significant difference between ground and local participant controllers’ viewing of the FDM (<italic>t</italic> = −5.36, <italic>df</italic> = 20, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001) and of the RACD (<italic>t</italic> = 13.80, <italic>df</italic> = 20, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001). This result is expected because ground participant controllers spend more time editing and sequencing electronic flight strips (on the FDM), and local participant controllers spend more time monitoring arrivals and departures (on the RACD).</p>
<p>To elicit design recommendations from visual gaze data and to explore methods of decreasing time spent in heads down tasks, we referenced playback videos to find controller actions causing long individual dwell durations (defined as more than 15 s). Ground control participants had a higher frequency of long dwells (53 instances) as compared with local control participants (22 instances). When viewing the FDM for more than 15 s, participant controllers were found to be spending time editing an electronic flight strip, finding one in the Pending bay, or using the search function on the FDM. For ground participant controllers, editing electronic flight strips was the primary source of long dwells (13 of 53 instances). Local participant controllers, as a result of their limited role in editing flight strips in the tower environment, exhibited few long dwells when editing electronic flight strips (2 of 22 instances). Viewing and monitoring electronic flight strips was another source of lengthy ground participant controller dwells (8 of 53 instances); however, it, too, had less impact on local participant controllers (3 of 22 instances). For local participant controllers, a majority of instances were found to occur when participants were viewing and monitoring the TIDS (16 of 22).</p>
<p>After the DFW-2 demonstration, a number of design issues were prioritized for postdemonstration consideration and implementation. The attention functionality required another design iteration to reduce the number of inputs to change the state of the field (e.g., highlighted, red text) in the electronic flight strip. The surveillance-based automatic flight strip movement required another iteration after some flight strip movements in DFW-2 caused the participant controllers some confusion. Further consideration of the search functionality and the editing of electronic flight strips on the FDM were also deemed useful, since issues with this functionality appeared both in the verbal command analysis and in the visual gaze analysis.</p>

<title>Discussion and Conclusions</title>
<p>The purpose of reporting this study in the <italic>Journal of Cognitive Engineering and Decision Making</italic> is to relay how the design of a complex system can be iterated in a practical fashion in the field environment with the use of both subjective and performance-based metrics. During the development process of the TFDM prototype, multiple opportunities were available to evaluate and revise its requirements and specifications. Examples of how the DFW evaluation changed the TFDM requirements and the prototype specification are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12-1555343412470947">Figure 12</xref>. With the use of field observations, benefits analyses, user groups, and field evaluations, the operational model of the tower environment and TFDM’s role in it has been honed throughout the design process. After each evaluation point, the requirements for the TFDM system and the prototype specifications were modified to reflect the updated operational model.</p>

<p>In DFW-1, field observation data was used to revise the operational model to emphasize the importance of the ability to call attention to fields on the electronic flight strips and to classify Boeing 757s as “heavy” aircraft for wake vortex separation requirements. The need for attention functionality was determined from the results of DFW-1, and the prototype specification for it was developed on the basis of the operational model of how attention functionality was used in the DFW tower (as well as other ATCTs visited in the field). In the DFW-2 demonstration, the participants were trained on and used the new features and improvements. Through field observations, questionnaires, and post hoc video and audio analyses, the attention functionality was evaluated. Although the functionality was evaluated as useful, verbal command data analysis and visual gaze data analysis revealed that the user interface required another iteration of design to reduce the number of inputs required to change the state of an electronic flight strip field. TFDM requirements were then modified to specify the number of acceptable inputs to implement attention features.</p>
<p>One contribution from this study was the development of nonintrusive measures of user behavior during the shadow field evaluation. Head-mounted equipment, such as that used in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1555343412470947">Reisman &amp; Brown (2006)</xref>, causes controllers discomfort during use that can result in cognitive distraction from the task at hand. Freestanding eye trackers have limitations of setup complexity and cannot be used in cases in which user interaction with the physical device is too close (equipment must have an unobstructed view of the interface). Additionally, certain physical characteristics, such as thick eyelashes or “droopy eyes,” prevent certain participants from being tracked at all (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1555343412470947">Tobii Technology, 2010</xref>). Using nonintrusive measures, such as video recordings, provides the ability to gain quantitative behavioral data without confound to the ecological validity of the task.</p>
<p>One benefit to having the behavioral information is to provide a means to uniquely identify issues with the system design that were not, or could not, be identified observationally or through questionnaires. Issues with the search feature on the FDM were discovered via the playback analyses, not through recorded observations. As was discovered in this study, the information gleaned from the post hoc analyses overlapped with the information gathered through observations and questionnaires. The behavioral information also provides guidance to prioritize features included in the next development iteration. More than 200 individual suggestions were made during the observations in the field evaluation at DFW. Without a means to effectively prioritize them, valuable development time could be spent on changes that yielded little actual benefit to the controller and his or her future work process. Knowing that a design flaw was affecting the participant controllers’ secondary task of control command issuance or increasing the participant controllers’ requirement to be heads down to the system is a clear means of separating “required” improvements from “nice-to-haves.” Through the playback analyses, cognitive engineers and systems engineers were able to focus on select issues with the FDM (searching, editing, moving electronic flight strips, surveillance-based automatic strip movement) that caused increased cognitive workload and heads-down time.</p>
<p>The positive feedback from the participant controllers and the TFDM user group throughout this design process as well as the behavioral information gathered from the DFW-2 demonstration suggests that the TFDM prototype developed thus far is beneficial in the demanding environment of the ATCT. When the participant controllers were asked whether the TIDS and FDM would be beneficial to the tower, there was strong agreement. One hundred percent somewhat or completely agreed that TIDS would be beneficial, and 83% somewhat or completely agreed that FDM would be beneficial. TFDM appeared to exert low extra cognitive workload on the participant controllers, since 73% of the control commands issued were before or at the same time as those of their east tower counterparts.</p>
<p>Although total heads-down time for participant controllers using TFDM appeared excessive and averaged approximately 82% (49.14 s per minute), authors of other studies have reported varying measures of heads-down time, some similar to these results: 35% to 38% (Bruce, 1996, cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1555343412470947">Cardosi &amp; Yost, 2001</xref>), 80% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1555343412470947">Pavet, Garron, &amp; Coullon, 2001</xref>), 35% to 39% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1555343412470947">Pinska, 2006</xref>), and 58% to 60% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1555343412470947">SensoMotoric Instruments [SMI], 2011</xref>). The variance in these measures can be attributed to reasons such as varying ATC test environments in both location and equipment used. (For example, Pinska, 2007, tested participants within a French ATC tower, whereas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1555343412470947">SMI, 2011</xref>, studied attentional allocation in German airports.) Although varied, all measures indicate reliance on head-down information versus head-up out-the-window information.</p>
<p>The next step in the process is to ensure that the prototype also achieves the operational benefits (e.g., increased departure and arrival efficiency, reduced fuel burn of aircraft on the surface) for which TFDM was designed. Although informative for evaluating the usability and acceptability of the prototype, the shadow operations environment was unable to support an evaluation of the TFDM prototype with respect to operational efficiency and fuel burn. Continual design to ensure operational benefit should occur through a similar iterative process with human-in-the-loop simulations followed by operational evaluations. Opportunities to evaluate potential benefits of the TFDM prototype in the future include additional field demonstrations and TFDM benefits-related human-in-the-loop simulation studies.</p>
