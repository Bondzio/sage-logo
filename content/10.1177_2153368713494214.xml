<abstract>
<p>Research consistently shows that minorities have less confidence in the police and perceive less procedural justice during encounters than Whites. This work generally concludes that the differences in perceptions by race are due to actual differences in attitudes, then proceeds to explore the origins of these differences. However, scholarly work has not yet explored the possibility that this finding is related to how members of different racial groups answer and interpret questions about the police; in other words, how measurement properties of scales may contribute to these differences. Using data from the National Police Research Platform’s Police–Community Interaction Survey, we conduct analyses to assess the reliability and validity of two measures of attitudes toward the police and assess differential item functioning (DIF) by race using Rasch analysis. Our findings reveal that few items from the procedural justice scale indicated DIF. All other items comprising the confidence in the police and procedural justice scales exhibited no differential functioning by race, indicating that the historic finding of variation in attitudes toward police by race are likely due to real differences rather than measurement error.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Confidence in the police and police legitimacy are essential elements in police–community relations. Research shows that individuals who trust in and have had positive encounters with the police, are more likely to be satisfied with law enforcement and reach out to them in times of need. They are also more likely to cooperate with them when information is needed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-2153368713494214">Hinds, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-2153368713494214">Tyler, 2004</xref>). Perhaps more importantly, research has indicated that satisfaction with and confidence in the police is strongly correlated with law-abiding behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-2153368713494214">Tyler, 1990</xref>). In addition, public cooperation is vital to police functioning, and it is clear that those who do not have confidence in the police are less likely to “be coproducers in the fight against crime” as called for in the community policing philosophy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-2153368713494214">Cao, Frank, &amp; Cullen, 1996</xref>, p. 3; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-2153368713494214">Scott, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>Fortunately, research tends to show that a majority of the public has moderate to high degrees of confidence in the police (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-2153368713494214">Cao et al., 1996</xref>). A recent analysis by the Bureau of Justice Statistics indicates that 9 of the 10 individuals report that they were satisfied with their encounter with the police (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-2153368713494214">Eith &amp; Durose, 2011</xref>). However, one of the strongest findings in the policing literature is that attitudes toward the police vary tremendously across groups within a community. Certain groups view the police with much more skepticism than others. Studies show there are substantial differences by race in who makes calls to and cooperates with the police (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-2153368713494214">Albrecht &amp; Green, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-2153368713494214">Cao &amp; Hou, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-2153368713494214">Eith &amp; Durose, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-2153368713494214">Hindelang, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-2153368713494214">Rocque, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-2153368713494214">Sampson &amp; Bartusch, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-2153368713494214">Weitzer &amp; Tuch, 2006</xref>). Blacks and Hispanics are less likely to trust the police and perceive the police as less legitimate than Whites. These groups are less satisfied with the police even after controlling for individual- and neighborhood-level characteristics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-2153368713494214">Reisig &amp; Parks, 2000</xref>). These findings have major implications for the ability of the police to be effective in areas with a high concentration of minorities.</p>
<p>Research examining confidence in the police and procedural justice relies on scales designed to measure these (latent) constructs. Psychometric analyses have tested the reliability and validity of such scales revealing that several measures are adequate for research purposes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-2153368713494214">Bradford, Jackson &amp; Stanko, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-2153368713494214">Cao et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-2153368713494214">Cao &amp; Hou, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-2153368713494214">Reisig, Bratton, &amp; Gertz, 2007</xref>). However, few studies have considered how these scales function by race. It might be the case that the differences discussed in the literature are at least partially a function of how different racial groups perceive and respond to the particular items in a scale and not that they measure real attitudinal differences toward law enforcement. If race effects are prominent in the literature on confidence in the police and police legitimacy, and research shows that they are, then a careful examination of the constructs revealing these differences is warranted. In other words, differences by race in scale scores may reflect true underlying differences in perceptions of justice/confidence, or they may reflect that the scales measure <italic>different</italic> constructs for Whites than they do for Blacks.</p>
<p>To date, research has not examined this possibility with respect to scales measuring attitudes toward the police. However, racial differences in other scales suggest that differential item functioning (DIF) is a possibility. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-2153368713494214">Cauffman and MacIntosh (2006</xref>) examined gender and racial differences in interpretation of the Massachusetts Youth Screening Instrument–Second Version and discovered some potentially problematic items. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-2153368713494214">Piquero, MacIntosh, and Hickman (2002</xref>) found DIF by race in a well-known self-report delinquency scale. These results suggest that findings on the basis of these measures may not be tapping the same constructs for Whites and Blacks. They also point out the potential for racial differences in measurement properties which may alter the meaning or interpretation of differences in scores on latent constructs. Others have found that popular self-control measures also operate differently by sex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-2153368713494214">Gibson, Ward, Wright, Beaver, &amp; DeLisi, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-2153368713494214">Higgins, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Whether differences in scale scores reflect real differences in attitudes or measurement error is clearly an important question for policy. If part of the reason that minorities have traditionally had lower ratings of police than Whites is because of measurement error, policies directed at addressing these disparities may need to be reconsidered. This may also go a long way toward explaining why research has yet to clearly understand why such differences exist. However, if there is little evidence that measurement error explains racial differences in attitudes toward the police, then there is substantial reason to believe that the findings reflect real differences in attitudes that need to be addressed.</p>
<p>To address this question, we examine the psychometric properties and whether there are racial differences in the response to items for two particular scales measuring confidence in the police and procedural justice. We utilize data from the National Police Research Platform’s Police–Community Interaction Survey (PCIS), which include responses from over 1,200 individuals who have had a recent encounter with the police. In what follows, we begin by reviewing the literature on confidence in the police and procedural justice paying particular attention to the importance of race. We then introduce the Rasch model as a method to examine differences in measurement by race, using a technique called DIF (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-2153368713494214">Walker, 2011</xref>). This is followed by the analysis and discussion of the results.</p>

<title>Race and Confidence in the Police</title>
<p>The importance of the community and public citizens with respect to the role of the police has been recognized for over a century. In the early 20th century, efforts to professionalize the police sought to decrease the perception that the police were corrupt or unfair. In the middle to late 20th century, it became increasingly clear that public cooperation was essential for the police to do their jobs well. This led to the rise of community policing, seeking a more trustworthy relationship between the public and the police (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-2153368713494214">Bridenball &amp; Jesilow, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-2153368713494214">Dunham &amp; Alpert, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-2153368713494214">Skogan, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-2153368713494214">Walker, 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-2153368713494214">1999</xref>). An important part of the move to community policing was to increase confidence in the police’s ability to protect citizens. Citizen confidence in the police is important because it is related to the willingness of citizens to cooperate with the police (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-2153368713494214">LaFree, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-2153368713494214">Sunshine &amp; Tyler, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-2153368713494214">Tyler, 1990</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-2153368713494214">2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-2153368713494214">Tyler &amp; Wakslak, 2004</xref>). This cooperation includes reporting criminal incidents, facilitating police investigations, and not engaging in criminal behavior. As criminal justice moves toward a more integrative and collaborative model to crime control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-2153368713494214">Klofas, Hipple, &amp; McGarrell, 2010</xref>), the ability of the police to effectively work with the community is increasingly important.</p>
<p>In general, the majority of the public appears to be quite satisfied with the police and highly rate their confidence in how officers do their jobs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-2153368713494214">Cao et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-2153368713494214">Schuck &amp; Rosenbaum, 2005</xref>). However, there are several challenges for the police in engaging and gaining the trust of the public. For example, focused patrols, hotspot policing, saturated patrols, and other strategies often target youth in disadvantaged areas who have little input into these strategies which are often seen as intrusive or unjust (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-2153368713494214">DeLeon-Granados, 1999</xref>). These areas are often home to concentrations of minority residents (particularly Blacks and Hispanics), and research reveals that these groups rate their confidence in the police much lower than Whites (Eith &amp; Druose, 2011; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-2153368713494214">Tuch &amp; Weitzer, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-2153368713494214">Tyler, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-2153368713494214">Weitzer &amp; Tuch, 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>To date, research has sought–with limited success—to determine the causes of this differential confidence in the police. Although some work has found substantial mediators of racial disparities in attitudes toward the police (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-2153368713494214">Dai &amp; Johnson, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-2153368713494214">Frank, Brandl, Cullen, &amp; Stichman, 1996</xref>), much research continues to demonstrate differences. Taking into account direct experiences, police practices, neighborhood effects, and socioeconomic status, much research continues to reveal divergent opinions of the police according to the race of the respondent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-2153368713494214">Eschholz, Blackwell, Gertz, &amp; Chiricos, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-2153368713494214">Sampson &amp; Bartusch, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-2153368713494214">Schuck &amp; Rosenbaum, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-2153368713494214">Tuch &amp; Weitzer, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-2153368713494214">Weitzer &amp; Tuch, 1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-2153368713494214">2005</xref>). It thus appears that this finding is the result of numerous factors with no one simple answer.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-2153368713494214">
<title>Race and Procedural Justice</title>
<p>Procedural justice, or feeling that the justice system is fair, is also related to cooperation with the police. Individuals who believe that the police are fair are more likely to believe that the police are legitimate and are thus more willing to cooperate with them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-2153368713494214">Tyler, 2005</xref>). In addition, when the public believes that the criminal justice system and the law are legitimate, they are more likely to be law abiding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-2153368713494214">Fagan, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-2153368713494214">Tyler, 1990</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-2153368713494214">1997</xref>). This is particularly the case when a person has had a positive direct experience with the police (Tyler &amp; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-2153368713494214">Fagan, 2008</xref>). Conversely, negative experiences (real or perceived) often lead individuals to view the police as less legitimate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-2153368713494214">Browning, Cullen, Cao, &amp; Kopache, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-2153368713494214">Reitzel, Rice, &amp; Piquero, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-2153368713494214">Rocque, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-2153368713494214">Rosenbaum, Schuck, Costello, Hawkins, &amp; Ring, 2005</xref>). How people are treated during an encounter with the police is a strong predictor of satisfaction with the police. The view of the police as less legitimate among minorities appears to be related to the perceptions and experiences of minorities with practices such as racial profiling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-2153368713494214">Hagan &amp; Albonetti, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-2153368713494214">Tyler &amp; Wakslak, 2004</xref>). Further, minorities often perceive that they are treated differently or unfairly during encounters with police (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-2153368713494214">Browning et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-2153368713494214">Eith &amp; Durose, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-2153368713494214">Eschholz et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-2153368713494214">Gabbidon &amp; Greene, 2008</xref>). This includes the perception that Black communities and citizens experience “differential policing” in terms of both the frequency and the types of encounters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-2153368713494214">Schuck &amp; Rosenbaum, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Research has also concluded that there are fundamental differences between Whites and Blacks in the interpretation of questions about the police. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-2153368713494214">Scaglion and Condon (1980</xref>) suggested that Whites’ attitudes toward the police were more likely than Blacks to be shaped by the media and other secondary sources than Blacks’ attitudes which are more likely to be shaped by direct interaction with the police who target them or people they know. Blacks are also more likely to come to the police with a complex set of issues regarding the police including a history of maltreatment and distrust. This points to the need to not only investigate racial differences in satisfaction with the police but also differences in <italic>measurement structure</italic> (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-2153368713494214">Schuck &amp; Rosenbaum, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Taken together, there is little wonder why research finds racial differences in satisfaction with the police. Minorities have less confidence in the police and view the police as less legitimate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-2153368713494214">Tuch &amp; Weitzer, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-2153368713494214">Tyler, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-2153368713494214">Weitzer &amp; Tuch, 1999</xref>). The reasons for this racial disparity have been addressed by several researchers but salient questions remain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-2153368713494214">Weitzer &amp; Tuch, 2004</xref>). It is possible that several factors, such as class, neighborhood context, and previous differential/discriminatory treatment all coalesce to paint the picture of attitudinal disparity that the literature has continually documented. To the extent that racial differences in attitudes toward the police are a function of racial profiling or negative experiences, it is clear that targeted efforts by the police are needed to bridge this gap. However, another (perhaps not mutually exclusive) possibility exists. Research has largely overlooked racial differences that might exist in the interpretation of the scales used in this type of research. Minorities might respond to certain questions differently than nonminorities, regardless of their actual attitudes and perceptions of the police. If there are differences in how respondents interpret or respond to scale items regularly used in policing research, racial differences uncovered in analyses may be due (perhaps partially) to racial differences in responses to the same items for people with the same level of confidence in the police. This study examines differential functioning of policing scales by race using a psychometric strategy not often utilized in the field of criminology/criminal justice: Rasch analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-2153368713494214">Hambleton, Swaminathan, &amp; Rogers, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-2153368713494214">Rasch, 1960</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section4-2153368713494214">
<title>Psychometric Assessments and the Rasch Model</title>
<p>Researchers recognize that measurement is a serious issue when testing theories of crime and criminal justice. Policing scholars are continuing to assess measures and refine concepts related to satisfactions with the police. A recent example is a psychometric analysis conducted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-2153368713494214">Gau (2011</xref>) who examined the measures of procedural justice and police legitimacy revealing some areas of concern. Her analysis suggested that the internal consistency of the legitimacy construct she examined was questionable and that a revised scale functioned similarly but was more reliable. Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-2153368713494214">Reisig, Bratton, and Gertz (2007</xref>) revised measures of procedural justice based on Tyler’s process-based model of policing to improve validity. Arguing that prior research has neglected issues of measurement, they use factor analysis to construct measures of police legitimacy and subsequent regression analysis to confirm the validity of the scales. Their analysis revealed that the adjustments to the original measures were, in fact, improvements and that the revised scale was much stronger psychometrically.</p>
<p>Traditional psychometric techniques based on classical test theory (CTT), such as factor analysis or inter-item analyses (e.g., Cronbach’s α), are concerned with how items in a scale are correlated with one another. However, CTT methods overlook the fact that respondent characteristics may be related to how they answer items. Other researchers have acknowledged this deficiency of traditional methods and opted for a more rigorous strategy based on item response theory (IRT; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-2153368713494214">Piquero, MacIntosh, &amp; Hickman, 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-2153368713494214">2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-2153368713494214">2002</xref>). The Rasch model of measurements is an IRT technique that separates person ability (how different people answer questions) and item difficulty (how difficult questions are to endorse/support) and seeks to determine whether a set of items has reached fundamental or consistent measurement. In the Rasch approach, as opposed to more traditional methods, the fit of the data to the model is examined, rather than the fit of the model to the data. The separation of person ability from item difficulty allows an assessment of whether these two factors correspond. If they do not, this finding suggests that revisions should be made to the scale. For a more in-depth review of the advantages of Rasch methods for scale assessment, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-2153368713494214">Piquero, MacIntosh, and Hickman (2000</xref>).</p>
<p>The distinction of person ability and item difficulty within Rasch analyses provides advantages over CTT methods that rely on correlation between items and are thus sample dependent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-2153368713494214">Piquero et al., 2000</xref>). This is important in the present case because race may play an influential role in how a person might answer a question about confidence in the police or procedural justice. For example, a Black respondent and a White respondent might be equally likely to endorse (answer yes to) the same types of questions but a Black person might interpret certain questions differently than a White person. In fact, research has demonstrated differences in perceptions of the same situation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-2153368713494214">Eschholz et al., 2002</xref>). Therefore, even though ability or propensity on a particular measure is the same, there may be evidence of DIF across race that effects the way questions are answered. Researchers examining DIF by race have found this to be the case (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-2153368713494214">Cauffman &amp; MacIntosh, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-2153368713494214">Piquero et al., 2002</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-2153368713494214">Piquero and colleagues (2002</xref>, p. 517) suggested that “the DIF observed in the SRD could result in group differences in means or patterns of correlations that become potentially artifactual and perhaps substantively misleading.” If DIF exists, this would have clear implications for the measures used to evaluate procedural justice and confidence in the police. It may also partially explain why researchers continue to find differences in confidence in the police and procedural justice by race.</p>
<p>Rasch analysis allows researchers to specifically examine DIF across subgroups (here, race). DIF determines whether item difficulty varies by group—a finding that should not occur if a measurement scale is accurately representing a latent trait. If items are easier for Whites to endorse, this could result in a scale score that shows minorities as having lower levels of that trait (e.g., procedural justice) when this might not necessarily be the case. This is an important, but as of yet unexplored, issue in policing research. The purpose of this study is to examine the psychometric properties of two scales: confidence in the police and procedural justice, using both CTT and IRT approaches to determine whether the scales are reliable, valid, and function similarly by race.</p>
<p>The latter question is of the utmost importance in policing research. As we have noted, one of the strongest findings in the literature is that minorities—especially Blacks, have lower levels of confidence in and satisfaction with the law and/or the police. This finding has been replicated in numerous samples and across time (for a review, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-2153368713494214">Rocque, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-2153368713494214">Weitzer &amp; Tuch, 1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-2153368713494214">2006</xref>). To the extent that these findings reflect real differences in attitudes by race, there are clear policy implications in terms of changing the way that police relate to minorities. In addition, it would be incumbent on researchers to discover the causes of these differences. However, as we have noted throughout this article, another possibility exists: that there are differences in <italic>interpretation</italic> of scale items by race. This possibility implies that rather than minorities feeling the police are less legitimate or effective than Whites, minorities simply respond to items that make up these scales in a different manner than Whites. In other words, Whites and Blacks who hold the <italic>same</italic> position on the latent trait (say, confidence in the police) answer <italic>differently</italic> than Whites to the same questions. This possibility suggests that further attention to measurement is needed. To our knowledge, this possibility has not been explored as of yet in the literature.</p>

<title>Data and Sample</title>
<p>Using data from the National Police Research Platform’s PCIS, this article uses several methods to assess whether the psychometric properties of two common scales in the policing literature: (1) confidence in the police and (2) police legitimacy, vary by race. Research teams from two locations in the U.S. collected data on citizen encounters with the police over the months of September 2010–March 2011 in three locations. One location is a large east coast police department serving a population of more than 300,000 (response rate = 7.75%), one is a small city police department located in the Midwest serving a population of approximately 52,000 (response rate = 7.78%), and the third is a small town police department in the Midwest serving a population of approximately 12,000 (response rate = 7.04%).</p>
<p>The sample was obtained by mailing or e-mailing a letter from the chief of police to citizens who had a current (within the past week) encounter with an officer inviting them to participate in a survey. These encounters included reporting a crime to the police, reporting a traffic accident, and in two jurisdictions being stopped by the police for a traffic violation. The letters/e-mails informed the citizen that they could log on to a website or call a toll-free number to complete the survey. The survey was given in both English and Spanish (participants could choose one). The total sample includes all those who completed the survey for a total of 1,290 individuals. Descriptive statistics are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-2153368713494214">Table 1</xref>.</p>

<title>Measures</title>
<sec id="section7-2153368713494214">
<title>Independent variables</title>
<p>Two major independent variables are used in the logistic regressions and as the main variables in the Rasch analysis. First, confidence in the police is an additive scale of 6 dichotomous items from the community contact survey. These items measure perceptions of how well individuals believe the police are doing at addressing crime and problems within their community. This original scale ranges from 0 to 6 with a mean of 5.24. This skew is the result of a majority of the sample rating the police at a 6 (<italic>yes</italic> on all items). Therefore, the measure is collapsed into a dichotomous measure where a score of 0–5 corresponds to <italic>lower</italic> confidence in the police and a 6 corresponds to <italic>high</italic> confidence in the police.</p>
<p>The second main variable is procedural justice. This measure is an additive scale consisting of 10 dichotomous items from the survey. The items constructing this scale tap whether the respondent thought the officer listened to them, cared about the situation, and was professional. Scores ranged from 0 to 10. Again, a large majority of the respondents had the maximum score so the measure was collapsed into the same “lower” category (score of 0–9 = <italic>0</italic>) and “high” category (10 = <italic>1</italic>). A complete list of items for both of the main scales is presented in the <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-2153368713494214">Appendix</xref>.</p>
<p>Several covariates are included in the multivariate analysis. <italic>Age</italic> is a continuous measure of the respondent’s age. A series of dummy variables are included for <italic>Black</italic>, <italic>Hispanic</italic>, and <italic>other race</italic> categories. White is left out as the reference group. <italic>Male</italic> is a measure of sex coded as 0 = <italic>female</italic> and 1 = <italic>male</italic>. <italic>Location</italic> is dummy coded for each of the three sites so that 0 = <italic>no</italic> and 1 = <italic>yes</italic>—Site 3 is left out as the reference category.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-2153368713494214">
<title>Dependent variable</title>
<p>The dependent variable in the multivariate analysis is a measure of satisfaction with the police encounter. The original variable ranges from 1 (<italic>completely dissatisfied</italic>) to 5 (<italic>completely satisfied</italic>). Seventy percent of the sample was completely satisfied with their encounter. Therefore, this measure is dichotomized so that 0 = <italic>not completely satisfied</italic> and 1 = <italic>completely satisfied</italic>.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-2153368713494214">
<title>Analytic Strategy</title>
<p>Our analytic strategy is twofold. First, we utilize CTT psychometric analyses (e.g., factor analyses and reliability analyses) to examine the two scales. This is to determine whether the scales have evidence of consistency, using more traditional methods, as typically found in the literature. Tetrachoric factor analysis is conducted on both scales. Since the items constructing our two scales are dichotomous, traditional factor analysis, which assumes interval-level measurement of items, would not be an adequate strategy. Tetrachoric factor analysis first computes the pairwise correlations of the items using bivariate probit with the maximum likelihood estimation procedure. This pairwise correlation matrix is then used to conduct the factor analysis—here this was an iterative principle factor method. We also utilize reliability (Cronbach’s α) analyses to examine whether the scales are internally consistent. With dichotomous items, this is equivalent to the Kuder–Richardson formula 20 (KR-20) test. Second, bivariate (χ<sup>2</sup>) tests and multivariate logistic regression models are constructed using each scale as an independent variable to predict satisfaction with an encounter with the police.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-2153368713494214">1</xref>
</sup> Confidence in the police and procedural justice are shown in the literature to be related to satisfaction with a police encounter. Therefore, this is a test of validity.</p>
<p>Finally, we introduce the IRT model (Rasch) to explore how items within these scales might operate differently across race among comparable individuals. Here, Rasch analysis is utilized to uncover any differential functioning of scale items by race. Rasch analysis accounts for both item difficulty (how difficult it is for a specific item to be answered affirmatively) and personal ability (how difficult it is for a particular person to endorse a specific item). DIF can be explored by comparing the responses on the same items for individuals with the same person ability. If differences exist within groups among individuals who have the same ability, there is evidence of DIF.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>
<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-2153368713494214">Table 1</xref> presents the descriptive statistics for the sample. This is broken out into racial groups for Whites, Blacks, Hispanics, and “other” races. The “other” group includes Asians, Native Americans, and other races/ethnicities not listed in the survey. Individuals from the Hispanic and the other racial groups tended to be a bit younger and consist of more males than the White and Black groups. Site 2 had more Black respondents than the other sites, while Site 1 had more Hispanics, and Site 3 had more respondents in the other racial group. In terms of confidence in the police, procedural justice, and satisfaction—Whites had the highest scores for each, followed by Blacks, Hispanics, and the other racial group.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-2153368713494214">2</xref>
</sup> The one exception was that the other group had the second highest score for confidence in the police.</p>
<p>Next, construct validity and reliability are tested by conducting a factor analysis on the tetrachoric correlations and calculating a Cronbach’s α for the items for each scale. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-2153368713494214">Table 2</xref> indicates that the confidence in the police scale is internally consistent and reliable. Each item is correlated with one another (KR-20 = .91) and one factor emerged with an Eigenvalue of 5.32. Similarly, in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-2153368713494214">Table 3</xref>, the procedural justice scale is internally consistent and reliable. Each item is correlated with one another (KR-20 = .90) and one factor emerged with an Eigenvalue of 8.24. A separate principal component factor analysis (not shown) confirmed that these scales are two different constructs producing two separate factors with items of each scale loading on only one factor.</p>

<xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-2153368713494214">Table 6</xref> includes both measures in a multivariate logistic regression analysis. The relationship between the constructs and satisfaction with the police should hold after controlling for additional variables if they are valid measures of satisfaction with the police. Model 1 includes the measure of confidence in the police and Model 2 includes the measure of procedural justice. Both measures remain significant and have substantial effects on satisfaction with the police (they also remain significant when both variables are included in the same model—results not shown). Individuals having high confidence in the police are over 6 times (odds ratio [OR] = 6.60) more likely than those with lower confidence in the police to be completely satisfied with their encounter (increase of .36 in predicted probability of complete satisfaction). Individuals experiencing high procedural justice are over 14 times (OR = 14.67) more likely than those who do not report high procedural justice during their encounter to be completely satisfied (increase of .52 in predicted probability of complete satisfaction). In sum, these measures are both reliable and valid constructs, using traditional psychometric methods.</p>

<p>Although these scales are reliable and valid, and comport with results from the literature, still there may be issues related to how different groups interpret and respond to certain items within these scales. While traditional methods are adequate to investigate broad psychometric properties, they cannot capture more nuanced properties such as DIF. Using WINSTEPS 3.73 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-2153368713494214">Linacre, 2009</xref>), we conduct Rasch analysis to determine if DIF exists within the scales.</p>
<p>
<xref ref-type="table" rid="table7-2153368713494214">Table 7</xref> presents the DIF analysis. The first column for each scale is the item difficulty for Whites. This serves as a baseline measure. The higher the number, the more difficult the item is to endorse (answer <italic>yes</italic> to) for the respondent. What this implies is that given the same “ability” (or underlying attitude toward the police), higher responses (indicating more confidence or justice) are less likely to be selected. The second and third columns for each scale represent the difference that exists in item difficulty between the two groups. This is obtained by subtracting the second number from the first number (i.e., Group 1 [Whites])–Group 2 ([Blacks or Hispanics]). Therefore, the higher the contrast measure (absolute value), the greater the difference between groups. Negative contrast scores indicate that the item was more difficult for Blacks or Hispanics as opposed to Whites.</p>

<p>For the most part, there is little DIF that exists in either scale. The confidence scale showed no DIF by race, and all but 2 items in the procedural justice scale showed no significant DIF. Taken with the previous results, each scale is psychometrically sound—measuring in a consistent manner what it is supposed to measure. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table7-2153368713494214">Table 7</xref> suggests that there is little reason to believe that these scales function differently across racial groups. We can be fairly confident that the results of previous research, which finds differences in confidence in the police, procedural justice, and similar outcomes between Whites and minority groups, are founded in reality and not just a reflection of measurement differences.</p>
<p>However, two items in the procedural justice scale do exhibit DIF when considering the difference between Whites and Blacks. When asked if the officer was objective and if the officer displayed concern, a difference in difficulty between Blacks and Whites was found. For Whites, the objectivity item was fairly easy to endorse (difficulty = −.77) and the concern item was difficult to endorse (2.54). However, for Blacks, the objectivity item received a difficulty score of .45 (−.77 to .45) = −1.22 contrast. Interestingly, the concern item was more difficult for Whites to endorse (2.54 vs. 1.56), which was not expected. These contrasts are significant at <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01. It appears that racial groups interpret these questions differently.</p>

<sec id="section11-2153368713494214">
<title>Discussion and Conclusion</title>
<p>Much research has examined the relationship between race and attitudes (e.g., confidence and satisfaction) toward the police. By and large, this body of work has found that minorities view the police with more skepticism than Whites. To date, research has been equivocal when trying to explain this pattern. Most of this research, however, has taken the findings of differential attitudes by race at face value, assuming that the results reflect real differences. In this article, we raised the possibility that previous findings may actually be the result of differential functioning of scale items by race. This could be the case when a scale represents different constructs for Blacks and Whites.</p>
<p>Our results revealed that the scales employed by the National Police Research Platform to measure confidence in the police and procedural justice are reliable and valid using traditional CTT methods. Factor analysis indicated that each scale is a separate construct and that the items within the scales are interrelated. Validity analysis showed that the scales are related to outcomes in the expected direction. Confidence in the police and procedural justice were significantly and substantially related to satisfaction with the police. Thus, we have strong evidence that our measures are related in the expected direction for the overall sample.</p>
<p>To test the idea that minorities may respond to items differently than Whites, we utilized Rasch analysis. The DIF component of Rasch analysis allowed us to delve deeper into the functioning of the scales. The DIF analyses indicated that the items in the scales do not, overall, function differently by race suggesting that the findings in the literature on differential attitudes toward the police by race are not a function of DIF. Therefore, the consistent findings that minorities, particularly Blacks and Hispanics, have lower confidence in the police and lower perceptions of fair treatment during interactions, are not likely due to inconsistent measurement using current scales for each construct. Instead, this finding appears to reflect real attitudinal differences by race.</p>
<p>However, it should be noted that DIF was evident among two items in the procedural justice scale. When using Whites, Blacks, and Hispanics as the grouping variables, it was shown that the items tapping objectivity by the police officer and officer concern demonstrated DIF. This might be the result of a different interpretation of objectivity and concern by race. Blacks had a harder time responding that they thought they were treated objectively than did Whites. This is an important finding and suggests that, while other items function similarly by race, objectivity and concern stand out as potentially problematic. It also suggests that, all else being equal, Blacks may have a tougher time believing that the police are objective even if they have similar attitudes as Whites toward their encounter with the police. Future research should take up the task to investigate these items further.</p>
<p>The findings of this study are important for several reasons. First, they support the argument found in the literature that Blacks and Hispanics have more negative attitudes toward the police than Whites. Previous research had been unable to determine if lower scale scores were a function of lower position on the latent trait for minorities, or differential functioning of the items. Our study has indicated that the results of past research do in fact indicate that minorities hold lower positions on the latent trait, and thus view the police more skeptically than Whites.</p>
<p>There are limitations to this study that must be acknowledged. First, the sample for this study come from three locations in the United States and the generalizability of this sample is unknown. However, because Rasch analysis separates items and persons, the DIF analysis is therefore not sample dependent. The interpretation of the Rasch results is not affected by the representativeness of the sample. A common critique of the type of sample used in the current study is that the people who respond to such a survey will either be very unsatisfied or be very satisfied with their encounter with few in-between. Unfortunately, we cannot determine whether or not this is the case with our sample, but it appears that the majority of the participants indicated that they were satisfied and, when they were not, that their dissatisfaction was linked to perceived lack of procedural justice. Because the main purpose of our study is to test the psychometric properties of the scales, the analysis will not suffer greatly from this issue. We must also note that our sample size for Hispanics was relatively small, thus our findings for this group are not as entirely conclusive.</p>
<p>Our measures of confidence in the police and procedural justice have disadvantages as well. Both measures use shortened scales that omit some items found in original scales or items that are commonly found in the literature. Including abbreviated scales reduced the size of the survey and shortened the time required of the respondent to complete the survey. While there are items that were not included in the scales, analysis showed that the constructs remained reliable and valid and adequately represented the concepts that they were intended to measure. We are therefore confident in both of our measures.</p>
<p>In sum, this study attempted to contribute to the literature on policing and race by examining to what extent previous findings of differential attitudes toward the police may result from measurement issues. Using traditional CTT methods, we found (much like previous research) that attitudes toward the police scales utilized in the National Police Platform are reliable and valid—a point where much research has stopped in terms of psychometric analyses. We turned to Rasch analyses to examine whether DIF exists in our measures by race. While two items did show evidence of DIF, for the most part, the items that comprise our two scales operate similarly across race. Thus, our results suggest that the historical finding of differential attitudes by race toward the police reflect real differences that are not accounted for by measurement properties. These findings offer additional support for efforts currently underway in many police agencies to improve the relationship between police and members of Black and Hispanic communities. Future research should attempt to measure the root causes of these differences, so that we understand the extent that prior experiences, media representation, class, neighborhood context, or other factors might be associated with consistently lower levels of trust and confidence in the police by certain groups in our society.</p>
