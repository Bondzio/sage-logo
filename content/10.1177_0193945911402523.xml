<abstract>
<p>This study determined the effectiveness of motivational interviewing (MI) to decrease prenatal alcohol use, while examining mechanisms of behavior change based on self-determination theory that may have evoked decreases in drinking behaviors. In all, 67 pregnant women who reported previous-year alcohol use were randomly assigned to an MI intervention or comparison group, with 56 women completing all study procedures. Both groups were assessed at baseline and 4- to 6-week follow-up for alcohol use and mechanisms of behavior change (basic psychological needs satisfaction and autonomous motivation). Only the MI group received the intervention after baseline assessments. Although MI was not found effective in decreasing prenatal drinking behaviors in this study, nonspecific factors were identified, such as treatment structures, participant motivation for improvement, and provider qualities, which may have influenced these results. More research is needed to determine theory-based specific and nonspecific factors that drive effective nursing interventions to decrease alcohol use during pregnancy.</p>

Interventions using various doses and types of ingredients have successfully reduced alcohol-exposed pregnancies, but with varying effectiveness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0193945911402523">Chang et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0193945911402523">Floyd et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0193945911402523">Handmaker, Miller, &amp; Manicke, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0193945911402523">Manwell, Fleming, Mundt, Stauffacher, &amp; Barry, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0193945911402523">O’Conner &amp; Whaley, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0193945911402523">The Project CHOICES Intervention Research Group, 2003</xref>). Yet little is known about the specific mechanisms of these interventions that evoked actual changes in the women’s drinking behaviors. The 2009 National Institutes of Health Science of Behavior Change meeting stressed the importance of understanding specific mechanisms of behavior change and their role as mediators of successful interventions. Highly recommended was the testing of theory-based mechanisms of interventions as one way to foster future development of individually tailored interventions to assist with behavior change. Therefore, this article describes a study that tested the effectiveness of a motivational interviewing intervention (MII) to decrease prenatal alcohol use, while it examined theory-based mechanisms of motivational interviewing (MI) that evoked changes in pregnant women’s drinking behaviors. Unexpected outcomes of this study led to the identification of several nonspecific factors or factors that are not theoretically active components of the intervention theory but that are common and shared by most intervention studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0193945911402523">Donovan, Kwekkeboom, Rosenzweig, &amp; Ward, 2009</xref>). This article discusses these nonspecific factors and their effect on the present study’s outcomes. This information will guide future intervention research in the quest to decrease alcohol use during pregnancy, thereby decreasing the risks of FASD in children.</p>

<title>A Theory-Driven MII to Decrease Prenatal Alcohol Use</title>
<p>This study examined the usefulness of an MII to decrease alcohol use during pregnancy, while addressing theory-based mechanisms of behavior change as guided by the self-determination theory (SDT; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0193945911402523">Deci &amp; Ryan, 1985</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0193945911402523">2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0193945911402523">Ryan &amp; Deci, 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0193945911402523">2002</xref>). MI is a directive, patient-centered counseling style that assists persons in the exploration and resolution of ambivalence related to behavior change, which enhances motivation for change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0193945911402523">Miller &amp; Rollnick, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0193945911402523">Moyers, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0193945911402523">Rollnick, Miller, &amp; Butler, 2008</xref>). Its collaborative “way of being” with clients emanates acceptance and optimism of the client’s abilities and autonomy to make decisions in her own best interest through the four MI principles of expressing empathy, developing discrepancy, rolling with resistance, and supporting self-efficacy. Through a counselor’s respectful and empathic use of reflective statements, open-ended questions, and linking summaries, a client examines any ambivalence between personal values and beliefs in regard to present behaviors. The client is supported in the development of goals congruent with present values and beliefs, with personalized strategies to achieve those goals promoted. Meta-analyses have found small to medium effects of MI in the improvement of health behaviors and outcomes, including alcohol use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0193945911402523">Burke, Arkowitz, &amp; Menchola, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0193945911402523">Hettema, Steele, &amp; Miller, 2005</xref>). One meta-analysis found that MI facilitated significant improvements in risky alcohol-use behaviors, superior to placebo or no-treatment controls, while producing effects similar to other active treatments, such as cognitive-behavioral treatments, 12-step facilitation, and counseling, in less time with patients (shorter by an average of 180 minutes or 3-4 sessions; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0193945911402523">Burke et al., 2003</xref>). Although MI has been successful in reducing future alcohol-exposed pregnancies in nonpregnant women of childbearing age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0193945911402523">Floyd et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0193945911402523">The Project CHOICES Intervention Research Group, 2003</xref>), only one study has examined the usefulness of MI in decreasing alcohol use with pregnant women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0193945911402523">Handmaker et al., 1999</xref>). Although findings of these studies are encouraging, the mechanisms of MI that are most helpful in evoking changes in prenatal drinking behaviors are unknown.</p>
<p>SDT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0193945911402523">Deci &amp; Ryan, 1985</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0193945911402523">2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0193945911402523">Ryan &amp; Deci, 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0193945911402523">2002</xref>) is a theoretical framework that can increase understanding of the mechanisms of MI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0193945911402523">Markland, Ryan, Tobin, &amp; Rollnick, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0193945911402523">Vansteenkiste &amp; Sheldon, 2006</xref>) leading to the identification and implementation of effective interventions to decrease prenatal alcohol use. The theory poses that all persons have three basic psychological needs—the need for autonomy, the need for competence, and the need for relatedness—and the more these needs are satisfied, the more intrinsically motivated a person is to engage in a behavior. Intrinsic motivation means a person engages in a behavior willfully and freely for personal satisfaction. Yet, extrinsic factors, or factors external to the individual, may also motivate behavior. Extrinsic factors that are externally regulated, such as rewards, punishments, and guilt, may motivate behavior in the present but may not sustain the behavior due to lack of autonomous decision making to engage in the behavior. Extrinsic factors that are internally regulated, such as those a person identifies with or that are congruent with personal values and beliefs, can lead to behaviors engaged in for more autonomously self-determined reasons. MI, through its empathic respect of a person’s autonomy and promotion of self-efficacy to make behavior changes consistent with the person’s inherent values and beliefs, provides an extrinsic environment, which could promote satisfaction of a person’s basic psychological needs and more autonomous motivations for behavior change. Therefore, this study determined whether MI was effective in increasing a pregnant woman’s satisfaction of basic psychological needs and autonomous motivations to decrease alcohol use during pregnancy, thereby leading to an actual decrease in the pregnant women’s drinking behaviors. More information regarding SDT and its integration in the MII can be found elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0193945911402523">Osterman, 2011</xref>).</p>

<title>Design and Sample</title>
<p>This experimental two-group pretest and posttest design study recruited a convenience sample of pregnant women from three prenatal clinics located in a midwestern university medical center. After institutional review board approval, pregnant women consented to screening for study eligibility, which included being between the ages of 18 and 44 years inclusive; at or less than 36 weeks gestation; being seen at a prenatal visit; able to understand, speak, and read English; positive for alcohol use in the previous year; and available for follow-up administration of questionnaires at a 4- to 6-week follow-up. Women were excluded from the study if they reported symptoms of alcohol dependence based on Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0193945911402523">Babor, Higgins-Biddle, Saunders, &amp; Monteiro, 2001</xref>) total scores of 20 or more. Also excluded were women with scores of 2 or more on AUDIT Items 4, 5, or 6 related to dependence symptoms, or 4 or more on Items 9 or 10 related to harmful alcohol use. Women who screened positive for alcohol dependence symptoms were referred to social services for further assessment and/or treatment of potential alcohol dependency. These women were excluded from this study due to potential confounding effects of the assessment and/or treatment provided by social services on determination of the MII’s effectiveness. Standard education about the risks of prenatal alcohol use was provided by the researcher to all women who consented to screening for study participation.</p>
<p>Eligible women then consented to participate in the intervention phase of the study, which included random assignment to an MII group or a no-MII comparison (NIC) group. Before participating in the MII, women in the MII group completed instruments measuring levels of basic psychological needs satisfaction and autonomous motivations to decrease alcohol use during pregnancy. These women were contacted by phone 4 to 6 weeks after the intervention to complete these same instruments and to answer questions regarding drinking behaviors since baseline. All MI interviews were recorded, transcribed, and evaluated by an MI Network of Trainers (MINT) member with expertise in MI methods, training strategies, and evaluation of MI fidelity and integrity. Women randomized to the NIC group completed instruments measuring basic psychological need satisfaction and autonomous motivations to decrease prenatal alcohol use at baseline, then were contacted by phone 4 to 6 weeks after baseline assessment to complete these same instruments and to answer questions regarding drinking behaviors since baseline. A payment of US$10 dollars was received by women in both groups after completion of baseline instruments, with receipt of a US$15 gift certificate after study completion.</p>

<title>Study Variables</title>
<sec id="section6-0193945911402523">
<title>Drinking behaviors</title>
<p>The AUDIT, a 10-item questionnaire with items scored on a 0 to 4 scale and totaled to determine hazardous/harmful drinking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0193945911402523">Babor et al., 2001</xref>), was used to screen for previous-year alcohol use and for alcohol-dependence symptoms in the women. If the women screened positive for alcohol-dependence symptoms, they were excluded from the study and referred to social services for further assessment. Because minimal intake of alcohol during pregnancy has been linked to FASD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0193945911402523">Sood et al., 2001</xref>), women with any positive response on the AUDIT were included in the study. Internal reliability of the AUDIT was found with women at risk for prenatal alcohol use in a feasibility study (Cronbach’s α = .90; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0193945911402523">Osterman, 2011</xref>) and in the present study (Cronbach’s α = .87).</p>
<p>Other drinking-related items reported by the pregnant women included (a) number of days drinking in a typical week and (b) number of standard drinks in a typical day. Women reported these drinking behaviors for the last 30 days and last year at baseline and for the last 4 to 6 weeks at follow-up.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0193945911402523">
<title>Basic psychological needs satisfaction</title>
<p>The pregnant women’s levels of basic psychological needs satisfaction were measured by the Basic Psychological Needs Scale (BPNS), a 21-item 7-point Likert-type scale with subscales for autonomy, competence, and relatedness averaged for each basic psychological need (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0193945911402523">Gagne, 2003</xref>). An index of general need satisfaction (total needs) was calculated by averaging the three need indicators for this study’s purposes. Internal consistency of the BPNS was found in a feasibility study (Cronbach’s α = .83 at baseline and .88 at 2-week follow-up; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0193945911402523">Osterman, 2011</xref>) and in the present study (Cronbach’s α = .82 at baseline and .80 at 4- to 6-week follow-up).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0193945911402523">
<title>Autonomous motivation</title>
<p>Levels of autonomous motivation to decrease alcohol use during pregnancy were measured with a modified version of the Treatment Self-Regulation Questionnaire (TSRQ; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0193945911402523">Ryan &amp; Connell, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0193945911402523">Ryan, Plant, &amp; O’Malley, 1995</xref>). In addition to modifying the stem of the TSRQ for prenatal alcohol use, the researcher added two items to measure the mother’s motivations to decrease alcohol use related to the baby’s health (TSRQ-P; alcohol use in pregnancy version). This resulted in a total of 17 items measured on a 7-point Likert-type scale. The Relative Autonomy Index (RAI) was calculated for use by this study by subtracting the average for the controlled regulation subscale from the average for autonomous regulation subscale. Internal consistency of the total TSRQ-P was found in the present study (Cronbach’s α = .712 at baseline and .756 at follow-up).</p>

<sec id="section9-0193945911402523">
<title>Intervention</title>
<p>The MII based on the four principles of MI—establishing empathy, developing discrepancy, rolling with resistance, and supporting self-efficacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0193945911402523">Miller &amp; Rollnick, 2002</xref>)—lasted approximately 30 minutes. It was provided by the researcher, a certified psychiatric mental health clinical nurse specialist with certification in inpatient obstetrics and training in MI. At the beginning of the intervention, empathy was established through the understanding and respectful attitude of the researcher as the woman’s values and beliefs about alcohol use during pregnancy and her goals for the current pregnancy and baby were discussed. Through the use of simple and complex reflections, open-ended questions, and summaries, discrepancies between the woman’s values and beliefs about alcohol use during pregnancy, her goals for the pregnancy, and her recent drinking behaviors were explored. The pregnant woman’s perspectives regarding the risks of prenatal alcohol use were received in a nonjudgmental manner to decrease or alleviate any resistance to share information. In support of the woman’s autonomy, her permission was asked before sharing neutral information and feedback. The woman’s abilities to set personal goals to decrease prenatal alcohol use and to develop strategies to support this behavior change were supported promoting self-efficacy.</p>
<p>All MIIs were digitally recorded. One of every two MII sessions was randomly selected for evaluation of fidelity with the Motivational Interviewing Treatment Integrity Scale (MITI) 3.0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0193945911402523">Moyers, Martin, Manuel, Hendrickson, &amp; Miller, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0193945911402523">Moyers, Martin, Manuel, Miller, &amp; Ernst, 2007</xref>) by a MINT member. The MITI evaluated the evocation, collaboration, autonomy/support, direction, and empathy demonstrated by the clinician in the MI interaction. It also coded behavioral counts of simple and complex reflections, open and closed questions, and MI adherent and nonadherent statements to indicate MI-consistent behaviors of the clinician. Details regarding the development and implementation of this intervention are described elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0193945911402523">Osterman, 2011</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section10-0193945911402523">
<title>Analysis</title>
<p>Structural equation modeling (SEM) was used to test the hypotheses of this study through the examination of causal relationships between variables based on theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0193945911402523">Byrne, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0193945911402523">Kline, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0193945911402523">Meyers, Gamst, &amp; Guarino, 2006</xref>). With all variables in this study represented by observed data, SEM evaluated the structural model for goodness of fit through path analyses. First, change scores were calculated for changes in drinking behaviors (drink days per week and drinks per day) of the MII and NIC groups from baseline to the 4- to 6-week follow-up. Change scores were derived by subtracting the number of drinking behaviors reported at baseline from the number of drinking behaviors reported at 4- to 6-week follow-up. Gains scores were calculated for changes in levels of basic psychological needs satisfaction and autonomous motivation over the same time period. Gains scores were derived by subtracting the BPNS score and RAI score at baseline from the respective BPNS and RAI scores at follow-up. Using AMOS 17.0, SEM determined the direct, indirect, and total effects of the MII on gains/changes in a pregnant woman’s basic psychological needs satisfaction, autonomous motivations, and drinking behaviors over a 4- to 6-week period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0193945911402523">Figure 1</xref>). Standardized beta weights assigned to paths that exceeded a 0.3 criterion indicated practical significance with an alpha level of .05 (one tailed). Model goodness of fit was indicated by the following parameters: a nonsignificant chi-square, Goodness-of-Fit Index (GFI), adjusted GFI (AGFI), and Normed Fit Index values greater than 0.95, and a root mean square error of approximation value less than 0.08 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0193945911402523">Byrne, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0193945911402523">Kline, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0193945911402523">Meyers et al., 2006</xref>).</p>

<title>Description of Sample</title>
<p>A convenience sample of 171 pregnant women (mean age = 24.90 years; mean weeks gestation = 20.71) seeking prenatal care at three prenatal clinics at a midwestern university medical center consented to screen for study eligibility. The majority of the women were non-Hispanic African American (66.7%), single (83.0%), had a high school diploma or higher education (75.4%), and an annual income of less than US$15,000 (64.3%). Mean number of total pregnancies was 3.21, with a mean of 1.58 deliveries in the women’s lifetimes. No significant differences in demographic characteristics were found between eligible and noneligible women, except in numbers of abortions and weeks gestation. The eligible group were screened earlier in pregnancy, <italic>t</italic>(153) = −2.53, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05, and had an obstetrical history of more abortions, <italic>t</italic>(115.82) = 2.58, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05, than the noneligible group.</p>
<p>Of the 74 women (43%) who met the eligibility criteria for participation in the intervention phase of the study, 67 women consented to participate. Thirty-nine women were randomly assigned to the MII group, with 29 women who completed all study procedures (2 women were taken out of the study due to fetal loss, 6 women did not come to the scheduled intervention session, and 2 were lost to follow-up). Twenty-eight women were assigned to the NIC group, with 27 women who completed all study procedures (one woman was lost to follow-up). No significant differences in demographic characteristics were found between these groups of women.</p>

<title>SEM</title>
<p>SEM determined the direct, indirect, and total effects of the MII on a pregnant woman’s BPNS gains scores, RAI gains scores, number of drink days per week change scores, and number of drinks per day change scores over the 4- to 6-week follow-up period. The intervention variable was coded as those women who received the MII (MII group = 1) and those who did not receive the intervention (NIC group = 2). Two separate path analyses for each drinking behavior parameter were conducted in lieu of one path using a drinking composite score (drink days per week × drinks per day) due to the discrepancy in the number of women in both groups who self-reported alcohol use in the last year that did not occur on a weekly basis. All missing data were determined to be missing completely at random with less than 5% incomplete data on any variable; therefore, any missing data were replaced by mean substitution. For the SEM analysis, three participant’s data sets were excluded from each path analysis due to outliers culminating in a final sample size of 53 pregnant women in each path analysis. Each path analysis included different participants due to differences in outliers. Two participants in the drink days per week model and two different participants in the drinks per day model were excluded with change scores greater than 3 standard deviations below the mean. One and the same participant was excluded from each path analysis due to a BPNS gains score that was 3 standard deviations above the mean. The final sample size was consistent with path analysis procedures based on the 1:5 ratio of number of parameters to number of cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0193945911402523">Bentler &amp; Chou, 1987</xref>). With nine parameters in the study model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0193945911402523">Figure 1</xref>), a minimum of 45 participants were required for this study.</p>
<p>Estimation of model fit for both the original hypothesized path models found saturated models. Significant path coefficients were found from the type of intervention (MII vs. NIC) to the number of drink days per week (β = −.23, <italic>p</italic> = .05) and from the type of intervention to gains in BPNS scores (β = .24, <italic>p</italic> = .04) in the drink days per week model at an alpha level of .05 (one tailed; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0193945911402523">Figure 1</xref>). No other path coefficients were significant in this model. No path coefficients were significant for the drinks per day model (model not shown). Respecified path models found fit indices that indicated good model fit with nonsignificant chi-squares. Of the remaining paths, only the type of intervention to the number of drink days per week (β = −.23, <italic>p</italic> = .05) and the type of intervention to gains in BPNS scores (β = .24, <italic>p</italic> = .04) in the drink days per week model remained significant. Again, the path coefficients for the drinks per day model remained nonsignificant.</p>

<sec id="section15-0193945911402523">
<title>Hypotheses</title>
<p>Hypothesis 1 was not supported by these findings with no significantly greater decrease in drinking behaviors found in the MII group compared with the NIC group at the 4- to 6-week follow-up. In the drink days per week model, significant differences were noted in drink days per week change scores between the two groups (MII group: <italic>M</italic> = −.875, <italic>SD</italic> = .919; NIC group: <italic>M</italic> = −1.38, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.25, <italic>t</italic>[51] = 1.69, <italic>p</italic> = .05). The standardized path coefficient between type of intervention received (MII vs. NIC) and changes in drink days per week scores was −.23, <italic>p</italic> = .05. The negative path coefficient indicated a decrease in days drinking per week from baseline to follow-up. Although a significant direct effect was found between the type of intervention group and number of drink days per week, the NIC group had a greater decrease in drink days per week than the MII group. This finding was contrary to the stated hypothesis. In the drinks per day model, no significant differences were noted in drinks per day change scores between the two groups (MII group: <italic>M</italic> = −2.18, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.40; NIC group: <italic>M</italic> = −1.93, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.11, <italic>t</italic>[51] = −.702, <italic>p</italic> = .24). The standardized path coefficient between type of intervention received (MII vs. NIC) and changes in drinks per day scores was .10, <italic>p</italic> = .24.</p>
<p>Hypothesis 2 was not supported by these findings, with no significantly greater increase in level of basic psychological needs satisfaction found in the MII group when compared with the NIC group at the 4- to 6-week follow-up. Significant differences in BPNS gains scores were noted between the two groups (MII group: <italic>M</italic> = 0.123, <italic>SD</italic> = .456; NIC group: <italic>M</italic> = .352, <italic>SD</italic> = .495, <italic>t</italic>[51] = −1.75, <italic>p</italic> = .04) in the drink days per week model. The standardized path coefficient between the type of intervention received (MII vs. NIC) and gains in levels of basic psychological needs satisfaction was .24, <italic>p</italic> = .04. Although a significant direct effect was found between the type of intervention group and gains in basic psychological needs satisfaction, the NIC group reported more gains in BPNS scores than the MII group. This finding was contrary to the stated hypothesis. In the drinks per day model, no significant differences in basic psychological needs satisfaction gains scores were noted between the two groups (MII group: <italic>M</italic> = 0.152, <italic>SD</italic> = .480; NIC group: <italic>M</italic> = .263, <italic>SD</italic> = .550, <italic>t</italic>[51] = −.787, <italic>p</italic> = .22). The standardized path coefficient between the type of intervention received (MII vs. NIC) and gains in levels of basic psychological needs satisfaction was .11, <italic>p</italic> = .21.</p>
<p>Hypothesis 3 was not supported by these findings in either path analysis with no significantly greater increase in levels of autonomous motivation to decrease drinking behaviors in the MII group when compared with the NIC group at the 4- to 6-week follow-up. No significant differences in gains were noted between the two groups (MII group: <italic>M</italic> = 0.232, <italic>SD</italic> = .945; NIC group: <italic>M</italic> = −.100, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.33, <italic>t</italic>[51] = 1.06, <italic>p</italic> = .15) in the drink days per week sample, with the standardized path coefficient between the type of intervention received (MII vs. NIC) and gains in levels of autonomous motivation at −.12, <italic>p</italic> = .19. In addition, no significant differences in gains were noted between the two groups (MII group: <italic>M</italic> = 0.201, <italic>SD</italic> = .973; NIC group: <italic>M</italic> = −.200, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.38, <italic>t</italic>[51] = 1.23, <italic>p</italic> = .11) in the drinks per day sample, with the standardized path coefficient between the type of intervention received and gains in levels of autonomous motivation at −.17, <italic>p</italic> = .11.</p>
<p>Hypothesis 4 was not supported by these findings. No greater decreases in drinking behaviors as mediated by increased basic psychological needs satisfaction and increased autonomous motivation were found in the MII group when compared with the NIC group at the 4- to 6-week follow-up. The only significant total effect of the type of intervention on the pregnant women’s drinking behaviors was found between the type of intervention and drink days per week changes (β = −.23, <italic>p</italic> = .05). No other significant indirect or total effects were found. Therefore, no mediating effects of basic psychological needs satisfaction and autonomous motivation on the drinking behaviors of pregnant women due to the intervention over the 4- to 6-week follow-up were found.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The purpose of this study was to determine the effectiveness of an MII to decrease alcohol use in pregnant women, while examining theory-based mechanisms of the intervention that evoked changes in the women’s drinking behaviors. Yet, no significant effects of the MII on the drinking behaviors of the pregnant women as mediated by self-reported levels of basic psychological needs satisfaction and autonomous motivation to decrease prenatal drinking were found. Contrary to the hypotheses of this study, the NIC group reported significantly greater decreases in drinking behaviors and greater increases in basic psychological needs satisfaction than the MII group in the drink days per week model. These unexpected findings may be explained by the influence of nonspecific factors not controlled for in the present study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0193945911402523">Donovan et al., 2009</xref>). Nonspecific factors identified in this study that may have affected its results included (a) treatment structures related to dosage of the intervention and the standard education on the risks of prenatal alcohol use provided, (b) participant motivation for improvement with low reported levels of drinking and high reported levels of basic psychological needs satisfaction at baseline, and (c) provider qualities, such as all study procedures provided by the researcher trained in MI.</p>
<p>The first nonspecific factor related to treatment structure involved the dosage of the intervention. Perhaps a one-time, single-session MII was not sufficient to decrease alcohol use in this sample. The risk of alcohol-exposed pregnancies has decreased with multiple-session interventions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0193945911402523">Manwell et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0193945911402523">O’Conner &amp; Whaley, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0193945911402523">The Project CHOICES Intervention Research Group, 2003</xref>). Yet, studies using single-session interventions have not found significant overall reductions in prenatal drinking behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0193945911402523">Chang et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0193945911402523">Handmaker et al., 1999</xref>), similar to the present study’s findings. Interestingly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0193945911402523">Chang et al. (2005)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0193945911402523">Handmaker et al. (1999)</xref> both found women with heavier alcohol consumption initially to have significant reductions in alcohol consumption in the intervention groups. A meta-analysis of the efficacy of brief interventions for hazardous drinkers in primary care settings found brief interventions to work better with heavy drinkers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0193945911402523">Ballesteros, Duffy, Querejeta, Arino, &amp; Gonzalez-Pinto, 2004</xref>). Because dependent drinkers were excluded from the present study, future inclusion of women who report heavier drinking behaviors would determine the effectiveness of a single-session MII with this group.</p>
<p>Dosage of the intervention may have led to the paradoxical findings of this study. Contrary to the stated hypotheses, the NIC group reported significantly greater decreases in drinking behaviors and significantly greater increases in basic psychological needs satisfaction at follow-up when compared with the MII group. It is possible that the standard education on risks of prenatal alcohol use provided to all women at screening may have provided an effective brief intervention for both the MII and NIC groups. But the addition of the MII may have been counterproductive to achieving outcomes in the MII group. A meta-analysis found MI to be more effective with clients who are more resistant and less ready for change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0193945911402523">Hettema et al., 2005</xref>). Conversely, it found that MI may not be as helpful in changing behaviors in persons who are ready to change and may actually hinder behavior change in these situations. With the overall low levels of alcohol use (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0193945911402523">Table 1</xref>) and the high levels of basic psychological needs satisfaction reported at baseline and follow-up for both groups (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0193945911402523">Table 2</xref>), receipt of the MII may have led to less satisfaction of basic psychological needs and less reduction of drinking behaviors in the MII group at follow-up. The standard education provided before administration of the BPNS may have increased the levels of basic psychological needs satisfaction resulting in the high levels reported at baseline and follow-up for both groups (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0193945911402523">Table 2</xref>). Yet, only the NIC group had significant within-participant gains in total BPNS scores at follow-up (<italic>p</italic> = .008), whereas the MII group experienced nonsignificant gains. Significant within-participant decreases in previous year to follow-up drinking behaviors in drink days per week and drinks per day were found for both the MII and NIC groups (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .001 and <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, respectively), although the NIC group had significantly greater decreases in drink days per week change scores at follow-up than the MII group. The influence of the standard education on the women’s drinking behaviors was supported by several women who during the MII stated that they had made the decision to not drink during pregnancy after the standard education was provided.</p>
<p>Other nonspecific factors, such as participant motivation for improvement, may have affected determination of the MII’s effectiveness to decrease alcohol use in this sample. With dependent drinkers excluded from this study, reported drink days per week and drinks per day at baseline for previous year drinking were low for study-eligible women at baseline (mean drinking days per week = 1.30 [<italic>SD</italic> = 1.50]; mean drinks per day = 2.34 [<italic>SD</italic> = 1.71]). Although low levels of alcohol consumed during pregnancy can result in FASD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0193945911402523">Sood et al., 2001</xref>), these low reported levels may have produced a floor effect, which could have impeded determination of the MII’s effectiveness due to limited room for improvement in drinking behaviors. The significantly greater decrease in drinking behaviors found in the NIC group may be attributed to receipt of the standard education at screening about the risks of prenatal alcohol use, while the addition of the MII provided to the MII group led to less reductions in alcohol use. Yet, several factors may have contributed to the overall low levels of self-reported prenatal alcohol use in both groups. Fear of punitive and legal consequences of prenatal alcohol use may have led to underreporting of drinking behaviors at baseline and follow-up (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0193945911402523">Golden, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0193945911402523">Thomas &amp; Rickert, 2004</xref>). A certificate of confidentiality in future studies would provide women the security to truthfully report prenatal drinking behaviors. Race and socioeconomic status may have influenced the lower levels of reported drinking by this study’s sample of primarily low-income African American women. Because predictors of heavier drinking among women of childbearing age include being White, younger (21-29 years), single, and of higher income (&gt;US$40,000 per year; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0193945911402523">Caetano et al., 2006</xref>), a larger sample of pregnant women of diverse races/ethnicities and socioeconomic statuses would address this limitation in the future. Pregnancy itself may have been a powerful motivator to decrease prenatal alcohol use because overall alcohol use decreases by more than 50% after pregnancy recognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0193945911402523">Floyd et al., 1999</xref>). Yet, the significant within-participant differences in drink days per week and drinks per day found for both the MII and NIC groups (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .001 and <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, respectively), with only one woman in the NIC group reporting a single drink at follow-up, resulted in an overall 98% decrease in prenatal alcohol use at follow-up.</p>
<p>A ceiling effect related to basic psychological needs satisfaction scores may also have influenced determination of the MII’s effectiveness. Mean scores on the BPNS ranged from 5.76 at baseline to 5.91 for the MII group and from 5.63 to 6.00 for the NIC group. With a total of seven points possible, women in both groups reported high levels of basic psychological needs satisfaction with limited room for improvement due to the intervention. The significantly greater BPNS gains scores reported by the NIC group could be attributed to receipt of the standard education, or it could be related to compensatory rivalry of the NIC group to perform better as they were not chosen for the intervention. The lower gains in the basic psychological needs satisfaction reported by the MII group could be related to the counterproductive influence of receiving the MII when the women were possibly not resistant and were ready for change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0193945911402523">Hettema et al., 2005</xref>). What contributed to the high levels of basic psychological needs satisfaction in both groups is unknown but could be related to other nonspecific effects, such as cultural issues, levels of perceived self-esteem, social networks, the women’s motivation to seek prenatal care, or the receipt of standard education concerning the risks of prenatal alcohol use before baseline administration of the BPNS.</p>
<p>A final explanation for the unexpected results of this study involved the researcher’s provision of the intervention as well as all other study procedures, including informed consent, administration of instruments, and follow-up for both the MII and NIC groups. Practitioners of MI use behavioral strategies that enhance a person’s motivation for behavior change. While the fidelity and integrity of the MII in this study were evaluated by an MINT member, these learned behaviors on the part of the researcher may have crossed over into interactions with participants other than the MII, producing a nonspecific effect due to provider qualities. The pregnant women in both the MII and NIC groups may have been influenced by the “spirit of MI” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0193945911402523">Miller &amp; Rollnick, 2002</xref>) exuded by the researcher at the various interaction points leading to high levels of basic psychological needs and the decreased levels of alcohol use at baseline and follow-up. Future studies can control for this nonspecific factor by having persons not trained in MI strategies provide all study procedures, except the intervention.</p>
<p>One limitation of this study was the exclusion of women who screened positive for dependence symptoms at baseline. Women who reported patterns of drinking indicative of potential alcohol dependence on the AUDIT were referred to social services for further assessment and potential treatment. These women were excluded from the study due to potential confounding effects of additional assessment and treatment provided by social services on determination of the effectiveness of the MII. Yet, other studies of interventions to decrease prenatal alcohol use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0193945911402523">Chang et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0193945911402523">Handmaker et al., 1999</xref>) found women with heavier alcohol consumption initially to have significant reductions in alcohol consumption in the intervention groups, whereas no significant differences were found in overall reductions between intervention and comparison groups. Meta-analyses have found brief interventions to work better with heavy drinkers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0193945911402523">Ballesteros et al., 2004</xref>) and MI to be more effective in facilitating behavior change in resistant persons less ready for change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0193945911402523">Hettema et al., 2005</xref>). Because women who drink at higher levels may experience greater difficulties decreasing alcohol use during pregnancy, future studies will include pregnant women reporting any amount of alcohol use to determine the effectiveness of the intervention across varying levels of alcohol use.</p>
<p>Another limitation of this study involved the difference in attrition between the MII and NIC groups. The rate of attrition in the MII group was 26% with two women taken out of the study due to fetal loss and eight who did not complete study procedures. The attrition rate for the NIC group was 4% with one woman who did not complete study procedures. No significant differences in demographic characteristics were found between these groups of women. The difference in attrition rates may have been related to a delay in provision of the MII that occurred due to scheduling. Women randomized to the NIC group typically completed all baseline instruments after screening and consenting for the intervention phase of the study at the same prenatal visit. Women randomized to the MII group many times chose to complete baseline instruments and the intervention at the next scheduled prenatal visit to allow time to arrange childcare and work schedules because the MII took an additional 30 minutes. This delay may have led to a decrease in some women’s motivation to participate, while contemplating an already busy life schedule.</p>
<p>The final sample size of 56 pregnant women who completed all study procedures was also a limitation of this study. Although this study’s sample size met the 1:5 ratio recommended by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0193945911402523">Bentler and Chou (1987)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0193945911402523">Kline (2005)</xref> recommended a 1:10 ratio to enhance power and statistical precision with SEM methods. A larger sample of pregnant women at risk for prenatal alcohol use of various races and socioeconomic statuses, with inclusion of heavier drinkers, would have determined if the intervention was effective for specific populations of pregnant women.</p>
<p>This study tested the effectiveness of an MII to decrease prenatal alcohol use, while it investigated SDT-driven mechanisms of the intervention. No significant effects of the MII were found on the drinking behaviors of the pregnant women as mediated by levels of basic psychological needs satisfaction and autonomous motivation to decrease prenatal drinking. Paradoxically, the comparison group reported greater decreases in drinking behaviors and greater increases in basic psychological needs than the intervention group. This study uncovered nonspecific factors that may have led to these unexpected results. Future intervention research will include theory-based specific and nonspecific factors in the development and provision of effective nursing interventions that decrease prenatal alcohol use and, ultimately, the incidence of FASD.</p>
