<p>When broadcasting organizations from different countries collaborate in producing a documentary, they create a global narrative. However, producers also try to adjust this narrative to the tastes of their own national audiences. This book analyzes the production and content of <italic>The Fifty Years War: Israel and the Arabs</italic> as the product of the tensions between the parallel needs of the producers – BBC, WGBH Boston (PBS) and MBC Abu-Dhabi/London – to share costs as well as to shape the program according to their own national narratives.</p>
<p>The first part locates this work within the gaps in the literature on memory-identity, media and nation. Ashuri’s aim is to show how national narratives manifest themselves in transnational TV documentary co-productions, and the way in which polarized approaches to globalization, which either stress its homogenizing effects or the relevance of local identities in shaping culture, are both valid. Chapter 1 defines shared and forgotten memory and how this consolidation via social communication maintains national identity. It also traces the history of nonfiction films in relation to national narratives. Chapter 2 highlights the development of the relationship between television and the nation, and how scholars have interpreted the impact of globalization on the national dimension. It then outlines Ashuri’s theoretical framework: while globalization transforms national memory and re-emerges within national boundaries in the form of ‘cosmopolitan memory’, national narratives find space in global productions. Chapter 3 shows how co-productions represent the practice this approach is best suited for, as they are the only type of collaboration where both financial and editorial efforts are shared. Common financial constraints lead producers to work together in creating a trans-national product, but one on which each producer is eager to imprint a national perspective.</p>
<p>The second part presents the analysis of the documentary. Chapter 4 analyzes the tense production phase during which the producers negotiated their common economic needs and their different cultural requirements. Elements on which unanimous agreement could not be reached – such as historical balance and blame – were replaced with balanced forms. Compromise involved moving the focus away from the historical responsibilities of nations and replacing comprehensive narratives with historical ‘bites’ which could be picked up by different national audiences and fit divergent perspectives and amnesias. In the end, however, different final versions were created in order to include elements on which compromise was not possible. Chapter 5 analyzes and compares the content of these versions, showing how they mostly differed in terms of the responsibility of nations historically involved in the conflict.</p>
<p>Chapter 6 discusses the findings in the light of Ashuri’s theoretical framework. Drawing from the work of globalization scholars such as Sassen and Beck, and expanding the concept of ‘cosmopolitan memory’ outlined by Levy and Sznaider, Ashuri brings together polarized strands of television co-production studies and demonstrates how transnational documentaries are spaces where the global and local both manifest dynamically in shaping representations of this conflict. However, the Israeli–Palestinian conflict is an area in which media professionalism is constantly criticized. The focus of national and global detracts from the fact that content about this conflict could also be determined by the producers’ reaction to this expected criticism, which may trump other dimensions. On the other hand, the national may play a greater role than recognized in the theoretical discussion, where global–local are presented as balanced factors: notwithstanding their undeniable ‘global flavor’, transnational documentaries might be the only possible choice for allowing national narratives to manifest themselves in times of economic constraint because it may be difficult to sell national products to foreign channels, as Ashuri’s findings indirectly demonstrate. Finally, the precision with which the central framework is outlined and adhered to leaves possibilities for further research. Narratives of this conflict also reflect an intermediate level of identity, only briefly tackled by Ashuri, which transcends national boundaries and affects national debates: to wit, pro and anti Western narratives. Further studies could expand on Ashuri’s findings to investigate if they, too, develop in response to perceived expectations of audiences or if they are mostly a media-originated type of identity.</p>
<p>This book provides a broad theoretical framework, a history of documentaries and a focused discussion on content and production, which will appeal to both theoreticians and practitioners. The focus on identity, globalization and national narratives will attract the interest of an interdisciplinary set of readers, while media scholars can find in this book a stimulating application of the call for contextualized media analysis.</p>
