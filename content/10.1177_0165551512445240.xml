<abstract>
<p>Prior studies indicate that undesired consequences may occur if knowledge cannot be effectively shared among members of a project team. Nevertheless, there are few studies that explore the knowledge-sharing (KS) mechanisms used and the contingency factors affecting their application in the context of managing new product development projects that encounter changes in project scope. Therefore, in this research the principles of the contingency approach were adopted in order to examine the KS mechanisms used and the contingency factors affecting their use in this context via an in-depth case study. Three key KS mechanisms and three contingency factors affecting their application were identified based on the research results. The relationship between the KS mechanisms and the contingency factors is formalized in five propositions. Future research that examines the interrelationships among these contingency factors and how they collectively influence KS practices in similar contexts is encouraged.</p>

<title>1. Introduction</title>
<p>The impact of unexpected changes in project scope on the performance of project teams, in terms of project cost, schedule, and quality, cannot be overlooked in today’s complex business environment in which project owners’ requests and expectations can change constantly. Under such circumstances, project teams tend to encounter stress-inducing situations in which critical decisions must be made in a timely manner based on limited information in order to ensure favourable project performance.</p>
<p>The results of a recent literature review indicate that successful knowledge-sharing (KS) practices can lead to the development of competitive advantage in a project team by enhancing team members’ coordination and problem-solving abilities. Although academic research indicates that the key to enabling effective KS practices in project teams is to let the experts talk to each other, this is a difficult task in practice, particularly in a time-stressed decision-making context. However, undesired consequences may occur if the knowledge cannot be effectively shared among the team, such as a reduction in the work efficiency of the project team, an increase in the probability of failure of new product development (NPD) projects, and unreasonable project delays. Nevertheless, there have been very few studies that explore the KS mechanisms used and the contingency factors affecting their application in the context of managing NPD projects with unexpected disturbances.</p>
<p>Consequently, this study aims to explore specifically the KS mechanisms used by project teams and the contingency factors affecting the use of these mechanisms when encountering unexpected and/or disturbing changes in NPD project scope by conducting an in-depth case study. The findings of this study can help NPD project teams examine their ability to harness critical knowledge, and, in turn, develop effective methods to share it in order to enhance NPD project performance. To conclude, based on the previous works examining KS practices in the context of NPD projects that encounter changes in project scope, this study is conducted with the intention of answering the following research questions:</p>

<title>2.1. Knowledge sharing</title>
<p>Knowledge management (KM) is considered key for organizations seeking to acquire a competitive advantage in intensively competitive business environments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0165551512445240">1</xref>]. Among various KM-related subjects, KS has been recognized as a major focus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0165551512445240">2</xref>] that is strategically important to organizations, as it enables individuals to acquire the knowledge needed from knowledge owners in order to improve their work performance and, in turn, benefit the organization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0165551512445240">3</xref>]. KS can be defined as a set of activities in which knowledge is transferred/distributed from specific individuals, groups, and organizations to others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0165551512445240">4</xref>]. The results of the literature review carried out in this work indicate a number of primary research perspectives for comprehending KS, as summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0165551512445240">Table 1</xref>.</p>

<p>What connects these perspectives is the interaction perspective of KS. Knowledge can be shared not only through structured media, such as documents, but also through informal and/or formal interpersonal interactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0165551512445240">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0165551512445240">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0165551512445240">20</xref>]. With reference to the classic distinction of tacit and explicit knowledge [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0165551512445240">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0165551512445240"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0165551512445240">23</xref>], KS practices tend to rely on four modes of interpersonal interactions (i.e. the SECI knowledge conversion processes) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0165551512445240">24</xref>]: socialization (tacit to tacit), externalization (tacit to explicit), combination (explicit to explicit), and internalization (explicit to tacit). Hendriks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0165551512445240">2</xref>] argues that, in order to share knowledge among multiple parties, it is necessary to perform an act of reconstruction, in which knowledge owners consciously communicate their knowledge in some form, while knowledge receivers do their best to understand that knowledge by using their own knowledge. This knowledge reconstruction process can be facilitated by effective interpersonal interactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0165551512445240">25</xref>]. To conclude, the core of KS is the perception that knowledge must continuously move throughout a group/organization by utilizing a diverse set of social and technical systems and processes that encourage and facilitate interactions among individuals so that the knowledge can be accumulated, reused, and recombined in order to generate potential benefits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0165551512445240">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0165551512445240">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0165551512445240">27</xref>].</p>

<title>2.2. KS practices in NPD projects with changes in scope</title>
<p>A project is the combination of a series of activities or tasks that has the following features: (a) a specific objective (scope) to be completed within certain specifications (requirements); (b) defined start and end dates; and (c) the consumption and/or the utilization of resources [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0165551512445240">28</xref>]. Projects are challenging to plan and manage because their conditions and performance change over time as a result of environmental turbulence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0165551512445240">29</xref>]. NPD projects have drawn significant attention from researchers and in this study NPD is defined as the complete process of bringing a new product from idea to market [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0165551512445240">30</xref>].</p>
<p>Competitive forces, such as intense global competition, demanding markets, and diverse and rapidly changing technologies, have caused organizations to undertake effective change management practices in their NPD projects in order to achieve the desired project performance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0165551512445240">31</xref>]. It is indicated in the literature that very few NPD projects succeed because of the dynamic nature of key success factors, including time, cost, quality, and, in particular, scope [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0165551512445240">32</xref>]. For example, changes in project scope often lead to significant schedule and/or cost overruns as a result of unexpected reworks and additional tasks, redesign of work processes, or re-allocation of resources [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0165551512445240">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0165551512445240">34</xref>]. Rodrigues et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0165551512445240">32</xref>] further note that changes in NPD project scope tend to increase the volume and complexity of tasks, leading to insufficiencies related to project staffing. This, in turn, causes a significant decrease in work quality, and thus leads to the occurrence of reworks in the project execution process. Additionally, as changes in scope often occur during the course of NPD projects, and have significant impact on their progress, a number of researchers have conducted and/or called for research that aims to explore and examine issues related to effective change management during this process [e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0165551512445240">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0165551512445240">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0165551512445240">35</xref>]. For example, Eden et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0165551512445240">36</xref>] argue that the efforts made by a project team to ensure that the project clients have sufficient knowledge of the related industry, such as well established knowledge banks accessible to the clients and appropriate knowledge sharing/communications activities with clients, can lead to client appreciation of the disruptions caused by changes in project scope, and thus mitigate their negative impact on project performance.</p>
<p>There is a significant body of studies related to KS in the context of project management, and there is a consensus that individual team members do not have all of the knowledge a project requires, and must therefore acquire the knowledge needed in order to accomplish their work. Koskinen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0165551512445240">37</xref>] and Hong et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0165551512445240">38</xref>] both point out that a great deal of the know-how required to achieve a successful project is tied to knowledge that is difficult, if not impossible, to present in an explicit format, but can be realized through the interactions between knowledge owners and seekers. Ruuska and Vartiainen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0165551512445240">39</xref>] identify two primary challenges related to KS practices in a project management context. One is that projects are often dispersed and peers have to collaborate at a distance from each other; another is that project teams are temporary, and a lot of the knowledge learned may be lost when the team disbands. It is thus important to develop effective means to facilitate interpersonal communication among project team members, such as the development of a team atmosphere that encourages KS practices [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0165551512445240">40</xref>].</p>
<p>Studies that focus on investigating KS in NPD project teams have been conducted based on various perspectives, such as action research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0165551512445240">37</xref>] and the communication/networking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0165551512445240">41</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0165551512445240"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0165551512445240">43</xref>] and risk management views [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0165551512445240">44</xref>]. For example, from a social capital perspective, Bakker et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0165551512445240">45</xref>] indicate that team membership, instead of trust, is the critical element of social capital that has the largest effect on the density of the KS relationships of project team members, particularly for individuals who belong to longer-lasting teams. Richtner and Ahlstrom [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0165551512445240">46</xref>] find that reduced possibility of change in project scope can facilitate sharing processes inside NPD projects, with a focus on explicit rather than tacit knowledge. Tukel et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0165551512445240">47</xref>] indicate that much valuable NPD-related knowledge acquired from previous NPD projects, particularly knowledge which is left over from incomplete or failed NPD projects, tends to be lost gradually if not appropriately managed. They thus emphasize the importance of the development of knowledge banks for facilitating KS and increasing the salvage value of the knowledge created. While the literature emphasizes the important role of KS in supporting the successful execution of NPD projects, there are few empirical or theoretical studies that investigate factors influencing the execution of projects undergoing unexpected changes in scope using a contingency approach.</p>

<sec id="section5-0165551512445240">
<title>2.3. The contingency approach</title>
<p>The contingency approach has been widely adopted in various areas of management literature and has been an underlying theme for theory building [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0165551512445240">48</xref>]. This approach emphasizes the importance of choosing the most suitable management systems by taking into consideration critical contingency factors, including corporate strategy, structures, and culture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0165551512445240">49</xref>]. To elaborate on this argument, it is worth noting that the essential premise of the contingency approach is that effectiveness, which can be broadly defined as organizational adaptation and survival, can be achieved in more than one way, which implies that universal principles for management excellence may not exist [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0165551512445240">50</xref>]. Zeithaml et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0165551512445240">51</xref>] argue that effectiveness depends on the appropriate matching of contingency factors with internal organizational structures that enable appropriate responses to uncertainty and changes in the environment, and suggest three steps for theory building using the contingency approach, as follows:</p>
<list id="list2-0165551512445240" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>identifying important contingency factors that distinguish between contexts;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>grouping similar contexts based on the identified contingency factors;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>determining the most effective organizational designs or responses in each major group.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Zeithaml et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0165551512445240">51</xref>] also indicate that the theory-building steps of the contingency approach involve contingency, response, and performance variables. Contingency variables are situational characteristics that are often exogenous to the focal entities, such as organizations, departments, and teams. The control and manipulation of these tend to be limited and indirect, and the key is to identify the contingency factors which explain the greatest variance in performance variables. Response variables are the managerial actions taken in response to the current or anticipated statuses of the contingency variables (e.g. KS mechanisms). Performance variables are dependent measures that represent specific aspects of effectiveness, such as employee productivity, project completion time, and product quality in the case of NPD projects.</p>
<p>Although, to the best of the authors’ knowledge, this approach is not very common in the literature on the management of NPD projects, it is essential in terms of building understanding KS practices in the context of such projects. This study thus adopts a contingency approach in order to explore the dynamics of KS practices in NPD projects undergoing changes in scope by identifying and taking into account the critical contingency factors.</p>

<title>3.1. Research design</title>
<p>The research subjects of this study were two research-oriented departments at two organizations, which operated on a project basis to develop new products. Thus, in this study the unit of analysis was the NPD project team, and the in-depth case study method was adopted with reference to the logic of the grounded theory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0165551512445240">52</xref>]. Grounded theory is an inductive method that enables researchers to develop a theoretical account of the important issues/phenomena related to the topic of interest, while simultaneously grounding these issues/phenomena on empirical observations or data. The quality of the case study carried out in this work was examined from three perspectives: construct validity, internal validity, external validity, and reliability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0165551512445240">53</xref>], which will be addressed in the subsequent discussions.</p>
<p>This study used a step-by-step process recommended by previous studies [e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0165551512445240">54</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0165551512445240">55</xref>]. The first step was to identify the key contingency factors and the KS mechanisms used by project teams by reviewing the existing literature on relevant domains, such as project management, KS, and group learning. The second step was to carry out a case analysis of two research-based departments (Departments A and B). The first aim here was to further evaluate the suitability of the identified contingency factors and the KS mechanisms, and then to group and modify them as necessary based on the results of the analysis. Then, the relationships between the identified contingency factors and the KS mechanisms were investigated and then summarized in the form of theoretical propositions.</p>
<p>
<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0165551512445240">Table 2</xref> summarizes the profiles of these two departments, and the <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-0165551512445240">Appendix</xref> presents more detailed descriptions of them both. These departments were selected for the following reasons. First, they share a sufficient degree of similarity in terms of average team size and project duration. Additionally, the two departments were conducting research related to environmental protection and renewable/biomass energy generating technologies, and their project teams tended to function in similar business environments and to confront similar difficulties when executing research projects. To conclude, the cases used in this research share a considerable degree of commonality, and thus it is likely that by studying them it will be possible to draw consistent and insightful conclusions related to the research topic.</p>

<p>To ensure the construct validity of this study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0165551512445240">53</xref>], three procedures were conducted. First, data was collected from multiple sources for the purpose of carrying out triangulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0165551512445240">56</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0165551512445240">57</xref>]. The data sources were as follows: (a) data from 17 semi-structured, face-to-face personal interviews with executives, middle-level managers, and employees with non-managerial positions, each lasting 40–120 minutes (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0165551512445240">Table 3</xref>); and (b) documents from the participating organizations, including memos, personal notes, work logs, and meeting minutes. A set of pseudonyms were selected for all the primary and secondary subjects to ensure confidentiality. Second, before the data collection process officially began, the sample interview questions, data collection protocols, and data analysis techniques to be used were sent to a number of academics and practitioners with expertise relevant to this study for their evaluation. Finally, three pilot interviews with two key informants were conducted in order to further validate the interview instruments.</p>

<p>With regard to the reliability of this study, two procedures were conducted [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0165551512445240">53</xref>]. One was that a case study protocol, which described the research purpose, interview questions, and guidelines to be followed by the researchers, was developed and used to guide the entire data collection process. The other was that a research database was built and constantly maintained to systematically store and process the research materials, including the research protocol, records of data collection process, raw data, coding scheme, and data codes, for future auditing purposes.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0165551512445240">
<title>3.3. Data analysis</title>
<p>This study adopts the grounded theory approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0165551512445240">52</xref>], which can be summarized by the following five characteristics. First, the researchers engaged in data analysis while collecting data. This practice allowed the researchers to gradually adjust the orientation of their data collection procedures based on their improving understanding of the research topic, which made the collected data become more focused. Second, the two-stage method of analytic coding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0165551512445240">58</xref>] was adopted for the data coding process. In the first stage of initial coding, the data collected was examined line by line in order to identify statements that were related to the study. When initial coding was completed, the second stage of focused coding began, in which the codes were sorted and categorized based on their conceptual similarities. During the process of sorting and categorizing codes, those that were considered irrelevant or relatively less productive were discarded. The remaining codes were then re-examined and their concepts were further elaborated for future analysis.</p>
<p>Third, the researchers used an inductive method in order to identify and develop theoretical reasoning for the critical themes relevant to the research topic, while simultaneously grounding this reasoning in empirical observations or data. These themes were then further analysed using the technique of pattern matching in order to ensure internal validity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0165551512445240">53</xref>]. The fundamental logic of this technique is to compare an empirically-based pattern or a rival pattern with one or multiple-predicted patterns [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0165551512445240">59</xref>]. If the patterns are identical, the internal validity of the case study is strengthened. If there are two potential patterns, the task is to first determine whether the data matches one pattern better than the other, and then to appropriately explain and organize what was observed from the collected data. Fourth, the external validity of this study was ensured by the use of multiple case studies and cross-case comparisons. Specifically, the themes related to the project teams in two departments were examined by treating each team as a separate case. Findings across different cases in this study were then compared in order to determine whether they shared similar characteristics. The question of how and why these cases were similar or different from one another was examined by identifying the dominant intervening factors and investigating their interactions with the case characteristics. Finally, the overall validity of the research results, which were presented in the form of theoretical propositions, was checked and verified by the research participants through three follow-up interviews.</p>

<p>The research results confirmed that the use of these KS mechanisms had a considerable influence on project performance. This was manifested in the data by the improving productivity of project staff, the on-time project completion, and the successful development of new products. Building on the cases analysed in research step three, the role of KS mechanisms used in the NPD projects was explored by examining their relationships with the identified contingency factors and project performance indicators. To take into consideration the sharing of both tacit and explicit knowledge, the conceptualization of the use of the identified KS mechanisms is grounded on the definition of the well known SECI (i.e. socialization, externalization, combination, and internalization) knowledge conversion processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0165551512445240">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0165551512445240">24</xref>] introduced previously in this work.</p>

<title>4.2. Knowledge categorization and indexing</title>
<p>Organizing knowledge (e.g. grouping, indexing, and establishing associations with appropriate, context-specific keywords) to make it more easily accessible by people who need to use it is an important KM task. At the individual level, although the task of knowledge categorization and indexing mostly requires sophisticated techniques, users can contribute to this by using tools that allow them to represent and index any sets of knowledge at the level of precision they desire [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0165551512445240">76</xref>]. However, academics have argued that the key to this task lies at the organizational level, and proposed a variety of principles for categorizing knowledge [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0165551512445240">77</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0165551512445240">78</xref>].</p>
<p>Documentation, particularly that distributed by various information technologies, such as websites, information systems, and discussion boards [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0165551512445240">64</xref>], is believed to surpass other methods and media in the speed of transferring/sharing knowledge [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0165551512445240">8</xref>]. Both Departments A and B use a KM system (KMS) for managing the documents of previous projects. As presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-0165551512445240">Table 6</xref>, the data indicate that rigorous documentation practices benefited both departments beyond simply enabling the effective identification and retrieval of the knowledge needed, as they also encouraged employees to transform their tacit knowledge into explicit knowledge (i.e. knowledge externalization) for preservation and reuse. A manager of Department A stated:
<disp-quote>
<p>We have a standardized protocol for processing documents related to this kind of project … Mostly we ask senior employees to teach the junior employees. It is like the relationship of master and apprentice … They work together to help each other to speak out and discuss their know-how, and then turn it into documents to be stored in the KMS … we do use the knowledge we learned from previous experience to make the way we do things more effective.</p>

<p>Additionally, most informants in both departments indicated that effective knowledge categorization and indexing practices, along with thorough documentation, would benefit them in various ways beyond the conventional benefits of the effective identification, retrieval and distribution of the critical knowledge. A noteworthy benefit of knowledge categorization and indexing is its usefulness in facilitating the arrangement and integration of the explicit knowledge (e.g. documents and logs of online forums) in the KMS into more sophisticated sets of domain-specific knowledge and electronic instruction programmes (i.e. knowledge combination) for employee learning, which can then enable individuals to identify knowledge gaps. An assistant manager of Department A, who served as the knowledge ambassador to oversee and facilitate KM-related tasks in his unit, commented:
<disp-quote>
<p>The appropriate ordering of the knowledge documents and the content of people’s discussions on the online forums in our KMS is very important to the identification of knowledge gaps caused by insufficient efforts to turn people’s experience into explicit knowledge documents … knowing what knowledge documents are missing regarding a particular area is a good sign of a knowledge gap … We need to train people to do this, since knowledge that is purposely organized will offer more values to us.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In the case of Department A, changes in project scope were usually demanded by the key shareholders, particularly those of the state-owned shares, due to market conditions and public opinion. This would result in extreme time pressure and potential financial losses. This increased time pressure was mainly responsible for the staff making less effort with regard to performing the necessary documentation tasks. Thus, to keep the process of documentation and knowledge categorization and indexing going smoothly, even when the project team members were under extreme pressure because of the changes in project scope, the management of Department A hired part-time assistants, who were mostly graduate students majoring in relevant areas at the local universities with which Department A had associations. Additionally, in the case of Department B, changes in project scope were common in the projects from private companies for reasons related to technical problems, market competition, and changes in the decision making authorities of the client companies. During the course of a project that encountered changes in scope, the resulting new work and rework tended to keep the team members more occupied than usual. This in turn led to significant time lags, both in developing related documents and in categorizing these documents for knowledge sharing purposes, especially the latter (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-0165551512445240">Table 6</xref>).</p>
<p>The reduced efforts in these KS-related tasks caused problems for both Departments A and B regarding the preservation of critical knowledge and the identification and elimination of knowledge gaps. This resulted in further problems in terms of facilitating effective learning activities. As another assistant manager of Department A stated:
<disp-quote>
<p>The information was messy and there was too much in the KMS. Sometimes our colleagues, particularly those relatively young and in-experienced ones, cannot figure out what kinds of documents in the KMS they should look for when having problems at work, and absorbing the knowledge needed in order to solve their problems in time is almost impossible … it is like a fake knowledge gap caused by the inappropriate location of the knowledge documents.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Additionally, without convenient access to important documents, employee training programmes might not develop appropriately, since the programme coordinators would have problems determining what new subjects to include, who would be an appropriate instructor, and what teaching materials should be offered in order to close the identified knowledge gaps. A manager in Department B stated:
<disp-quote>
<p>What I considered a failure is that most people simply upload the documents they are required to upload to our online knowledge repository in the KMS, without thinking about what “knowledge gaps” we have and then what documents needed to be created and shared … Systematic organization of the documents uploaded is also a neglected issue. Everyone has to realize that the knowledge can only be accessed easily and be useful to people who need it if the documents are properly organized … All these actions can help us do an iterative ‘knowledge needs assessment’ process that will let us know what knowledge needs to be recorded and shared, who has it, and who should be trained to understand it.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In summary, when encountering changes in project scope, a decrease in the efforts devoted to documentation diminishes the effectiveness of externalizing individuals’ tacit knowledge for preservation and future reuse. Additionally, a decrease in efforts to follow knowledge categorization and indexing practices makes it more difficult for project teams to identify genuine knowledge gaps and then to determine what knowledge needs to be acquired or created in order to work more effectively. Based on this discussion, the following propositions are developed:

<title>4.3. Management style</title>
<p>Management style is defined as the practices adopted by leaders in decision making, as well as the management of information, knowledge, social relationships, motivation, and subordinates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0165551512445240">79</xref>]. Management style influences the level of delegation, the manner of decision making (in terms of time required and the approach used), and the control of activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-0165551512445240">80</xref>]. Bossink [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-0165551512445240">81</xref>] indicates that a manager’s performance of an innovative leadership style is successful when it is combined with KM. There have thus been several studies that point out the need to further explore the relationship between management style and KS practices in a context of project management [e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0165551512445240">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0165551512445240">70</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-0165551512445240">81</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0165551512445240">82</xref>].</p>
<p>To conceptualize the management styles of Departments A and B, this study adopted the framework proposed by Likert [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-0165551512445240">83</xref>] that identifies and categorizes the management styles based on six operating characteristics. By using this, it was found that Department A implemented an <italic>autocratic</italic> management style, in that the attitude of the management tended to be strong, decisive, and firm but fair, and was protective and generous to loyal subordinates. Additionally, Department B was found to implement a <italic>consultative</italic> management style, with the attitude of the management tending to be egalitarian and influenced by subordinates in matters related to the tasks. Using a consultative management style, managers also used their authority to get the resources needed to accomplish the jobs on hand. This was evident by a number of observations made of these two departments, as illustrated in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table7-0165551512445240">Table 7</xref>.</p>

<p>Interactions among individuals in physical and virtual professional communities can facilitate interpersonal knowledge transfer and transformation, which broaden their expertise [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0165551512445240">63</xref>]. Communities of practice have implications for project-based learning, as it is assumed that learning deepens as participants change their membership from more peripheral project roles to more central ones within a project community [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-0165551512445240">84</xref>]. Haslam et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0165551512445240">60</xref>] divide communities of practice into two categories of formal (e.g. participants in regular or ad hoc project meetings) and informal ones (e.g. informal discussion groups, study groups, and online communities).</p>
<p>It was found that Department A had a well established system for enforcing the functioning of formal communities of practice. This included weekly project progress meetings and regular quarterly workshops in which department managers and project leaders made decisions related to resource re-allocation, and the design and execution of training activities that allowed project staff to constantly update their knowledge related to their professional areas. The instructors of these training courses were mostly university professors or experts recruited from business partners. Additionally, the information gathered showed that both formal and informal communities of practice were functioning in Department B. The project teams held regular project progress meetings (i.e. formal communities of practice) twice a month. Additional meetings might be called when there was a change in project scope, although these were not preferred by most of the employees in Department B, who favoured undertaking KS via the use of informal communities of practice, such as informal meetings and personal social networks.</p>
<p>When encountering changes in project scope, the managerial personnel of Department A reinforced the autocratic management style in order to keep themselves on top of things. The managerial personnel intended to develop a set of overall strategic guidelines and goals (as the products of <italic>knowledge externalization</italic> processes) for their subordinates to perform their individual tasks. Vertical communications dominated the communication processes via the increased use of formal communities of practice in order to share the knowledge necessary for managers to make high-level strategic decisions, and then to accurately pass along these decisions to their subordinates. As an assistant manager of Department A stated:
<disp-quote>
<p>Client requests for changes in project scope usually cause disturbances in our work, and the leader of the project team will hold additional project meetings … In these project meetings we are asked to extensively share our opinions and experience in order to develop a collective view of the project and alternative measures for dealing with the problems caused by the changes in project scope … the project leader will then decide what to do next in response to the client’s request … In this way, everyone knows exactly what to do and how to avoid disturbing other people’s work schedule by reducing error rates.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In contrast, the use of informal communities of practice is less obvious and less important in Department A, and changes in project scope further hampered the use of this KS mechanism. The autocratic management style of Department A made its employees accustomed to sharing knowledge vertically via formal communities of practice in order to impress their superiors for the purpose of gaining personal benefits or avoiding punishment. Horizontal communication with peers or business friends via informal communities of practice was considered less important and less productive, and thus was relatively limited. As a senior researcher of Department A mentioned:
<disp-quote>
<p>We get used to sharing what we know with one another during the scheduled project progress meetings, since it saves time to talk about things when everyone is present. Besides, we can also let our bosses know clearly what we have been doing and what kinds of assistance we may need from them.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>When encountering changes in project scope, the managerial personnel of Department B tended to shift from a consultative to an autocratic management style. The changes in scope created more pressure for the managerial personnel with regard to successfully implementing the project, which, in turn, resulted in a demand for better understanding and control of the progress of the project. The autocratic management style was thus adopted, which led to the more intensive use of formal communities of practice for facilitating vertical communication/knowledge sharing behaviours. For example, additional project meetings were usually held when changes in scope first occurred for the purpose of facilitating vertical communications. However, the subordinates perceived these additional meetings as unnecessary, unproductive, and a waste of time. As an engineer of Department B stated:
<disp-quote>
<p>Although project meetings can be helpful sometimes since we can straighten things out and acquire some resources and assistance from our supervisors or colleagues, our progress can be delayed if these are held too frequently … we spend most of the time reporting what we have been doing to our bosses and waiting for them to issue their commands. There are plenty of more efficient ways than official meetings to do that … we usually tell our supervisors why we do not like to have too many meetings, and they tend to take our suggestions after a while, if we complain enough, and reduce the number of such meetings.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The above discussion indicates an unsuccessful shift from consultative to autocratic management style in Department B, as eventually the managerial personnel went back to using the former. The subordinates were then motivated by the concept of voluntarily pursuing self-improvement. This encouraged them to develop and maintain their informal communities of practice in order to efficiently acquire the knowledge needed to better resolve the difficulties they encountered at work via more effective vertical and horizontal communication and interactions with their peers, superiors, and friends working in similar professional areas. Additionally, horizontal communication in which employees shared their experience and expertise with their peers (i.e. <italic>knowledge socialization</italic>) was found to occur much more often than the vertical communication. An assistant manager of Department B recalled:
<disp-quote>
<p>When encountering an unavoidable change in project scope, the project leader simply informs everyone of the news and encourages us to resolve our own problems associated with it … We don’t like a project meeting that takes too long, since it’s a waste of time and not productive … I simply contact the colleagues who may know what to do with the problems I cannot solve … I can run to their offices during regular office hours or their leisure time, such as lunch breaks, to talk to them personally, and instant messaging software and emails are also good ways to reach them … My team leader will ask me to do exactly the same thing anyway if I ask for his advice.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In summary, the above discussion highlights important implications of this study, as follows. One is that the management style of a project team may evolve in accordance with the shifting managerial concerns in response to unexpected changes in project scope. Additionally, different management styles have different foci that have different influences on individuals’ attitudes toward KS when encountering changes in project scope, and thus promote different methods for sharing knowledge. Based on the comparison of the two departments studied, it was observed that project teams that adopt a more autocratic oriented management style are more likely to use KS mechanisms that facilitate formal, vertical communication/interaction for knowledge externalization (<italic>tacit to explicit</italic>) in order to achieve consensus and control. In contrast, project teams that adopt a more consultative oriented management style tend to value KS mechanisms that promote informal, horizontal communication/interaction for knowledge socialization (<italic>tacit to tacit</italic>) in order to achieve self-improvement and collaborative problem-solving. This implies that organizations may adjust their strategies and support to encourage employees to engage in KS to enhance project performance with reference to the management style adopted. The following propositions are thus developed:
<disp-quote>
<p>P3. Project leaders/managers who implement an autocratic management style tend to emphasize control over the project progress and maintaining team consensus when encountering changes in project scope, and thus promote the functioning of formal communities of practice that facilitate vertical communication for performing knowledge externalization.</p>
<p>P4. Project leaders/managers who implement a consultative management style tend to value voluntary self-improvement and interpersonal collaboration when encountering changes in project scope, and thus promote the functioning of informal communities of practice that facilitate horizontal communication for performing knowledge socialization.</p>

<sec id="section14-0165551512445240">
<title>4.4. Level of task complexity</title>
<p>Research indicates that changes in project scope tend to increase the level of task complexity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0165551512445240">32</xref>], which refers to the extent to which operations must be performed upon data resources by the group in order to complete the task successfully [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-0165551512445240">85</xref>]. When the project team members perceive tasks and requirements to be complex, it becomes difficult for them to understand what is expected from the project, and thus they require more communication activities/interactions for sharing information and knowledge in order to make sense of the surrounding environment and develop actionable understanding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-0165551512445240">86</xref>]. However, Roberts et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-0165551512445240">87</xref>] indicate that, the more complex a project is, the lower the overall level of interpersonal communication that takes place for sharing knowledge, because the team members require more time to concentrate on their individual tasks to develop solutions.</p>
<p>The results of the data analysis provide support for the phenomena reported in the literature (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table8-0165551512445240">Table 8</xref>). Both Departments A and B had mentoring systems functioning to facilitate KS, especially for sharing tacit knowledge by facilitating learning by doing. As a section supervisor of Department A stated:
<disp-quote>
<p>There is a hierarchical mentoring system running in almost all the departments in our organization, and we count on this system to distribute the skills developed to those who are less experienced. As far as we know, it works quite well … The mentors constantly pass along what they have learned from field experiences to their individual mentees in order to help the latter improve their work efficiency and reduce errors.</p>

</table-wrap>
<p>Nevertheless, the results indicated that when encountering changes in project scope, members of project teams were very likely to be forced to develop and then implement new approaches in order to successfully achieve the newly requested or amended project goals. These tasks tended to involve intensive trial-and-error processes for developing new methods and/or coordinating with previous accomplishments of the projects, while carefully taking into consideration the changes in the business environment, including budget adjustment, technological advancement, and dynamic market conditions. This might result in an increase in the level of task complexity. Consequently, a lack of time and less effort made by project team members would diminish the use of the mentoring systems, particularly due to the increased demands made on the mentors. As a section supervisor of Department B mentioned:
<disp-quote>
<p>It takes time to teach and guide my mentees … time pressure tends to be heavier when the project’s scope changes based on the requests of the clients, and I am forced to just provide my mentee with some simple guidelines and then ask him try to learn the necessary skills through learning by doing and leave me alone to do my own work. However, sometimes the mentee just cannot pull it off on his own, and this usually results in an increase in work-related errors and unnecessary reworks.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The mentors thus usually prioritized what knowledge to share based on either their own judgments and/or questions from their mentees. However, unintentional loss of knowledge from the perspective of the mentees may occur during these ill-organized KS practices. The research results indicated that the mentors tended to decide to share the know-what and know-how knowledge first to deal with the most urgent problems on hand, and leave the know-why knowledge for later, which may then never be shared and be lost from the mentees’ standpoint. Being unable to acquire the complete version of a particular set of knowledge may keep the mentees from making the most of it. As an engineer of Department A stated:
<disp-quote>
<p>My mentee has to ask the right questions in order to get useful answers from me … I just don’t have time to teach him something in great detail like teaching a fresh college student. On most occasions I briefly tell him what to do and how to do it fast to help him solve the problems on hand first, and save the fundamentals for later when I have more time to talk to him … There are no such things as standard procedures when doing jobs like ours. Without telling him the reasons why we do these things, he may not be able to improvise when things do not go as expected. This may cause him some trouble at work.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>To conclude, changes in project scope result in an increase in the level of task complexity, which creates a context that may diminish the effectiveness of the mentoring systems for sharing tacit knowledge. The results show that the mentoring systems are the first KS mechanism that is discarded, since their benefits to the mentors are few and unclear, and they are unlikely to be sufficient or effective enough for a particular mentee in terms of acquiring all the knowledge needed under these circumstances. Based on this discussion, the relationship between mentoring systems and the level of task complexity of a project undergoing changes in scope is thus summarized in the following proposition:
<disp-quote>
<p>P5. An increased level of task complexity caused by changes in project scope will negatively impact the effectiveness of the mentoring systems for performing the KS process of socialization (tacit to tacit) in terms of the integrity/completeness of the knowledge shared.</p>

<title>5. Conclusion</title>
<sec id="section16-0165551512445240">
<title>5.1. Implications for theory</title>
<p>This study intended to highlight the importance of performing effective KS practices during the process of NPD projects that encounter unexpected and/or disturbing changes in scope. The study explores the KS mechanisms used to share and use critical knowledge by conducting an in-depth case study of two research-based departments in two organizations. Additionally, this study investigates and summarizes the relationships among the identified KS mechanisms and key contingency factors in five theoretical propositions, which provide insights into planning better KS practices for managing NPD projects. The identification of key KS mechanisms and contingency factors in the research context and the theoretical propositions developed in this work also provide answers to the research questions.</p>
<p>The key implications for researchers of this study are twofold. One is that it specifically identifies the most commonly used KS mechanisms and the key contingency factors affecting the use of these in a specific and critical business context, namely the implementation of NPD projects with changes in project scope. As there have been very few studies that specifically examine issues related to KS in this context, the findings of the current work have advanced our understanding of KS within NPD project teams when encountering unexpected changes in project scope, and, in turn, can enable future researchers to further develop a programmed body of research on topics related to the use of KS mechanisms in various business contexts in which unexpected disturbances often occur. Additionally, this study examined the relationships among the KS mechanisms used and the key contingency factors that could affect their effectiveness with the results summarized in five theoretical propositions. These findings shed light on how the use of specific KS mechanisms can benefit an organization. Moreover, the results of this study also underline the importance of taking into consideration the influence of key contingency factors on the use of KS mechanisms when implementing KS practices in a specific business context. This study thus highlights the need to conduct further research on KS in various business contexts based on a contingency approach in order to enrich our understanding of the use of KS mechanisms.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section17-0165551512445240">
<title>5.2. Implications for practice</title>
<p>This study also provides insights for the managers of project-based organizations. First, it identifies the KS mechanisms that are used for sharing knowledge among knowledge owners and seekers for executing successful NPD projects. Second, it identifies the three contingency factors that affect the application of KS mechanisms in NPD projects. Finally, it depicts the relationships among these KS mechanisms and the contingency factors identified in NPD projects.</p>
<p>To be more specific, the usefulness of documentation in helping employees to handle projects with unexpected changes in scope seems to be contingent upon the effectiveness of the knowledge categorization and indexing practices used. Additionally, in the context of managing NPD projects encountering unexpected changes in scope, the adoption of an autocratic management style can promote the functioning of formal communities of practice, while the adoption of a consultative management style can promote the functioning of informal ones. Furthermore, it was found that unexpected changes in project scope resulted in an increased level of task complexity, and thus diminished the effectiveness of the mentoring systems in project teams for acquiring the complete knowledge needed to implement the projects. This finding can provide managers with guidelines for determining how and under what circumstances, in terms of the variations of the key contingency factors, the KS mechanisms identified in this work should be used in order to maximize the benefits they can generate to the organization in the indicated business context. To conclude, the findings of this study enable organizations to better examine their strengths and weaknesses in terms of the use of KS practices to better handle disruptions in their NPD projects, and then make appropriate strategic choices to match their KS efforts with their organizational contexts (e.g. the three contingency factors). This, in turn, can help them develop useful KS mechanisms to perform effective knowledge sharing practices, and thus facilitate the generation of effective ways to appropriately manage potential disturbances to future NPD projects.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section18-0165551512445240">
<title>5.3. Limitations and future research directions</title>
<p>Like all studies, this work has its limitations. First, since the research findings were generated based on the analysis of only two cases, the generalizability of the findings is debatable from the perspective of quantitative research. However, this study is believed to have contributed to the understanding of the use of KS mechanisms in NPD projects encountering changes in scope and their relationships with the identified contingency factors by achieving analytic generalization, namely the ability to allow others to use their experience to generalize the proposed theory to understand and conceptualize similar problems and social contexts, as should be possible through a rigorous case study research project [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0165551512445240">53</xref>]. However, since it is generally agreed that a large number of cases can strengthen findings and eventually achieve statistical generalization, further research should be conducted to address related issues and to validate the theoretical propositions outlined above.</p>
<p>Another limitation of this study is that, although the relationships between the KS mechanisms identified and the key contingency factors were investigated, these mechanisms were examined separately with a focus on their individual relationships with the key contingency factors. To compensate for this limitation, future research projects that specifically examine the interrelationships among these KS mechanisms in the process of NPD projects encountering changes in scope are strongly encouraged.</p>

<title>Appendix: Description of the contexts of the two participating organizations</title>
<sec id="section19-0165551512445240">
<title>Organization A</title>
<p>Organization A was founded in mid twentieth century by the Taiwanese government to be responsible for the development and supply of petroleum and natural gas, and is the core of Taiwan’s petrochemical industry. Its main business activities include refining, distributing, storing, and transporting petroleum and natural gas, and producing and selling a variety of petrochemicals.</p>
<p>Because of the development of biotechnology, Department A was founded in the early twenty-first century for the purpose of developing new techniques and products in this area in order to enhance organizational performance and to generate new revenue streams. The projects executed by Department A are initiated by a biotechnology guidance committee that is under the direct supervision of the CEO of Organization A, and the primary products developed from these projects can be grouped into three categories: biochemistry-based environmental protection technologies (e.g. sewage treatment, waste disposal, and gas disposal techniques); health food, drinks, and supplements; and renewable/biomass energy generating technologies. The projects executed by Department A were all in-house ones, while the staff of Department A occasionally required help from external experts, mostly from research teams administrated by university professors. Compared to the other departments in Organization A, Department A dealt with a more dynamic and newly emerging business area with which the management of the company was less familiar, and the revenue generated from Department A was relatively insignificant to the company. The employees of Department A thus encountered changes in project scope more frequently than those in the other departments because of budget cuts, technical problems, and, above all, market competition.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section20-0165551512445240">
<title>Organization B</title>
<p>Founded and mostly supported by the Taiwanese governmental agency for more than 30 years, Organization B is a national research centre with a mission of conducting and promoting technological research in order to facilitate industrial development and boost the Taiwanese economy. The primary business of Organization B is to design and execute research projects in various technological areas for both public and private sectors to obtain the financial benefits generated from the potential patent transfers resulting from this work. The projects executed by Organizational B are mostly in-house ones, though occasionally they are joint projects with the R&amp;D personnel of client organizations.</p>
<p>Department B, as an emerging unit in Organization B, was founded for the purpose of advancing technologies that can support the environmentally friendly economic development of Taiwan, including those related to mining industries (e.g. coal, natural gas, and oil), geothermal energy, renewable energy, energy conservation, and environmental protection. Similar to what happens in other departments of Organization B, Department B constantly conducts research projects for both public and private sectors in the environmental protection and energy industries alike. While the characteristics of the client organizations are diverse, Department B very often encounters changes in project scope. Department B is generally responsible for conducting one government-funded research project with a grant of US$1–2 million in a fiscal year and 3–8 research projects for private companies, with an average grant of US$100,000–200,000 per project.</p>
<p>The government funded projects tend to be larger in scale than those funded by private companies, and aim at achieving relatively higher goals, such as those involving major breakthroughs in new energy saving technologies or in developing new renewable/biomass energy generating technologies. The achievements of the government funded projects are constantly used to develop cooperative opportunities with private companies, such as acquiring funded research projects from these companies to conduct subsequent investigations. The research projects acquired from private companies tend to have relatively more specific objectives, aiming to develop new marketable products/services/technologies that can generate revenue for the client firms. While the staff of Department B occasionally encounter changes in the scope of the government funded projects, mostly because of technical problems, such changes are far more common in the projects from private companies and involve far more complex issues, such as those related to technical problems, market competition, the economic environment, and changes in the decision making authorities of the client companies.</p>
