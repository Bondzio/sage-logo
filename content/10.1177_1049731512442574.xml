<p>It has been argued that gaps exist between research and practice, due in part to the fact that “few practitioners become academic researchers in universities and even fewer actively engage in undertaking their own research” (p. 14). As such, efforts are needed to encourage social work clinicians to become involved in and conduct research in practice-based settings. The authors of this book seek to address this issue by demystifying the process of research for practitioners.</p>
<p>The authors are affiliated with the University of Liverpool and the University of Central Lancashire, respectively. Professor Hardwick’s expertise reflects her commitment to cultivating collaborations between social work students and community-based, nonprofit organizations. Professor Worsley is an expert in practitioner research and service user-led research. Given that the authors are from the United Kingdom, case examples relate to situations relevant to social work practice in that country, but the broad themes are also applicable to social work practice in the United States. For example, the authors often refer to the U.K. National Occupational Standards for Social Work, which delineates best practice skills for social workers; germane to the social work profession in general.</p>
<p>The book is well organized, clearly written, and informative with chapters covering research ethics, interview and questionnaire development, focus groups, data analysis, proposal development, and report writing. Each chapter includes thought-provoking case studies, activities to stimulate reflection, a summary of key points, and references for additional reading. The book also includes a useful bibliography. Future editions of this book may profit by including illustrative examples of actual social work research by practitioners published in the literature as well as research resources for practitioners, such as information about the Campbell Collaboration library of Systematic Reviews in social welfare and a list of social work journals receptive to publishing small-scale, practitioner-led research studies. Overall, this book will be a good introductory resource for students in Master of Social Work (MSW) MSW-level social work research courses, and more importantly, social work practitioners interested in conducting applied research in community-based practice settings. Hopefully, it will inspire practitioners to carry out small-scale, social work research projects in pursuit of understanding and improving the delivery of social work services to individuals, families, organizations, communities.</p>
