<p>The following papers originated in a panel session on ‘Possible Futures for Philosophy of Religion’ at the 20th World Congress of the International Association for the History of Religions held in Toronto in August of 2010. The original remit of the panel was a proposal to consider the possible future of the philosophy of religion by examining questions concerning the relations of philosophy to the academic study of religion and the function of philosophy within such a study. What precisely is the current situation? Is the current situation adequate or can it be improved upon? Could philosophy be more effectively integrated into the study of religion? If so, how? What might ‘properly constituted philosophical thinking’ about religion entail? What might a more integrated philosophy of religion look like? What types of scholarship best merit the description ‘philosophy of religion?’</p>
<p>Papers came from Ivan Strenski, who holds the Holstein Family and Community Endowed Chair in Religious Studies at the University of California, Riverside, and specializes in the history of religions, method and theory in the study of religion, and intellectual history of the social scientific study of religion; Gregory Alles, who is professor of religious studies at McDaniel College, and whose special interests include religions of Asia, especially south Asia, as well as theories of religion and the academic study of religions; Bryan Rennie, the Vira I. Heinz Chair of Religion at Westminster College in Pennsylvania, who specializes in the history of the study of religions and method and theory in the study of religion; and Marsha Hewitt, who is Professor of Social Ethics and Religion at Trinity College and the University of Toronto and does research on the psychoanalysis of religious experience. She is currently working on a book on Freudian psychoanalytic theories of religion and the ways in which they are relevant to contemporary work in developmental and neuro-psychology.</p>
<p>Kevin Schilbrack of Western Carolina University, who is currently working on a book-length consideration of the future of the philosophy of religion, responded to their work. Although the individual emphases of each paper may have shifted slightly from the original proposal, the papers nonetheless make focused and potentially useful suggestions for the development and improvement of the philosophy of religion. Benefitting from the commentary and response given by Kevin Schilbrack in Toronto the papers were modified and updated and Schilbrack re-worked his response for publication here. The original contributors were given one last chance to reply briefly to Kevin Schilbrack’s response. No doubt the conversation will go on through many further iterations; however, for the purposes of publication we had to end at some definite point and this was it.</p>
<p>The participants would like to express their gratitude to the journal’s anonymous reviewers, whose comments further helped to focus and refine our work. As the convener of the session and the editor of the papers, I would like to thank Ivan Strenski, Gregory Alles, and Marsha Hewitt for their time and effort and for their valuable and helpful contributions. Special thanks go to Kevin Schilbrack for his successive responses and to Patricia Caillé of the University of Strasbourg for providing translations of the abstracts. I would also like to take this opportunity to thank the organizers of the IAHR Congress in Toronto, especially Donald Wiebe and Sydney Yeung. Finally, our thanks go to Francis Landy of <italic>Studies in Religion</italic> for suggesting the publication of this collection.</p>
