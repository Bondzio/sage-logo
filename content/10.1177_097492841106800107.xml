<p>The book under review begins with a few reflections on the complex association between an individual and making of history, and proceeds to draw portrait of Osama bin Laden (Osama). Understanding historical processes with the help of biography does offer a partial view of the main historical events and circumstances under which an individual plays significant role in history. An individual inevitably is a product of his times; at the same time he also has limited maneuverability to change those times, and marginally even a course of history. Mockatis essentially has written Osama’s political biography in the context of the emergence of radical Islamic terrorist outfits. Among all such terrorist outfits since the beginning of this century, the al-Qaeda has emerged as the most prominent transnational terrorist outfit under a rapidly globalising world, by demonstrating its capacity to pull down the twin towers in New York on 9/11 and thereby assaulting the symbol of US power. This inevitably prompted the USA to declare global war on terror. Thus, on the one hand al-Qaeda has been fighting against the US to rectify the injustice committed against the Palestinians, in particular, and Muslims, in general, while, on the other hand, in a retaliatory move, the US in the pursuit of putting an end to terrorism has militarily intervened in Afghanistan and Iraq. What is more, it has also succeeded in murdering the most wanted and infamous terrorist, Osama, through a meticulously planned and effectively executed operation in Abbotabad, Pakistan, on 2 May 2011. Amidst these dramatic developments, the work under review is timely. In fact, this well-researched and neatly documented biography, written in a dispassionate tone, indeed, sheds a new light on the personality of Osama by demystifying it. Within the available, albeit fragmentary, information the author has placed Osama’s family circumstances, childhood, student days, understanding of Islam and world politics in a succinct manner. The substance of this oeuvre could be placed as follows.</p>
<p>Osama was born in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, in 1957 in an exceptionally wealthy family that owned construction industry. His father, Mohammed bin Laden, who controlled and managed the firm had received lucrative contracts to renovate the Mosque of the Prophet in Medina and the Grand Mosque in Mecca. Apart from working within the ambit of lucrative pilgrimage industry, he had always shown willingness to loan money to the profligate monarchs and kept himself on their right side. By most accounts he had 54 children from 22 wives and Osama was one of them. An intrinsically shy child, Osama was respectful of family elders, neighbours and teachers. He was unremarkable as a student. As an adult he never had more than four wives at a time. Contrary to the prevailing level of education in Saudi Arabia, two of his wives were well educated. For instance, Umm Hamza was Professor in Child Psychology and Umm Khaled taught Arabic Grammar.</p>
<p>Osama grew under the then prevailing circumstances of traumatic transition in Saudi Arabia, where a medieval kingdom was trying to modernise an essentially feudal country by inviting investments and technology in the petroleum sector from the west. He was sensitive as well as receptive to the problems of the Muslim world. Consequently, the six-day Arab–Israeli war of 1967 and the consequent defeat of the Arab states had a profound impact on him. In fact, the war had not merely humiliated the Arab world but had apparently discredited secular nationalism which Nasserism had constantly espoused. By 1976 and particularly after the Yom Kippur war of 1973 between Arab states and Israel, Osama had realised that Israel had upper hand vis-à-vis the Arabs, owing to constant Western support. He also had started detesting the tendency of the US to placate oil-rich Arab states. However, the Islamic revolution in Iran of 1979 had elevated Osama’s spirits by giving a happy reminder of the fact that the Western powers such as the US could be challenged and their influence in the region could be curbed.</p>
<p>In the midst of all these developments Osama was building his worldview. Two of his teachers had a prominent role in shaping it. Ayman-al-Zawahiri, a fanatic Egyptian doctor, and Azam, a lecturer from Adbul Aziz University, Jeddah. In fact, he inherited the former’s visceral hatred for Israel and was attracted to the latter’s preaching of Jihad. Perhaps his understanding of Jihad was gradually preparing Osama to wage a just and holy war against the enemies of Islam. With the passage of time Osama’s worldview blended Saudi Wahabism with the radical Islamism of Muslim Brotherhood articulated fully by Sayd Qutb. Qutb had convinced Osama about the need to find Islamic answer to the problem of modernity and reconcile Islamic tradition with modern technology.</p>
<p>This was also a time when the former Soviet Union militarily intervened in Afghanistan in 1979. After the fall of the Shah Regime and the Islamic revolution in Iran, the US was keen to repeal the growing Soviet influence across the world as the new Cold War began between the then superpowers. Actually, it was desperately looking for allies, even if they were religious fanatics, to oust the Soviets from Afghanistan. Being restless for activity, Osama found a major opportunity to fight against the Godless communists. Thus, the US began to finance the Afghan resistance against the Soviets and Osama began to aid <italic>mujahideen</italic> groups to recruit the so-called ‘holy warriors’ from the Arab world. Besides, Osama was ever willing to part with his own wealth in the war. Thus, even though he was not really well trained and prepared to fight, he was too precious to lose. The author has taken pains to show how the role of Osama in Afghan war was exaggerated. Even the so-called ‘Lion’s den’ where he had apparently fought well was a very small part of a major insurgent built up. Nevertheless, Osama’s personality gradually began to assume mythical proportions. He also enjoyed being a messianic, enigmatic and complex historical figure. Inspired by Zawahiri’s eulogisation of martyrdom, he was not merely ready to shed his life but was influencing many others to commit their lives in the service of Islam. He often conducted himself as if he was Allah’s chosen man to be the savior of the Muslims.</p>
<p>In the pursuit of defending Islam, Osama was provoked to pick up a fight with Saudi monarchy, due to their close association with the US and willingness to station American troops on the Saudi Arabian soil during the Iraq–Kuwait war in the 1990s. Consequently he had to flee to Khartoom, Sudan, where he not merely took shelter but gradually turned al-Qaeda into a major international terrorist outfit. Because of the US pressure, the Sudanese government could not continue to give him asylum, and he fled to Taliban-led Afghanistan by 1996. In fact, Mullah Mohammed Omar and Osama have had similar views on Islam. They began to condemn the so-called Zionist–Crusader alliance in Palestine and Iraq by issuing <italic>Fatwas</italic>. Subsequently, they established the World Islamic Front in 1998 by bringing a number of radical Islamic groupings together. Osama’s <italic>Fatwas</italic> refused to accept long-standing distinction between combatants and non-combatants. To him any citizen that elected the so-called democratic government in the US was equally responsible for the foreign policy if the US was a democratic country. Thus, the attack on non-combatants was justified with this absurd logic.</p>
<p>The author has discussed some of the most significant attacks through bombings, such as those on the US embassies in Kenya and Tanzania (1998), 9/11 (2001), Indonesia (2002), Turkey (2003), Spain (2004), etc., that were carried out through al-Qaeda’s overt or covert support. It is here that he has made some strikingly original contributions. Generally, the events of 9/11 have often been credited to Osama. However, the author has underlined the fact that according to the report of 9/11 commission, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed (KSM), an Egyptian, was the mastermind behind those events. He was eventually captured by the US and interrogated while in detention in Gunatanamo Bay Naval base. Nevertheless, al-Qaeda through 9/11 attempted to drag the US into a protracted conflict. Their calculation was that the latter will attack Afghanistan which, in turn, will pave the way for such a war. Incontestably, the overall US involvement, in economic and military terms in the West Asian region certainly increased in Pakistan, Afghanistan and Iraq. The US war on terror also led towards building Osama into a mythical figure. And yet, the calculations of al-Qaeda about the circumstances under which the US intervened in Afghanistan proved fairly inaccurate. Actually, the Northern Alliance, during the civil war, was controlling only 10 per cent of the territory but the same was adjacent to former Soviet Central Asian Republics. Thus, in order to get free hand against the Chechen rebels, the then Russian President, Vladimir Putin, supported the US leasing of old Soviet air bases in Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan and these bases, in turn, provided bases for American operations within Afghanistan. Similarly, Pakistan’s attack on Taliban in Swat Valley on its North-western frontier in Afghanistan and the subsequent cooperation of 4,000 US marines with the Afghan government could contain Taliban. In spite of such successes in containing fanatic Islamic forces, the impact of radical Islam cannot easily be wished away. The author has even attributed the rise of piracy in Somalia as a symptom and source of jihadist activity.</p>
<p>Having stated the substance of this work, it is worth noting that the book, with its select documents and bibliography, would be useful for researchers on terrorism. The only limitation of this work has been that it is insufficiently critical about the role of the US-led imperialism in the Arab world. In fact, the US–Israel alliance or the US military intervention in Iraq of 2003 deserved to be viewed in a more critical perspective to understand Osama’s popularity in the Arab world. Such criticality could have opened up better space to answer questions such as the following: Is Osama, in the ultimate analysis, a product of dialectical interactions between the US-led imperialism and the Arab world? Would Obama’s friendly speeches and gestures contain the Arab resentment against Israel and interventionist policy of the US in West Asia? Osama is dead but will his spirit and ideas continue to haunt his followers in future? Irrespective of this limitation this book is a major contribution to the literature on terrorism.</p>
