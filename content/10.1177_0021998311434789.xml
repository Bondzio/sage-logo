<abstract>
<p>Treated and untreated woven century fiber (CF) composites are investigated for evaluating their flexural, tensile, and impact strengths, Barcol hardness, glass transition temperature, thermal resistance, and water absorption properties. Scanning electron microscopy study revealed a brittle fracture for treated fiber composite, while significant fiber pull-out is observed for the untreated fiber composite. Higher tensile and hardness properties, higher glass transition and thermal decomposition temperatures, and low water absorption properties are obtained for alkaline-treated composites. Enhanced interface bonding due to improved adhesion has helped in the formation of covalent bonds at the fiber–matrix interface, resulting in superior tensile, thermal, and water absorption properties of the treated fiber composite. Flexural and impact properties are higher for untreated fiber composite. This is due to the weak fiber–matrix interface and a differential strain in fiber and matrix. The weak interface has provided an energy absorbing mechanism and enhanced the impact energy absorption capacity. The tensile strength of CF composite is very much comparable with that of sisal fiber composite. The tensile and flexural properties are higher for the woven CF composites than those of short CF composites. But the impact properties are superior for short fiber composites compared to the woven fiber composites. Increased number of interfaces for the short fiber composites has contributed for the cushioning effect and an enhanced energy absorbing mechanism. Water absorption properties have improved for the treated fiber composites due to formation of a strong interface.</p>

<sec id="sec1-0021998311434789" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>With growing interest on use of ecofriendly materials in all areas of human activity, the development of biodegradable composite materials using natural fibers is a solution par excellence. In fact, the Ford Motor Company<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0021998311434789">1</xref></sup> was using natural fiber composites since 1930s. Composites made of thermoplastic or thermosetting matrices are widely used for interiors of aircraft and automobiles, casings of electronic gadgets and domestic appliances, panels in building construction, bicycles, sports goods, etc. In order to get better performance of these materials, it is important to have good interface bonding between the fiber and the matrix. To overcome the difficulty associated with the hydrophobic nature of the resin, the hydrophilic nature of the natural fiber, the fibers are subjected to chemical treatments such as NaOH, KOH, LiOH, and acetylation, wherein the lignin and hemicelluloses will dissolve and expose the OH groups and modify the crystal structure of the fibers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0021998311434789">2</xref></sup> These treatments will alter the microfibril angle and enhance the mechanical properties. Porosity, surface tension, wetting, and adhesion properties of the fibers are further improved through treatments such as silane, maleic anhydride polypropylene, and acetic anhydride. Several plant fibers such as banana, hemp, cellulose, henequen, wheat straw, ramie, jute, pineapple, okra, kenaf, and sisal are used for making natural fiber composites.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0021998311434789">3</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0021998311434789">10</xref></sup> Treatments on sisal fibers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0021998311434789">10</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0021998311434789">16</xref></sup> such as mercerization, permanganate, benzoylation, polymethyl methacrylate, and admicellar polymerization have improved interfacial adhesion and enhanced the tensile, flexural, and impact strengths, dynamic mechanical behavior, water absorption, electrostatic charge, thermal stability, dielectric constant, and ac conductivity of sisal fiber polyester composites. Storage modulus, loss modulus, and damping factor have increased with each treatment and decreased with increase in fiber content.</p>
<p>Century (<italic>Agave americana</italic>) fiber has drawn attention from several researchers because of their large leaf length, leaf biomass, fiber length, fineness, density, and high strength. Century fibers (CFs) have great potential for reinforcement in composites as well as for textiles and geotextiles.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0021998311434789">17</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0021998311434789">19</xref></sup> The fibers are traditionally used for ropes, cordage, and mats. Bessadok et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0021998311434789">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0021998311434789">21</xref></sup> reported that treatments such as acetic anhydride, styrene, acrylic acid, and maleic anhydride, have improved the wetting and adhesion properties of the fibers and significantly increased the moisture resistance, breaking strength, and breaking strain. Oudiani et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0021998311434789">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0021998311434789">23</xref></sup> found that retting of leaves in sea water has produced fine fibers with fairly low lignin content (2.12%) compared to other natural fibers (2.4%). However, the fibers produced by manual extraction have the lowest density and highest crystallinity (51.2%). Treatments with lower concentrations have produced the fibers stronger than the untreated fibers, while treatments with high concentration (&gt;2% w/v) have produced weaker fibers. It was noted by Thamae and Baillie<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0021998311434789">24</xref></sup> that fibers produced from conventional boiling of leaves and mercerization have doubled the interfacial shear strength and improved the tensile and thermal properties of the fibers. Mylsamy and Rajendran<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0021998311434789">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0021998311434789">26</xref></sup> have found that the alkali treatment of fibers has improved the tensile, flexural, impact, water absorption, machinability, dynamic mechanical, as well as thermo mechanical properties.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0021998311434789">26</xref></sup> They have noted that 3-mm long fibers have fairly good bonding with epoxy matrix when compared to those made of 5- and 7-mm long fibers. A discontinuous <italic>A. americana</italic> fiber-reinforced epoxy composite table has been built and the conceptual design and fabrication has been presented by Mylsamy and Rajendran.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0021998311434789">27</xref></sup></p>
<p>The study of recent literature suggests that the work on woven CF composites is very apt. Results obtained for treated and untreated woven fiber century composites are compared with the recent results of Mylsamy and Rajendran<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0021998311434789">26</xref></sup> for short CF composites. It was a natural selection by the authors to choose the CFs because of the fibers’ fine features. This study has been a part of the first authors’ major Project on the selection of best fibers to promote cultivation of such plants for socio-economic reasons. Flexural, tensile, and impact strengths, Barcol hardness, glass transition temperature, thermal degradation, and water absorption properties of the treated and untreated woven CF composites are presented in this article. Results are also compared with sisal fiber composites and also the short fiber century composites. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) are done for thermal analysis, and fracture behavior is observed through scanning electron microscopy (SEM). These studies will establish a database on the properties of woven CF polyester composites. Components for non-structural applications, such as equipment casings and panels in construction industry as wood substitute can be molded using polyester matrix and with thermoplastic matrices, such as, polypropylene, the interiors of automobiles, parts of domestic appliances, bicycle parts, and sports goods, can be produced.</p>

<sec id="sec3-0021998311434789"><title>Century fiber</title>
<p>CFs are produced from leaves by retting process. The leaves are cut and dried to allow the watery substance to evaporate and then soaked in still water for 15 days. The fermented soft greenish substance is washed thoroughly and the fibers are peeled off the leaves and washed and dried in shady place. The length of the fibers is between 100 and 123 cm and the size ranges between 150 and 300 µm.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-0021998311434789"><title>Alkali treatment</title>
<p>For chemical treatment, the dried fibers are soaked in 2% NaOH solution for 24 h at room temperature. The fibers are washed thoroughly with distilled water to remove NaOH. These treated fibers are dried at room temperature for 24 h. CFs are generally coarse and have become soft upon treatment.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-0021998311434789"><title>Preparation of composites</title>
<p>Uni-directional mats are prepared on an indigenous weaving set-up using treated and untreated fibers. The size of the mat is 440 × 440 mm<sup>2</sup> with a density of 0.542 kg/m<sup>2</sup>. General purpose isopthalic polyester resin is procured from M/s Sakthi Fiber Glass, Chennai, India. As additives, 2% methyl ethyl ketone peroxide and 2% cobalt napthanate are used. Wax polish and polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) are used as releasing agents. CF composites (cfc) are fabricated in an open mold process between two thick glass plates. The laminates are prepared with fiber resin ratio by weight equal to 1:6. A thin coat of PVA is applied on the contacting surfaces of the plates to act as releasing surfaces. The resin mix is poured on the plate and woven fiber mat is placed and then rolled for proper wetting and release of entrapped air. Another half of the resin is poured and spread over the mat and other glass plate is placed on it. The laminate is kept under a load of around 1000 N for 24 h. Then, the laminate is post-cured at room temperature for another 24 h. Two types of composites, one with treated fiber and the other with untreated fiber are made. They are referred in this article as: cfc-t (CF composite-treated) and cfc-ut (CF composite-untreated).</p>

<sec id="sec6-0021998311434789"><title>Flexural test, flexural strength, and flexural modulus</title>
<p>Flexural properties are evaluated as per ASTM D-790 through three-point bend test on compression testing machine at a cross-head speed of 1.25 mm/min, supplied by Hydraulic and Engineering Instruments, New Delhi. The size of the specimen is 32 × 12.7 mm<sup>2</sup>. The specimen was freely supported and the maximum load applied in the middle of the specimen. The flexural modulus is calculated from the slope of the initial portion of the load–deflection curve.</p>
<sec id="sec7-0021998311434789"><title>Flexural strength</title>
<p>Flexural strength is the maximum stress in the outer surface of the specimen at the moment of break. When the homogeneous elastic material is tested with three-point system, the maximum stress occurs at the midpoint. This stress is evaluated for any point on the load–deflection curve using <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula1-0021998311434789">Equation (1)</xref>.

<sec id="sec8-0021998311434789"><title>Flexural modulus</title>
<p>Flexural modulus or modulus of elasticity in bending is a measure of the stiffness during the initial part of the bending process. Flexural modulus is the ratio of stress to corresponding strain within the elastic limit. A tangent line is drawn to the steepest initial straight line portion of the load–deflection curve, and flexural modulus is calculated using <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula2-0021998311434789">Equation (2)</xref>.

</sec>
<sec id="sec9-0021998311434789"><title>Tensile test, tensile strength, and tensile modulus</title>
<p>The tensile test is conducted on an electronic tensile testing machine Zwick/Roell Z010-10KN-UTM at a cross-head speed of 3 mm/min and a gage length of 50 mm. Standard Type IV dumbbell-shaped specimens are used as per ASTM D-638. The values of tensile strength and tensile modulus are obtained from the load–deflection values by taking the maximum load resisted up to the point of fracture and the corresponding strain.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec10-0021998311434789"><title>Morphology</title>
<p>The fractured surfaces of the treated and untreated fiber composites during tensile test are studied by SEM using EVOMA15 Smart SEM.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec11-0021998311434789"><title>Impact strength</title>
<p>Notched impact performance of the composite is evaluated as per ASTM D-256 using Izod impact supplied by PSI Sales Pvt. Ltd., New Delhi. The size of the samples is 12 × 60 mm<sup>2</sup>. The test specimen was supported by a vertical cantilever beam and the specimen broken by the swing of the pendulum. This method elaborates the determination of the resistance to breakage by flexural shock. Five specimens are tested and the average value of impact strength is considered.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec12-0021998311434789"><title>Barcol hardness</title>
<p>Standard test method ASTM D-2583-75 is used to find indentation hardness of the composite through Barcol impresser model no. 934-1. This test employs a hardened steel truncated cone indenter having an angle of 20° with a flat tip at 0.157 mm diameter. Five specimens were tested and the average value is taken.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec13-0021998311434789"><title>Differential scanning calorimetry</title>
<p>Composites exhibit changes in material properties such as volume, enthalpy, heat capacity, thermal expansion, and tensile modulus as the material is heated through glass transition temperature, <italic>T</italic><sub>g</sub> and it goes from glass to rubbery state. DSC is performed with the help of Mettler using Star SW 8.1 analyzer to measure <italic>T</italic><sub>g</sub>. The temperature is programmed in the range 25–300°C with a heating rate of 10°C/min in nitrogen atmosphere with a flow rate of 30 mL/min.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec14-0021998311434789"><title>Thermogravimetric analysis</title>
<p>TGA curves are used to determine the thermal degradation and thermal stability of the polymeric material. Thermal decomposition is observed in terms of loss of global mass using TA Instrument TGAQ50 V20.10 Build 36 thermogravimetric analyzer. The temperature change is controlled from room temperature to 800°C at a heating rate of 20°C/min. A high-purity nitrogen stream was continuously passed into the furnace at a flow rate of 60 mL/min at room temperature and atmospheric pressure. Before starting each run, nitrogen is used to purge the furnace for 30 min to establish an inert environment to prevent any unwanted oxidative decomposition.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec15-0021998311434789"><title>Water absorption</title>
<p>Water absorption tests are conducted on rectangular specimens of dimension 76.2 × 25.4 mm<sup>2</sup> size as per ASTM D-570. The samples are conditioned by heating in an oven at 50°C for 24 h and then cooling to room temperature. The weights of the samples are taken by Shimadzu Electronic Balance with readability of 0.001 g. All the samples are immersed in double distilled water for 24 h at room temperature. Reconditioning is done by keeping them once again in the oven for 24 hrs at 50°C. Percentage increase in weight of the specimen during immersion is obtained from the ratio of increase in average weight of the conditioned specimen after immersion in water for 24 h and the average weight of reconditioned specimen calculated nearest to 0.01%. The amount of soluble matter lost is given by the decrease in weight of the specimen after reconditioning.</p>

<sec id="sec17-0021998311434789"><title>Flexural properties</title>
<p>The flexural strength of the composite is determined based on the maximum bending load at failure using <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula1-0021998311434789">Equation (1)</xref>. It can be seen from <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0021998311434789">Table 1</xref> that cfc-ut has the highest flexural strength. The weak fiber–matrix interface in cfc-ut has been advantageous in creating a differential strain in the matrix and fiber. This has allowed the stretching and bending simultaneously that prevented the kind of brittle fracture and resulted in highest flexural strength of 188 MPa. For cfc-ut, the slope of the load–deflection curve is large and the specimen could withstand a highest load of 175 N. For cfc-t, the slope is small and the specimen could withstand only 50 N, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0021998311434789">Figure 1</xref>. The chemical treatment has dissolved the lignocelluloses, and the fibers became thin and soft resulting in a very flexible laminate for the treated fibers, while the cfc-ut specimen has been rigid. Prolonged exposure of the fiber during treatment has weakened the fiber surfaces and reduced the stiffness property of the composite. This pattern of results confirms the statement by Reid et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0021998311434789">9</xref></sup> that increased concentrations will damage the fiber surface and reduce the mechanical properties. In the present case, the alkali treatment was given for 24 h which has reduced the strength of the fibers. Similarly, Pothan et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0021998311434789">11</xref></sup> have reported that the flexural strength has reduced upon NaOH treatment for woven sisal fiber composites. Results of the present solution are also compared with those of short fiber century epoxy composite reported by Mylsamy and Rajendran.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0021998311434789">26</xref></sup> In case of short fiber-treated century/epoxy composite (T3EC), the highest flexural strength is only 58 MPa for treated fiber composite and for untreated fiber composite, it is 54 MPa. In this case, the treatment has not significantly influenced the strength property. The present treated woven CF composite with polyester matrix has produced nearly twice the flexural strength compared to that of the short-fiber epoxy composite which is equal to 99 MPa. Due to the long and continuous fibers, the woven fiber composite has shown the property of better load sharing than in the case of short fiber composites. For neat resin, the flexural strength is equal to 136 MPa and the flexural modulus is 7191 MPa. In case of short fiber composite, it can be seen that all the properties are higher for the treated fiber composite. This reflects on the effect of variation in fiber–matrix interfaces in the long and short fiber composites. These variations have contributed for different values of flexural strength. Results indicate that for flexural load applications, the long untreated fiber composites are advantageous. The modulus of elasticity for bending is calculated using <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula2-0021998311434789">Equation (2)</xref> as per ASTM D-790. The values of flexural modulus are listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0021998311434789">Table 1</xref>. For the treated fiber composite, the flexural modulus is equal to 17,544 MPa and for the untreated fiber composite, it is equal to 39,814 MPa. Specific flexural strength and specific flexural modulus values of the composites and the neat resin are highly rational for comparison with each other and they are obtained by taking into account the variation in the density of the specimens.

<sec id="sec18-0021998311434789"><title>Tensile properties</title>
<p>Unlike in the case of flexural properties, the tensile properties have increased for composite with treated fibers. The strong interface due to increased adhesion between the fiber and the matrix as a result of chemical treatment has produced a positive effect on tensile properties. The stress–strain diagram for tensile loading is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0021998311434789">Figure 4</xref>. Except for the initial part of the curves, the cfc-t, cfc-ut, and neat resin have followed the linear Hooke’s law. The ultimate tensile strength of cfc-t is 47 MPa and it is equal to 42 MPa for cfc-ut. For neat resin, it is equal to 39 MPa, as shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0021998311434789">Table 1</xref>. The tensile modulus of cfc-t is equal to 682 and 615 MPa for cfc-ut, while it equal to 399 MPa for neat resin. Pothan et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0021998311434789">11</xref></sup> have reported a similar trend of increase in tensile modulus for treated woven sisal fiber composites.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0021998311434789">15</xref></sup> The tensile strength of woven sisal fiber composite was equal to 45 ± 3 MPa and the tensile modulus was 5.8 ± 0.4 GPa. The tensile strength obtained for the present woven CF composites is quite comparable with that of sisal fiber composite and the tensile modulus of CF composites is less by an order of 10. Unidirectional CF mats are used in this study and the sisal fiber mats are bidirectional. The effect of direction of fibers in the weaving pattern has contributed for the variation in the tensile modulus of the composite, while it has not made significant on the tensile strength. The tensile strength depends only on the cross-section of the specimen, while the longitudinal fibers and the matrix will resist the tensile load. But the tensile modulus depends on the stress and strain of the member. The strain occurring in bidirectional sisal fiber specimen is small compared to that of CF composite specimen with the unidirectional mat. Elongation of the specimen with bidirectional sisal fiber mat is resisted by both the longitudinal as well as the transverse fibers that are connected through the resin matrix. Only longitudinal fibers and the matrix will resist elongation in tensile loading of CF composites. Hence, the strain is more in case of the present CF composites, while it is less for sisal fiber composites, as reported by Pothan et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0021998311434789">11</xref></sup> This justifies the higher tensile modulus of the bidirectional sisal fiber composites and the lower value of tensile modulus for CF composites. Further, higher modulus in bidirectional composites is always useful for resistance to higher impact loads. In case of short fiber century (<italic>A. americana</italic>) epoxy composite,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0021998311434789">26</xref></sup> the sample with treated 3-mm long fibers has a tensile strength of 23.5 MPa and for untreated fiber composite, it is equal to 23 MPa. Although this variation is small, the tensile modulus has increased significantly which is equal to 257 MPa for the T3EC compared to that of 235 MPa for UT3EC. This increase is due to enhanced interfacial adhesion because of the alkali treatment of the fibers which resulted in brittle fracture. The effect of chemical treatment on flexural properties is very significant, while the tensile properties are not affected significantly which can be noted from the values given in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0021998311434789">Table 1</xref>. The specific tensile strength and specific tensile moduli for cfc-t, cfc-ut, and neat resin are shown in Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0021998311434789">5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0021998311434789">6</xref>, respectively. For cfc-t, the specific ultimate strength is equal to 36.5 MPa/g/cm<sup>3</sup> and for cfc-ut, it is equal to 34.7 MPa/g/cm<sup>3</sup>, while it is equal to 30.5 MPa/g/cm<sup>3</sup> for neat resin. The specific tensile modulus is equal to 526 MPa/g/cm<sup>3</sup> for cfc-t; for cfc-ut, it is equal to 511 MPa/g/cm<sup>3</sup> and for neat resin, it is equal to 315 MPa/g/cm<sup>3</sup>. This increase in tensile modulus can be attributed to the change in the intrinsic structure and crystallinity of the fibers and the reduction in microfibril angle of the fibers associated with chemical treatment.

Alkali treatment has dissolved the lignin and hemicelluloses, thus forming straight serrations on the fiber surface that can be seen clearly in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0021998311434789">Figure 7</xref>, while such lines are absent on the surface of the untreated fiber in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0021998311434789">Figure 8</xref>. Similar rough fiber surface morphology was reported in case of sisal fibers due to alkali treatment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0021998311434789">11</xref></sup> Microholes are formed on the fiber surface due to dissolution of lignin on the fiber surface. This surface modification has increased the interaction between fibers and the resin and improved the fiber–matrix adhesion, resulting in a sharp, brittle fracture for the treated fiber composite. There are traces of fiber pull-out observed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0021998311434789">Figure 8</xref> for the untreated fiber composite which indicate a weak interface bonding. Pothan et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0021998311434789">11</xref></sup> have reported voids in the tensile failure surfaces of alkali treated sisal fiber composites and such voids are not present for CF composites.

<sec id="sec20-0021998311434789"><title>Impact strength</title>
<p>For treated CF composite, the impact strength is equal to 48 J/m, while for untreated fiber composite, it has the highest value equal to 71 J/m. In case of neat resin, the impact strength is very low equal to 5 J/m. The treated fiber composites have lower impact strength as a consequence of higher interface adhesion, resulting in lack of energy absorption mechanism in the composite. The impact strength is much less for neat resin due to complete absence of fibers for the shock absorbing mechanism. However, the results reported by Mylsamy and Rajendran<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0021998311434789">26</xref></sup> for short fiber epoxy composites with 3, 7, and 10 mm fibers show that the composite with treated fibers of 3 mm has given the highest impact strength of 134 J/m and the untreated 3 mm fiber composite has given 120 J/m. The impact strength has reduced with increase in length of the fiber from 7 to 10 mm. The fibers could transmit the energy of impact into the epoxy matrix through increased number of interfaces rather than through lesser numbers of long interfaces. The higher impact strength in case of 3-mm long short fiber composite is due to the increased number of interfaces with random orientations which increased the cushioning effect, resulting in higher energy absorption. However, for the present woven fiber composites, the adhesion was more and the cushioning effect is reduced due to lack of energy absorption mechanism. The values of impact strength for different composites, cfc-t, cfc-ut, and neat resin are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0021998311434789">Figure 9</xref>.

Results for composites and the neat resin are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0021998311434789">Table 1</xref>. For amorphous solid like the fiber composite, a state of transition occurs due to change in heat capacity from hard brittle state to soft rubbery state.

<p>TGA of the composites and the neat resin are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-0021998311434789">Figure 10</xref>. Thermal decomposition of each sample took place in a programmed temperature range 25–800°C. The neat resin showed only one stage of weight loss process. This has a transition temperature from 340°C to 417°C, and it is clear that the peak transition temperature has occurred at 401°C. The weight loss and residual weight of neat resin for the TGA are found to be 91% and 3%, respectively. Thermogravimetric curves show that the thermal stability of the composites is found to be higher than that of the neat resin. Beginning of decomposition took place at 260°C for both treated and untreated fiber composites and for neat resin, it is at 340°C. However, the decomposition has ended at 475°C for treated fiber composite, while it occurred at 463°C and 417°C for untreated fiber composite and neat resin, respectively. The results are listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0021998311434789">Table 2</xref>. Therefore, the thermal stability of the treated fiber composite is higher compared to untreated fiber composite. Lower percentage losses are obtained for treated fiber composite. Higher thermal stability of treated fiber composites is due to improved fiber/matrix interaction as a result of additional intermolecular bonding between fiber and the matrix. This is also evident from the lower weight loss at different temperatures.

<sec id="sec24-0021998311434789"><title>Water absorption</title>
<p>Treated fiber composite has absorbed less water compared to that of untreated fiber composite. Treatment of CFs with NaOH for 24 h has made the fibers less hydrophilic and decreased the water absorption capacity by 13.45%. The moisture absorption behavior of various composites is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11-0021998311434789">Figure 11</xref>. The percentage of water absorption for cfc-t composite is 2.25 and for cfc-ut, it 2.6, while it is equal to 0.5 for neat resin. There is a decrease in water absorption in case of treated fiber composite. As the fibers are hydrophilic in nature, they absorbed water during immersion, and loss of matter has been observed upon reconditioning. The percentage loss of soluble matter during immersion after reconditioning the specimens is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12-0021998311434789">Figure 12</xref>. In case of cfc-t, due to fiber surface treatment, there is absolutely no loss of soluble matter, whereas for cfc-ut, there is 0.34% loss of soluble matter and for neat resin, the loss is 0.04%. Absorption of water by ligno-cellulose material has rendered the formation of hydrogen bonds between water and hydroxyl groups of cellulose, hemi-cellulose, and lignin in the cell wall,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0021998311434789">2</xref></sup> causing the swelling of the composite. This has resulted in increase in width and reduction in the length of the composite. Less water is absorbed by treated fiber composite which is due to replacement of hydrophilic OH groups of fiber by more hydrophobic ester groups or otherwise due to formation of a protective layer at the interface which prevented water molecules from penetrating into the cell wall. The moisture absorption behavior for long-time immersion up to 1200 h is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13-0021998311434789">Figure 13</xref>. It can be noted that there is a gradual increase in water absorption for both cfc-t and cfc-ut, and the state of saturation has occurred at around 700 h. At saturation, the maximum moisture absorption values for cfc-t and cfc-ut composites are 7.75% and 6.8%, respectively, and for neat resin, a maximum absorption of 2.16% has occurred at 1000 h. The thickness, width, and the length of neat resin have slightly increased due to long-time immersion, the results of which are shown in Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14-0021998311434789">14</xref><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig15-0021998311434789"/>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig16-0021998311434789">16</xref>. For the treated fiber composite, there is an increase in thickness by 8.7% and width by 4%. During this period, the thickness and width of untreated fiber composite have increased by 9.42% and 3.17%, respectively, while the length has slightly decreased by 1.36% for untreated fiber composite and 0.4% for treated fiber composite. The percentage reduction in length for treated fiber composite for 1200 h of immersion in water was very small and nearly constant at 0.4%. It confirms that the treated fiber composites are stable in moist environment. However, the increase in thickness of the untreated fiber composites was considerable as the fibers have swollen, resulting an increase in both thickness and width and a decrease in length.

<p>Mechanical, thermal, and water absorption behaviours of woven treated and untreated fiber composites were studied. Absence of fiber pull-out and a brittle fracture indicate good interface bonding in treated fiber composite. This has resulted in higher tensile and hardness properties, low water absorption, high glass transition temperature, and higher decomposition temperature. Higher flexural strength and flexural modulus and high impact strength are obtained for untreated CF composite. Alkali treatment has improved the fiber–matrix adhesion and enhanced the interface strength that has positively influenced the tensile, water absorption, and thermal properties except the flexural and impact properties. Fiber pull-out in case of untreated fiber composites indicates a weak fiber–matrix interface and was helpful for the increased flexural strength and flexural modulus. The long untreated fibers with weak interface have provided a suitable energy absorption mechanism for increased impact strength. The authors have compared the present results with the latest results on sisal fiber composites<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0021998311434789">11</xref></sup> and Century (<italic>A. Americana</italic>) short fiber composites<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0021998311434789">26</xref></sup> available in the literature. This comparison has brought good insights about the trend of the results upon chemical treatment and reduced the flexural and impact properties in sisal fiber composites The short fiber composites are good for impact loading only but for all other properties, long woven fiber composites are better. The formation of covalent bond at the fiber–matrix interface in treated fiber composite has resulted in increased glass transition temperature and higher thermal resistance. TGA gave higher decomposition temperature and low weight loss. The water absorption properties have improved for the treated fiber composite. It has also reduced the moisture absorption capacity due to the formation of protective layer in the fiber–matrix interface and also prevented the loss of soluble matter.</p>
