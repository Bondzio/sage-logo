<abstract>
<p>There is a growing appreciation that our current approach to clinical research leaves important gaps in evidence from the perspective of patients, clinicians, and payers wishing to make evidence-based clinical and health policy decisions. This has been a major driver in the rapid increase in interest in comparative effectiveness research (CER), which aims to compare the benefits, risks, and sometimes costs of alternative health-care interventions in ‘the real world’. While a broad range of experimental and nonexperimental methods will be used in conducting CER studies, many important questions are likely to require experimental approaches – that is, randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Concerns about the generalizability, feasibility, and cost of RCTs have been frequently articulated in CER method discussions. Pragmatic RCTs (or ‘pRCTs’) are intended to maintain the internal validity of RCTs while being designed and implemented in ways that would better address the demand for evidence about real-world risks and benefits for informing clinical and health policy decisions. While the level of interest and activity in conducting pRCTs is increasing, many challenges remain for their routine use. This article discusses those challenges and offers some potential ways forward.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Despite the publication of approximately 19,000 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) each year, major gaps in evidence are consistently identified by systematic reviews, clinical guidelines, and other efforts to aggregate clinical research for the purpose of helping patients, clinicians, and payers making informed health-care decisions.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1740774512450097">1</xref></sup> The output of the current clinical research enterprise appears to be consistently unable to generate the information needed to support evidence-based clinical and health policy decisions. Up to 60% of the clinical recommendations made by the American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association in their clinical guidelines are based on expert opinion and/or low-quality studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1740774512450097">1</xref>]. Among other design issues, studies have shown that trial participants are not broadly representative of typical patients, contributing to substantial uncertainty about the risks and benefits of widely used interventions in the patient populations for which they are most commonly used [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1740774512450097">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1740774512450097">3</xref>].</p>
<p>Comparative effectiveness research (CER) has become a major focus of attention over the past several years in large part due to the increasing recognition of the major gaps in evidence. Political support for CER derived primarily from the view that better information for clinical and health policy decisions could improve the quality and efficiency of health care. In 2009, the Institute of Medicine provided the following widely cited definition of CER, which is similar to several others developed by other major organizations: CER involves<disp-quote>
<p>the generation and synthesis of evidence that compares the benefits and harms of alternative methods to prevent, diagnose, treat, and monitor a clinical condition, or to improve the delivery of care. The purpose of CER is to assist consumers, clinicians, purchasers, and policy makers to make informed decisions that will improve health care at both the individual and population levels . . . [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1740774512450097">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1740774512450097">5</xref>].</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In 2010, the Congress created an organizational home for CER as part of the broad health reform legislation (the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act) by establishing the Patient Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI)<disp-quote>
<p>as a non-profit organization to assist patients, clinicians, purchasers, and policy-makers in making informed health decisions by carrying out research projects that provide quality, relevant evidence on how diseases, disorders, and other health conditions can effectively and appropriately be prevented, diagnosed, treated, monitored, and managed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1740774512450097">6</xref>].</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>It is generally agreed that CER will be approached using a wide range of research methods, including both experimental and nonexperimental designs. In this article, we review the role of RCTs in CER, showing how pragmatism in trial design supports the primary goal of CER: a means to generate information that is useful for decision making. We illustrate these design principles with a number of examples and consider how to address the design and implementation challenges that may impede the broader use of pragmatic RCTs (or ‘pRCTs’) – trials that maintain the internal validity of RCTs while being designed and implemented in ways that better address the demand for evidence about real-world risks and benefits among a broad spectrum of patients, so that they will better inform clinical and health policy decisions.</p>

<title>Pragmatic attitudes to clinical trials: a foundation for relevant and reliable CER</title>
<p>The increasing interest in pragmatic approaches to the design of RCTs is highlighted by the increased rate of publication of articles on the related topics of pragmatic trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1740774512450097">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1740774512450097"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1740774512450097">9</xref>], practical trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1740774512450097">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1740774512450097">11</xref>], large simple trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1740774512450097">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1740774512450097">13</xref>], real-world trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1740774512450097">14</xref>], management trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1740774512450097">15</xref>], and effectiveness trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1740774512450097">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1740774512450097">17</xref>]. A MEDLINE search of RCTs selecting for trials that included the term ‘practical’ or ‘pragmatic’ in the title or abstract by year and a MEDLINE search of all RCTs by year revealed the trends shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1740774512450097">Figure 1</xref>. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1740774512450097">Figure 1</xref>, over the past two decades, the number of pRCTs has been increasing, from 43 in 1990 to 252 in 2010; however, in relation to an increasing number of RCTs, the proportion of trials designated as ‘pragmatic’ is still very small.</p>

<p>The common feature across most of these concepts is that they describe trials that aim to determine the effectiveness of interventions in ‘the real world’ and are often contrasted with explanatory trials that aim to determine whether a technology works in highly selected patient populations in tightly controlled study settings.</p>
<p>The pragmatic attitude to RCT design was first described by Schwartz and Lellouch during debates on the role of placebo and the most appropriate trial design for informing a change in clinical practice. In their seminal 1967 article, Schwartz and Lellouch [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1740774512450097">18</xref>] introduced the distinction between ‘pragmatic’ and ‘explanatory’ attitudes as alternative intentions behind the design of any particular RCT.</p>
<p>The conceptual framework, terminology, and reporting standards for pRCTs have recently been formalized. This includes an extended version of the Consolidated Standards for Reporting Trials (CONSORT) statement for pragmatic trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1740774512450097">19</xref>] and the pragmatic–explanatory continuum indicator summary (PRECIS) instrument developed to guide the design of pRCTs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1740774512450097">20</xref>]. The CONSORT statement is meant to provide guidance on the reporting of pragmatic trials, whereas PRECIS is a tool for graphically displaying the degree of ‘pragmatism’ in 10 defined structural element of trial design [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1740774512450097">20</xref>] and aims to encourage careful consideration of matching each element of the study design to the trial’s purpose (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1740774512450097">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1740774512450097">Figure 2</xref>).</p>

<p>The PRECIS tool makes visible the choices and tradeoffs that trial designers are making among the 10 domains of the explanatory–pragmatic continuum as they try to balance real-world relevance, feasibility, and credibility of their trial. At present, the authors recommend recording each criterion on its own continuous unmarked visual analogue scale, arranged as a 10-spoke wheel for visual display of the pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1740774512450097">Figure 2</xref>). Work on scaling, scoring, weighting, summarizing, and combining these domains is underway. However, the real purpose of the tool is to facilitate a dialogue between trialists and decision makers, early on in the process of designing a trial, rather than retrospectively to score trials for their pragmatism. Consequently, the optimal degree of pragmatism across each axis and overall can be achieved through such a process of meaningful dialogue and engagement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1740774512450097">21</xref>].</p>
<p>A number of examples are presented below to illustrate the pragmatic and explanatory elements, and some of the considerations that might favor a more pragmatic or explanatory approach to each component of a given study.</p>
<sec id="section3-1740774512450097">
<title>Case study 1: Randomized Aldactone Evaluation Study</title>
<p>The Randomized Aldactone Evaluation Study (RALES; see <xref ref-type="boxed-text" rid="boxed-text1-1740774512450097">Box 1</xref>) evaluated the ability of a potassium- conserving diuretic to improve clinical outcomes among patients with congestive heart failure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1740774512450097">22</xref>]. Spironolactone, a relatively inexpensive and widely available drug, was compared to usual therapy for congestive heart failure and was associated with a survival benefit. However, the patient population in RALES was so highly selected that few patients at risk of developing spironolactone-related side effects, chiefly hyperkalemia, were included in the study. These exclusions were not based on preexisting evidence regarding specific patient characteristics associated with high risk of hyperkalemia. When the findings were released, physicians began to use the medication in a broader patient population, which was associated with a dramatic rise in the rate of hyperkalemia-associated hospital admissions and deaths [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1740774512450097">23</xref>].</p>
<p>A more pragmatic trial design with broader inclusion criteria may have more quickly identified the patient population with optimal risk–benefit profile.</p>

<sec id="section4-1740774512450097">
<title>Case 2: Vioxx Gastrointestinal Outcomes Research</title>
<p>The Vioxx Gastrointestinal Outcomes Research (VIGOR) and Adenomatous Polyp Prevention on Vioxx (APPROVe) trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1740774512450097">24</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1740774512450097"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1740774512450097">26</xref>] highlight the risks of narrow inclusion criteria (<xref ref-type="boxed-text" rid="boxed-text2-1740774512450097">Box 2</xref>). The exclusion of patients at risk for heart disease reduced the study’s ability to assess rofecoxib-related cardiac complications, leading to years of increased risk to patients while accumulating postrelease administrative data. If the regulatory trials had included a wider range of patients, irrefutable safety signals might have been detected sooner.</p>
<p>Furthermore, population surveillance in Ontario, Canada, showed a dramatic rise in the very problem coxibs were designed to reduce: severe gastrointestinal bleeds. After coxib group drugs were licensed and listed for reimbursement by the public insurer there, incidence of severe gastrointestinal bleeding rose in the population, suggesting that the patients who would have been ineligible for coxib trials were being prescribed coxib drugs after they were licensed and reimbursed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1740774512450097">27</xref>].</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1740774512450097">
<title>Case study 3: Prospective Multicenter Imaging Study for Evaluation of Chest Pain Trial</title>
<p>In contrast to the aldactone and rofecoxib evaluations, the Prospective Multicenter Imaging Study for Evaluation of Chest Pain (PROMISE) trial assessing the effectiveness of cardiac computed tomography angiography (CCTA) against other diagnostic options for coronary artery disease has a number of highly pragmatic features (<xref ref-type="boxed-text" rid="boxed-text3-1740774512450097">Box 3</xref>). The study control group reflects practice in real-world settings: for patients not randomized to receive the CCTA, individual clinicians will select the alternative diagnostic approach, rather than following a diagnostic algorithm dictated by the study protocol. PROMISE will randomize patients over 2 years and follow them for up to four additional years. Study patients will be recruited from 150 sites representing a broad range of settings and populations, and once enrolled, patients will be managed by their primary clinicians rather than relying on protocol-driven care or specialist management, again increasing the generalizability of the findings to routine practice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1740774512450097">28</xref>].</p>
<p>While these and other pragmatic features of the design of the PROMISE trial will help to make the trial’s findings more applicable to routine care, they have also stimulated debate. For example, the decision to forego the traditional central reading and interpretation of CT scans may reduce diagnostic accuracy and thereby underestimate the potential benefits of CCTA, but it perfectly matches the organization of interpretation, and thus accuracy in real-world use, should the technology become widely available. This potential challenge to a pragmatic approach could be tested by including a substudy of ‘usual’ versus ‘expert’ reading comparisons.</p>
<boxed-text id="boxed-text1-1740774512450097">
<title>Box 1. Spironolactone therapy for patients with congestive heart failure: the Randomized Aldactone Evaluation Study (RALES) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1740774512450097">22</xref>]</title>
<p>The RALES trial examined the efficacy of spironolactone on morbidity and death in 1663 patients with severe congestive heart failure who were treated with an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, a loop diuretic, and, in many cases, digoxin and were randomized to receive spironolactone or placebo. The primary end point was death from all causes. The trial was discontinued early, after a mean follow up period of 24 months, because an interim analysis found a 30% relative reduction in the risk of death among patients in the spironolactone group – attributed to a lower risk of both deaths from progressive heart failure and sudden death from cardiac causes – a lower frequency of hospitalization for worsening heart failure, and significant improvement in heart failure symptoms. The study concluded that blockade of aldosterone receptors by spironolactone, in addition to standard therapy, substantially reduced the risk of both morbidity and death among patients with severe heart failure.</p>
</boxed-text>
<p>Whether more or less pragmatism is beneficial is a judgment that is best made with a clear sense of the clinical or policy question at hand. It is no more sensible to always default to the most explanatory approach to trial design than it is to always default to the most pragmatic approach. We would instead propose that clinical trialists more consistently consider the potential value of adopting pragmatic design <italic>features</italic> in clinical trials, ideally by consulting directly with decision makers (patients, clinicians, and payers) during trial design.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1740774512450097">
<title>Case study 4: the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial</title>
<p>In some cases, a mix of pragmatic and explanatory features may generate the evidence needed for optimal clinical and health policy decision making. For instance, the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT) clearly demonstrated that rigorous implementation of tight glucose control reduced long-term complications of diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1740774512450097">29</xref>]. As demonstrated by the PRECIS tool in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1740774512450097">Figure 2</xref>, this trial had relatively restrictive inclusion criteria and allowed for little flexibility in the implementation of the experimental intervention, both of which are more explanatory features (represented by the E in the middle of the wheel). However, the trial also has a number of relatively pragmatic features including, most notably, patient-relevant outcome measures.</p>
<p>The careful attention to frequent testing of blood sugar with regular adjustments of insulin dosing required a high level of clinical oversight and patient compliance – a seemingly explanatory approach to those aspects of the protocol. Prior to this trial, there was no consensus about whether ‘tight’ glycemic control could reduce long-term complications from diabetes. The DCCT demonstrated significant reductions in these rates and thus raised targets for glucose control among clinicians, patients, and policy makers. However, the strategies for obtaining tight control are not easily implementable across health systems, and the search is now on for ways to tighten control in usual care settings. An entire disease management industry has been born, clinicians are now expected to measure and report the level of glycemic control in their patients with diabetes, and their financial compensation is increasingly linked to performance on this metric.</p>

Cox II inhibitors for the management of arthritis: the Vioxx Gastrointestinal Outcomes Research (VIGOR) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1740774512450097">24</xref>] and Adenomatous Polyp Prevention on Vioxx (APPROVe) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1740774512450097">25</xref>] trials</title>
<p>VIGOR was a large, 8000 patient RCT with a 9 month follow up period. The VIGOR trial assessed whether rofecoxib (Vioxx) was associated with a lower incidence of upper gastrointestinal events when compared to the nonselective nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drug naproxen among patients with rheumatoid arthritis. The patients included in this trial were highly selected; those with recent cardiovascular events and those taking aspirin were excluded.</p>
<p>Subsequently, a 2500 patient RCT (APPROVe), of rofecoxib, with longer follow up modified its protocol to include patients at higher baseline risk for a cardiovascular event and found clear evidence of cardiovascular risk. Rofecoxib was withdrawn from the market.</p>

<p>Millions of Americans develop chest pain suggestive of coronary heart disease each year and often require noninvasive diagnostic testing. The PROMISE trial is designed to assess test strategies that lead to improved diagnosis and outcomes, while minimizing test burden, risk, and cost. The trial will compare an initial ‘anatomic’ testing strategy (using CT angiography) to an initial ‘functional’ stress testing strategy (using physician selected stress imaging or exercise electrocardiography) in low to intermediate risk patients for coronary artery disease. The trial will examine a range of end points including death, myocardial infarction, major periprocedural complications, hospitalization for unstable angina, quality of life, resource use, and cost effectiveness. This is a 150 site pragmatic trial, which will randomize 10,000 symptomatic patients over 24 months to either anatomical testing or functional testing. Therapeutic management will be at the discretion of the treating physician, supplemented by the latest clinical practice guidelines. Patients will be followed up for up to 48 months.</p>
</boxed-text>
<p>While the trial was rather explanatory in its approach to enforcing the intervention, it was very informative as it successfully addressed a key uncertainty at the time. Had the trial protocol been adjusted to be more pragmatic (i.e., less intensive efforts to ensure patient and practitioner compliance), DCCT might have been less informative for clinical and health policy makers. Tight monitoring and follow-up were implemented, not as a default design choice but because they were the essential characters and definitions of the intervention being tested.</p>

<title>Challenges and opportunities for pRCTs: a way forward</title>
<p>While nonexperimental methods such as prospective or retrospective cohort studies using routinely collected data, administrative databases, and electronic medical records may offer useful approaches to address a number of important CER questions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1740774512450097">30</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1740774512450097"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1740774512450097">32</xref>], pRCTs offer another potentially valuable methodological approach to CER. The most appealing aspect of pRCTs is that they aim to achieve a balance between internal validity and relevance, maintaining the benefits of randomization while including design elements that enhance external generalizability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1740774512450097">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1740774512450097">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1740774512450097">34</xref>]. It is not necessary to abandon randomization in order to conduct studies that reflect the experiences of patients in real-world settings and circumstances. As noted in the examples above, clinical trials can adopt pragmatic features across a number of discrete design domains, customizing the design to reflect the specific circumstances of the question being addressed and the decisions to be informed. Despite their potential value to many important stakeholders and decision makers, the number of self-declared pRCTs published each year is still a small fraction (about 1% in 2011) of the total number of RCTs due to several perceived and real barriers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1740774512450097">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

<title>Timeliness</title>
<p>Although pRCTs designed to inform real-world clinical and health policy decisions may currently be most commonly employed to examine already licensed and competing diagnostic or therapeutic interventions, pRCTs may be more useful <italic>before</italic> a new drug or technology has been widely adopted in clinical practice. Consider CCTA: systematic reviews completed in 2005 and 2006 noted the lack of high-quality studies on the clinical utility of CCTA and highlighted the need for PROMISE. The Medicare program based its 2009 review of CCTA on the limited available body of evidence and decided to pay for the technology, thus significantly accelerating its adoption [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1740774512450097">35</xref>]. It is not clear whether the trial results, however convincing, will now alter current payer and provider practice, as other experience has shown that even a well-designed RCT showing no benefit of an established technology may not be sufficient to limit use or reimbursement of the technology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1740774512450097">36</xref>]. Ideally, the PROMISE trial would have been initiated several years before its 2010 start date.</p>
<p>In order to produce information that is relevant, timely, and credible, it will be necessary to develop mechanisms to identify important research gaps early and to rapidly initiate studies to address those critical gaps in knowledge. Inclusion of relevant stakeholders (e.g., patients, the public, practitioners, private companies profiting from interventions, and payers) is vital. So too are strong links between decision-making bodies and funding agencies to ensure that the prioritized decision makers’ questions are translated into timely studies and are designed in a way that addresses these questions. Without these elements, studies may be too late to alter practice and influence outcomes, not designed to answer relevant questions or not technically sound.</p>

<title>Predictable sources of funding for routine and experimental costs</title>
<p>A dedicated funding mechanism for pRCTs will permit timely and efficient addressing of priority questions. Decision makers, and health-care payers, have traditionally had limited interaction with the clinical research and research funding communities. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), responsible for making coverage decisions for nearly 50 million elderly and disabled beneficiaries, and with a budget of over US$400 billion, has no funds allocated for the purpose of supporting research to inform their decisions. Furthermore, CMS and other health service providers and funders have limited routes by which to influence the division of expenditure by National Institutes of Health (NIH) or any other funders of research. This situation is not unique to the United States. In the United Kingdom, recommendations by the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) for the use of interventions in the context of well-designed studies have often equated to negative decisions because of a lack of a dedicated funding stream to design and implement the necessary trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1740774512450097">37</xref>]. However, the National Health Service (NHS) Research and Development program now has a dedicated budget for undertaking pragmatic trials assessing comparative clinical and cost-effectiveness of interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1740774512450097">38</xref>].</p>
<p>Initiatives such as coverage with evidence development (CED) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1740774512450097">39</xref>] in the United States and ‘direct access’ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1740774512450097">40</xref>] in the United Kingdom have helped resolve some of these limitations. An approved trial done under CED in the USA has intervention costs covered by health service funders who agree to do so because this initial investment is trivial in comparison to the potential cost resulting from broad, long-term adoption of a therapy or diagnostic tool that is not effective. The UK NHS’s outcome-based patient access schemes are designed so that when patients receive new technologies that have shown promise but as yet have too weak an evidence base to use in standard care in the context of a research project, the cost of the technology is paid for by the NHS, but rebates by the manufacturers can be agreed if the trial results show that the new technology fares worse than initially assumed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1740774512450097">41</xref>]. In Ontario, Canada, the Ministry of Health and Long-term Care funds both intervention and research costs under the umbrella of the Medical Advisory Secretariat. In a recent example, positron emission tomography (PET) scanning was evaluated for a number of specific indications, with funding and reimbursement only to patients and centers willing to participate in research to study the effects of the scan on care and outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1740774512450097">42</xref>]. In British Columbia, PharmaCare policy makers recently explored the use of delayed design pRCTs to evaluate drugs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1740774512450097">43</xref>]. The Blue Cross Blue Shield Association has been a US pioneer in developing a CED approach under the title ‘third path’, and the Center for Medical Technology Policy, a nonprofit organization in the United States, is working with large employers and private health plans, as well as life sciences companies, professional societies, and other key stakeholders, to implement CED for selected promising emerging therapies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1740774512450097">44</xref>]. The Department of Veterans Affairs Cooperative Studies Program has also developed over the years a stable infrastructure and operating procedures for conducting complex multicenter RCTs and provides a mature framework to consider increasingly pragmatic trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1740774512450097">45</xref>].</p>

<title>Local capacity and community-based research infrastructure</title>
<p>For trials to inform pre- and postregulatory decision making, they have, by definition, to be carried out in a real-world setting reflecting ‘usual care’ or ‘normal conditions’ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1740774512450097">18</xref>]. This requires that there is research capacity at the local level across different settings, from community and primary care clinics and small district hospitals to tertiary care centers and teaching hospitals. Such capacity includes a modest amount of research personnel support, ideally, an electronic medical record, technical infrastructure and central randomization systems, collaborative institutional review boards (IRBs), and financial arrangements to support trials outside academic centers, as has happened with the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ)-sponsored practice-based research networks in primary care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1740774512450097">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1740774512450097">47</xref>]. In addition, AHRQ’s Distributed Ambulatory Research in Therapeutics network (DARTnet) is a federated network of electronic health record data, aimed at facilitating CER in real-world settings through ‘. . . providing the central resources and operational infrastructure to conduct increasingly complex practical clinical trials . . .’ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1740774512450097">48</xref>]. Recently, there has been increased recognition and discussion in the United States about the need to significantly improve the capacity to conduct clinical trials in community-based settings. Furthermore, there is a recognition of the need for more public participation in the clinical research enterprise and greater efforts to form collaborations with industry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1740774512450097">49</xref>].</p>
<p>One strategy to increase the conduct of trials at the community level instead of solely in academic centers is to undertake cluster randomization by meaningful clinical units – possibly primary care practices, wards/teams, or even entire hospitals or administrative jurisdictions – thereby increasing the number of individual subjects in a trial with little extra effort, which more than compensates for the increased homogeneity of participants due to clustering of the study sites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1740774512450097">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1740774512450097">51</xref>]. Indeed, cluster randomization can allow researchers to take advantage of the existing variation in practice to test the comparative effectiveness of the technologies and, most importantly, delivery models, the latter being high on the Institute of Medicine list of top 100 CER priorities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1740774512450097">52</xref>].</p>

<title>Achieving the promise of faster and cheaper trials</title>
<p>One of the most significant concerns about pRCTs is that they may require larger sample sizes and longer follow-up to detect important differences in major (as opposed to surrogate) clinical outcomes and more diverse clinical settings such as community-based (as opposed to solely tertiary academic centers), in order to enhance external validity and relevance. These challenges are clearly illustrated by the Antihypertensive and Lipid-Lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial (ALLHAT) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1740774512450097">53</xref>], a widely cited large, lengthy, and expensive RCT, which demonstrated the comparative effectiveness of several branded and generic antihypertensive regimens. However, pRCTs need not be expensive. Large simple trials conducted at low cost include the International Study of Infarct Survival (ISIS) and Global Utilization of Streptokinase and Tissue Plasminogen Activator for Occluded Coronary Arteries (GUSTO) trials. These trials were inexpensive despite their huge size (‘mega-trials’) because they minimized exclusions, simplified patient recruitment, reduced data collection burden, and focused on important and easily verified short-term outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1740774512450097">54</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1740774512450097"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1740774512450097">56</xref>]. In the United States and Canada, increased investment in clinical and disease registries and their infrastructure may also reduce the resource requirements for conducting pRCTs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1740774512450097">57</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1740774512450097">58</xref>].</p>
<p>In its 2011 review of the National Cancer Institute’s (NCI) Clinical Trials Cooperative Group Program, the Institute of Medicine recommended a series of measures for streamlining clinical trials, equally applicable to pRCTs, including consolidating administrative requirements, simplifying government oversight, and improving collaboration among stakeholders, including the Food and Drug Administration, academic centers, community practices, and the pharmaceutical industry. The use of NCI standardized case report forms and remote data capture systems are also suggested as ways for improving efficiency. Providing salary support for protected research time and encouraging payers (public and private) to implement consistent payment policies to cover patient care costs (in return for not having to cover experimental interventions outside a trial setting) are cited as measures for improving patient and physician participation in high-priority NCI trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1740774512450097">59</xref>].</p>

<title>Streamlining institutional review</title>
<p>Human subject protection is crucial, regardless of the trial’s place on the explanatory–pragmatic spectrum, and this may impose appropriate delays in the process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1740774512450097">60</xref>]. Governmental organizations in both the United States and United Kingdom have recently recommended centralization and streamlining of IRB process in order to increase efficiency of the implementation and completion of clinical trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1740774512450097">61</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1740774512450097">62</xref>]. Furthermore, in the United States, the Clinical Trials Transformation Initiative is working on a project designed to develop strategies to address the barriers to the use of central IRBs for multicenter trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1740774512450097">63</xref>]. Additionally, funders and research ethics committees are increasingly calling for greater breadth of inclusion of patients in RCTs, that is, encouraging trialists to be more pragmatic in their eligibility criteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1740774512450097">64</xref>]. Extensive work carried out by the Sensible Guidelines Initiative<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1740774512450097">2</xref></sup> sets out concrete steps for simplifying existing trial regulation in order to make large simple trials more timely and more affordable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1740774512450097">65</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1740774512450097">66</xref>].</p>
<p>Underscoring this is the recent emphasis on creating a ‘learning health-care system’ in the United States. This emphasis suggests that there will be increasing attention to the need to integrate clinical research into clinical practice, which poses significant challenges to the existing human subjects protection paradigm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1740774512450097">67</xref>]. pRCTs present one important variation of this research–practice continuum. As newer methods emerge for conducting research within the clinical practice setting, such as through the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation, new frameworks for ethical oversight that balance the obligation to protect research subjects with the need to efficiently generate information to help guide the clinical care are needed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1740774512450097">68</xref>]. Practical ways for integrating randomized trials into routine clinical practice have been proposed by Vickers and Scardino [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1740774512450097">69</xref>] for interventions ranging from surgery and ‘me-too’ drugs to health promotion and drugs for orphan diseases. In their model, randomization becomes part of routine practice, and eligibility criteria are minimized, along with the marginal cost of putting an additional patient on trial. Most recently, the Department of Veterans Affairs completed the first pilot of a point-of-care clinical trial comparing the effectiveness of two insulin regimens, using the electronic medical record system to randomize interventions and then collect all study variables [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1740774512450097">70</xref>].</p>

<title>Concluding thoughts</title>
<p>As the methodological framework for CER is developed and debated over the next several years, we believe that pRCTs will continue to emerge as a key design for answering CER questions. While the CER portfolio will include a wide range of designs, including nonexperimental studies, the well-recognized benefits of randomization in controlling for unknown confounders suggests that there will be a good return from efforts to improve the design and implementation of RCTs, which address the demand from clinical and health policy decision makers for evidence about real-world risks and benefits. Further attention is required to develop methods, infrastructure, and policies to expand the number, quality, and relevance of pRCTs:</p>
<list id="list1-1740774512450097" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>To ensure that pRCTs are designed to reflect the information needs of patients, clinicians, and payers, these decision makers can be actively engaged in refining research questions and developing study protocols for specific trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1740774512450097">71</xref>], as well as in the development of methodological standards for clinical researchers working in defined therapeutic domains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1740774512450097">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1740774512450097">72</xref>].</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Multistakeholder collaboration could be strengthened by institutionalizing the dialogue between payers and regulatory bodies to ensure that trials are designed with the goal of addressing both regulatory and reimbursement expectations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1740774512450097">73</xref>]. This will increase the interest of life science companies in supporting trials with more pragmatic features.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Public funding for pRCTs that address questions of comparative effectiveness will be essential to complement private investment in these trials. In the United States, PCORI should be an important source of funding for pRCTs when high-priority questions cannot be adequately addressed with other methods. The recent calls for proposals from the NIH is an important step toward expanded funding for pRCT and should significantly augment the infrastructure to conduct these studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1740774512450097">74</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1740774512450097">75</xref>].</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Pragmatic trial designs are not yet familiar to trialists or decision makers, and so empirical research is underway to estimate the differences in effect size of pragmatic design choices for each of the domains, with more needed. Further empirical research work is also needed to weigh the impact of unblinded designs, simplified recruitment and outcome measurement, cluster randomization, and real-world behaviors (such as noncompliance, cross over, and dropout) on required sample sizes.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The rapid establishment of clinical registries and adoption of electronic medical records by many health-care systems should provide an extensive data collection infrastructure that could be deployed to support pRCTs. The financial sustainability of this infrastructure will depend in part on continued progress in delivery system and payment reforms that reward collection of high-quality clinical data that supports measurement and improvement of care delivery as well as research.</p></list-item></list>
<p>A common theme that emerges from this overview of pRCTs is that the goal of increasing the relevance of clinical trials for clinical and health policy decision will require close and ongoing collaboration between researchers and the audiences for which evidence is being generated. It will also depend on researchers being able to leverage the changes in the collection of health-care data, organization of the delivery system, and payment reforms to facilitate the conduct of pRCTs.</p>
