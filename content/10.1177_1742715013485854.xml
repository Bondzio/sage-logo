<abstract>
<p>Although growing numbers of scholars are studying the role embodiment plays in leadership, few attend to the most fundamental level at which bodies are involved: that of the felt experience of being within a leadership dynamic. How do we know, at a bodily level when we are being led, or when we are leading? Does the quality of that bodily based experience have an impact on the extent to which we are willing to engage in leadership processes, either as followers or as leaders? This paper draws on Merleau-Ponty’s phenomenology to respond to questions such as these and to elaborate the perceptual processes central to the felt experience of being within a leadership relation. This exploration culminates in a description of Merleau-Ponty’s notion of ‘flesh’, the ‘stuff’ of materiality, as well as the medium through which materiality is experienced. This paper argues that Merleau-Ponty’s ideas provide a holistic approach to understanding perception as a full-bodied activity with important implications for the creation and maintenance of leadership relations. In doing so, his thinking offers a starting point for rendering the invisible intersubjective relations at the heart of leadership more visible, thus enabling their material dimensions to become more evident.</p>

<sec id="sec1-1742715013485854" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>There are growing numbers of scholars exploring embodied aspects of leadership (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1742715013485854">Kupers, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1742715013485854">Ladkin, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1742715013485854">Ropo and Parviainen, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1742715013485854">Ropo and Sauer, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1742715013485854">Sinclair, 2005a</xref>). To date, this work generally follows one of two trajectories: writers such as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1742715013485854">Ladkin (2008)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1742715013485854">Sinclair (2005a)</xref> provide descriptive accounts of actual leaders and the way in which their bodies can be seen to be implicated in the way in which they take up the ‘leader role’. Alternatively, those such as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1742715013485854">Giessner and Schubert (2007)</xref> or <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1742715013485854">Naidoo et al. (2010)</xref> undertake psychologically based studies that explore the links between specific bodily actions or positions and how they are interpreted. The limitation of the first approach is that much of this work remains descriptive (for instance, by her own admission, Sinclair forefronts the body in order that it does not ‘disappear under the weight of theorising’ (2005a: 387)). The second deconstructs leader–follower relations in ways which render them curiously ‘dis-embodied’: by focusing on correlations between variables, the holistic nature of leadership as a phenomenon is lost. Neither approach attends to the most fundamental bodily based aspect of leadership; the felt-experience of being part of a leadership dynamic.</p>
<p>This paper addresses these limitations by drawing on the phenomenological insights of Maurice Merleau-Ponty to explore how the felt experience of leadership is created and maintained through embodied perceptual processes. In doing so, the holistic quality of perception is retained and the way in which bodies create and maintain leadership relations comes into relief. The felt experience of leadership is important because although often overlooked, it can be seen to be a critical aspect of leader–follower relations, the very ‘stuff’ which holds people together and aligned as they move towards common purposes.</p>
<p>In order to better understand the territory which this paper addresses, it may be helpful to introduce an example which highlights the issues at stake. Corbin (a pseudonym) was the Head of a Professional Services Firm (PSF) in which I undertook research into change management processes. Although my attention was primarily drawn to systems changes, the relationship between Corbin and his staff became a central focus of the study.</p>
<p>Corbin was variously described as ‘nosy’, ‘involved’, ‘disruptive’, ‘caring’, ‘a busybody’, ‘politically astute’ and ‘powerful but sometimes like a bull in a china shop’ by those with whom he worked. A white man in his early fifties of medium build, Corbin was not described as ‘charismatic’, but was known for his high energy levels and drive. The staff were well aware of his sporting prowess, and each summer he took part in the organisation’s sport days as an active competitor.</p>
<p>It was clear that from Corbin’s point of view leading this group of very autonomous workers was akin to ‘herding cats’. Although the bonds that held Corbin and his staff together were sometimes fraught, they were very strong. Everyone, from the tea-lady to the most senior directors, had a view about him and, more often than not, it was a powerfully felt view. Furthermore, although there was a significant number of staff who did not like him, they still felt duty-bound to respond to him. (This was in contrast to other Professional Service Firms I have known in which it was common for senior members to ignore a Director if they did not like him or her.) Similarly, my conversations with Corbin inevitably concerned his staff, what they were thinking and feeling and how they were making sense of changes he was spearheading.</p>
<p>What was even more interesting to me was my own ‘felt reaction’ to Corbin. I met him briefly during my first day with the firm and occasionally during my nine months of working there. However, even when he was not there, I felt his presence. After a few weeks of working in the organisation, I found myself echoing others within the firm who routinely mentioned, ‘Oh, Corbin wouldn’t like that,’ or ‘That will float Corbin’s boat’. He was a ubiquitous presence within the organisation, to the extent that people spoke about him as ‘holding the place together’. There were no leadership theories which adequately addressed the experience of being in a leadership relation with Corbin and the feelings it engendered. He was not considered particularly ‘charismatic’, for instance, and his leadership did not seem to be experienced as ‘transformational’ either. Instead, people seemed to experience his leadership as a strong containing presence; a way of being which both guided their work but also let them get on with it in an autonomous fashion. I wanted to know more about how that felt sense of being led by Corbin was created. I will return to Corbin throughout this paper as an anchoring point for the ideas offered here.</p>
<p>In summary, this paper seeks to discover a way of noticing and discussing the lived, felt experience of being part of a leadership dynamic, whether as ‘leaders’ or as ‘followers’. Rather than locating that experience primarily within our cognitive processes, the approach taken here suggests that bodies have a critical role in creating this felt sense through the very way in which perception works. By attending to this bodily based role, the seemingly invisible forces which ground the felt sense of ‘leading’ or ‘being led’ become more apparent. Raising these processes into conscious awareness affords leaders and followers greater choice about how to engage with them.</p>
<p>This paper begins by placing these ideas within the broader canvass of literature on leadership as a socially constructed and relational phenomenon before turning to the work of those elaborating its embodied aspects. Ideas from Merleau-Ponty which complement these perspectives are introduced, culminating in an explication of his notion of ‘flesh’ and the insights it brings to how the ‘leadership container’ is created and maintained. The paper ends by considering the implications of these ideas for conducting further research into issues of materiality within leadership.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-1742715013485854"><title>Socially constructed and embodied accounts of leadership</title>
<p>Two strands of literature serve as platforms for the ideas presented here; that pertaining to the social construction of leadership and that exploring ways of understanding leadership from an embodied perspective.</p>
<sec id="sec3-1742715013485854"><title>Leadership as a social construction</title>
<p>Grounded in an idealist ontology, the notion of leadership as a socially constructed activity is part of the larger move in organisational theory towards understanding social phenomena as outcomes of the interplay between individual sense-making, collective cultures and institutional norms, rather than being based in any objectively verifiable reality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1742715013485854">Alvesson and Deetz, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1742715013485854">Astley, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1742715013485854">Searle, 1995</xref>). Proposed by writers such as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1742715013485854">Meindl (1995)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1742715013485854">Sjostrand et al. (2001)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1742715013485854">Grint (2005)</xref>, the key idea here is that leadership emerges as a function of individuals engaged in tasks together through which they come to identify themselves as ‘leaders’ or ‘followers’. Central to this view is that leading and following are ‘roles’ which are taken up at a given time in response to particular contextual demands. From this perspective, leadership is not solely a function of hierarchical position. Rather, depending on how a situation is perceived by those within it, one individual may be understood to be most appropriately designated ‘leader’ at a given point of time. This is accomplished through either conscious or unconscious understandings or through formal or informal processes (of course, this attribution may also align with hierarchical position, as it does in the example of Corbin.)</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1742715013485854">Fairhurst and Grant (2010)</xref> offer a ‘sailing guide’ which categorises the different ways in which leadership as a social construction has been theorised. Ideas presented here are aligned with those viewing leadership as a phenomenon which emerges arising through perceptual and attributional processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1742715013485854">Calder, 1977</xref>). Explained in this way, leadership is an outcome of individuals’ beliefs about how they relate to one another within particular social contexts. These theorists often locate leadership in the ‘minds’ or ‘imaginations’ of those who would engage in the process, with language as its key expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1742715013485854">Fairhurst, 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1742715013485854">2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1742715013485854">Pondy, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1742715013485854">Smircich and Morgan, 1982</xref>).</p>
<p>As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1742715013485854">O’Malley et al. (2008)</xref> argue, however, before language and cognition, embodied processes exist without which attributions could not take place. We cannot escape the fact that individuals observe one another as bodies and through bodies, and as such bodies affect how and what we perceive, and consequently our attributional processes. For example, the very way in which I perceive another person is subject to the mundane reality of my height. If I am shorter than the person I am speaking with, I will necessarily look ‘up’ at them, and this looking up itself provides me with a different sensorimotor perception than if they are shorter than me and I look ‘down’ to meet their gaze. This everyday occurrence of positioning ourselves in relation to others provides the very basis of our relations with them.</p>
<p>Other authors working in this territory similarly hint at the importance of ‘something’ upon which cognition rests. Hollander, for instance, writes that ‘a major component of the leader follower relationship is the leader’s perception of him or herself relative to followers, and how they in turn perceive him or her as a leader’ (1992: 55). Murrell suggests leadership rests on the ‘human processes of how people decide, act and present themselves to each other’ (1997: 39). As a consequence of these processes, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1742715013485854">Naidoo et al. (2010)</xref> highlight the role played by ‘primary appraisal’ in the creation of affective responses between leaders and followers. It can be inferred that such automatic responses are based on the way in which leaders and followers perceive one another at a physical level. None of these accounts, however, explore this bodily basis of attribution in depth, although <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1742715013485854">Fairhurst and Grant (2010)</xref> call for the importance of more studies which would do so.</p>
<p>There is another off-shoot of socially constructed theories of leadership which is important to mention here; those theories categorised as ‘relational’. As summarised by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1742715013485854">Uhl-Bien (2006)</xref>, these studies fall into two categories. The first examines the relationship between leaders and followers but does so by attending to the individual agents, and are characterised as ‘entity perspectives’. The second which Uhl-Bien calls ‘relational’ attends to the leadership relationship itself which occupies the ‘space between’ leaders and followers. This is very slippery territory, as Uhl-Bien herself points out. The notion of ‘the space between’ leaders and followers is hard to grasp; it lacks the materiality which would make it more easily observable. However, I believe that Merleau-Ponty offers a view of perception which can help us conceptualise this ‘middle space’ in a way that renders it more ‘palpable’ if not more distinct. Before exploring this in more detail, let us briefly consider the questions being asked by others currently exploring the embodied aspects of leading and leadership.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-1742715013485854"><title>Leadership and embodiment</title>
<p>Two approaches to exploring the embodied aspect of leadership are apparent in the literature. Writers such as Amanda Sinclair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1742715013485854">Sinclair, 2005a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1742715013485854">2005b</xref>), Arja Ropo and her colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1742715013485854">Ropo and Parviainen, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1742715013485854">Ropo and Sauer, 2008</xref>) and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1742715013485854">Kupers (2010)</xref> are in the vanguard of those providing descriptive accounts of the bodily basis of leadership. In addition to myself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1742715013485854">Ladkin 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1742715013485854">2008</xref>), others such as Hans Hansen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1742715013485854">Hansen et al., 2007)</xref> and Steve Taylor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1742715013485854">Ladkin and Taylor, 2010</xref>) have elaborated embodied leadership through their work on leadership and aesthetics.</p>
<p>Similar to the approach taken here, Ropo and her colleagues also introduce ideas from Maurice Merleau-Ponty to justify the importance of attending to the bodily nature of leadership. In particular, they point out that from a Cartesian point of view, leaders are conceptualised as ‘those who see’, without the reciprocal perception of their followers being taken into account (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1742715013485854">Ropo and Sauer, 2008</xref>). In that article, as well as an earlier piece written with Parviainen (2001), a conceptualisation of leadership as something which is ‘socially and bodily constructed through the senses…through seeing and looking, through hearing and listening and feeling and touching’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1742715013485854">Ropo and Parviainen, 2001</xref>: 567) is stressed.</p>
<p>Sinclair develops her ideas along similar lines but her writing foregrounds leaders’ bodies by attending to them in specific case studies. In this way she considers how leaders’ bodies are perceived by particular constituencies and how those perceptions affect what the leader feels able to do. For instance, in her profile of Christine Nixon, the Chief Commissioner of Police within the Australian State of Victoria, she notes that despite Chris’s allegiance to the gay community demonstrated by her marching with the annual Gay and Lesbian Pride March in 2002, the force of public backlash was such she has not marched in the event again. Sinclair analyses this by suggesting that placing her body so clearly in support of this movement was too subversive for her constituency and Christine has been sensitive to this and has acted accordingly. The depth and detail of Sinclair’s case studies offer a means of scoping this territory and pose important questions about the extent to which a leader can act outside of the perceptual boundaries their bodies impose, the challenges faced by bodies which are not prototypical of those they lead and the interplay between embodied and symbolic aspects of leading.</p>
<p>There is a second strand of literature which looks at bodily interactions between leaders and followers but from a more realist perspective. Grounded in neurology and ideas of ‘embodied cognition’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1742715013485854">Barsalou, 2005</xref>), these studies tend to isolate one aspect of bodily awareness (for instance, the location of an individual within a firm’s hierarchy, as in the case of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1742715013485854">Giessner and Schubert, 2007</xref>) and plot its relationship to particular attributions associated with leadership, such as power. Following similar lines, there have been a number of scholars who have concerned themselves with exploring the relationship between individuals’ heights and their likeliness to be promoted or attributed the leader role (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1742715013485854">Egolf and Corden, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1742715013485854">Melamed, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1742715013485854">Schubert, 2005</xref>). Closer to the purposes of this paper, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1742715013485854">O’Malley et al. (2008)</xref> study the interactions between ‘embodiment’ and ‘sense-making’ within leadership contexts. The intricacies of relationships theorised in their work, however, fail to address the somatic experience of being within a leadership relationship and how the quality of that relationship might affect the overall ‘leadership’ dynamic and outcomes.</p>
<p>In summary, within the leadership literature to date, there is a body of work which considers how leadership comes to be through socially constructed processes and within relational ways of being. However, these studies take perception as having occurred as their starting point. In doing so, the nature of perception itself remains unexplored. The impact of its bodily basis on what and how someone or something is perceived is ignored. Within the literature concerned with embodiment in leadership, there is much that remains descriptive, or that analyses particular embodied relationships in ways resulting in the felt experience of leadership being lost. Although all of these approaches may explain a part of what was going on between Corbin and those in his organisation, the holistic sense and feel of being part of a particular kind of leadership dynamic is still missed out. To address this, I now turn to a phenomenologically based approach in an effort to reveal the processes of perception critical to the felt experience of leadership.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-1742715013485854"><title>The nature of perception</title>
<p>The process of perception is a very complex one and has been extensively theorised within psychological and neurological disciplines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1742715013485854">Mack et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1742715013485854">Pick, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1742715013485854">Simons and Chabris, 1999</xref>). Perceptual processes have also been explored within the management literature, particularly in relation to managers’ sense-making (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1742715013485854">Mezias and Starbuck, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1742715013485854">Sutcliffe, 1994</xref>). Here I draw from a phenomenological, rather than psychological or neurological, approach to understanding perception for two key reasons. Firstly, the phenomenological account considers perception ‘holistically’, from an experience-based perspective in which the perceiver and perceived retain centre stage (rather than specific aspects of what is perceived, e.g. ‘height’). Secondly, phenomenology offers concepts which provide useful ‘handles’ for both apprehending and discussing the slippery territory of intersubjective experiences.</p>
<p>I turn specifically to the work of the French phenomenologist known for this work on the phenomenology of perception, Maurice Merleau-Ponty. Two ideas central to Merleau-Ponty’s understanding of perception are important here. Firstly, he characterises perception as ‘physiognomic’, that is, it is primarily a materially based, full-bodied encounter rather than a cognitive one. Secondly, perception is ‘reciprocal’; as we perceive we are also aware of being perceived. Each of these ideas is elaborated more fully below, as well as having their implications for leadership drawn.</p>
<sec id="sec6-1742715013485854"><title>Perception as ‘physiognomic’</title>
<p>According to Merleau-Ponty, rather than being a cognitive activity, perception is fundamentally a full-bodied engagement with the world; it is ‘physignomic’. He describes physiognomic perception as a process through which ‘the perceiver ranges round the subject in a world which speaks to him of himself, and gives his own thoughts their place in the world’ (1945[2002]: 154). Furthermore, he suggests the nature of bodily knowing is such that ‘my body has its world, or understands its world, without having to make use of my ‘symbolic’ or ‘objectifying’ function’ (1945[2002]: 162). In other words, the body’s way of knowing the world is primary, prior to cognition’s role in selecting and interpreting. Scientists working in the emerging field of embodied cognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1742715013485854">Rohrer, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1742715013485854">Varela et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1742715013485854">Wilson, 2002</xref>) come to similar conclusions about the nature of perception as a primary and whole-bodied achievement. In particular, their work demonstrates the way in which sight, sound, touch, taste and smell coalesce in our interpretation of experience which occurs prior to our ‘thinking about’ what we (consciously) perceive.</p>
<p>The notion of physiognomic perception, however, has within it the sense of how perception is the product of an active engagement with the world at an embodied level. The body is not just the meeting point of our different sensory organs, as sometimes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1742715013485854">Varela et al.’s (1993)</xref> work seems to be implying, but the active organ of perception itself. According to perceptual physiognomy, it is our bodies which first apprehend the world at a material level. In leader follower relations, it is important to remember that individuals first encounter one another through embodied awareness, and it is the knowing arising from this physical basis that initially informs assessments of who might take up ‘leader’ and ‘follower’ roles within particular contexts.</p>
<p>Physiognomic perception provides a means of making sense of the role perception played in the relationship between Corbin and his staff. First of all, it was striking how often those working within PSF mentioned the extent to which Corbin was generally ‘around the place’. One senior manager who I coached reflected as follows:<disp-quote>
<p>‘He’s always around. I often work until late in the evening, and all of a sudden Corbin will pop into my office. He always wants to know what I’m working on, why I’m not home with my family’.</p></disp-quote>Others spoke about how Corbin always seemed to ‘know what was going on, at every level of detail in the business’. ‘He’s just always around the place’, was a comment I heard frequently. In other words, by his sheer presence, he made it possible both for his staff to know him from a physiognomic perspective and for him to know them.</p>
<p>When I asked Corbin about how he saw his role, he was very clear that a key part of doing his job was just noticing how people were, what kinds of pressures they were under and trying to figure out ways in which he could help – not overtly but often through providing extra resource. He characterised himself as ‘nosy’, he said he just liked ‘bumbling around the place, because you found out so much just by doing so’. There was another practice that Corbin mentioned which struck me as unique. He had created a big board on which all of the members of the staff had a place, and he would rearrange people in terms of their proximity to one another, and muse about what the effects of just having people in different working relationships might be. What came across from the way in which he talked about PSF and the people within it was that he was endlessly curious about his staff, how they saw things and how they might work differently. This curiosity seemed to drive him to be actively present within the organisation in a way which may not always be the case when leaders become (physically and emotionally) separate from those they are leading.</p>
<p>This was not a one-way interaction. People within the organisation often talked about changing their own behaviour because of the way in which they imagined Corbin would view what they were doing. A second concept from Merleau-Ponty, that of ‘reciprocity’, elaborates the significance of this exchange of perceptions.</p>

<p>Another distinctive way in which Merleau-Ponty theorises perception is by noticing its reciprocal nature. As an individual is perceived, they are simultaneously aware (perhaps not at a conscious level but at more of an ‘energetic’ level) of being perceived. Perception is thus characterised as a reciprocal event, rather than as a one-way process. A passage from <italic>The Visible and the Invisible</italic> captures this notion particularly well:<disp-quote>
<p>‘Thus since the seer is caught up in what he sees, it is still himself he sees; there is a fundamental narcissism in all vision. And thus, for the same reason, the vision he exercises, he also undergoes from the things, such that, as many painters have said, ‘I feel myself looked at by the things, my activity is equally passivity, the seen and the visible reciprocate one another and we no longer know which sees, and which is seen’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1742715013485854">Merleau-Ponty, 1968</xref>: 139).</p></disp-quote>The notion of reversibility of perception challenges realist accounts in which observer and observed are separate from one another (and by extension, those accounts in which leaders and followers are similarly ‘separate’ with leaders exerting influence on followers as a one-way process). Phenomenologically, Merleau-Ponty characterises perception as a dynamic, mutually affecting process.</p>
<p>This kind of mutuality was evident in the way in which Corbin and his staff interacted. Corbin was different from many other Directors of firms such as PSF in that he had been appointed as a ‘professional manager’. He did not have the same professional qualification of those he led and had not ‘come up through their ranks’, as is often the case for Directors of such organisations. The fact that he was ‘not one of them’ seemed a key feature of the way in which he thought of his staff. He seemed genuinely curious about them, rather than able to rely on assumptions of ‘how they would be’. Similarly, the fact that Corbin was ‘not one of us’ was often mentioned by individual members of his staff and seemed to lead to a good deal of speculation about ‘what he was up to’.</p>
<p>This lack of a shared background seemed to heighten the role interactions of perceptions played in their relations with one another. Corbin commented:<disp-quote>
<p>‘They have the power to deliver the goods. I may be their boss, but at the end of the day, if they aren’t happy, clients will know that, and that will have an impact on the business. So I need to monitor what kind of affect I’m having on them. I always have to walk a fine line between keeping them happy and pushing us as an organisation forward’.</p></disp-quote>Similarly, his staff watched out for signals indicative of what he thought of them. Many of them came to read his mannerisms and idiosyncrasies extremely well. The following quote is indicative of how members of his senior team attended to Corbin’s embodied reactions to their ideas:<disp-quote>
<p>‘If you’re in a meeting with Corbin and he doesn’t’ like what’s going on, the left side of his face sort of freezes up. Then I know I’ll stand a better chance of getting what I want done if I try a different tack’.</p></disp-quote>Not having shared a common discipline background seemed to heighten the way in which they kept tabs on one another and would adjust their behaviour depending on what they perceived.</p>
<p>What came across strongly in talking with both Corbin and his staff was the extent to which they were engaged in perceiving and assessing one another’s reactions on an on-going basis. There was nothing ‘once and for all’ in the way in which they related to one another as a leader and his group of followers. Although the social construction of leadership literature does talk about the fluid nature of leader–follower relations, the role that embodied perception plays in the creation of these relations is generally ignored. Between Corbin and his staff, it was clear that the way in which they related to one another was essentially grounded in what they noticed about one another and how they interpreted their own behaviour affecting the other. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1742715013485854">Weick (1979)</xref> refers to such a process as the ‘double interact’, which he elaborates through the lens of sensemaking. Here, phenomenology provides a new way of understanding what is going on through the notion of the reciprocity of perception. Leaders and followers will not only be assessing one another, they will also be informed by the gaze of one another about themselves.</p>
<p>Merleau-Ponty offers another concept which takes the notion of perception a step further. Rather than conceptualising perception merely as interactive, he posits that it is also the very medium through which relations are formed. All relationships – all of the interactions that occur within them as well as the meaning that is made from those interactions – have their genesis in interacting perceptions. These interacting perceptions have their own basis in embodied awareness: somatic feelings and reactions which themselves are grounded in physical, material contexts and relationships. All of these ideas are held within one of Merleau-Ponty’s most radical concepts, that of ‘flesh’.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec8-1742715013485854"><title>Merleau-Ponty’s notion of ‘flesh’</title>
<p>So far, perception has been described as physiognomic – that is, a full-bodied encounter; and, as reciprocal – that is, in constant dialogue with that which is perceived. Imagine the continuous flow of perceptions between individuals in a relationship as developing some kind of momentum and becoming something of an ‘energy force’. I think this image begins to approach a phenomenon akin to Merleau-Ponty’s idea of ‘flesh’.</p>
<p>In his final manuscript, <italic>The Visible and the Invisible</italic>, he writes:<disp-quote>
<p>‘Flesh of the world, described (apropos of time, space, movement) as segregation, dimensionality, continuation, latency, encroachment…that means that my body is made of the same flesh as the world (it is a perceived) and moreover that this flesh of my body is shared by the world, the world <italic>reflects</italic> it, encroaches upon it and it encroaches upon the world (emphasis in the original)’ (1968: 248).</p></disp-quote>In other words, ‘flesh’ is the ‘stuff’ of which human beings are made, as well as the myriad ‘things’ of the world and the medium through which perception of each other occurs. It is the inter-contextuality of being, and as such provides the material embodiment of an ontology of relationality. Three implications of this notion for leadership are offered below. It is important to make clear that in drawing connections between Merleau-Ponty’s notion of ‘flesh’ and leadership, I am taking imaginative liberties which the philosopher himself might not have strictly endorsed. However, I think the concept provides an interesting springboard to reconceptualising about the nature of leader–follower–context relations and the role of bodies and materiality which are central to them. I therefore beg Merleau-Ponty’s forgiveness, as well as the reader’s indulgence in following me along this thinking thread.</p>
<p>Firstly, as the notion of ‘flesh’ posits the complete inter-connectivity between perceiver, perceived and world, it emphasises the inseparability of leaders, followers and the context within which their relations are enacted. Thinking of these relations as arising out of ‘the flesh of the world’ provides an imaginative in-road into the ‘between-space’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1742715013485854">Bradbury and Lichtenstein, 2000</xref>) of relationality. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1742715013485854">Uhl-Bien (2006)</xref> points out, even entity-based relational leadership theories fall back into the habit of examining ‘leaders’ and ‘followers’ as separate aspects of the leadership mix. It is difficult to apprehend the ‘between-space’, where leadership actually ‘happens’. ‘Flesh’ provides a concept for naming that relational space. For those engaged in leadership relations, it is the palpable ‘sense’ of being part of ‘something’. Created through the invisible perceptual interactions produced by material, visible bodies, the notion of ‘flesh’ offers a way of noticing the relational dynamism at the heart of leadership relations.</p>
<p>As such, the notion of ‘flesh’ also provides a location for the qualitative experience of leadership. How I experience being in a leadership relationship; whether I feel central or peripheral to it (either as a leader or a follower) arises from the qualitative experience of the ‘flesh’ of that relationship. Of course, this way of thinking about the space between those in relationship is part of any human-to-human interaction and indeed is present between humans and non-humans too. However, it allows the question to be posed about what is distinctive about the quality of relationality (or ‘flesh’) which is experienced as ‘leadership’? Indeed, it provides a way of talking about the quality of leader–follower relations; is it a relationship in which there is a high degree of ‘flesh’ (as was the case in the relationship between Corbin and his staff) or one in which there is very little ‘flesh’?</p>
<p>Following from that observation, the third contribution which the notion of ‘flesh’ makes to conceptualising the ‘felt experience’ of leadership is that it provides a description of the ‘holding container’ of leadership. In their theory of ‘adaptive leadership’, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1742715013485854">Heifetz and Laurie (1997)</xref> note the critical role leaders play in providing a psychological container for followers’ difficult emotions as they go through times of stress and change. ‘Flesh’ offers a unique way of conceptualising that ‘containing’ space and how it is created.</p>
<p>The ‘containing space’ of leadership was very evident in the example of Corbin and his staff. Managers in that organisation often spoke of the organisation being ‘held together’ through Corbin’s leadership. ‘Flesh’ suggests that rather than being a one-way process, however, both Corbin and his staff would have been involved in the kind of perceptual interactions which would have resulted in this strong holding space. It is important to note that not all of these perceptions had to be ‘positive’ in order to create strong containment. Just the energy of the perceptual interactions themselves, whether ‘positive’ or ‘negative’, would contribute to creating the experience of the ‘flesh’ of the relationship between Corbin and his staff.</p>
<p>Indeed, within the organisational narrative were stories of shouting matches between Corbin and his most senior executives. There were those who did not appreciate the strong ‘containing force’ of Corbin’s way of leading and who left the organisation. However, there was also a sense of steadiness amongst those who remained, and the organisation exuded a sense of collective purpose somehow, despite the changes it was going through during my time with them.</p>
<p>Whether in a confronting or supportive manner, however, it was clear that Corbin spent a lot of time and energy thinking about and watching his staff and they spent a correspondingly significant amount of time watching and making sense of him. There was a continuous and energetic perceptual interaction going on between them. The extent of this perceptual reciprocity seemed to create a feeling of ‘connectedness’ between them which the concept ‘flesh’ encapsulates. The ‘flesh’ between Corbin and his staff seemed to be quite ‘thick’. His staff often spoke about the almost ‘palpable’ force with which the organisation was ‘held’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1742715013485854">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>In what ways can the example of Corbin inform us more generally about the ‘flesh’ of leadership and how it is created? The final section of the paper offers reflections on this question, as well as ideas about how this approach to understanding leadership might be further developed.</p>

<sec id="sec9-1742715013485854"><title>Discussion: the phenomenology of perception and its contribution to understanding the material dimensions of leadership</title>
<p>Research into the material and bodily based aspects of leadership is on the rise, as indicated by this very Special Issue itself. In this final section of the paper, I discuss the significance of this trend and how the ideas offered here can extend current thinking. Finally, implications for further research, both in terms of its content and its methods, are offered for those keen to pursue these ideas empirically.</p>
<p>As indicated through the illustration of Corbin used throughout this piece, current theories of leadership, numerous though they may be, do not adequately address the ‘felt experience’ of being within a leadership dynamic. This may be for many reasons, and chief among them, as suggested by scholars such as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1742715013485854">Bradbury and Lichtenstein (2000)</xref>, is the sheer difficulty of conceptualising ‘between space’. It is, after all, invisible. In a field dominated by studies attempting to measure ‘objectifiably determined variables’, invisible, subjective experiences are easily ignored. Yet, it is these invisible aspects, i.e. the feeling of trust that flows between leaders and followers; the extent to which followers read leaders as being motivated for the common good rather than just for their own ends; the level of actual support a leader feels from her staff as she spearheads an exciting new vision, which play a large, yet unsung role in creating effective, communally experienced and acknowledged mobilisation.</p>
<p>Perception is the key activity at play in the ‘between space’ of relational processes according to Merleau-Ponty. But his view of perception is not the commonly held one in which cognition is the main arbiter. Instead, he places bodies as the very ground from which perception arises. We cannot perceive without bodies, Merleau-Ponty says – not just in the sense that our eyes are physical parts of our bodies, but in the sense that our bodies position us in relation to that which we perceive, kinaesthetically as well as visually. Our bodies tell us what we feel, hear and smell – as well as all of the physiologically based responses which go along with those sense data. In other words, it is the material, embodied basis of perception which yields the non-material, yet vital reactions between leaders and followers.</p>
<p>For actors within leadership relations, the implications are at least threefold. Firstly, this account of perception means that both leaders and followers might helpfully be more aware of the bodily signals they give off to one another. This bodily awareness goes beyond surface-level gestures and attire, however. Merleau-Ponty’s rendering reminds us that we are exposed, betrayed and known through bodily awareness which is alert to nuance in comportment and energetic engagement. In understanding the physignomic nature of perception, leaders are invited to become sensitised to the way in which followers will constantly be noting what they ‘do’ at subtle levels and making interpretations from the backdrop of full-bodied knowing. If a leader is making pronouncements about the way forward, for instance, but a follower senses that this change is not high on the leader’s agenda (a lack of conviction in the voice, a sense of distraction in the delivery?), this is likely to impact on how that pronouncement is interpreted and subsequent action is taken. Therefore, these ideas suggest the potential power of becoming more conscious of the invisible, bodily based perceptions one feels in assessing how leadership relations are actually going.</p>
<p>A second implication revolves around the importance of proximity for those within a leadership relationship in order that the physignomic knowing <italic>can</italic> occur. Ideas of ‘management by walking around’ are powerful because they recognise the kind of knowledge that can be gained simply by ‘being around’, picking up signals, reactions, themes, from a full-bodied perspective, rather than from just relying on email or telephone contact. Of course, it is not possible for leaders of extremely large organisations to meet all of their staff. However, successful leaders of large organisations often spend a good deal of time just visiting people, just making themselves physically felt to those they lead. Politicians running for office know the importance of actually ‘pressing the flesh’ by being seen shaking hands and holding babies in order to demonstrate ‘who they are’ physically to potential voters.</p>
<p>This leads to the third implication that is connected with the term ‘flesh’. To date, the leadership literature focuses on ‘leaders’, sometimes ‘followers’ and increasingly, aspects of ‘purpose’ and ‘context’ (see for instance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1742715013485854">Ladkin, 2010</xref>). Generally, the leadership <italic>relation</italic> itself is not a focus of attention. When individuals undertake leadership development, their main focus is usually on themselves as ‘leaders’. Seldom is the focus on the leadership relationship and how <italic>it</italic> can be strengthened. Attending to ‘leadership’ rather than individual ‘leaders’ would invite different questions for those engaged in leadership development activities, such as: ‘How might I develop a more robust leadership relationship with my followers?’ ‘What do I know about them from an embodied basis, rather than just a cognitive one?’ ‘Based on their bodily reactions, what do they think of me and where the organisation is headed?’</p>
<p>Merleau-Ponty’s notion of ‘flesh’ provides a concept through which the invisible dynamics at the heart of leadership can be brought into more conscious awareness, if not materially seen. It also opens up possibilities for action and impact for both leaders and followers engaged in the creation of ‘leadership’. As a follower, for instance, I can make efforts to become more present to the leader. I can join with other followers to bring our feelings and perceptions to the view of the leader. Alternatively, I can have impact on the leadership relationship by disengaging and distancing myself from the leader. As the result of a reciprocal process, ‘flesh’ tells me I am not just a passive observer to another’s acts of leading – I bring my own perceptions and reactions and those too contribute to ‘the leadership’, even if I embody them silently or through my non-presence.</p>
<sec id="sec10-1742715013485854"><title>Future directions</title>
<p>One of the most important contributions to further research offered by these ideas is the way they pose new questions for leadership scholars. There are important questions to be asked about the felt sense of leadership itself, including ‘What does it feel to be within different leadership relations?’ and ‘How is that experience created?’ A second line of questioning would focus on the perceptual process itself and the extent to which raising the embodied aspects of it to a more conscious level leads to different ways of interacting. Are there triggers for making the embodied aspects of perception more salient and how might such triggers be used to better align intentions with impressions?</p>
<p>There are also important questions to be asked about the practices which result in leadership being experienced as ‘trusting’ or ‘supportive’ (or for that matter, ‘manipulative’ or ‘untrustworthy’). I was surprised, for instance, to learn of the ‘board’ that Corbin drew up and how he played around with different arrangements of people. Even if he did not move them there, playing in this way engaged his energy with thinking about how people worked, what made them tick and how they inter-related. What other practices do leaders engage in which contribute to the experience of strong containing environments?</p>
<p>Methods for investigating such questions would necessarily be holistic in their approach and means. In my own work, I have experimented with visually based methods for attempting to capture ‘leadership moments’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1742715013485854">Wood and Ladkin, 2008</xref>). If not wholly successful, the method of inviting co-researchers to take photographs of moments they experienced as contributing to the emergence of leadership seemed to sensitise them to their own embodied responses to what they interpreted as ‘leaderful’ activity. Of pertinence to the argument here is the need for researchers to attend to the ‘invisible’ aspects of the research field in order to understand its more materially based dimensions. This seemingly contradictory capacity; to be able to attend to the invisible in order to make sense of the visible within leadership relations was also a finding of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1742715013485854">Salovaara’s (2011)</xref> phenomenologically based longitudinal study of Finnish business leaders undergoing a development programme. That study also highlighted the need for researchers inquiring into the interplay of the ‘visible’ and the ‘invisible’ to use their own embodied responses as critical data for their own interpretative efforts.</p>
<p>In conclusion, this reflection brings me back to Merleau-Ponty and particularly to his last work, <italic>The Visible and the Invisible</italic>. Through its very title, Merleau-Ponty declares the paradoxical relationship between that which can be seen and that which cannot. His radical philosophy encompasses this by alerting us to the way in which material (yet often overlooked) bodies are the <italic>sine qua non</italic> of perception itself. Visible leader and follower bodies, inter-relating within particular material contexts together create the invisible, yet visceral experience of leadership relations. By attending to the visible in a heightened way, we become more sensitive to the power and presence of the invisible. It is interesting to speculate upon the material affect just holding that invisible thought in mind might have on those who enter into leader–follower relations, as well as on those who study them.</p>
