<abstract>
<p>This study examines the day-to-day experiences of female spouses of international students living in the United States as legal dependents of their male student spouses. Although these women are well-educated professionals, as legal dependents, they are prohibited from engaging in educational and professional endeavors during their sojourn. As a result of these limitations placed on their day-to-day activities, this study reveals that these women frequently experience social isolation, economic challenges, and emotional struggles. Given the economic, cultural, and intellectual benefits of international students and their families to campus communities, these findings suggest that it is imperative for colleges and universities to provide spouses of international students with access to programs and services that meet their educational, professional, and social needs. As universities compete to attract international students, the existence of services and programs for accompanying spouses could become a key factor in where international students choose to pursue their education.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The majority of spouses of international students (SIS) in the United States today are well-educated professional women used to financial independence and rich professional lives. As holders of F-2 visas, however, while in the United States, they are legal dependents of their student spouses and therefore prohibited from seeking educational and professional opportunities. As such, these sojourners are largely restricted to the domestic sphere. Moreover, as their legal status is entirely dependent on the status of their student spouses, they have limited abilities to change their circumstances on their own. Therefore, the sojourning of SIS is often problematic as their daily lives and the relationships to their spouses are significantly altered during this time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1028315311403486">De Verthelyi, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1028315311403486">Kim, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1028315311403486">Schwartz &amp; Kahne, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1028315311403486">Vogel, 1986</xref>).</p>
<p>In light of these realities, this study centers on the experiences of female SIS. Although some SIS in the United States are male, the majority of SIS throughout the history of American higher education have been and continue to be female. What has changed over time is that whereas earlier generations of female SIS were primarily homemakers, the current generation is for the most part made up of professional women. However, as the findings of this study show, policies and practices that shape the experiences of SIS have failed to keep up with the needs of female SIS as a result of changes in gender roles over time. To better understand this situation, this study focuses specifically on the day-to-day experiences of 12 women from 11 different countries, currently living in the Midwest as either current or former F-2 visa holders.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1028315311403486">
<title>Brief Review of the Literature</title>
<p>The period immediately following the end of World War II is marked by significant growth in American higher education. Since then, the number of international students and their families living in the United States has continuously risen. According to the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1028315311403486">Institute of International Education (2009a)</xref>, there are currently close to 700,000 international students in the United States, representing over 25% of the world’s international students. Historically, the expectations of female SIS were that, as homemakers, they would play a supportive role to their husbands during their studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1028315311403486">Baldwin, 1969</xref>). To meet the transitional needs of these women, colleges and universities historically relied on volunteer networks such as churches and the Young Women’s Christian Association (YWCA). However, over the decades, as gender roles have changed around the world, female SIS no longer fit the description of homemakers. Instead, they are well-educated professional women who often meet their future husbands while they are working toward their own degrees. Concomitantly, as the number of women in the U.S. workforce has increased, volunteer networks that aid SIS have decreased in numbers and in reach.</p>
<p>Despite these significant contextual shifts, we still know very little about SIS and their adjustment to functioning as accompanying spouses. Research on SIS has been extremely limited as SIS occupy an in-between space, being neither part of academic institutions nor their surrounding communities. To this end, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1028315311403486">Pence (2004)</xref> describes them as living isolated lives of “double marginalization.” What we do know about SIS is that despite the changes in their characteristics, they continue to be typified as homemakers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1028315311403486">Kim, 2006</xref>). From the limited research available (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1028315311403486">De Verthelyi, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1028315311403486">Martens &amp; Grant, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1028315311403486">Pence, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1028315311403486">Schwartz &amp; Kahne, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1028315311403486">Vogel, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1028315311403486">Kim, 2006</xref>), we also know that these women typically lack assistance in adjusting to a new environment and, therefore, often experience loneliness and isolation. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1028315311403486">De Verthelyi (1995)</xref> asserts that academic institutions are unwilling to support this group because “unlike their student husbands, they [SIS] are not required to fulfill any specific task nor to achieve any positive goal during their sojourn . . . ” (p. 390). Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1028315311403486">Martens and Grant (2007)</xref> contend that institutions have never been willing to assist the SIS because college administrators view the concerns of this group as an external matter. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1028315311403486">Schwartz and Kahne (1993)</xref> make a similar assertion, suggesting that when institutional support for SIS does exist, it is usually “ad hoc or covertly accomplished to get around the official system” (p. 453).</p>
<p>This lack of information about accompanying spouses has compelled some researchers to use the experiences of other sojourners (e.g., international students and expatriate families) to learn about adjustment, culture shock, and psychological and emotional issues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1028315311403486">Day &amp; Beavers, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1028315311403486">Ebbin &amp; Blankenship, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1028315311403486">Fasheh, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1028315311403486">Furnham, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1028315311403486">Furnham &amp; Treizise, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1028315311403486">Hull, 1978</xref>). That said, even if there are some similarities between accompanying spouses of students and spouses of expatriates, there are typically stark economic differences. While some international student families are learning to survive on a single assistantship or stipend, expatriate families are less likely to face economic constraints. Nonetheless, the literature on international students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1028315311403486">Black &amp; Gregersen, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1028315311403486">Martens &amp; Grant, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1028315311403486">Schwartz &amp; Kahne, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1028315311403486">Shaffer &amp; Harrison, 2001</xref>) suggests that the adjustment of accompanying spouses affects the academic progress of international student scholars. In other words, adjustment of accompanying spouses is not only important to the emotional and psychological well-being of the couple but also an important factor in the achievement of the international students to whom they are married (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1028315311403486">Church, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1028315311403486">Ward, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1028315311403486">Ward &amp; Kennedy, 2001</xref>).</p>

<title>Method</title>
<p>Using semistructured interviews, 12 female SIS from 11 countries were interviewed about their experiences living in the United States on an F-2 visa. The site for this study was a large Midwestern university with a long tradition of attracting international students. The women interviewed were recruited for the study through a local volunteer group working with SIS. The group of women interviewed included women whose spouses were currently students and those whose spouses had completed their studies and were now in the workforce. The availability of these two subgroups allowed for an engagement with both short-term and long-term experiences of accompanying spouses. All interview data were transcribed, coded, and analyzed according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1028315311403486">Coffey and Atkinson’s (1996)</xref> approach for handling interview data.</p>
<sec id="section4-1028315311403486">
<title>Participant Profiles</title>
<p>As indicated in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1028315311403486">Table 1</xref>, the ages of the 12 participants ranged from 26 to 46 years, and their respective stages in life and circumstances were quite varied. Overall, younger interviewees were newer arrivals and typically childless, whereas older interviewees were parents that were more settled in the community. Several women in the group (Basu, Alexandra, Tonya, Mindy, Heidi, Chiyo, and Frances<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1028315311403486">1</xref></sup>) were awaiting the completion of their husbands’ studies, whereas others like Roxana and Nasrin were settled with families (their husbands had received and accepted offers of employment). Meanwhile, Gita had just moved to the community after her husband accepted a postdoctoral position. The other two interviewees, Ingrid and Manuela, were living as single mothers; both were divorced and their husbands had returned to their respective countries.</p>

<title>Findings</title>
<p>Of the key themes that emerged from the interviews, in this article we focus on (a) shifts in professional and relational identity, (b) feelings of marginalization and isolation, (c) experiences of adjustment and relationship building within a new community, and (d) expectations of the academic institution their spouses attend.</p>
<sec id="section6-1028315311403486">
<title>We are made invisible</title>
<p>This was the expression used by Alexandra and a sentiment shared by several of the women interviewed. Alexandra had been in the United States for 3 years at the time of the interview. She came from a family background committed to social justice and remarked,</p>
<p>
<disp-quote>
<p>I am intolerant of seeing anyone mistreated and marginalized. . . . [Seeing] myself in a situation like this . . . I feel like I have been shut out and it makes me furious. . . . I used to be a respectable lawyer back home, and . . . [here], I felt that we (spouses) were marginalized . . . and made invisible by just abandoning us at home. . . . [First], I became very depressed, and I suffered in my own skin . . . [Then], two years later, I was determined to change my status . . . my husband was very helpful and I was able to change my visa from a dependent to a student. . . . [But] it was a very expensive process because I needed to go back home and re-enter the U.S. (as a student). . . . [But] what about those women . . . who may not have any money and support [from the husbands] that I had?</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Alexandra’s description of her dependent status in contrast to the status she once had as a respected lawyer speaks to the transitions experienced by many of the interviewees. She described her past professional and economic status with her current status as “a wife who just sits at home,” as creating a “rupture” in her identity and spoke of this resulting in strong feelings of isolation and invisibility.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1028315311403486">
<title>Sometimes, I feel that we are not part of the community, though we live here</title>
<p>This was a statement made by Ingrid from Kenya that is representative of several interviewees who concluded that they felt like “outsiders within the community.” Most participants directly and indirectly discussed feeling like outsiders as a result of losing their professional identities and lacking educational opportunities. Some also placed emphasis on the role of ethnicity/race in their experience of marginalization. For example, Chiyo from Japan saw the absence of her professional identity intertwined with her ethnic identity as central to the struggle she experienced as the spouse of an international student:</p>
<p>
<disp-quote>
<p>I grew up learning how important it is to pursue education and a professional life . . . even after having children, more and more Japanese women are trying to stay [active] in their professional lives . . . I loved my job very much, but I did not realize how important it was to me in the way I used to feel about myself . . . when my husband told me about his plans to come here, I was supportive . . . he did not force me to quit [my job] but I knew he was expecting me [to do so] . . . Now, sometimes, I have regrets about being here . . . once in a while, I ask myself, why did I say yes to follow my husband?</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Chiyo mentioned knowing very few Japanese people in the community and pointed out that the building of community and friendship is not automatic, even if people hail from the same country:</p>
<p>
<disp-quote>
<p>Even if there are students from your country, it does not mean that you make friends with everyone from your country . . . [Because], there are differences in our background and we could have age differences. . . . [For me], I have been a professional for several years. . . . [Here], the students I meet are very young . . . [so], it is not easy when you do not have a lot in common.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>As someone who has been in the community for a long time, Chiyo’s length of stay had not translated into a sense of belonging. Similarly, Basu from Kazakhstan, who expressed admiration for the university town she warmly called “an intellectual place,” had not been able to build relationships in spite of having spent 6 years in the community. She suggested that sometimes “the culture of the community” is what makes her feel “uncomfortable or different”:</p>
<p>
<disp-quote>
<p>We came from Kazakhstan where people socialize with everyone . . . [you] may know already that Kazakhstan has [a] very mixed population . . . [because] during the Soviet rule, they brought different people; Indian looking, Turkish, Koreans, and others and released them in Kazakhstan. As a result, we are very mixed . . . [and] we grow up socializing with each other . . . [and] you do not have a feeling of [a] divided community. Here, I feel it is the opposite. . . . I notice it is not the same . . . [people] are always with someone who looks like them.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Speaking about the role of ethnic/racial background in relation to a sense of belonging and community, Heidi from Holland, recognizing the benefits she experienced as a White woman, expressed concern for non-European spouses:</p>
<p>
<disp-quote>
<p>I feel comfortable about being here and people are nice in general . . . [but] I am not sure if this is the way other women are feeling with no support system from the campus. . . . I am not sure if other women (who are non-Europeans) feel the same way. . . . I think it [homogeneity] could be a concern for some women.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Whether dealing with professional, social, or cultural issues, the voices of these women suggest that feelings of isolation, marginalization and loss of identity, were common experiences among this group of SIS.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1028315311403486">
<title>The community network is instrumental in learning English</title>
<p>Although several interviewees expressed frustration with isolation and marginalization as evidenced by the aforementioned interview excerpts, a few interviewees had no regrets about their roles as accompanying spouses. Mindy and Frances, two Chinese interviewees, were upbeat about the local community, especially about the opportunities to learn English. As Frances said, to which Mindy agreed, “My English is very poor . . . and . . . [I] feel this is an opportunity to improve my language . . . [and] also to learn about American culture.” For Mindy and Frances, who had been living in the community for a relatively short time (2 years and 18 months, respectively), neither expressed a sense of loss by not having family with them. Also, neither one seemed to regret the loss of their professional identities. They both seemed excited about the opportunity to improve their English language skills. Instead of spending more time with conationals, they preferred to spend more time with Americans so that they were forced to speak English and learn more about American culture. Frances was proud to share how her language skills have improved without having the opportunity to study formally. She stated, “My husband is in a department with a lot of Chinese students and they speak Chinese all day. . . . [I] am sure by the time he completes his stud[ies], I will be even in much better level (of English).” What Mindy’s and Frances’s responses make evident is that a number of factors such as age, stage in life, national origin, language skills, and professional experience can significantly shape how SIS experience their circumstances.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1028315311403486">
<title>They really make you feel welcome when no one knows you are here</title>
<p>Despite varying perspectives on the local community, all the participants shared strong positive feelings about the sense of connection they experienced through their interactions with a small group of local volunteers. They all mentioned that having a member of the community to question about anything and everything (e.g., schooling issues for the children, drivers license/bus, language, utilities, and banking) was very important. Having a member of the community to socialize with was particularly pertinent for those with children. Tonya from Russia explained the importance of meeting local women who provided her with basic information: “The few women we met when we first arrived are the ones who made us feel welcome, and my daughter relates to one of them as her aunt. . . . The community network is where we make friends.” Although some participants arrived more than 20 years ago and others had only been in the United States for 2 years, all reported that the volunteer network was a place where they made friends, particularly when they first arrived in the community, and this served as their only means of support and networking. Roxana, who came to the United States 17 years ago, shares her early experiences with great emotion:</p>
<p>
<disp-quote>
<p>For several months, local volunteers were the people that I interacted with and my husband was very busy trying to complete his studies. . . . I remember particularly feeling miserable during the week because I was lonely and I missed my family and friends back home. . . . [Also,] I started to worry about my English language skills. My profession . . . what would I be doing . . . [but] joining the conversation group was a great opportunity because I met some long-term friends through the network.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1028315311403486">
<title>The relationships with local volunteers is long term</title>
<p>Almost all the participants attended English conversation socials and holiday gatherings with the local volunteers at some point during their time in the community, and several built lasting friendships with volunteers. Nasrin from Bangladesh, one of the interviewees who had been in the community for the longest time, expressed her experience in this way:</p>
<p>
<disp-quote>
<p>Because I grew up in a close-knit family, my first few months were very hard . . . [but] years ago, when I came here, the opportunity to get to know people [spouses like myself] was better, because there were many volunteers and many activities. . . . [For example], one lady used to come to the student housing to offer sewing classes. . . . [Although] I didn’t need to do sewing for my family, I enjoyed attending classes like that because, that way, we get to meet new people.</p>

<p>Although her long stay in the United States empowered Nasrin, she never forgets the invaluable friendships she first established with local volunteers many years ago:</p>

<p>When I was new . . . [many years ago], the wives did not have to worry about how to get to different places such as meetings, churches, conversation gatherings . . . because there were many volunteers who were helping out . . . [they] drove us to different activities in town and out of town . . . sometimes, we shared recipes and we used to do baking in church kitchens in groups. . . . [Driving] to the Capitol to see the Christmas lighting was one of my favorite times.</p>

<title>Volunteers can only do so much on their own</title>
<p>For the spouses who were highly educated and proficient in English (Heidi, Gita, Chiyo, Basu, Ingrid, and Alexandra), the support and programming they wished to receive was different than for those without these experiences/skills. As they had advanced English language skills, their hope was to get involved in something more challenging than English conversation classes. Here is how Gita, who earned her MBA in India, spoke about her expectations:</p>
<p>
<disp-quote>
<p>When we first arrived, I stayed at home for about two months . . . [then], I found out that there is a volunteer group which met for conversation and socialization with local volunteers and I joined immediately . . . [but] I stopped after attending the meetings three or four times . . . [because] I did not get what I was hoping for . . . [first of all], the language (conversation) effort felt like it was more appropriate for women who are just beginning to learn English . . . [we] talked about the same thing all the time—each person spoke about her culture regarding holidays, cooking, etc . . . then, next week, it seemed like we repeated the same thing again. . . . [I] felt that I needed more. . . . [But] . . . I am sincerely grateful to all they are doing to make us feel welcome. . . . [Even though] I chose not to go, I know that they are helping many women.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Thus, Gita preferred to do something else rather than attend the conversation meetings. An Indian woman eventually helped her get connected with a volunteer opportunity on campus: “It [the work] did not have much to do with my field, but it offered me a different venue to spend a few hours a week doing office type of work for the YWCA. . . . [And] I had a chance to be with professional women, and that was important to me.”</p>
<p>Like all participants, Gita was grateful for the “kindness” of volunteers because she believes “even if some of us do not need help with basic English conversation, I know they are there to provide information and friendship.” However, hinting at the differences in the backgrounds and expectations of sojourners, her comments revealed a gap between the sojourners’ needs and the limited assistance the volunteer network was able to offer. Like Gita, Heidi was an advanced English speaker who similarly commented on the limited conversation opportunity: “I think the volunteers are doing what they can on their own, but they don’t have the capacity to help if your ability is beyond basic English.” She added that she heard of churches in the community that were also offering English classes, but she questioned whether it is “fair to those who are not from the Christian religion . . . . When you have religious groups offering free classes, I feel that it is not easy for those who are not Christians to avoid being suspicious.”</p>
<p>Furthermore, virtually all participants said they wished to see some level of involvement by the university in easing their sojourn. To some participants, the university needed to get involved in designing “better” programs and services to enable them to get out of the house routinely. Frances and Mindy believed the university’s relationship was primarily with their husbands and that their husbands were the link between them and the university. However, both indicated that “helping the accompanying spouses needs to be seen as helping the student spouses” because, as Mindy noted, “when I am not happy or not busy enough, the problem will affect my husband.” For Frances, Mindy, Heidi, and Gita, institutional involvement could mean something as basic as presenting them with information they needed, offering English classes, or providing volunteer opportunities. For Gita, the university was not the only organization responsible for the adjustment of spouses. In particular, Gita believed that “the community should partner with the university in creating ways to assist.” She was the only one to mention the fact that international students and their families can be contributors to the community, both financially (e.g., rent, transport, restaurants, etc.) as well as culturally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1028315311403486">Altbach, 2004</xref>). As Gita’s husband had just started working in the community after he received a postdoctoral assignment, she noted that the benefit from having international families “is not just a benefit for the university.” Instead, she remarked that the community would benefit “by employing a continuous flow of new knowledge.” Because of this benefit, Gita said, community businesses should be equally interested in aiding the adjustment of accompanying spouses—because “when international families decide to leave the area because of difficulties in adjustment, it is not just a loss to the university, rather, it is also a loss to the community.” She added, “I feel that businesses are part of the community, not just the university alone.”</p>
<p>The voices of the women in this study offer valuable information about the daily experiences of women sojourners that reside in the United States as legal dependents. Their narratives suggest that their prescribed primary roles as homemakers are far removed from their previous lives, causing great dissonance. The isolation many experience as they find themselves restricted to the domestic sphere translates into struggles with professional, social, and psychological well-being. Although community volunteers played a vital role in mediating these circumstances, their capacity was limited in terms of both resources and the ability to respond to highly skilled professional SIS. Finally, there is a belief among these women that academic institutions have a responsibility to provide them assistance during their sojourn.</p>

<title>Recommendations</title>
<p>The increased revenue from international education has produced tough competition among universities worldwide. Given this growing competition, it is important that U.S. institutions of higher education develop effective ways to address issues associated with accompanying spouses. Even though accompanying spouses have never been viewed as part of the campus community by colleges and universities, they are nevertheless part of a constituency responsible for billions of dollars paid annually to higher education institutions worldwide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1028315311403486">Mazzarol &amp; Soutar, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1028315311403486">Mok &amp; Tan, 2004</xref>). In the United States alone, for the academic year 2008/2009, international students contributed US$17.8 billion to the U.S. economy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1028315311403486">Institute of International Education, 2009b</xref>).</p>
<p>The most transformative change to address the concerns raised by this study would be a change in U.S. immigration policy, making it legal for accompanying spouses to pursue formal education and attain employment. This policy change is briefly addressed as part of the Alliance for International Education and Cultural Exchange and NAFSA: Association of International Educator’s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1028315311403486">2007</xref>) call for the federal government to develop U.S. international education policy. In a call for this policy to include the creation of a “comprehensive strategy to restore America’s status as a magnet for international students and scholars” (n.p.), the recommendation is made to “remove unnecessary barriers to international students that are currently in place . . . [such as the] inability of . . . spouses to work” (n.p.). To date, at least 23 states have passed resolutions acknowledging the importance of international education and international students and scholars to their states. President Obama has also spoken out in favor of growth in international education in the United States. Moreover, when asked about the creation of international education policy during his campaign, his advisors stated that this was a priority for the president. Given this context, we believe that scholars, policy makers, and supporters of international education must gain greater awareness of the conditions faced by accompanying spouses and clearly articulate the associated consequences to the advancement of international education as a whole. They must also allow issues related to the F-2 visa to feature more prominently in the advocacy for U.S. international education policy.</p>
<p>In lieu of immediate immigration policy changes, it is imperative that institutions of higher education work within existing legal parameters to create environments that better meet the needs of SIS and, in turn, meet the needs of international students. First and foremost, it is imperative that institutional decision makers recognize that an important segment of their international constituency is being overlooked in both policy and practice. Although involving SIS on campus currently happens only as a result of personal initiative and ad hoc programming, formally assigning a staff member within international student services as a liaison to SIS can serve as a crucial beginning to addressing the needs of this constituency. Through formalized social and educational programming, SIS can become a greater part of the college or university community, increase their understanding of American culture, and feel more connected to their new environment. Working in collaboration with the local community, staff in international student services could develop uncompensated job-shadowing and volunteer opportunities for SIS to help them maintain professional skills and knowledge. Although F-2 visa holders are not allowed to enroll in degree-granting coursework, providing SIS with information on vocational and recreational courses that they may enroll in may also open up more opportunities for SIS to interact and engage outside of the home. While simultaneously working for federal policy changes, institutions have the opportunity to establish themselves as preferred destinations for capable international couples through initiatives such as these.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Given the economic, social, cultural, and intellectual benefits of international students and their families to campus communities, institutions as a whole must come to understand the importance of providing this group with access to appropriate programs and services. Most importantly, there is an urgent need for academic institutions, immigration policy makers, and sponsors of international students to create and support educational and professional opportunities for SIS outside the domestic sphere. By doing so, institutions of higher education will not only help SIS in the short term but also give them the opportunity to invest in their education and career goals, which, in turn, will allow them to become productive contributors to the workforce and society at large, whether they return to their countries of origin or not. At the same time, this is an opportunity for institutions to become more attractive to potential students globally, improve retention of international students, and improve the overall quality of life in the communities where they are located.</p>
