<title>Introduction</title>
<p>In the last few decades, the number of patients with diabetes mellitus has markedly increased,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1479164113484165">1</xref></sup> thus making early diagnosis and efficient treatment options more necessary. Many patients with a long history of diabetes suffer complications, such as diabetic foot, retinopathy, neuropathy or nephropathy. A small subset of diabetic patients, however, experiences infarctions of the skeletal muscle.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1479164113484165">2</xref></sup> Although the pathogenesis of diabetic muscle infarction is still unclear, it can be surmised that an impairment of local muscular perfusion occurs. Contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) has been developed to accurately visualize changes in the microcirculation of skeletal muscle.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1479164113484165">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1479164113484165">4</xref></sup> The aim of this study was to investigate whether muscular micro-perfusion assessed by CEUS and transient arterial occlusion is reduced in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM-2).</p>

<title>Material and methods</title>
<p>This study was planned as single-centre study and 20 patients with DM-2 (mean age, 58 ± 8.6 years) could be enrolled in this study. Patients were separated into a group with DM-2 &gt;10 years (mean age, 58.2 ± 9.9 years) and a group with DM-2 &lt;10 years (mean age, 57.4 ± 7.4 years); p &gt; 0.05. DM-2 patients with retinopathy were also separated. Also, 20 healthy volunteers (54 ± 5.4 years) were included. Arterial stenoses of the lower limbs were excluded via echo Doppler ultrasound. Mean ankle–brachial index (ABI) of the subjects was 1.0 ± 0.1. None of the patients suffered from macroscopically visible diabetic complications, such as diabetic foot. None of the subjects met exclusion criteria for this study, such as advanced cancer or orthopaedic problems of the lower extremity. Informed written and oral consent was obtained from all subjects. This study was approved by the local review board and was performed according to the Declaration of Helsinki.</p>
<p>A Siemens-Acuson Sequoia 512 ultrasound device with a linear transducer 15L8w (Siemens-Acuson, Mountain View, CA) was employed. The ultrasound examinations were performed by a radiologist with 4 years of experience in the field of musculoskeletal radiology/CEUS (E.A.) together with a medical student (S.W.). A total of 4.8 mL of sulphur hexafluoride (SonoVue<sup>®</sup>) was injected continuously into a cubital vein (1 mL/min). Video clips with a length of 5 min and a frame rate of 1/s were recorded. A 1.75 cm × 5 cm sized region of interest (ROI) was positioned at a depth of 2 cm within the triceps surae muscle. The maximum CEUS signal following the end of transient arterial occlusion (max) was evaluated. The time difference between the end of occlusion and max was termed t<sub>max</sub>. Furthermore, the maximum slope immediately after occlusion (m, slope to max) and the area under the curve after occlusion (AUC<sub>post</sub>) were assessed. Details have been published previously.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1479164113484165">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1479164113484165"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1479164113484165">7</xref></sup> Image analysis was performed in consensus by two experienced radiologists (M.K. and M.-A.W.) each having 12 years of experience in the field of musculoskeletal radiology and CEUS. Both did not participate in CEUS data collection and thus were blinded to the clinical patient data.</p>
<p>An automated occlusion plethysmograph Periquant<sup>®</sup> 803 (Gutmann, Eurasburg, Germany) was used to achieve a reproducible arterial occlusion (i.e. simulation of physical exercise) by inflating a cuff (120–180 s), which was tied around the examined thigh.</p>

<title>Statistics</title>
<p>The derived CEUS parameters of the DM-2 patients and healthy volunteers were evaluated by comparing their mean values, standard deviations and ranges. Student’s t-tests were used to assess the significance of possible differences. The values of p &lt; 0.05 were considered as statistically significant. Normal distribution was proven with the Kolmogorov–Smirnov test. Pearson-product-moment correlation coefficients were computed to assess correlations of CEUS data and clinical data, for the subject group of patients with DM-2 (coefficients &gt; 0.5 or &lt;−0.5 indicate a moderately positive or negative correlation, respectively).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1479164113484165">8</xref></sup> Statistical analyses were performed using SAS software (SAS version 9.2; SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC, USA).</p>

All CEUS values for DM-2 patients with retinopathy were altered compared to DM-2 patients without retinopathy: max, 81.35 ± 49.28 versus 117.88 ± 65.92; m<sub>2</sub>, 7.67 ± 6.02 versus 12.75 ± 9.44; t<sub>max</sub>, 17.60 ± 7.92 versus 15.07 ± 6.12; and AUC<sub>post</sub>, 4249.01 ± 2241.60 versus 5502.06 ± 2957.47.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The influence of DM-2 on muscular micro-perfusion was evaluated with CEUS and transient arterial occlusion. A moderate negative correlation of HbA1c and max was observed. This indicates that elevated HbA1c may be directly associated with a decreased local muscle micro-perfusion. Max and AUC<sub>post</sub> were lower in patients with &gt;10 years duration of DM-2 compared to patients with &lt;10 years duration of DM-2. Max, m and AUC<sub>post</sub> were all decreased in the subject group of DM-2 patients in comparison to the healthy volunteers. However, the differences were not statistically significant. Lacking an accepted gold standard for quantifying muscular micro-perfusion, it still remains unclear whether the CEUS technique is not sensitive enough in visualizing a slightly decreased muscular perfusion in DM-2 patients or whether patients’ muscular perfusion was indeed physiologic.</p>
<p>One limitation of this study is its sample size. Although the findings indicate a slightly reduced muscular micro-perfusion in patients with long-lasting DM-2, further studies with greater sample size are needed to confirm the preliminary results. In future studies, one should focus on including DM-2 patients with secondary complications to uncover potential relations between impaired muscle perfusion and specific secondary microvascular diabetic complications, such as diabetic retinopathy, neuropathy or nephropathy. Additionally, in the absence of a gold standard for measuring muscular micro-perfusion, the study’s findings could not be matched to any benchmark values, which represent another limitation.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the study showed that patients with a long history of DM-2 present with impaired muscular perfusion. CEUS and transient arterial occlusion techniques may represent appropriate methods for the semi-quantitative evaluation of muscular micro-perfusion in patients with DM-2.</p>
