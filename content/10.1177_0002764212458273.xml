<abstract>
<p>Mental health courts represent an opportunity for individuals diagnosed with a mental illness and involved in the criminal justice system to participate in community-based treatment in lieu of incarceration. Individuals who agree to participate also agree to court-ordered mental health treatment that often includes a requirement to take prescribed psychotropic medications. Despite controversies concerning medications’ efficacy and growing evidence of long-term harms, a critical discussion of medications’ role in mental health courts remains absent in the literature. We review current research findings related to psychotropic medications and pose legal and ethical questions of their mandated status in mental health courts. We offer recommendations for mental health courts to adopt evidence-based policies that prioritize participant self-determination in regard to medication-taking and discuss challenges to implementing our recommendations.</p>

<p>Problem-solving courts are an example of a relatively new type of judicial arrangement in which courts demonstrate a philosophy of therapeutic jurisprudence rather than punishment for certain categories of offenders. The stated goal of mental health courts (MHCs), a specific type of problem-solving court, is to divert persons involved in the criminal justice system and diagnosed with a mental illness from jails to community-based mental health treatment. As stated by the cofounder of the concept of therapeutic jurisprudence, the fundamental problem MHCs seek to address is untreated mental illness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0002764212458273">Stefan &amp; Winick, 2005</xref>). This problem is evidenced, in part, by the increasingly visible numbers of homeless mentally ill who are filling jails for nuisance violations and misdemeanors and who are not engaging with the community mental health system, presumably because of either inability to access services or treatment refusal.</p>
<p>MHCs are based on several assumptions related to mental illness and treatment for it: (a) Criminal behavior in persons who are diagnosed with a mental illness is causally related to the mental illness; (b) current treatment options benefit persons diagnosed with mental illness and are effective for alleviating symptoms of mental illness, thereby reducing criminal behavior; (c) coercion is an ethically acceptable and effective tool to assist persons diagnosed with a mental illness to engage with treatment and make progress towards recovery; (d) legal coercion to motivate, persuade, or force persons who do not meet civil commitment criteria to accept treatment services that they may have refused or been unable to obtain is an appropriate use of state power; and (e) the benefits to the individual and society of mandating treatment for mental illness outweigh risks or harms associated with that treatment and deprivations of liberty.</p>
<p>The problem-solving court literature contains focused discussions on some of these assumptions, such as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0002764212458273">Wolff’s (2002)</xref> review of the relatively weak empirical evidence on the causal connection between mental illness and criminal behavior, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0002764212458273">Casey’s (2004)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0002764212458273">Boldt’s (2009)</xref> analyses of legal, ethical, and pragmatic foundations of and problems posed by the use of judicial power to coerce treatment engagement. What remains lacking in the problem-solving court literature, particularly as it relates to MHCs, is a critical evaluation of the assumptions related to the effectiveness and risks of current treatment, namely, psychotropic medication prescribed for mental illness. Our aim is to fill some of this gap through examining the drug-treatment model as it is applied specifically to mental illness in MHCs. We contrast research evidence of drug and nondrug treatment options and discuss court-mandated medication compliance in relation to principles of self-determination and informed choice.</p>

<title>Context of Treatment in MHCs</title>

<title>Medication-Taking Requirements</title>
<p>Arrested individuals with a diagnosed mental illness who are judged competent may be presented with the option to enroll in a mental health court. In all cases, voluntary consent to participate must be obtained, though some critics have questioned how “voluntary” the process truly is (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0002764212458273">Redlich, Hoover, Summers, &amp; Steadman, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0002764212458273">Stefan &amp; Winick, 2005</xref>). As part of the consent and initial enrollment processes, MHC participants are expected to sign a document—variously termed an agreement, a contract, an orientation sheet, or informed consent, among possible expressions—that, with varying degrees of detail, outlines the scope and nature of their MHC participation (for example, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0002764212458273">Redlich et al., 2010</xref>). MHC judges use their judicial authority to mandate that individuals comply with treatment plans, participate in other activities as deemed necessary and appropriate (e.g., employment training or job-seeking, volunteer work, etc.), and attend regular court hearings in front of the judge. Given the prominent role of psychotropic medications as the first-line treatment in the U.S. mental health system, this document is very likely to include a statement that participants must adhere to all prescribed psychotropic medications. The medication-taking requirement is not equivalent to a court order for involuntary administration of medication, and in fact, the consequences for noncompliance across courts are varied and sometimes unclear. For example, among possible consequences, participants who do not adhere to their medication prescriptions may be required to increase the frequency of court hearings, return to jail, or be terminated from the MHC program. Despite the near universality of a medication-taking requirement, a critical discussion about the underlying rationale for this policy in MHCs remains absent in the MHC literature.</p>

<title>Determining Clients’ “Best Interest”</title>
<p>In a 2006 case brought to the Alaska Supreme Court (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0002764212458273"><italic>Myers v. Alaska Psychiatric Institute</italic>, 2006</xref>), the appellant, Faith Myers, had lived with mental illness for over 20 years and in 2001 had stopped taking her prescribed psychotropic medications because she believed the drugs had worsened her condition. In 2003, Myers was involuntarily hospitalized under the state’s civil commitment statute. The treatment team, who insisted that medications were helpful to Myers, sought a court order for involuntary administration of psychotropic medications due to Myers’ refusal to take them. Psychiatrists and other experts supporting Myers’ case testified to the fact that viable alternatives to drug treatment do exist and that drug treatment itself is of dubious efficacy and comes with known risks and problems. The Alaska Supreme Court agreed that psychotropic drugs cannot be viewed as universally beneficial to persons diagnosed with mental illness, holding that “in the absence of emergency, a court may not authorize the state to administer psychotropic drugs to a nonconsenting mental patient unless the court determines that the medication is in the best interests of the patient and that no less intrusive alternative treatment is available” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0002764212458273"><italic>Myers v. Alaska Psychiatric Institute</italic>, 2006</xref>, p. 2). This more restrictive standard of considering a patient’s “best interest,” rather than only a patient’s competence, when making involuntary treatment decisions necessarily involves a careful benefit-to-risk assessment based on scientific evidence.</p>
<p>In the context of individuals who are diverted from the criminal justice system on the condition that they follow a psychiatric treatment plan that in all likelihood mandates adherence to prescribed psychotropic medication, court decisions have not directly spoken. A preponderance of research evidence contradicts the assumption that psychotropic medications are always in clients’ best interest. The present article discusses some the uncertainties and controversies in the scientific literature related to psychotropic drugs and emphasizes the need for critical reevaluation of current benefit-to-risk assessments. MHCs have developed in tandem with commonly accepted societal beliefs about what medications do and their indispensable role in mental health treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0002764212458273">Cohen, McCubbin, Collin, &amp; Perodeau, 2001</xref>). Extensive conflicts of interest, rampant publication bias, and lawsuits against pharmaceutical companies for misleading advertising and hiding drug harms have made it increasingly clear that many of the beliefs about the benefits, effectiveness, and role of psychotropic medications are not based on sound evidence as much as they are based on effective marketing and promotion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0002764212458273">Kesselheim &amp; Avorn, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0002764212458273">Kirsch, Moore, Scoboria, &amp; Nicholls, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0002764212458273">Lacasse &amp; Leo, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0002764212458273">Turner, Matthews, Linardatos, Tell, &amp; Rosenthal, 2008</xref>). Much of the drug information published in medical journals and made available by drug manufacturers through other outlets paints a picture of medications as largely efficacious and minimally harmful; this biased portrait is revealed as such through internal company documents discovered as part of litigation and independent scientific analyses that also include unpublished research data.</p>
<p>Questioning prevailing paradigms of treatment might also prompt some basic questions of MHCs themselves. Would the very foundation on which MHCs are built be irrevocably cracked if as many persons are actually iatrogenically harmed as they are helped by prescribed psychotropic medications? When considering a mandated treatment plan, what role should the medication user have in the negotiation of medication-taking expectations? Do MHC participants have a right to forego psychotropic medications if they agree to other aspects of the court’s treatment plan?</p>
<p>Overreliance on psychotropic medications in the mental health system has ignited criticism against MHCs for functioning as “a coercive agent” comparable to the controversial practice of outpatient commitment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0002764212458273">Seltzer, 2005</xref>). In the present discussion, we go beyond the criticism of simple overreliance on medication by presenting evidence that challenges the perceived necessity of a medication-taking requirement altogether in MHCs. Framed by the principles of self-determination and informed choice, we further pose legal and ethical questions related to medication use in MHCs, offer recommendations for MHCs to adopt evidence-based policies and practices on medication-related issues, and discuss practical challenges to implementing our recommendations.</p>

<title>Examining the Evidence</title>
<sec id="section5-0002764212458273">
<title>How Psychotropic Drugs “Work”</title>
<p>Drug treatment of mental illness, especially in the form of a mandate, is theoretically justified by the premise that psychotropic medications correct a chemical imbalance or some other biological abnormality in the brain that causes mental illness. However, despite promotional messages from pharmaceutical companies and other entities that strongly imply otherwise, there are currently no known physiological or biochemical abnormalities in the brains or bodies of individuals diagnosed with a mental illness, even schizophrenia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0002764212458273">Baughman, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0002764212458273">Lacasse &amp; Leo, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0002764212458273">Nestler &amp; Hyman, 2002</xref>). Although some professional associations (e.g., the American Psychiatric Association) and government organizations (e.g., the National Institute of Mental Health [NIMH]) appear invested in the hypothesis that a putative brain disease underlies mental illness, they simultaneously acknowledge that “no published investigation in the field has determined that any structural or functional brain abnormality is specific to a single psychiatric disorder” (Flaherty, 2006, para. 9). In fact, according to former NIMH director <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0002764212458273">Steven Hyman (1996)</xref>, psychotropic medications actually “create perturbations in neurotransmitter functions,” causing a person’s brain to function in a manner that is “<italic>qualitatively as well as quantitatively different from the normal state</italic>” (emphasis added, p. 161).</p>
<p>An alternative model for understanding how psychotropic medications “work” posits that, as psychoactive substances, these drugs produce a variety of nonspecific physical, psychological, and behavioral effects that some individuals find helpful and desirable, whereas others do not (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0002764212458273">Moncrieff &amp; Cohen, 2009</xref>). For example, antipsychotic medications have general sedative or tranquilizing effects that may be interpreted by the individual user and/or others as helpful in alleviating acute, severe distress, agitation, or aggression. The same individual may interpret this sedative effect as an impediment to long-term progress in daily functioning because of slowed cognition and impaired alertness. The “effectiveness” of a psychotropic medication, then, is not tied to a biological state in which an abnormality or imbalance is corrected, but rather to the subjective consideration of total drug effects in the context of an individual’s complex life. Taking a psychotropic medication for a diagnosed mental illness is thus more similar to taking aspirin for a headache in pursuit of symptom relief than it is to the analogy popularized by the pharmaceutical industry of diabetics taking insulin as part of daily illness management. Whereas the aspirin relieves the acute pain of the headache, it is irrelevant to the multiple possible <italic>reasons</italic> for having the headache in the first place.</p>

<title>Short- and Long-Term Outcomes Associated With Psychotropic Drug Treatment</title>
<p>MHCs typically mandate treatment compliance for a year or longer, with the hope that individuals will continue taking their medications beyond MHC graduation. The assumption underlying this practice is that continued and sometimes indefinite medication use is effective in managing and preventing mental illness. As noted above, psychotropic medication effects do provide some individuals with substantial acute relief from mental or emotional distress (i.e., the “symptoms of mental illness”); however, research shows that response to drug treatment is highly variable and poorly predictable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0002764212458273">Lieberman et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0002764212458273">Perlis et al., 2006</xref>). Even with the experience of short-term relief, evidence is lacking to support the related conclusion that continued medication use improves outcomes over the long term (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0002764212458273">Hughes &amp; Cohen, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0002764212458273">Whitaker, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>As only three examples from recent NIMH-funded investigations—of schizophrenia, major depressive disorder, and bipolar disorder—the largest-ever drug studies emulating real-world clinical conditions each observed <italic>less than one third</italic> of patients to continue on antipsychotics (the CATIE study, ~1,500 patients), or show remission from depression after 12 weeks of treatment (the STAR*D study, ~2,900 patients), or experience no manic or depressive episode during nearly 2 years of treatment (the STEP-BD study, ~1,500 patients). An average 74% of patients in the CATIE study stopped taking their antipsychotic medications before the 18-month study period was complete, mostly due to patient or physician perception that the drug was not working (i.e., lack of efficacy) or that the drug produced intolerable adverse effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0002764212458273">Lieberman et al., 2005</xref>). Most (80%) STAR*D participants who discontinued the study were not in remission at the time of their exit, despite either initial or continued antidepressant treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0002764212458273">Rush et al., 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Drug inefficacy and intolerable adverse effects are common in drug research and are particularly salient in studies that examine outcomes beyond the typical 4- to 8-week, highly controlled trials conducted by drug manufacturers seeking to obtain Food and Drug Administration (FDA) drug approval. A decade-long string of large settlements and fines against pharmaceutical companies (the most recent a $1.2 billion fine against Johnson &amp; Johnson for concealing dangers of the antipsychotic Risperdal) has brought to public attention the fact that benefit-to-risk assessments that provide the underlying rationale for present-day prescription practices and payment and reimbursement schemes are based on incomplete, selectively reported data from drug companies that consistently exaggerate claims of efficacy and minimize known harms (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0002764212458273">Table 1</xref>).</p>

<p>In addition to new information on harms revealed as part of litigation, recent independent evidence from respected neuroscientist Nancy Andreason further demonstrates measurable harm to the brain from continued antipsychotic medication use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0002764212458273">Beng-Choo, Andreason, Zieball, Pierson, &amp; Magnotta, 2011</xref>). Using a large cohort of diagnosed with schizophrenia patients in a longitudinal neuroimaging study, Andreason and colleagues sought to identify the causes of progressive brain volume reduction long associated with schizophrenia. Antipsychotic medication, and not the duration or severity of schizophrenia, was found to exert a measurable influence on brain tissue loss, with some individuals losing up to 1% of their brain tissue each year they remained on the drug. As important new information on previously unknown or hidden harms comes to light through litigation and research evidence, conclusions about the relative benefits versus risks of psychotropic drugs should be carefully reevaluated.</p>
<p>Finally, much of the research literature that claims to demonstrate that psychotropic medications prevent illness relapse are in the form of drug discontinuation studies in which some participants might actually experience withdrawal effects, misinterpreted as illness relapse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0002764212458273">Black, Shea, Dursan, &amp; Kutcher, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0002764212458273">Moncrieff, 2006a</xref>). Withdrawal effects may last for days, weeks, or even months, and often include adverse physical effects, such as dizziness, headache, fatigue, shock-like sensations to the head, and nausea, as well as adverse psychological and behavioral effects, such as irritability, agitation, anxiety, despair, confusion, mania, and suicidal ideation. Certain combinations of these effects mimic symptoms of some mental illness diagnoses and in the clinical setting might be confused with illness relapse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0002764212458273">Lejoyeux &amp; Ades, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0002764212458273">Moncrieff, 2006b</xref>). Aside from possible withdrawal effects, since psychotropic medications “work” by providing relief from distressing symptoms, it is not unexpected that the original expressions of mental and emotional distress subdued by medications would still be present upon stopping the drug.</p>

<title>Alternatives to the Drug-Treatment Model</title>
<p>Psychotropic medications are the cornerstone of modern mental health treatment as practiced in the United States, and some people find that medications provide them substantial relief from their suffering. On the other hand, evidence pertaining to a variety of non-drug-based models of care show them to be viable—and potentially less harmful—options for achieving long-term positive outcomes. In fact, especially over the long term, individuals who decide to take medications tend to have poorer outcomes in terms of symptom relief and social role functioning when compared to individuals who engage with alternative interventions and who avoid medication use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0002764212458273">De Girolamo, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0002764212458273">Harrow &amp; Jobe, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0002764212458273">Whitaker, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>The classic Soteria model, for example, provides persons experiencing acute psychosis a homelike psychosocial alternative to hospitalization and drug treatment through the use of an intensive interpersonal approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0002764212458273">Matthews, Roper, Mosher, &amp; Menn, 1979</xref>). An early outcomes study found that Soteria participants had a 20% better chance of not being rehospitalized compared to initially hospitalized and primarily drug-treated patients at nearly every assessment point over a 24-month period. More recent applications of the Soteria model have also found equivalent or superior outcomes when compared to traditional hospitalization and medication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0002764212458273">Fenton, Mosher, Herrell, &amp; Blyler, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0002764212458273">Lloyd-Evans, Slade, Jagielska, &amp; Johnson, 2009</xref>). In a 5-year study of the Open Dialogue approach for treating psychosis—a psychotherapeutic intervention operating within patients’ own personal support systems—fewer than one third of the 75 participants used antipsychotic medication in any phase of the study period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0002764212458273">Seikkula et al., 2006</xref>). Despite the fact that very few participants were taking medication at the final 5-year assessment, approximately 80% of patients had no residual psychotic symptoms, over 70% had returned to work or school, and less than one quarter were living on disability allowances. Such extraordinary outcomes are unmatched in the research literature evaluating drug-based models of treatment, in which only 10% to 50% of patients achieve sustained positive outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0002764212458273">Cuyun Carter, Milton, Ascher-Svanum, &amp; Faries, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0002764212458273">Hegarty, Baldessarini, Tohen, Waternaux, &amp; Oepen, 1994</xref>; Hughes &amp; Cohen, 2010).</p>
<p>In sum, research evidence does not support the assumption that psychotropic medications universally benefit persons diagnosed with a mental illness. Although psychotropic medications might provide short-term relief from human distress and suffering, no drug comes without risk. A growing body of evidence is illuminating a benefit-to-risk ratio for prescribed psychotropic medications that exaggerates the scope and scale of benefits while minimizing the risks and harms. Continuing to uphold policies and practices that are not congruent with the <italic>unbiased</italic> sources of evidence we currently have available puts us at risk of trading one public health concern for another. Reduced use of jails today—because of forced compliance with medications to subdue mental and emotional distress—might result in increased use of health care services down the road, the services needed to treat drug-induced illnesses (e.g., diabetes, movement disorders, heart problems, liver damage) among a population of persons also experiencing progressively declining cognitive capacity.</p>

<title>Right to Refuse Medication in Other Contexts</title>
<p>In every U.S. state, persons who are deemed to be a danger to self or others and/or at risk of becoming gravely disabled may be subject to involuntary detention and possibly involuntary psychotropic drug treatment. The courts have, however, consistently upheld the right of involuntary mental patients (in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0002764212458273"><italic>Rennie v. Klein</italic>, 1981</xref>; and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0002764212458273"><italic>Rogers v. Okin</italic>, 1984</xref>) and mentally ill inmates or pretrial detainees (in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0002764212458273"><italic>Washington v. Harper</italic>, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0002764212458273"><italic>Riggins v. Nevada</italic>, 1992</xref>; and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0002764212458273"><italic>Sell v. United States</italic>, 2003</xref>) to refuse unwanted psychotropic medications in the absence of a life-threatening emergency. Most recently, the Alaska Supreme Court (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0002764212458273"><italic>Myers v. Alaska Psychiatric Institute</italic>, 2006</xref>) held that the court cannot impose involuntary medication unless it can be demonstrated by evidence to be in the patient’s best interest. In forming their opinions, judges in these cases acknowledged the serious adverse effects posed by psychotropic medications and the liberty issues presented by the forced ingestion of a mind-altering substance. The right of patients and inmates to refuse medications is far from absolute, but specific criteria must be satisfied to establish overriding justification for forced administration.</p>
<p>MHC participants must be deemed competent and not a danger to self or others to meet enrollment requirements. Whereas treatment with psychotropic medications is not forced in this context, as it might be with involuntary detention in a psychiatric hospital, a medication-taking requirement can be a coercive element that may be interpreted by clients as equivalent to involuntary use. MHCs should consider whether their court clients maintain the same rights as institutionalized patients and inmates to avoid psychotropic medication use in all but emergency circumstances. As the Alaska Supreme Court decision in <italic>Myers</italic> suggests, the “best interest” of the patient/client does not necessarily lead to medication-taking.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0002764212458273">
<title>Informed Consent</title>
<p>The principle and process of informed consent—providing sufficient information to clients/patients so that they are able to make a rational decision in their best interest—is well established in many health care settings. With reference to medication use for MHC participants, at least two parts of that process can be problematic: the core provision of sufficient information to make an informed decision, and that the decision be voluntary. First, how much information about treatments and possible alternatives is <italic>sufficient</italic> to enable individuals to make a rational decision is an unresolved issue. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0002764212458273">Beahrs and Gutheil (2001)</xref> frame it by offering, “Clients should be informed about the relative efficacy, efficiency, and safety of the recommended treatment and its primary alternatives as well as the likely consequences of no treatment” (p. 8). For mental health treatment generally, “the amount and precise details of the information to be disclosed are determined by what a reasonable person would find material to a decision” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0002764212458273">Appelbaum &amp; Grisso, 1995</xref>, p. 106). In the case of psychotropic medications, it is especially unclear how the standard of <italic>sufficient information for an informed decision</italic> can be achieved when the efficacy of psychotropic medications is still being debated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0002764212458273">Kirsch et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0002764212458273">Turner et al., 2008</xref>). Related to possible drug harms, what information is <italic>material</italic> to making an informed decision on medication use? Should court-associated treatment providers inform participants of only common effects; the most serious possible adverse effects; long-term harms and risks; or all possible effects regardless of incidence, severity, and possible timing? Should persons expected to remain indefinitely on antipsychotic medications be informed of recent findings on brain tissue loss associated with long-term use of these drugs?</p>
<p>Second, while courts have defined involuntary medication use, less clarity exists on what makes the administration of medication <italic>voluntary</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0002764212458273">Griffith, Appelbaum, Giorgi-Guarnieri, &amp; Coleman, 2003</xref>). Specifically, is <italic>voluntary</italic> use based simply on the act of not refusing medication or rather on the individual making an informed and knowing decision about medication use? In <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0002764212458273"><italic>Benson v. Terhune</italic> (2002)</xref>, a prison inmate, Benson, argued that psychotropic medications were administered to her involuntarily on the basis that she was not given information on the potential side effects and harms of the drugs sufficient to make an informed decision. Benson further argued that she was in an intimidating setting with coercive gestures on the part of jail staff. The court affirmed that inmates and pretrial detainees have a right to information about psychotropic medications. In this particular case, though, the court found that Benson was already educated and experienced in regards to psychotropic medications and was competent to ask for additional information about administered medications if she so desired. The court also ruled that the jail setting alone is not sufficient to establish unconstitutional coercion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0002764212458273">Noroian &amp; Pinals, 2003</xref>). Although the Ninth Circuit in <italic>Benson v. Terhune</italic> found against Benson’s claim of involuntary administration of medications while in jail, the court also held that “an uninformed acceptance of or failure to refuse psychotropic medication does not preclude a finding of involuntariness” (p. 258). Whereas the inherently coercive nature of MHCs, similar to the jail setting in the <italic>Benson</italic> case, may not count as unconstitutional coercion according to the court, MHCs are left with the ethical question of the extent to which voluntary decision making is possible for those with the least power in the revised judicial process embraced by MHCs.</p>

<sec id="section11-0002764212458273">
<title>Principles of Recovery in Mental Health Treatment</title>
<p>Stated goals of MHCs include improving treatment engagement and the quality of life of participants, while a related assumption is that coercion imposed by the court is an acceptable and effective tool to achieve this (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0002764212458273">Thompson, Osher, &amp; Tomasini-Joshi, 2008</xref>). A review of the empirical literature on involuntary outpatient commitment, which also uses the court to mandate treatment compliance, concluded that “there is no evidence that a court order is necessary to achieve compliance and good outcomes, or that a court order, in and of itself, has any independent effect on outcomes” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0002764212458273">Ridgley, Borum, &amp; Petrila, 2001</xref>, p. 27). Additionally, the mental health recovery literature consistently prioritizes choice and self-determination as keys to meeting treatment engagement and recovery objectives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0002764212458273">Onken, Dumont, Ridgway, Dornan, &amp; Ralph, 2002</xref>). Participants in a national study of consumer perspectives on recovery described feeling “hindered by coerced consent forms, court mandated services and forced medication, . . . forced treatment hinders persons’ ability to value or find meaning in services on their own and thus impedes their recovery” (p. 35). Greater self-determination in creating a treatment plan increases treatment engagement and empowers individuals to assume responsibility over their own treatment and recovery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0002764212458273">Corrigan, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>Specific to MHCs, research shows that participants’ perceived levels of voluntariness and coercion, as well as their comprehension of what participation in MHC involves, can impact their success or failure in the court, including compliance with court orders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0002764212458273">Redlich, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0002764212458273">Redlich et al., 2010</xref>). A recent meta-analysis of 18 outcome studies of MHCs across the nation revealed that a “considerable portion” of MHC participants are deemed noncompliant and terminated from the program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0002764212458273">Sarteschi, Vaughn, &amp; Kim, 2011</xref>). In one case, 60% of 368 participants were either terminated due to noncompliance, chose to end their involvement with the MHC, or were transferred to another problem-solving court. In a second case, one-third of 265 participants were terminated because of noncompliance with the program. However, no studies clearly explained why participants were terminated or what exactly was meant by “noncompliance.” As noted in the examination of evidence above, medication discontinuation in drug research occurs frequently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0002764212458273">Lieberman et al., 2005</xref>). Individuals commonly choose not to take a medication due to lack of efficacy or intolerable adverse effects, but also for a variety of other reasons, such as poor treatment alliance, social network problems, or personal values that resist certain forms of care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0002764212458273">Carpenter, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0002764212458273">Wales &amp; Hiday, 2006</xref>). If medication-taking is a requirement of MHCs, then it is possible that this standard pattern of drug discontinuation might be interpreted as program noncompliance in that context.</p>
<p>Finding ways to increase participants’ choice and self-determination in negotiating the terms and requirements of their MHC participation may increase their “buy-in” and decrease perceived levels of coercion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0002764212458273">Winick 2003</xref>). Empowerment in making medication-related decisions, including the choice to abstain from medication use, may ultimately improve program “compliance” and contribute to successful outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0002764212458273">Wilder, Elbogen, Moser, Swanson, &amp; Swartz, 2010</xref>). The question remains, however, whether the very notion of self-determination is tenable in the inherently coercive context of MHCs, particularly if medication-taking remains an enrollment requirement.</p>

<title>Recommendations</title>
<sec id="section13-0002764212458273">
<title>Medication-Taking Policies in MHCs</title>
<p>A growing body of evidence challenges many commonly held beliefs about the uses and effects of psychotropic medications in alleviating mental and emotional distress. Popular but unsubstantiated certainties, such as that medications correct biological abnormalities and are a requisite component of mental health treatment, form the basis for MHC policies that require adherence to a prescribed medication regimen. In light of the evidence reviewed in this article as well as the rights of patients and inmates in other contexts to refuse unwanted medications, MHCs should reexamine their medication-taking requirements and consider policies that are better aligned with recovery principles. A reasonable course of action might be to offer medications as a choice among other treatments that the participant may agree to engage with, and to allow MHC participants a voice in medication-related decisions. The subjective experience of the consumer of a psychotropic medication should be at the center of benefit-to-risk evaluations and resulting treatment decisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0002764212458273">Jacobs &amp; Cohen, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0002764212458273">Longhofer, Floersch, &amp; Jenkins, 2003</xref>). Medications may be a preferred treatment strategy for some persons in certain contexts who seek relief for particular distresses, but should not be uniformly mandated as a first-line or primary form of treatment. We thus suggest the following language be included in MHC agreements or contracts for enrollment:
<disp-quote>
<p>The MHC respects your right to make decisions regarding psychotropic medication treatment, including your right to abstain from using unwanted psychotropic medications. Your treatment provider will review with you the possible benefits and risks of each recommended psychotropic medication, as well as benefits and risks of possible alternative treatments, so that you may make an informed treatment decision. At any time during your participation in the MHC, you should inform the treatment provider of any problems, concerns, or preferences regarding your medications. You will not be sanctioned for your medication preferences or medication refusal but should communicate any medication-related issues immediately so that your actions are not interpreted as noncompliance with the program.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Given the option, it is unknown how many MHC participants would invoke the right to complete medication abstinence. Empirical research on Psychiatric Advance Directives (discussed below) shows that very few individuals use the document to refuse all medications, and instead both consent to and refuse an average of one to three specific medications along with providing cogent explanations for their preferences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0002764212458273">Elbogen et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0002764212458273">Wilder et al., 2010</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-0002764212458273">
<title>Informed Consent</title>
<p>Development of a standard for informed consent concerning psychotropic medications is problematic given current controversies surrounding the efficacy of medications and considerable uncertainty regarding their contribution to positive long-term outcomes. We recommend that voluntary medication use be based on a high standard of knowing and informed consent, rather than simple absence of refusal, and that MHC participants be accorded the same or similar rights of informed consent as they would receive in hospital or jail settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0002764212458273">Noroian &amp; Pinals, 2003</xref>). MHC agreements should incorporate enough information about risks and benefits of any proposed medications to allow the participant to make a truly informed decision. Importantly, this information should accurately reflect current knowledge regarding psychotropic medication use and effects. Given the existing evidence base, this requires informing participants of drug risks that professionals may hesitate to share for fear that participants will not agree to take those medications. Possible medication abstinence, however, is not a convincing rationale for withholding information on drug harms and risks from patients. As <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0002764212458273">Table 1</xref> suggests, the pharmaceutical industry is drawing public criticism and legal sanctions for withholding information, and this should be a clear warning about the loss of professional and institutional credibility and legitimacy at stake. To counter accusations of serving as an additional coercive agent in the mental health system, MHCs should adopt policies and practices that support full and accurate disclosure of the evidence relating to the treatments under mandate.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-0002764212458273">
<title>Psychiatric Advance Directives</title>
<p>Another option for supporting the self-determination and empowerment of MHC participants involves the use of Psychiatric Advance Directives (PADs)—a legal tool allowing competent individuals to make advance mental health treatment decisions (including medication preferences or abstinence) for later occasions when they may be deemed incompetent to make such decisions. PADs can enable professionals to quickly identify the appropriate preauthorized treatments that might de-escalate a crisis situation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0002764212458273">Srebnik &amp; Brodoff, 2003</xref>), and can allow, if authorized in the PAD, earlier intervention into situations that may not yet have escalated to the point of legal involuntary detention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0002764212458273">Atkinson, Garner, &amp; Gilmour, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0002764212458273">Ritchie, Sklar, &amp; Steiner, 1998</xref>). Approximately half of U.S. states have authorized PADs, either in statute or as amendments to existing health care legislation, though nearly all states permit advance directives for health care, parts of which may be used for psychiatric treatments.</p>
<p>Few mental health consumers have completed a PAD, though many, particularly those who have previously experienced coercion or force, express an interest in completing one if provided assistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0002764212458273">Swanson, Van McCrary, Swartz, Elbogen, &amp; Van Dorn, 2006</xref>). In one example of a facilitated PAD intervention, 125 participants with a diagnosis that included psychotic behavior and who were receiving community-based treatment were assisted in completing a PAD by trained facilitators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0002764212458273">Elbogen et al., 2007</xref>). No participant used the PAD to refuse all psychotropic medications, and most specified at least one medication that they consented to and one that they refused. Participants also used the PAD to explain their preferences, such as their desire to refuse a specific antipsychotic drug because of side effects experienced with it in the past, and to offer additional instructions for their care, such as strategies to reduce or avoid the use of seclusion and restraint. In this study, being African American was the strongest predictor of perceived self-determination 12 months after completion of the PAD, suggesting that PADs may be an effective tool to promote empowerment particularly among members of traditionally disenfranchised groups.</p>
<p>The value of PADs has been limited, in part, due to the lack of assistance in completing the document, poor coordination among consumers and public agencies about using the document, and the overriding authority of treatment professionals to disregard PAD instructions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0002764212458273">Swanson, Swartz, Ferron, Elbogen, &amp; Van Dorn, 2006</xref>). MHCs are well positioned to overcome these challenges through the existing structure of the court. As part of standard practice, every MHC client could be assisted in completing a PAD that outlines their preferences for future care in the event that they decompensate to the point of crisis or near-crisis. Assistance in completing a PAD should be provided by a person who is not directly invested in a particular form of treatment but rather is invested in faithfully representing clients’ preferences. As MHCs are increasingly incorporating the use of peer mentors, they might provide this type of assistance. In their roles as social service coordinators, MHC personnel can ensure that relevant providers are aware of the PAD document and how to access it appropriately.</p>

<title>Challenges</title>
<sec id="section17-0002764212458273">
<title>The Drug-Based Paradigm of Care</title>
<p>Today’s prevailing drug-treatment model is attractive for judges and other MHC personnel because it offers a simple solution to complex individual and social problems—use the courts to keep people on their medications, which are known to be good for them. The central assumption of this simple solution is that persons diagnosed with a mental illness <italic>need</italic> medications and that the largest obstacle to improving the plight of the mentally ill is medication compliance. The fundamental problem to this line of thinking is that medications are not universally helpful and are actually harmful for some people. Furthermore, as demonstrated in large federally sponsored drug studies, as well as most other drug research, high rates of medication discontinuation, is overwhelmingly due to drug inefficacy, intolerable adverse effects, or other cogent reasons.</p>
<p>Thorough discussion of the evidence related to one particular form of treatment should not undermine optimism that persons experiencing mental and emotional distress can be helped. A variety of non-drug-based treatment options <italic>do</italic> exist, though none have received the equivalent political attention and financial investment that psychotropic medications have benefited from. When asked about the policy implications of the finding of progressive brain volume reduction with long-term antipsychotic use, Andreason offered a reasonable best practice standard: “These drugs have to be used at the lowest possible dose, which often doesn’t happen now. There’s huge economic pressure to medicate patients very rapidly . . . [and] whatever medications we use need to be combined with more nonmedication-oriented treatments, like cognitive or social therapies” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0002764212458273">Dreifus, 2008</xref>, para. 11).</p>
<p>Despite the challenge this might seem to present, current beliefs about the effectiveness of modern drug treatment deserve careful, critical reevaluation. Some critics of MHCs argue that the problem this specialty court was created to address is a failing mental health system that the executive and legislative branches of government have been unable or unwilling to bring creative solutions to (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0002764212458273">Stefan &amp; Winick, 2005</xref>). Through their participation in mental health courts, judges have accepted new roles as social service coordinators, treatment team leaders, problem-solvers, and, in some cases, social activists. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0002764212458273">Winick (2003)</xref> offers a description of judges who “become advocates for the populations they deal with and for the increased allocation of community resources needed to resolve their problems . . . (and) they work closely with community agencies and treatment providers, and, in the process, monitor and improve their effectiveness” (p. 3). Valid concerns against such expansion of the traditional judicial role also deserve open debate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0002764212458273">Boldt, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0002764212458273">Casey, 2004</xref>). Although it might be true that “the traditional judicial model addressed the symptoms, but not the underlying problem” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0002764212458273">Winick, 2003</xref>, p .3) of substance abuse, mental illness, and so on, one can question whether solving underlying social problems is the appropriate task for the judiciary. For judges committed to the philosophy inherent in MHCs, increasing the availability of meaningful treatment options presents a genuine opportunity to promote a paradigm of care that champions individual recovery and social progress. Rather than using the power of the court to coerce or persuade individuals to comply with a narrowly focused practice standard of first line drug treatment, it may be time to reexamine these standard models of care, and shift resources towards increasing the number of meaningful treatment options with which more individuals might genuinely <italic>choose</italic> to engage.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section18-0002764212458273">
<title>Institutional Culture</title>
<p>The judicial philosophy of therapeutic jurisprudence brings with it a new institutional culture that claims to value collaboration, empathy, and respect for autonomy and voluntary decision making (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0002764212458273">Winick, 2003</xref>). Paternalism in many forms is a fixture in the history of care for persons diagnosed with a mental illness, and MHCs are unlikely to be an exception to this rule. Even PADs, embraced by many as an innovative tool for client empowerment and self-determination, have been criticized by consumer groups and scholars as only a token gesture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0002764212458273">Swanson, Van McCrary, et al., 2006</xref>). Although PADs are legal documents completed while an individual is competent, in practice PAD instructions can be easily overridden by treatment providers. What does it mean, then, to profess to value collaboration, autonomy, and voluntariness in MHCs? If self-determination and informed choice are keys to treatment engagement and the recovery process, then what would need to change in the institutional and professional culture of MHCs to prioritize those values in meaningful ways? MHC participants may understandably be suspicious and uncertain of the extent to which their medication preferences, especially if those preferences include abstinence, will be supported within the court and treatment team. An institutional culture that values self-determination, in practice, might take steps to ensure that, for example, PADs are consistently completed, utilized in crisis situations, and that the preferences described in PADs are upheld by all concerned. Evidence suggests that psychiatrists’ attitudes, both positive and negative, affect the preparation, implementation, and adherence to PADs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0002764212458273">Van Dorn et al., 2006</xref>), which makes it essential that all professionals interacting with the MHC share this vision.</p>
<p>Additionally, we suggest that thorough discussion about what is known and what remains unknown regarding psychotropic medications is one way to reassess the purpose of medications as well as expectations for medication-taking. Incorporating accurate information and open discussion can provide the foundation for a culture that supports the values of informed consent and self-determination.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section19-0002764212458273">
<title>Financial Implications</title>
<p>Full and ongoing medication compliance is an unrealistic expectation because both empirical evidence and practical experience show that, for a variety of reasons, most people will stop taking their prescribed psychotropic medication at some point. Emphasizing medication compliance as a primary means to reduce relapse and recidivism will, therefore, inevitably lead to high rates of failures. Alternatively, an approach emphasizing self-determination and informed choice in medication-taking may reduce unnecessary failures by not placing unrealistic expectations on participants and by allowing participants to more fully take control of their treatment engagement. An approach thus aligned with research evidence and recovery principles might prove more likely to advance the ultimate MHC goal of reduced future incarcerations, which drives the cost-effectiveness of problem-solving courts.</p>
<p>For many participants of MHCs, psychotropic drugs will be prescribed for an indefinite period of time, perhaps even for the life of the individual. Nondrug treatment options, such as the open dialogue approach, cognitive behavioral therapy, and home-like respite, might require greater initial intensity of effort, but include a point of termination (a few weeks to several years, depending on the seriousness of clients’ problems) that makes these alternatives potentially more cost effective in the long term. Even in the short term, residential alternatives to hospitalization have been found to produce a 44% cost savings per acute treatment episode (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0002764212458273">Fenton, Hoch, Herrell, Mosher, &amp; Dixon, 2002</xref>). Furthermore, drug-treated cohorts of patients experience greater illness chronicity, more relapses, less improvement in social role functioning, and greater reliance on government assistance programs than do patient cohorts who were treated prior to the modern drug treatment era or who were treated with nondrug alternatives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0002764212458273">De Girolamo, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0002764212458273">Whitaker, 2010</xref>). Any intervention that reduces the use of hospitals and jails saves money; nondrug treatments produce equivalent or superior results compared to drug treatment, even in the short term but especially over the long term.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Empirical research on the issues we have raised here is essential. MHCs could examine the effect of the recommended medication-taking policy changes on process variables, such as perceived levels of coercion and treatment engagement. Also of interest is research on how variations in the type and specificity of information provided during informed consent affects consent to and/or refusal of medications. Ongoing discussion about how much and what kind of information about medication effects and other options is sufficient to permit truly <italic>informed</italic> consent may also be helpful in developing better standards of practice that accurately represent the current state of knowledge.</p>
<p>A sea change in public attitudes towards drug-based treatment models may be on the horizon as popular media outlets publicize the extent to which the pharmaceutical industry has influenced commonly held medication-related beliefs, such as the notion that drugs correct a chemical imbalance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0002764212458273">Begley, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0002764212458273">Spiegel, 2012</xref>), and other scientific controversies surrounding drug research and marketing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0002764212458273">Angell, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0002764212458273">Lacasse &amp; Leo, 2006</xref>). In this article, we reviewed some of the uncertainties associated with psychotropic drug treatment and then posed a number of ethical questions related to mandated medication use in MHCs. Though certainly many more questions are left to be asked and answered, we hope the recommendations we offer for prioritizing self-determination and informed choice point the direction for a system of care that is genuinely invested in individual recovery and social reform. At the very least, maintaining a medication-taking requirement should prompt questions for MHC personnel to grapple with and discuss in the context of their own court settings. For example, if taking a psychotropic medication is an explicit requirement of court participation, is a decision or request to abstain from psychotropic medications grounds for ineligibility or termination? How can principles of self-determination and informed choice be meaningfully translated into practice in the context of the MHC? By what standard is medication-taking “voluntary” when it is under court mandate, and what role should medication users have in negotiating these expectations? The answers to these and other questions raised in this article are likely to impact the ultimate value of MHCs in the mental health and criminal justice systems as well as the success of clients who participate in this specialty court program.</p>
