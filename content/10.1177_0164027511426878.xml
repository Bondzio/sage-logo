<abstract>
<p>The purpose of this article is to challenge the congruity of dramaturgical metaphors, especially in the mask-of-aging thesis among older actors, and to explore what these metaphors represent for them late in their careers. The case study is a group of veteran actors in the Israeli theater who subscribe to the Method acting approach. In-depth interviews were conducted from 2007 to 2009 with 22 such actors, aged 62 to 95 years, on the topic of their acting profession. The data suggest that actors make no distinction between performative self and interior self in their attempts to define their selves. In contrast to theory, the actors’ work abets a reversed structure of the self in the acting arena. An actor or actress experiences a correspondence between the mask (“front stage”) and the way in which he or she talks to himself or herself (“back stage”). The author discusses the importance of the performing self for self-esteem under contemporaneous social circumstances.</p>

<body>
<p>Gerontological theory uses dramaturgical metaphors to describe and predict the construction of the self in old age. Generally, it presupposes a clear distinction between “front stage” (aging body and functioning) and an authentic, younger, and defensive “back stage” in the self (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0164027511426878">Biggs, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0164027511426878">Featherstone &amp; Hepworth, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0164027511426878">Jung, 1967</xref>). In this article, I examine this theoretical construct, which may have important implications for the sense of well-being and self-esteem, on the basis of veteran stage actors. My findings suggest that veteran actors make no distinction between performative self and interior self in their attempts to define their selves. By contrasting this self-concept in the professional theater—an arena that elicits dramaturgical metaphors—with the construct in gerontological theory mentioned above, my analysis challenges the assumed congruity of the theoretical outlook and the self-concept of veteran stage actors. Then, on this basis, I propose an alternative conception of the self that may be more valuable for those of old age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0164027511426878">Cruikshank, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0164027511426878">Hooyman &amp; Kiyak, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0164027511426878">Moody, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>By “veteran actors,” I mean those who have passed the age of 65 years (or have passed retirement age in Western countries) and still perform on stage. Actors of this age are susceptible, to differing degrees but by necessity, to the categorization of being “old.” In contemporaneous Western societies, “old people” is one of the most labeled and excluded social categories that exist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0164027511426878">Palmore, 1991</xref>). Because of ageist stereotypes, one may expect the representation of the elderly in the theater to be relatively easy to identify. Indeed, elderly characters often appear unkempt, ludicrous, stooped, and/or functionally disabled. As one would expect, this situation challenges veteran actors and sharpens the question of their self-identities.</p>
<p>One central ideology in the professional theater, especially for the generation of veteran actors, is Stanislavsky’s Method acting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0164027511426878">1961</xref>). This method, developed in New York by Lee Strasberg, became the “preeminent acting style of Americans” in the 1950s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0164027511426878">Vineberg, 1991</xref>, pp. 5-6). “The Method,” as its proponents like to call it, places a high premium on the expression of genuine emotion, identifies the actor’s own personality as the mine from which all psychological truth must be dug, and demands an almost religious devotion on the actor’s part, on the basis of the power of truth in acting (see review in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0164027511426878">Bandelj, 2003</xref>). The advantage of Method acting for a general discussion of self-concept is that it is geared to blurring the gaps between acting and real life and between the acting self and the self of the character being played, which could be any nonacting member of the culture. Ironically, the optimum application of the Method would lead to a situation of the self as it is: a situation typical of each of us.</p>
<p>The analytical problem at the focus of this article is a paradox that traces, at the professional level, to Method acting: The entire justification of Method acting rests on the assumption that there is an ab initio role distance between the actor’s self and the character being performed. That is, the actor never <italic>is</italic> the character; he or she has to work to embody the character’s properties successfully. Role distance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0164027511426878">Goffman (1961)</xref>, explains, is a mechanism that individuals use to remedy, downplay, or deny what they perceive to be a faulty, strange, or otherwise inappropriate self while in a role before a particular audience. What this paradox means is that actors should apply an acting method that requires them first to distance themselves from, and then to internalize, a character even when they portray their own characteristics as elderly people. Thus, an 80-year-old actor who plays a 75-year-old character should work on the character’s traits as though unaccustomed to the role of someone who is old. Accordingly, the research questions are, What is the significance of the ex ante self-distancing from a character and the ex post internalizing of the same character for the actor’s identity? What do these strategies do to the distinction between the mask and the actor’s self? The probable outcome is that actors who continue to perform in old age are influenced by a process that abets the formation of a specific self-identity in old age. Below, I discuss this paradox and its ramifications for the self and its well-being in view of gerontological theories that purport to represent veteran actors as well.</p>
<sec id="section1-0164027511426878">
<title>Theoretical Use of Dramaturgical Metaphors: A Brief Review</title>
<p>Salient dramaturgical metaphors in gerontological theories are “role,” “performance,” “drama,” “mask,” “impersonation,” “stage,” “back stage,” and “social actors” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0164027511426878">Kaminsky, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0164027511426878">Kastenbaum, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0164027511426878">Myerhoff, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0164027511426878">Turner, 1990</xref>). According to some theories, the meanings imparted to these metaphors are inspired by the debate surrounding postmodernism in the sense that postmodernism makes allowances for multiple identities and multiple opportunities to choose one’s self, and from the dramaturgical metaphor of this situation. (An eminent example is <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0164027511426878">Melucci’s [1996]</xref> <italic>The Playing Self</italic>.) An important conclusion to draw from this is that to understand old age, we need to examine relations between social actors and their audiences, which include traditional audiences as in the theater, and the culture at large (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0164027511426878">Basting, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>The most familiar account of the use of dramaturgical metaphor, and the most influential one in postmodern gerontology, is the mask-of-aging thesis. The argument is that as one ages, the distance between the body—the “mask of aging”—and the inner self widens. The aging body becomes a cage from which a younger self-identity cannot escape. As aging accelerates, the body loses its flexibility and thereby fails to serve as a platform that can accommodate the wide variety of identities that exists. Old men and women engage in combat between the desire to express themselves and their aging bodies. The mask emerges as a contradiction between the fixedness of the body and the fluidity of social images (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0164027511426878">Featherstone &amp; Hepworth, 1991</xref>).</p>
<p>This thesis draws its inspiration from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0164027511426878">Jung’s (1967)</xref> metaphor of the persona:
<disp-quote><p>The persona is a complicated system of relations between individual consciousness and society, fittingly enough, a kind of mask, designated on the one hand to make a definite impression upon others and on the other to conceal the true nature of the individual. (p. 158)</p></disp-quote>
</p>
<p>The persona thesis, like the persona metaphor—both of which distinguish between depth and surface—captures the theatrical dichotomy of front stage and back stage. Similarly, as I will show, the “masquerade” is considered an arbitrator between the inner and outer logics of adult aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0164027511426878">Biggs, 1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0164027511426878">2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0164027511426878">Woodward, 1995</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section3-0164027511426878">
<title>The Research Setting</title>
<p>This article is based on anthropological research that focused on two theaters in Israel. The findings were gathered from 2007 to 2009 (the first phase) and in 2010 and 2011 (the second phase). The data, including documentation of the analysis, are kept in a large and accessible database.</p>
<p>In the first phase, 22 actors aged 62 to 95 years (average age = 77 years), two thirds men and the rest women, were interviewed. The management of one theater helped put me in touch with the first respondents. They referred me to additional ones in a snowball process that continued until I considered the findings sufficiently copious and supportive of the insights that the interviews yielded. What I wanted at this phase was to obtain a historical, artistic, and cultural picture of the theater from the perspective of veteran actors’ personal stories. The interviews established intimate familiarity with the respondents, a necessity for the continuation of the research. They also helped me obtain permission to conduct intensive participant-observation in the second stage. These interviews, part of a more comprehensive ethnological endeavor in different theatrical settings, account for most of the data in this article.</p>
<p>In the second phase (2010 to 2011), I observed rehearsals of one play and tracked the actors’ work for 8 months, from the 1st working encounter to the 10th public performance of the play. The intergenerational cast of the play included five veteran actors (aged 65 to 80 years), two of whom had been interviewed in the first stage of the study, and three younger ones (aged 30 to 35 years). This phase of the research yielded information from an additional source, the actors’ actual work. The small portion of this information that follows will attest, by triangulation, to the validity of the findings and the conclusions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0164027511426878">Denzin &amp; Lincoln, 2000</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0164027511426878">
<title>The Interviews</title>
<p>I conducted in-depth interviews and attended, as an observer, several plays in which the veteran respondents performed. Most of the interviews took place in the respondents’ homes and lasted 2 to 3 hours. Generally, the questions were chronologically structured, plotting the actors’ theatrical careers from past to present to future.</p>
<p>Before the interviews, I studied the actors’ biographies and incorporated information from them mainly into the first part of the interview, in which I asked the respondents to relate freely to questions such as “How did you become an actor [actress]?” “What image did the actor in Israel of the 1960s have?” and “What is the meaning of play-acting in your life?”</p>
<p>The purpose of this part of the interview, apart from obtaining information, was to establish rapport with the respondents and ensure the trustworthiness of the data. Because of the semistructured nature of the interview, I was able to derive more specific questions from the respondents’ narratives. In the central phase of the interview, I referred to the respondents’ individual and collective careers and asked questions about their work in the present, such as “What is your opinion about the role you are currently playing in [this play]? Describe your work on it.”</p>
<p>The last stage of the interview focused on the topic of retirement and old age. The main questions here included the following:</p>
<list id="list1-0164027511426878" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>What does an actor [actress] like you tell himself [herself] about the meaning of a life that you devoted largely to playing diverse characters who are not you and whose biographies are not yours?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Have you ever imagined your last performance, a situation where you won’t be acting anymore?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>What might an actor lose or gain when he [she] quits the stage?</p></list-item>
</list>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0164027511426878">
<title>Content Analysis</title>
<p>I subjected the interviews to a thematic analysis that elicited primary and secondary categories that I patterned after the concept-indicator model. Then, in accordance with the primary categories, I sorted the data in accordance with aspects such as the actors’ biographies, the choice of acting as a career, actor-director relations, the actor’s social role, actors’ cast work, actors’ role work, and so on. I identified the secondary categories in the sorted data for the purpose of producing a map and a hierarchy of meanings in the primary categories.</p>
<p>For the purposes of this article, I revisited the transcripts and the relevant categories and marked the one theme that recurred the most and pertained directly to the topic that surfaced conspicuously in the findings: the respondents’ self-concepts. Key issues in this theme included the meaning of acting for the self, the Method and professional perceptions of acting, playing an elderly character, the experiences of an elderly actor on stage and behind the scenes, and retiring from the theater.</p>
<p>To make the interpretation more reliable and valid, I applied painstaking controls to the choice of themes and parsed the information to extract that which would best validate my main argument. This process included switching back and forth between the data and the concepts of relevance to the argument, disregarding information that might be construed in clashing ways, care not to remove information from its context, and inspecting the dispersion of the themes among the respondents to exclude unrepresentative themes.</p>
<p>I then consulted with an expert scholar on performance theory, calling his attention to the analysis documentation. We discussed possible key themes and examples of data appropriate to them. In this discussion, the themes and the interpretation of the data were fully confirmed. My main themes were also corroborated by three respondents, who reviewed them and the clusters of data. Below, I quote them at length and offer support for the theoretical claims that relate to their explanations.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0164027511426878">
<title>The Data</title>
<p>The actors who were referred to me via the “snowball process” had similar professional biographies, attended the same European or American acting schools (e.g., Institut des Hautes Études Cinématographiques [the High Academy of Cinema Studies] in Paris, the London School of Acting, and the Academy of Music and Drama in Sofia, Bulgaria), and performed the same plays in the past and present. In Israel as in other countries, Method acting has created a professional culture with specific conventions, socialization processes, and transference through the mediation of structural settings and networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0164027511426878">Bandelj, 2003</xref>). The respondents discussed these unique cultural and historical conventions as opposed to those of other schools (e.g., the English school of acting or Bertolt Brecht’s epic theater). The respondents belong to the mainstream theater, in which they have spent 40 to 60 years (45 years on average) as professional actors. They still act for a living and are committed to professional standards and norms that pertain to their perceptions of acting, casting, support of veteran actors, and training and advising of younger actors, to name only four. Nineteen respondents participated in at least one production, 1 to 4 days per week, during the interview period. This biographical background is significant in assessing the validity of the interpretation because it explains why the actors used similar language, told the same anecdotes, and related to the same personalities from the past. Their theatrical world proved to be a subculture typified by total commitment.</p>
<p>The next parts of the data reveal the respondents’ subjective experiences and attitudes (which, by and large, they attributed to no particular cultural context, Israeli or of their countries of origin) toward the self in stage acting. Generally speaking, the first part shed light on the actors’ endeavors and self-concepts within a self-evident cultural and biographical framework. The second part illuminated one of the outcomes of the Method: its influence on the individual’s experiencing and perception of old age.</p>
<sec id="section7-0164027511426878">
<title>The Method and the Actor’s Self</title>
<p>There is a stereotypical expectation, also reflected in gerontological theory, that actors distinguish between themselves and the masks or characters that they portray. Contrarily, however, all respondents made a great deal of the state of “being” in acting. Their remarks might easily give the impression that “being” is a theatrical charm granted to actors who have come a long way in their profession. The respondents repeatedly linked it to Method acting, describing the Stanislavsky method in various ways that shared one crux: eliminating the distance between the actor and the character being portrayed. Chana (all names are fictitious) explained,
<disp-quote><p>Emotion is Stanislavsky’s motto. If you don’t feel the role, if you act at a distance from the role, it’s impossible. . . . If I want to play King Lear, first I feel him. I’ll know who King Lear is, why he was mean to his daughter, and so on, and then the way he stands . . . the way he walks, everything, will come to me naturally.</p></disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Udi explained a technique that actors use to eradicate role distance:
<disp-quote><p>Lee Strasberg was one of the founders of the [private American] acting studio that I attended as an active observer. . . . There was an exercise called “private moment”; it’s a private moment where you’re really just with yourself. You know it’s a stage where you’re totally exposed. As if no one’s watching you. It’s an exercise that Strasberg worked up from Stanislavsky.</p></disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Dan described the Method: “Stanislavsky discovered that you have to be as close to the truth as possible. You don’t do it to make an impression. You do it because you’re there; you’re the character.”</p>
<p>Yossi described the truth that exists in acting adroitly by setting down a “theory of phases” in an actor’s life:
<disp-quote><p>I managed to separate my acting career into three periods. There are three terms in acting: to play, to perform, and to be. The first period is “to play,” in the sense of child’s play. You play, you don’t know anything yet, you play the way at child plays in the street, in the garden, at home. After you go through that period of acting, you enter the performing period. To perform is to present something. By now you have tools, you know how to perform, [you can play] a thief or a clerk, a person in any occupation whatsoever. When the third period, “acting,” comes around, it’s not enough just to play, not enough to perform, you have to be there with yourself. It’s being. Being is a phase that’s very high, in which the actor presents himself via the scripts. He talks about himself via his script.</p></disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Respondents reflected this totalistic theory of the actor’s selfness in expressions that they used to describe their being on stage: “I searched every character not only to identify with her but also to find my identity within her”; “When I act, I lend myself out. I shed my skin”; “It’s your inner soul that feeds the role. Ultimately, the character should always be you. Even if he’s the worst of all scoundrels, a monster. It’s the theory of acting that you search for your tangents in this person”; “This character is me in my absolute honesty”; “To play the character, I take it all <italic>from myself</italic>. That’s the secret of the thing”; “Theatre is sex. You breathe living spirit [into the characters].” The respondents’ vast experience sometimes prompted them to fine-tune their use of terms that belong to their professional jargon. Dov distinguished between authentic acting and “pseudo-acting,” fake acting that renders dramatization into reaction. Shuki preferred to drop the word “acting” in favor of “behavior,” because this, in his eyes, represents a more authentic reality. Udi likened a “character” to a “shadow” to distinguish between both of them and a person, an entire world, who has to be played. This ideal perception of acting makes the veteran actors’ attitude toward elderly characters, the only ones whom they are still allowed to play, all the more interesting.</p>
<p>In their interviews, the veteran actors recounted their acting careers through the prism of the implicit professional ideology of Method acting. Their biographical narratives (outside the frame of this article) show the similar construction of a personal myth on the basis of the accessibility of childhood as a state of mind, a state that, as in children, is devoid of criticism about deep pretense. Several respondents explained acting as a reality of childishness that dominates their experiences even though it clashes with their age status outside the theater. They did not attribute this childishness to the inner part of the self.</p>
<p>The game play that typifies life in the theater broadens the incidence of childhood and extends the childlike way of viewing the world indefinitely. Meni explained,
<disp-quote><p>The thing that separates us actors from others is that we remain children, babies. Maybe it catalogs us. It makes me different from you. You can be my age but I still remain a goofy kid on stage. I’m allowed to do it. I build Greece and Rome, the characters, in my sandbox. I’m still there mentally and emotionally but it’s not a matter of being babyish. As an artist, you stay in the sandbox to play there and you stay there to play all your life.</p></disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Ronen described the phenomenon of childishness in old age experientially:
<disp-quote><p>The theatre is the key to childhood, to adolescence. Today, sure, I can talk about it philosophically too, since I’ve already reached that stage. I know I’m at the end of a circle; how much more rolling around am I going to do? . . . Wow . . . I’m a kid, I don’t know a thing, and I’m the oldest person in the world, and I stitch the two of them together. . . . At the age of seventy-two, if you begin to fool around in the street, they’ll put you in an insane asylum. But on stage, you can do it and they even pay you for it.</p></disp-quote>

<title>The Absence of Old Age on the Stage</title>
<sec id="section9-0164027511426878">
<title>Playing an elderly character</title>
<p>I found that when actors in their 80s play the roles of elderly people, they treat such roles ab initio as they would any other role that comes their way from some external source. They construct the characters in accordance with theatrical cultural conventions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0164027511426878">Bandelj, 2003</xref>) in which they ostensibly have no input. In terms of gerontological theory, they do distinguish between themselves and old age, but the old age is always someone else’s. Henia explained,
<disp-quote>
<p>To play an old woman on the stage, you have to be very careful to make her pleasant-looking and to like her. You want the audience to like you, the character. I thought about how an old woman talks. And slowly I found the way how to portray her. The wardrobe woman gave me a <italic>wig</italic>.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Sara recounted,
<disp-quote>
<p>I visit the cemetery every Friday. I had a very close relationship with my husband. This woman came over to me, an Oriental ethnic woman. “Oh, you’re just the one I’m looking for. Can you help me?” You know, I contemplated this character, with this kerchief that was always falling off and those idiotic glasses, a wretched woman. Not every actor can play this character [she imitates the woman’s clumsy movements]. It’s a character type that an actress has to know how to play. The stage demands it. The audience demands that you give it to them. Otherwise, you’re a woman like any character out of Shakespeare.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Zipora described the same phenomenon,
<disp-quote>
<p>In one of my plays, there was a man who played my son. I was very old in the play, really stooped over. He says, “Mom, how are you?” Then I turn around and say, “When someone makes it to 90, you don’t ask questions like those.” He couldn’t figure out what I’d found so funny.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The veteran actresses seemed totally disengaged from the old-woman characters that they played. They contemplated the characters and the preparations that they need to make to play them from a professional standpoint only.</p>
<p>In the next example, the perception of the gap between the elderly actor’s self and the elderly character that he or she plays is so obvious that it has the potential of causing confusion. Dan told me that an elderly actor of his acquaintance was once given an “old man’s role.” He dramatized the role to stress the character’s elderly traits. The director commented, “Don’t do anything special. Be you. It’s enough.” Dan blamed the director for the confusing situation that ensued: He thought the director should have asked the actor “to behave in a totally natural way, just as you are” from the very outset. On stage, where the actor established a nonelderly identity by creating a distance between himself and the character, the elderly man connected with the elderly identity via the actor’s offstage knowledge, not via his professional tools.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0164027511426878">
<title>Stage presence</title>
<p>In the transition from one theatrical space to the other, a transformation of identity takes place. It connects with the difference between two audiences that commonly observe veteran actors: young actors behind the scenes and the audience that faces the stage. Young actors “signify” veteran actors on the basis of their age by appreciating their professional experience and giving them respect. The veteran actors, in turn, are willing to play the role of advisers and instructors for the younger generation. In contrast, and sometimes only a moment later, the transition takes place: performing on stage allows the element of age to evaporate into thin air. The actors expressed this in the following way: “The stage erases. It brings forth new life. The optical illusion of the stage is also [an illusion] of values.” A similar explanation relates to the very fact that both actors and audience are aware that a role is being performed. When a veteran actress performs a character, she lays a mask of sorts atop the mask of her elderly body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0164027511426878">Featherstone &amp; Hepworth, 1991</xref>) in a way that obliterates the negative representation of the bodily images. Acting allows veteran actors to carry out this overlay of mask atop mask, thereby restoring the human face of old age (Gamliel, 2008).</p>

<title>Retirement: Quitting the Stage</title>
<p>The most provocative topic that arose in the interviews was permanent retirement from the theater. After the fact, this topic subjected the prediction in gerontological theory about the structure of the self and its constructive inner content to a more significant test.</p>
<p>The actors responded to questions about the eventuality of retirement with a vehemence that verged on insult. From their standpoint, not only is it that an actor “cannot be old” but also, “In the theatre, there’s no such thing as retirement.” When I expressed puzzlement about the depth of the crisis associated with the possibility of retirement, the actors linked retirement to things that allow no escape: depression and death. Retirement, Shlomo explained, causes an actor “to stop existing on the stage.” When I tried to compare retiring from the theater with retiring from another occupation, he said, “It’s worse in acting because you lose something that used to be there in a way that was almost totally natural. The actor [who retires] goes through a very difficult mental process, there’s depression, a kind of mental illness.” Ran explained,
<disp-quote>
<p>It’s hard-wired into your brain. An actor remains a kid. He’s a kid. He doesn’t believe it: just a moment, what happened, I’m pensioned off? So what if I’m sixty years old?! I’m a kid! What’s the meaning of this?!</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Yossi said, “Creativity is the main thing in life. If you feel that you’ve stopped creating, you can die.” “Why go on acting?” I asked Simon, an 80-year-old actor. He replied with a rhetorical question: “Why live? Did you ever ask yourself? Acting is all for living. If an actor doesn’t totally identify with the profession, it’s not him. It has to be like the blood in all your organs.” Gad said,
<disp-quote>
<p>Actors who retire due to old age die a short time later. It stood out in cases that I knew. I’m afraid of it. They say that what a man fears most is the loss of his potency. My fear is of losing my memory. It’s a very, very strong fear.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>When I asked Pnina, an octogenarian actress who suffers from chronic headaches, “Why don’t you take a rest [from acting]?” she replied, “Because I have nothing else, nothing. Someone who has something else, he can give it up.” An interview with Dana, a very famous Israeli actress, aged 84 and no longer given roles, confirmed what other veteran actors told me: She has fallen into melancholy.</p>
<p>Many respondents expressed the wish to continue acting until their last day: “to die on stage.” The next interview reflects this in a special way:</p>

<speaker>Interviewer:</speaker>
<p>Have you ever imagined your last performance, a situation where you won’t be acting anymore?</p>
</speech>

<speaker>Hezi:</speaker>
<p>I’ve imagined it and it scares me. If I’m not acting, exactly what am I doing? What will I do? Look, everything else I do is hobbies. I want to do something. I’m an actor, so what I want is to act!</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Interviewer:</speaker>
<p>What might an actor lose when he quits the stage?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Hezi:</speaker>
<p>He loses the audience. He becomes anonymous, so to speak; he becomes a kind of <italic>’over batel</italic> [mental invalid]. It’s helplessness. He’s an actor. That’s that. Get it? For the actor, when the curtain falls, he goes home. That’s that.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Interviewer:</speaker>
<p>Does it have to do with self-esteem?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Hezi:</speaker>
<p>It’s the other way around—it has to do with lack of self-esteem. I’d be delighted if I had the courage now to leave the theatre and go off to university, to discover other worlds all of a sudden. I’m afraid to give up acting.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Interviewer:</speaker>
<p>Is it different from any other profession?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Hezi:</speaker>
<p>Yes. It’s an art of the moment. That’s it. A painting, for example, stays alive for ever. The character I played last night is gone.</p>

<speech>
<speaker>Interviewer:</speaker>
<p>If you’re forced to retire, what will you do?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Hezi:</speaker>
<p>I’ll read for the blind. They can’t read, I’ll read them a book. I’ve thought about doing that. Or I’ll go to a hospital and be next to someone who’s dying [gives me the look of a dying person] and whisper in his ear, “Don’t be afraid . . .”</p>

<p>Why?</p>

<speaker>Hezi:</speaker>
<p>To do something that goes beyond what I’ve got to, for once.</p>

<p>Hezi seemed to consider himself socially dead outside of his life on stage. The Jewish expression that he used, <italic>’over batel</italic> (from the rabbinical text <italic>Pirqe Avot</italic>), denotes someone who can no longer occupy a special place in society because his or her mind or senses are failing. For Hezi, either he acts, lives a full stage life, or he connects with the situation into which retirement will thrust him, to the extent of adopting an altruistic nonacting self-identity that links itself with the social death, almost the literal death, of suffering people. This actor, I would say, devised his own way of saying what other actors said explicitly: that retiring from the stage is a state of emptiness that an actor’s mind cannot tolerate.</p>

<title>Discussion: The Theatrical (Mis)representation of the Old-Age Condition</title>
<p>The discussion that follows reflects the critical theory in gerontology that, in its recent incarnation, not only critiques existing theory but also aims to create models of aging that stress diversity. The interpretive approach and the critical self-reflection of the critical theory are strongly related to ethnographic methodologies that strive to understand the aging experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0164027511426878">Hooyman &amp; Kiyak, 2011</xref>). The discussion concerns the representative nature of the theater in two senses: as a domain of game play and as a source of theoretical arguments. It draws its inspiration from a theory developed by Bruce <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0164027511426878">Wilshire (1982)</xref> in a study on the theater, which is unique in its claim that the dramaturgical metaphors do not always correspond to the self-concept. Below, I describe the gap between veteran actors’ self-concepts and the theoretical structure of the old-age self-identity; further on, I offer insights and describe the practical implications of this research.</p>
<sec id="section13-0164027511426878">
<title>The Emerging Structure of Veteran Actors’ Self-Concepts</title>
<p>To bring a performance to the stage, actors constantly choose and work through the components of the acted characters to create and maintain self-identity. In my research, I found that the actors, although old in terms of years, tend selectively toward two extremes of the life span. Although they do not play child characters on stage, they state that they have children’s traits. They play elderly characters because they are considered the most appropriate candidates for such roles, but they do not consider themselves old. They display childishness as a personality trait and an inner essence that they attribute to their selfness. Because their childhood is a crucial variable in the formation of their destiny as actors, it is not exchangeable on stage for any other phase of development. It is childishness, for which the stage serves as a sandbox, that allows the actors, as they perceive the matter, to identify professionally with diverse characters, including elderly men and women. Because it is a basic medium for acting, it should not be viewed on the same plane as their attitude toward old age.</p>
<p>To make this matter clear, we return to Goffman’s concept of active “role distance,” which exists in my respondents’ experience mainly in relation to elderly characters. The reflectiveness that I encountered in my interviews served my elderly respondents as a way to narrow their distance from the role of the child and to widen their distance from the role of the old person. By defining themselves as childlike, they alluded to the ease of attaining deep-level pretenses. In other words, because of their timeless childishness, they are capable of appearing as “actors” who professionally internalize the characters that they play. Their attitudes toward elderly characters, in contrast, remind us that no matter how old the actors are, theatrical work presupposes by definition the existence of a distance between the character in the script and the actor who is expected to learn and identify with him or her. I wish to argue, paradoxically, that elderly actors relate to the old-age characters as they do to any other character: as a professional challenge. Accordingly, they spur themselves with full Stanislavskian gravitas to eliminate the distance between themselves and the “old-person” role. Shlomo described it thus:
<disp-quote>
<p>So I have to play an old man. If I go to an old-age home and see old people, it’s not me. I can’t imitate an old man; it’s impossible to imitate an old man. Every old man is different. It also depends on whom he meets with. If his first love comes along, then he’s young; if a doctor comes to treat him, then he’s sick. So you look for your old man, the one who’s inside you: who you are, what you’re going to be like when you’re old. Now, when you finally find the old age inside you, it can be explained: you say, “Now the emperor is coming to visit the old man.”</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The professional source of the paradox is the Method. In the courses of their careers, actors are trained to become the roles that they play. Once they become experienced and elderly, however, it is their interest to turn the process on its head.</p>
<p>By implication, the domain of game play is so strongly unique that one cannot determine whether the actors’ attitude of role distance toward the role of the old person is a routine professional attitude or whether it conceals an existential approach, typical of elderly people in Western societies, that denotes self-segregation and denial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0164027511426878">Gamliel, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0164027511426878">Neimeyer, 1994</xref>). One can only hypothesize that actors are trained to become the characters that they play and that, once having grown in experience and years, they have a special interest in reversing the process.</p>
<p>The inability to clear up this matter is related not only to the premise of role distance in Method acting. Another possible explanation concerns an additional characteristics of the acting space that make the theater a place where old age, in the sense familiar to us, does not exist. I refer to the actors’ belief, which has some backing in the semiological debate, that the audience cannot regard them as old people because “the twisted facial features are part of the mask,” as in the Polish film <italic>Before Twilight</italic>.</p>
<p>The acting arena places veteran actors at a disadvantage because it is both nonageist and total in their experiencing of self. Even if this is not absolutely the case and even if it originates in a dual attitude toward the well-being of the character being played (e.g., Miss Daisy in <italic>Driving Miss Daisy</italic>, Salieri in <italic>Amadeus</italic>, and King Lear), acting serves the actors as a mask for the physical and mental manifestations of old age. If there is a place where actors should experience their functional disabilities and express the value of their living and professional experience for young actors, it is the back stage. Only in rare cases does the potential of confusion in the dual approach (which, in terms of acting theory, presumes a distance from the old-person role even though the theater chooses only elderly people for this role) become real (i.e., when a director instructs a veteran actor to play an elderly character in such a way as to merely “be himself”). Consequently, in the totality of space in the theater, the veteran actor’s social identity is “not old” on stage and “old” behind the scenes. Method acting, on one hand, draws on the resources of the actor’s self for its own benefit; on the other hand, it leaves “old age” out. In this manner, it purges the self-identity of all permanent or labeled social meaning and constructs a “self of selves” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0164027511426878">James, 1925</xref>, p. 128): an empty self, an expression borrowed from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0164027511426878">Cushman (1990)</xref> that allows the accommodation of different characters.</p>
<p>The findings that follow illuminate the connection between the actors’ devotion to the Method and their nonaging self-perception, even in comparison with young actors.</p>
<p>In the intergenerational cast that I tracked, the veteran actors were typified by externalized emotional work. Their efforts to play their roles included (a) lengthy analytical discussions with the director and with me about the meaning of the character’s life, his or her cultural context, personality, weaknesses, strengths, and so on; (b) telephone calls at unusual hours to me and the director to tell us something about the characters; (c) strong emotional expressions about the character during and away from rehearsals; (d) description of the correspondence between the actor’s self and the demands of role work; (e) reading of literature about the playwright and the play; (f) difficulty in obeying many of the director’s instructions and proposals by the actors themselves to improve the role work; and (g) explicit conversations about Method acting. In one such conversation, Udi expressed the heroism of his acting self: “Working on this play is like taking a journey into your soul; it helps me to stand in front of a mirror into the complexity of my soul.” These behaviors or deep reflections were hardly evident among the young actors, two of whom even admitted that their work is more “technical.” In the course of my observations, I discovered that the application of Stanislavsky’s Method and stories about it, like nostalgic tales from the past of the Israeli theater, establish a generation gap and confirm the veterans’ self-concept as a “generation of giants.” The young actors, although deeming themselves more beautiful and more fresh, admit that they lack the seniors’ passion and devotion.</p>
<p>The domain of game play is so total that the respondents find it difficult to consider the possibility of retiring. Their attitude suggests the belief that there is neither existence nor purpose outside the theater. Their descriptions refer to depression, helplessness, the pointlessness of life, social death, and literal death as the endgame in a way that indicates that their selfness is very much embedded in the domain of game play, befitting the ideal in Stanislavskian theory. The veteran actors portray themselves as children for whom acting is a medium for a meaningful relationship with their social selves and as people who cannot acknowledge the way the show really ends. The end of the show forces them to cope with their cultivated self of selves, a situation almost tantamount to the end of life.</p>
<p>In view of these findings, the structure of the identity experience of veteran actors may be represented in the manner shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0164027511426878">Table 1</xref>.</p>

<title>A Theoretical Structure of Old-Age Self-Identity</title>
<p>If we relate to dramaturgical metaphors in main gerontological theories that are geared toward a social reality outside the theater—that is, real life—we find the opposite portrayal of self-identity. In my view, Biggs’s description of the underlying assumption of “masquerade” shows this clearly and also reflects the mask-of-aging thesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0164027511426878">Featherstone &amp; Hepworth 1991</xref>) as well as the Jungian psychology of the persona (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0164027511426878">Jung, 1967</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0164027511426878">Biggs (2004)</xref> described this assumption:
<disp-quote>
<p>The experience of a long life and the existential questions that aging brings with it are conceived as provoking an expanded and more grounded sense of self. As this new and evolving process of a maturing imagination continues to exist within a predominantly ageist society, masquerade is used to cloak socially unacceptable aspects of aging which are now nevertheless recognized as part of who the individual is. Under such circumstances, masquerade protects this mature self from external attack and becomes a vehicle for self-expression in its own right. A necessary inner space is created in which a stable identity can be built. This helps to ground an aging identity and provides a position from which to assess and connect with the social world. In the face of an uncertain environment, key elements of personal experience become interiorized, bringing vitality to the inner world of the self. (p. 53)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>These theories take a performative approach toward self-identity that assumes a dichotomy between outer appearance and what lies “under the skin” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0164027511426878">Andrews, 1999</xref>). This allows us to understand easily that the mask-wearing self is split between two social arenas, “onstage” and “offstage,” in response to the gap between body and spirit that widens in old age. Gerontological theory looks on as old person’s contacts with his or her environment slacken and describes the construction of a self-identity that is mired in internal retreat and rebels against social interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0164027511426878">Biggs, 2004</xref>). This theoretical approach suggests that the self-identity experience of the elderly follows the structure shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0164027511426878">Table 2</xref>.</p>

<title>Conclusions and Implications</title>
<p>What is the meaning of the contrast between the self-identity processes in the case study and in theory? As the two foregoing tables show, “onstage” and “offstage” are real arenas (in the theater) and psychological ones (in the theoretical metaphors) that take on opposite meanings in terms of self-identity in old age (“old” and “not old”). If so, I believe that the application of the dramaturgical metaphor in gerontological theory is invalid for the veteran actors’ experiences of identity. I reinforce this conclusion by comparing the contents of the social identity of veteran actors “away from the theater” with those of old people (most of whom are not actors) “away from social interaction” (the third row in each of the tables). As I have shown, the actors’ remarks show that they lack an inner space where they can experience identity meaningfully; the theory, in contrast, allows the elderly to have this positive experience “for real.” The comparison indicates the limits of the dramaturgical metaphor, because being away from social life is not like being away from the theater. Theory views reality away from social life as a behind-the-scenes arena in which the self is expected to intensify its constructive retreat. In contrast to this theoretical state, actors with vast experience in the theatrical world prove to be people who do not view the theater as a metaphor outside the theatrical space itself (i.e., people who are incapable of bending its rules and orders to the benefit of their selves). After retirement, as they perceive it, they have nowhere to retreat to. Their playacting selves lack the internal possibility of creating an alternative world of meaning. My respondents were like shoemakers who go barefoot; they are deficient in a symbolic resource (an offstage self characterized by autonomy, spirituality, creativity, etc.) that, according to the prediction in theory, may help people like them to cope with social exclusion. The “old actor’s paradox,” if I may paraphrase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0164027511426878">Diderot’s (1957)</xref> expression, applies to my respondents. For them, instead of saying “All the world is a stage,” it would be more correct to say “The stage is all the world,” with everything offstage incapable of acquiring theatrical meaning. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0164027511426878">Goffman (1959)</xref> contended, “[All] the world is not, of course, a stage, but the crucial ways in which it isn’t, are not easy to specify” (p. 72). In my judgment, since the respondents’ existential narrative lacks the perception of meaning and identity outside their theatrical exertions—and, therefore, lacks the dichotomy of front stage and back stage—this may be one of those “crucial ways” in which the world is not a stage.</p>
<p>We find that the extreme lack of a “back stage” within this self may have tragic outcomes when the final curtain falls. By implication, the limited nature of the representation provided by the theater, as reflected in an actor’s career, thwarts effective coping with changes during the life span as described in nondramaturgical theories in gerontology (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0164027511426878">Erikson, 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0164027511426878">Gutmann, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0164027511426878">Leder, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0164027511426878">Thornstam, 1997</xref>).</p>
<p>The actor who “remains a kid” is also, by necessity, one who by retiring is thrust into an unknown and threatening situation. This finding may support the hypothesis that although retiring from work may force nonactors to confront a sense of incapacity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0164027511426878">Cox, 1990</xref>), retiring from the theater may confront actors with a much more acute sensation: the lack of presence. The theatrical situation described above may be relevant for additional personalities, professions, and situations (e.g., acute workaholism) because it creates upon retirement a feeling that approximates the lack of presence. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0164027511426878">Wilshire (1990)</xref> expressed this approach by insinuating that the impetus to grow is also the impetus to sacrifice the defense that an accustomed and successful performance provides. The veteran actors in my study did not sacrifice this defense. They are disoriented offstage because they have spent their lives accommodating fiction and fact as one. In this paratheatrical situation, life on stage is full of vitality and light, while death is bleaker than bleak—and old age, which does not exist, does not mediate between them.</p>
<p>This case study yields several theoretical reflections of a more general nature. It probes the validity of the dramaturgical metaphor among actors for whom theater is not (or at least not solely) a metaphor and helps challenge the validity of inner/outer self construction that has inspired theories in various disciplines. This challenge is consistent with that of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0164027511426878">Andrews (1999)</xref>, who criticized gerontological approaches that base themselves on the Cartesian split, and with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0164027511426878">Wilshire’s (1982)</xref> similar critique of classical existentialist premises that propose a contrast between being-for-others and the authentic self. “To be a self,” Wilshire stated, “is to be a human body that is mimetically involved in other such bodies” (p. 226). My data suggest that actors make no distinction between performative self and interior self in their attempts to define their selves. An actor may experience a “natural” continuum or a correspondence between the mask and the way in which he or she talks to himself or herself. This insight contributes to the perception that the self is defined in a process of sociality (i.e., that one may know oneself only within the social world; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0164027511426878">Merleau-Ponty, 1962</xref>, p. xi).</p>
<p>This insight sheds light on the importance that my respondents attributed to the state of “being” in acting—something that surpasses a state of “acting” or “performing”—and their perception of acting as a state of valuable “doing. Hezi stressed this point: “I want to <italic>do</italic> something. I’m an <italic>actor</italic>,” and “If I’m not <italic>acting</italic>, exactly what am I <italic>doing</italic>?” Another example of the blurring of “being” and “doing” is the actor’s tendency to define himself or herself via the <italic>being</italic> of the characters he or she plays while expressing his or her reputation in terms of having <italic>done</italic> King Lear, Hamlet, and so on. This blurring may take place because of the possibility of being disparaged (i.e., the perception of the theater as an arena of fakery and make-believe that clashes with the ideal of authenticity; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0164027511426878">Taylor, 1991</xref>). Another possibility is that the actor will be ridiculed as a mere virtuoso, devoid of self, or a social parasite who repeatedly brings someone other than himself or herself to life. Paradoxically, viewing the theater as a place of masks poses a challenge, via this professional perception, to the Western perception of the self as something that uncouples “doing,” a socially visible thing, from subjective experience. Again, this blurring is a variation of the actors’ failure to distinguish between mask and self-performance.</p>
<p>One may easily test the practical implications of this insight by constructing an imaginary continuum of possibilities for the self. Between the two poles—a performance-based self (such as that of the veteran actors) and a self that has no performative orientation whatsoever (performance as a marginal and unconscious by-product of social interaction)—lies <italic>a varied and complex repertoire of daily performances before audiences of ordinary people</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0164027511426878">Goffman, 1959</xref>), in which people perform in accordance with professional exigencies and social conventions. The extent of theatricality in teaching and nursing, for example, varies in accordance with the nature of the performance before an audience and the extent of dependency of the self on the performance for its self-definition.</p>
<p>The existence of theatricality in those domains, however, cannot be overlooked. My study indicates that this comprehensive social fact should be taken seriously, especially in old age, given (a) the unattractiveness of the (theoretical) option of withdrawing from the social world, (b) the power of social interaction to influence self-perception, (c) the steady development and proliferation of arenas for expression and self-structuring in postmodernity, (d) the increase in life expectancy, (e) the absence of mandatory age norms, and (f) the importance of intergenerational relations. Here, in my judgment, lies the contribution of my finding that veteran actors manage to preserve a non-old-age identity even at advanced age and to be socially appreciated for it. This shows that, contrary to the prediction in gerontological theory, withdrawal from social involvement into a self that is expected to be dynamic, vital, and spiritual as a defense against stereotypical labeling and a sense of worthlessness is not necessary in old age (or in any other stage of life). Furthermore, the findings of this study suggest that we should relate cautiously to assumptions in relatively recent approaches in gerontology, for example, social constructivism, which maintains that it is an individual’s subjective view of social ties, and not his or her objective nature, that matters for well-being (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0164027511426878">Dykstra &amp; Mandemakers, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>The possibilities of performing before a real audience exist and may nurture a sense of continuity and self-worth among the elderly. Therefore, I would recommend examining the value of cultivating performative self-awareness in old age. Such a recommendation is backed by the belief that the elderly are predisposed to generativity or creative generosity in their attitude toward their surroundings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0164027511426878">de St. Aubin, McAdams, &amp; Kim, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0164027511426878">Erikson, 1969</xref>). In terms of the development and well-being of the self and the wish to spare the self from the cost of retirement, those who identify with their profession at various levels may gain by adopting a <italic>performative flexibility</italic> that will allow them to surrender one form of performance before an audience (that exclusive to their professional arena or some other temporary arena) in favor of another. The alternative performance should be based on, and should affirm, their personal and professional resources, life experience, talents, and knowledge, and it should merit the appreciation of audiences that are no less appropriate and, perhaps, more grateful (e.g., children, neighbors, students, relatives, and other veterans). The examples of caring performances, mentoring performances, and learning performances come to mind (see the development of this proposal in Gamliel, 2008).</p>
<p>Gerontological theory does use theatrical metaphors but rules out the elderly as social performers of their identities. The performative approach illuminated in my study clashes with this way of thinking and, therefore, may shed light on various basic assumptions. It may, for example, challenge the prevailing assumption about the denial of old age by the elderly. Despite clear indications that veteran actors distance themselves from old-person roles, as I have shown, one cannot overlook their perception that only they can play elderly characters and that the internalization of such a character is a success. This implies, at the very least, that their attitudes toward their old age are complex and interesting. Our perception of the elderly as performative agents may balance the discussion in psychosocial gerontology and enhance our understanding of their world without imposing on them a unidimensional interpretation that rests on our fears.</p>
