<abstract>
<p>Kinetix epoxy resin was filled with nanoclay to increase the tensile properties of the composite for civil and structural applications by the Centre of Excellence in Engineering Fibre Composites, University of Southern Queensland. This project manufactured samples with different percentages by weight of nanoclay in the composites in steps of 1 wt%, which were then post-cured in an oven. The samples were then subjected to flexural tests. The results showed that the composite with 3 wt% of nanoclay produces the maximum flexural strength, strain and modulus. It is hoped that the discussion and results in this study would not only contribute towards the development of nanoclay reinforced epoxy composites with better material properties, but also be useful for the investigations of fracture toughness, tensile properties and flexural properties in other composites.</p>

<sec id="sec1-0731684412459246" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>The composite materials exhibit characteristics of both inorganic materials and organic polymers. It has been established in recent years that polymer reinforced with a small percentage of strong fillers can significantly improve the mechanical and thermal properties.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0731684412459246">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>The most widely used and least expensive polymer resins are the polyesters and vinyl esters; these matrix materials are used primarily for glass fibre reinforced composites. The epoxies are more expensive and, in addition to commercial applications, are also utilized extensively in polymer matrix composites for aerospace applications; they have better mechanical properties and resistance to moisture than the polyesters and vinyl resins.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0731684412459246">2</xref></sup> This study investigates the flexural strength, maximum flexural strain and flexural modulus of kinetix epoxy (EP) composites reinforced with varying percentage by weight of nanoclay with a view of finding out the optimum percentage by weight of the nanoclay that can be added to the composites.</p>
<p>Nanocomposites are a type of composite in which the scale of the dispersed phase is less than 100 nm, in at least one dimension. Because of the nanoscale dispersion and the high aspect ratios of the inorganic clays, polymer-layered silicate nanocomposites (PLSNs) exhibit light weight, dimensional stability, heat resistance, high stiffness, barrier properties and improved toughness and strength with far less reinforcement loading than conventional composite counterparts. The synthesis and characterization of PLSNs have become one of the frontiers in materials science.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0731684412459246">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>In general, PLSNs can be divided into two categories: intercalated and exfoliated composites. In an intercalated nanocomposite, a few polymer chains diffuse into the silicate galleries with fixed interlayer spacing. In contrast, an exfoliated nanocomposite is formed when the silicate nanolayers are delaminated and well dispersed in the continuous polymer matrix. The exfoliated state may maximize the interfacial contact between the organic and inorganic phases, and as a result, nanocomposites with optimum performance properties can be achieved.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0731684412459246">3</xref></sup> Nanoparticles have an enormous surface area and the interfacial areas between the two intermixed phases in a nanocomposite will, therefore, be much larger than micro-scale composites. This brings about stronger bonding between the matrix and the matrix. The mechanical, thermal and electrical properties of nanocomposites are, therefore, observed to be better than their traditional counterparts. In many cases, the nanoparticle-reinforced resins have been used to fabricate conventional microcomposites.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0731684412459246">4</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-0731684412459246"><title>Literature review</title>
<p>Some studies showed that the addition of a small amount of nanoparticles caused the significant improvement in the mechanical properties of pure polymers. The high aspect ratio and high modulus of these particles may be the reasons for this. When the nanoparticles were dispersed in the matrix materials, they produced a very large amount of surface area and confined the chain mobility of the polymers under stresses.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0731684412459246">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0731684412459246">6</xref></sup> The overall molecular mobility in the nanocomposites had been due to two grounds: (1) the loosened molecular packing of polymer chains; this was because of the presence of nanoparticles and their interactions with the polymer chains. This led to increased free volume and enhanced molecular mobility, and (2) the formation of a layer of bound polymer around the nanoparticles and this led to decreased molecular mobility.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0731684412459246">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0731684412459246">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>Khan et al. made nanoclay/EP composites and discovered that the flexural strength of the composites initially increased with increasing particulate loading but dropped back after 3 wt% of nanoclay. They also found that the flexural modulus of the composite increased with particulate loading. They also made nanoclay–CFRP/EP (carbon fibre reinforced plastic) hybrid composites and found that the flexural strength and modulus behaved in the same way as the flexural strength of nanoclay/EP composites; the flexural strength and modulus peaked at 3 wt% of nanoclay.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0731684412459246">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>Zhou et al. mixed vinyl ester resin (tensile strength = 41.27 MPa) with nanoclay and found that the tensile strength of the nanoclay/vinyl ester composite would initially increase and peak at 2 wt% of nanoclay (44.68 MPa) and then drop significantly at 4 wt% of nanoclay (23.33 MPa). However, the tensile modulus of the composites behaved a little bit different as the maximum elastic modulus was at 1 wt% of nanoclay. After this, the elastic modulus dropped with increasing particulate loading.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0731684412459246">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>Yasmin et al. found that by adding clay particles, the elastic modulus of pure EP was significantly improved, and the higher the clay loading, the higher the modulus of the nanocomposite. The elastic modulus of the nanocomposites was, however, found to decrease with temperature.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0731684412459246">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>Mahfuz et al. made composite samples from low-density polyethylene and carbon nanoparticles. They were then tensile tested. They found that the failure stress of the extruded polyethylene sample doped with carbon nanoparticles/whiskers is about 17% higher than the neat extruded sample. They also found that the improvement in tensile modulus was around 16% and that the gain in the modulus was at the cost of a reduction in failure strain of 12%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0731684412459246">9</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec3-0731684412459246"><title>EP resin</title>
<p>The EP resin used in this study is Kinetix R246TX thixotropic laminating resin, an opaque liquid, and the hardener used is kinetic H160 medium hardener which has a pot life of 120 min. Other hardeners like H126, H128, H161 and H162 can also be used.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0731684412459246">10</xref></sup> The nanoclay was first mixed with EP resin. After this the hardener, kinetic H160 medium, was added. The weight ratio of resin to hardener used was 4:1.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0731684412459246">10</xref></sup> The composite was then cast to moulds of flexural test pieces and left to cure under ambient conditions for 24 h. The flexural test specimens were taken out of the moulds and then post-cured in oven at 40°C for 16 h, and then at 50°C for 16 h and finally at 60°C for 8 h. This is to ensure that the heat distortion temperature (HDT) is above 63°C. To bring the ultimate HDT to 68°C, another 15 h of post-curing will be required.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0731684412459246">10</xref></sup> The specimens were then subjected to tensile tests.</p>
<p>In many cases, the resin components (filler and resin) are mixed together and simply gravity poured into a low-cost mould of metal or some other material. One precaution must be kept in mind with EP casting and laminating resin; the polymerization reaction produces heat; it is exothermic, and if a large batch of resin is mixed with a curing agent and allowed to stand for too long, it may catch fire. People familiar with dealing with epoxies are well aware of this characteristic and deal with it by using the resin immediately after adding the curing agent or by mixing small quantities.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0731684412459246">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>Although some epoxies are formulated to cross-link at room temperature to initiate the cross-linking and a well-controlled temperature history throughout the process to cross-link as intended, many epoxies also require subsequent post-curing to completely cross-link to achieve the optimum properties. The cross-linking times required by epoxies are normally long as compared with other resins, e.g. unsaturated polyesters.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0731684412459246">11</xref></sup></p>

<p>On top of reducing costs, the addition of fillers into polymers is to make it electrically conducting. These fillers must be electrically conducting and is usually discontinuous for the sake of convenience in composite fabrication, e.g. slurry casting. These composites are widely used in electronic packaging.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0731684412459246">12</xref></sup> Moreover, the addition of some filler to polymers will increase the heat dissipation capability of the composites. This is very important for the proper operation of electronic devices because the accumulated heat generated from the performance of those devices should be removed quickly.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0731684412459246">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>The reinforcement used in this study is nanoclay. The product name of the nanoclay used is Cloisite® 30B manufactured by SCP Rockwood Additives; its synonym(s) is organoclay. Cloisite® 30B is a natural montmorillonite modified with a quaternary ammonium salt. Cloisite® 30B is an additive for plastics to improve various plastic physical properties, such as reinforcement, HDT, coefficient of linear thermal expansion and barrier. The moisture content is less than 2%. The typical dry particle sizes are 10% less than 2 µm, 50% less than 6 µm and 10% less than 13 µm. The colour is off-white. Its density is 1.98 g/cc.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0731684412459246">14</xref></sup></p>

The flexural strength of the neat resin post-cured in an oven was 58.83 MPa. This rises slowly to a peak value of 72.42 MPa at 3 wt% of filler but then remains steady for the rest of the wt% of the filler. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0731684412459246">Table 2</xref> presents the values of flexural strengths mentioned above with their standard deviation within parentheses. The increase in flexural strength at 3 wt% of nanoclay was 23% above that of neat resin.

<p>Siddiqui et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0731684412459246">17</xref></sup> used organoclay I30.P to fill Epon828 EP resin. These were clay/EP nanocomposites. They found that there was a gradual decrease of flexural strength with increasing particulate loading, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0731684412459246">Figure 2</xref>. This was due to the agglomeration and or non-uniform distribution of the clays in the matrix, particularly at high clay contents. The agglomerates could also act as crack initiation sites, leading to a loss of flexural strength. They also argued that the different curing speeds between the bulk EP and the silicate interfaces might induce internal stresses, leading to premature failure.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0731684412459246">17</xref></sup> The results of the flexural strength of this study were better than those of Siddiqui et al.’s<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0731684412459246">17</xref></sup> study because the flexural strength in this study increased with nanoclay content and peaked at 3 wt% of reinforcement. Of course, the resin and nanoclay used were different. The results are not surprising as Cease et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0731684412459246">18</xref></sup> studied the mechanical properties of different types of EP resins and discovered that the tensile strength of Epotek 301-2 EP resin was 2.4 times than that of Hysol 9361 EP resin.
</p>
<p>Siddiqui et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0731684412459246">17</xref></sup> also fabricated laminate composites from carbon fibre plain woven fabric and organoclay-filled EP resin (Epon828).

nanoclay reinforced EP composites. The results of the flexural are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0731684412459246">Table 3</xref>. It can be found that the flexural strength of the composites with any wt% of nanoclay was higher than that of neat resin. The flexural strength peaked at 415 MPa at 2 wt% of nanoclay.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0731684412459246">19</xref></sup> The trend of the flexural strength of Chowdhury et al.’s<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0731684412459246">19</xref></sup> study was similar to that of this study except that flexural strength peaked at 3 wt% of nanoclay in this study. Both returned promising results, but the maximum improvement in flexural strength in this study (23%) is better than its rival (13.7%). However, this is not surprising as Wang and Pinnavaia,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0731684412459246">20</xref></sup> Lan and Pinnavaia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0731684412459246">21</xref></sup> and Wang et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0731684412459246">22</xref></sup> had pointed out that the increase in strength in composites would be more distinct if the strength values of the starting EP were low.
</p>
<p>Khan et al. used EP (Epon828) resin and organoclay, Nanomer I30P to make clay/EP nanocomposites. They found that the flexural strength of the composites increase with particulate loading and peaked at 121.5 MPa at 3 wt% of nanoclay, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0731684412459246">Figure 2</xref>. The flexural strength dropped back to 110.8 MPa at 5 wt% of filler but it was still higher than the neat resin composites (108 MPa). From <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0731684412459246">Figure 2</xref>, it can be found that the results of the flexural strengths of clay/EP composites of Siddiqui et al. were much inferior to those of Khan et al. although both used the same resin and nanoclay. This can be attributed to the better dispersion of the nanoclay in the matrix because Khan et al. shear-mixed the resin and the nanoclay at 3000 r/min, while Siddiqui et al. subjected the mixed resin and nanoclay to sonication.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0731684412459246">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0731684412459246">17</xref></sup></p>
<p>The trend of the flexural strengths of Khan et al.’s study was similar to that of this study and both peaked at 3 wt% of nanoclay. The maximum improvement in flexural strength in Khan et al.’s study was 12.5% while that of this study was 23%. This is because the increase in strength in composites would be more distinct if the strength values of the starting EP were low.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0731684412459246">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0731684412459246">22</xref></sup></p>
<p>Khan et al. also fabricated laminate (hybrid) composites from unidirectional carbon fibre and organoclay filled EP resin (Epon828). These were CFRP nanoclay EP composites. They found that the flexural strength of the composites increase with particulate loading and peaked at 718.4 MPa at 3 wt% of nanoclay, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0731684412459246">Figure 1</xref>. The flexural strength dropped back to 678.9 MPa at 5 wt% of filler but it was still higher than that of the neat resin plus carbon-fibre composites (663 MPa). The flexural strength of neat resin plus carbon fibre laminate composite of Khan et al. was 663 MPa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0731684412459246">Figure 1</xref>) but that of Siddiqui et al. was only 368.4 MPa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0731684412459246">Figure 1</xref>), which was 80% lower than its counterpart. This was due to the different carbon-fibre format used. Furthermore, the flexural strengths of CFRP nanoclay composites of Khan et al. were even better than those of Siddiqui et al. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0731684412459246">Figure 1</xref>). This proves that the manufacturing processes employed by Khan et al. were more superior than those of Siddiqui et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0731684412459246">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0731684412459246">17</xref></sup></p>
<p>The increase in tensile strengths of the composites from those of neat resin could be due to two reasons; one was from nanoparticle point of view and the other from cross-linking. If a matrix were more cross-linked, its strength and stiffness would be higher. On the other hand, if nanoparticles were infused into a polymer, they would form a relatively weak particle–polymer interface which would act as a crack dissemination mechanism at the very early stage of crack growth and eventually delay the formation of the dominant crack.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0731684412459246">22</xref></sup> Thus, the improved tensile strength of nanocomposites was believed to have been caused by enhanced cross-linking in the matrix due to nanoparticle infusion.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0731684412459246">22</xref></sup></p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0731684412459246">Figure 3</xref> illustrates the maximum flexural strain of nanoclay-filled EP composites. The maximum flexural strain of the neat resin was 0.029 mm/mm. This rises to a peak of 0.032 at 3 wt% of nanoclay. It then drops back to 0.021 mm/mm at 5 wt% of filler and remains more or less the same with up to 7 wt% of nanoclay. The peak value of the maximum flexural strain occurred at 3 wt% of nanoclay and this was in line with that of flexural strength. The trend of the maximum flexural strains was also in line with that of the flexural strength. It can be argued that the trends of values of both were correct and reliable. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0731684412459246">Table 2</xref> presents the values of flexural strengths mentioned above with their standard deviations within parentheses. As the values of the standard deviations were small, it can be argued that the values of maximum flexural strains were correct and reliable.
</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0731684412459246">Figure 4</xref> shows the flexural moduli of varying by wt% of nanoclay reinforced EP matrix composites. The Young’s modulus of the neat resin post-cured in an oven was 2.30 GPa. This rises very slowly to 2.43 GPa at 3 wt% of nanoclay. The change was only 5.6%. In fact, the flexural modulus values did not change much with varying wt% of the filler. The lowest value was 2.09 GPa at 7 wt% of nanoclay. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0731684412459246">Table 2</xref> presents the values of Young’s modulus mentioned above with their standard deviations within parentheses. Since most of the deviations were small, it can be argued that the results are correct and reliable.

<p>Siddiqui et al. used organoclay I30.P to fill Epon828 EP resin. These were clay/EP nanocomposites. They found that there was a significant increase of flexural modulus with increasing particulate loading, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0731684412459246">Figure 4</xref>. They discovered that the increase was particularly significant in the first few wt% of nanoclay.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0731684412459246">12</xref></sup> The increase from neat resin (2.87 GPa) to a composite with 7 wt% of nanoclay (3.89 GPa) was 35.5%. The composite with 7 wt% of nanoclay gave the highest flexural modulus. This is in line with the work of Khan et al., as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0731684412459246">Figure 4</xref>. The increase from neat resin (2.96 GPa) to a composite with 7 wt% of nanoclay (3.70 GPa) was 25%. Again, the composite with 7 wt% of nanoclay gave the highest flexural modulus. However, their results were different from those of this study because the flexural modulus values of this study barely changed much with varying wt% of nanoclay. Of course, the resin and nanoclay used were different and the Young’s modulus values of different EP resins were different, as pointed out by Cease et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0731684412459246">18</xref></sup> However, it can be argued that the trend of having Young’s modulus to increase with nanoparticle loading, as in the cases of Siddiqui et al. and Khan et al., would not continue with increasing wt% of nanoclay; the reverse would happen, as proved by Chan et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0731684412459246">23</xref></sup></p>

Siddiqui et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0731684412459246">17</xref></sup> It can be found that the values of the flexural modulus hardly changed with particulate loading like the ones obtained in this study.

The flexural moduli of neat resin and hybrid composites with 3 wt% of nanoclay were 78.9 and 83.9 GPa, respectively. The increase was only 5%. The composite with 3 wt% of nanoclay gave the highest flexural modulus. However, the increase in flexural modulus of the composite with 3 wt% of filler from that of neat resin was not far from that (5.6%) of this study and composite with 3 wt% of nanoclay in this study also gave the highest flexural modulus.

The striations and flow were the characteristics of the neat EP resin.

<p>This study has evaluated the flexural strength, maximum flexural strain and flexural modulus of varying percentage by weight of nanoclay reinforced EP resin; in all cases, the fluidity of the slurry composite was high and could be cast easily into moulds. The values of flexural strengths and flexural moduli had also been compared with those found by other studies and the values obtained in this study were sometimes higher but at the other times lower than their rivals; this is due to the different EP resins and types of nanoclay used. However, the trends of the flexural properties were the same. The values of flexural strength and maximum flexural modulus as well as flexural modulus of this study peaked at 3 wt% of nanoclay, and in another study (Khan et al.), the values of flexural strength peaked at 3 wt% of nanoclay but the flexural modulus peaked at 5 wt% of nanoclay. This is due to the different EP resins and types of nanoclay used. Finally, it is worth pointing out that in addition to the basic reinforcing mechanisms of nanoclay composites, intercalation and exfoliation, interlocking and bridging effects do exist in nanocomposites, as pointed by Chan et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0731684412459246">24</xref></sup></p>
