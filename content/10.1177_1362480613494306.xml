<p>The English riots of 2011 have generated a diverse and growing literature, much of it within criminology. This sizeable reader is one of the first collections on the riots, with many chapters originating as conference papers. Like many such collections, it exhibits a healthy eclecticism covering the riots from a variety of perspectives including race, gender and policing among others. It is to the credit of the editor to have quickly assembled such a wide-ranging collection.</p>
<p>A short review is inevitably selective. However, it is possible to detect an important discussion running through several of the chapters concerning the core character of the riots. Given the predominance of looting, especially as rioting spread beyond London to other urban centres in England, many discussions sought to examine whether the riots were about politics or consumption, a form of protest or a violent shopping spree.</p>
<p>Daniel Briggs, in his introduction, sees consumerism as trumping politics. On the basis of interviews with rioters conducted some time after the events he concludes that ‘it’s true that inequality and injustice play some role, but the narratives were also heavily structured around a desire for consumption—claiming the “free stuff” as they saw it’ (p. 36). Two problems are immediately evident. First, we are not told much about where these interviews come from and there is certainly no attempt at engagement—methodological or otherwise—with the large scale interviewing and research undertaken by the <italic>Reading the Riots</italic> project led by Tim Newburn. Indeed, throughout the book, the latter project receives only passing mentions. Yet it is undoubtedly the most systematic research on the riots to date, and the interviews conducted are highly relevant to the question of the nature of the rioters’ motives and behaviour. The further problem is that the polarity between ‘taking stuff’ on the one hand, and some notion of ‘politics’ on the other, remains largely unquestioned.</p>
<p>In Chapter 8, Simon Winlow and Steve Hall spend much theoretical energy wrestling with this polarity, and their conclusion that ‘the riot’s profoundly apolitical foreground of destructive nihilism and conformist consumerism concealed an incoherent and inarticulate political desire to change the entire socio-economic field’ (p. 156) is suggestive. They also note the exhaustion of both neoliberal capitalism and liberal parliamentary democracy in the present period. This does not sit easily with their conclusion that the outcome of the riots exhibited the ‘depressing triumph of liberal capitalist ideology’ (p. 153). Under such circumstances, might not ‘inarticulate political desire’ come to take new forms? The key issue that is not addressed is the dichotomy between looting and politics itself and whether the looting—with its associated innovations in collaboration and the use of social media—was in fact itself an emergent politics rather than simply a shopping spree. The rioters may have understood more about the crisis of liberal democracy than Winlow and Hall (or Briggs) give them credit for. Why march on Parliament when real power now lies with the banks and the markets? What better place to demonstrate this than through its theatrical re-enactment on the high street? If neoliberalism celebrates the identity of politics and consumption then ‘shopping’ and ‘taking stuff’ could be a very practical political critique of neoliberalism! These questions will become even more urgent if there are further riots in the near future.</p>
<p>Some of the other contributions to the collection can be situated within this problematic. Simon Harding’s theme in Chapter 10 of the hegemony of gang values in the riots stands alongside Winlow and Hall’s triumph of consumer culture as a further barrier to any new forms of collectivism emerging from the riots. Harding asserts, and it is little more than an assertion, that the riots (in London at least) ‘all had their genesis in the urban street gang’ (p. 198), despite evidence that the overwhelming majority of rioters were not gang members and the fact that the London gangs called a truce precisely to enable internecine warfare to be subsumed, for a short time, in the collective enterprise of rioting. For Harding, it seems, the truce actually enhanced gang power by drawing non-gang youth into the ambit and values of the gangs. How this happened is not clear. Such an argument tends to presuppose what it sets out to demonstrate: namely the overarching hegemony of gangs in the articulation of ‘street values’. It might more plausibly be maintained that gangs had to call a truce to accommodate their members being drawn into the wider street values and joining with non-gang affiliated youth in a riot process that owed little to gang organization as such. The idea that the riots themselves were born of real grievances which become articulated through ‘street values’, quite irrespective of gang membership, remains largely precluded in Harding’s account.</p>
<p>Other contributions provoke further thinking on the political nature of the riots. In Chapter 5, Tim Bateman deploys George Rude’s distinction, originally developed in the comparison of France and Britain in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, between the political crowd and the apolitical mob. Bateman rejects the contrast between the Brixton rioters of 1981 as a political crowd resisting repressive policing, and the 2011 rioters as an apolitical mob focused on looting. Stressing rather the similarities between 1981 and 2011, he argues that the apparent lack of politics in the latter events results more from the decline of an organized far left capable of giving political voice to a general revolt against social deprivation. Rather, the 2011 riots have to be seen as part of a wider process also involving the student demonstrations of the preceding year, and this gives a clue to their political content. Bateman contrasts this with the views of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1362480613494306">Slavoj Žižek (2011)</xref> that the 2011 rioters ‘had no message to deliver’. In this context it is worth at least considering ‘turning Žižek on his head’ and seeing the apparent absence of demands as the form taken by a much more profound rejection of neoliberal capitalism than in the earlier riots, and that this indeed is the reason why the government could not contemplate an official Scarman-type inquiry.</p>
<p>A similar position is taken by Axel Klein in Chapter 7, who begins by contrasting the British government’s support for the Arab Spring with its repressive attitude to domestic rioters, viewing the latter as part of a wave of popular revolt sweeping across large parts of Europe and the Middle East. He would not be the first to make this comparison. All riots and mass movements are uneven in terms of consciousness and political literacy. The European movements are more advanced in this respect, but the point is that the English events, if I read the argument correctly, are part of the same movement and can be seen as infused with the same ‘moral economy’ (Klein here deploys Edward Thompson’s famous terminology) concerning beliefs about injustice. Klein’s chapter could have been better placed in the final section of the book which purports to deal explicitly with the international context of the 2011 riots, in particular the Arab Spring and the political turmoil in Greece. The opportunity is, however, largely missed and a connection with the issues raised by Klein is not really made. In Chapter 16, John Strawson contributes an excellent discussion of the fall of the Mubarak regime in Egypt which remains just that. The following chapter on the Spanish movements is similarly insulated from any comparison with England.</p>
<p>Briggs contributes the penultimate chapter by focusing on Greece and portraying himself as a latter day Thucydides (<italic>sic</italic>), determined to document ‘what happened’. But despite a potted history of Greece, a brief nod to contrasts with England, we learn largely what we already knew: that the Greek events have been far more politicized than in the UK and that the associated demonstrations are performative events rather than chaotic looting. The most glaring omission in the account of ‘what happened’ in Greece is any sustained discussion of the emergence of new forms of politics at both ends of the political spectrum—Syriza on the left and Golden Dawn on the far right, and their comparison with the English situation. Does Syriza, for example, represent the sort of radical political coalition, already in evidence in other parts of the European Union, potentially able to give the rioters on the streets some sense of political direction? Were the 2011 English riots indicative of a political blockage? This relates back to Bateman’s discussion of the impact on the English riots of the decline of the far left. Meanwhile, the strength of Golden Dawn contrasts with the timid performance of the English Defence League in the 2011 riots as documented in Chapter 12 by Joel Busher. Might that change?</p>
<p>All these questions are open and one certainly does not demand a finished discussion on such an urgent theme. This collection is certainly a useful contribution.</p>
