<abstract>
<p>Retirement is an expected phase of life that is made meaningful through social discourses such as master narratives. This study identified and explored a master narrative of retirement. Eighty-four individuals were interviewed representing four work experience phases. A thematic analysis revealed a master narrative of retirement that shaped expectations for retirement. Participants consistently narrated retirement as the ultimate marker of individual success and freedom. Two fractures appeared in this master narrative: the freedom/routine fracture and the individual responsibility/universal expectations fracture. These fractures created tension within the master narrative of retirement. This study has implications for social class as well as implications for the ways in which master narratives are interwoven into the cultural fabric of society.</p>

<p>Retirement is a social construct that is learned throughout a person’s working life. Communication is an essential part of this learning. Most scholarship examining retirement focuses on the nature of retirement as voluntary or involuntary, the reasons for retirement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0893318912438687">Hanisch, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0893318912438687">Weiss, 2005</xref>), retirement planning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0893318912438687">Taylor &amp; Doverspike, 2003</xref>), or on other specific forms of retirement such as early retirement programs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0893318912438687">Robertson, 2000</xref>). Very little of the retirement literature focuses on how retiring individuals understand this life process.</p>
<p>The original purpose of this study was to explore the social construction of retirement as a socialization narrative occurring over time. However, repetitiveness of stories across a highly diverse group of study participants made it clear that something beyond socialization was happening. On further analysis, it also became clear that career models were not useful in predicting retirement narratives. Researchers should be particularly attentive when a diverse group of people tell very similar personal stories, especially when their experiences should be as diverse as the people telling the stories. The participants for this study diverged widely in terms of age, work experience, income, marital status, race, and class, yet all of the participants provided versions of the same story, suggesting that they were speaking from a master narrative of retirement.</p>
<p>The communication construct of the master narrative (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0893318912438687">Adame &amp; Knudson, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0893318912438687">Deetz, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0893318912438687">Tannen, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0893318912438687">Trethewey, 2001</xref>) offers an intriguing means to explore how people come to understand what it means to retire. For this article, we define master narrative as a larger cultural narrative that silently shapes local narratives about a given construct by laying cultural resources or norms over local narratives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0893318912438687">Tannen, 2008</xref>). That is, a master narrative is an overarching story told by a culture that produces expectations and norms within the culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0893318912438687">Bergen, 2010</xref>). As they are communicative in nature, master narratives are ripe for exploration by communication scholars. Like all social narratives, retirement is subject to cultural prescriptions, making the master narrative a useful lens through which narratives about retirement can be explored. The purpose of this article is to explore the social construction of this master narrative of retirement and to understand its implications for discourses about work. In the following sections, we review literature regarding master narratives and retirement, explore the research that reveals a master narrative of retirement, and discuss conclusions and implications of this research.</p>
<sec id="section1-0893318912438687">
<title>Master Narratives</title>
<p>Master narratives are cultural tropes that influence the ways in which personal narratives are constructed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0893318912438687">Bergen, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0893318912438687">Tannen, 2008</xref>). As such, master narratives are a form of social domination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0893318912438687">Mumby, 1993</xref>) that can be both supported and rejected within personal narratives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0893318912438687">Bergen, 2010</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0893318912438687">Tannen (2008)</xref> offers the most specific and conceptually rich mapping of the relationship between master narratives and personal narratives. According to Tannen, there are three types of narratives. Small-n narratives represent the personal stories and experiences of the story teller. Big-N Narratives are the larger story lines that create a cohesive and contextual space for the recounting of small-n narratives. The master narrative is “a culture-wide ideology that shapes the big-N Narrative” (p. 209). People do not always specify the master narrative, but instead it emerges through the consistency of the big-N Narratives that shape the recounting of small-n narratives.</p>
<p>Master narratives are embedded within the framework of our society in such a way as to provide order and reinforce a master truth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0893318912438687">Boje, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0893318912438687">Bruner, 2001</xref>) that is then communicated during interactions. Master narratives have been studied in relation to multiple embedded societal discourses concerning, for example, war (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0893318912438687">Schwalbe, Silcock, &amp; Keith, 2008</xref>), sisterhood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0893318912438687">Tannen, 2008</xref>), and marriage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0893318912438687">Bergen, 2010</xref>). However, when considering issues of work, organizing, and retirement, two master narratives are of particular significance. One master narrative creates cultural expectations for aging. Specifically, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0893318912438687">Gullette (1997)</xref> articulates the presence of the master narrative of aging-as-decline, in which aging is automatically associated with both physical and mental degeneration. The master narrative of decline is enhanced in the workplace where notions of aging are compressed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0893318912438687">Olson, Coffelt, Dougherty, &amp; Gynn, 2007</xref>), particularly for women who are considered older workers at a relatively young age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0893318912438687">Trethewey, 2001</xref>). According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0893318912438687">Trethewey (2001)</xref>, midlife professional women must answer to a master narrative of aging as decline that suggests that women’s minds and bodies begin to deteriorate as they age. The master narrative of decline is so pervasive that it prevents individuals from looking for alternative narratives to explain changes that occur in the aging process. Similarly, the master narrative of decline influences those who are younger to view those who are older in a particularly negative sense. For example, discourses of involuntary unemployment tend to shift depending on the age of the referent population, with older workers discursively crafted as in decline and therefore as undesirable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0893318912438687">Ainsworth &amp; Hardy, 2008</xref>). The midlife professional working women in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0893318912438687">Trethewey’s (2001)</xref> study often rejected this overwhelming discourse and resisted its application to them by concentrating on the benefits of aging and crafting new identities for themselves.</p>
<p>Another important master narrative influencing the participants in the present study is the American Dream. The American Dream constitutes a national identity based on the ideals of independence, upward mobility, equality, and freedom (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0893318912438687">Cullen, 2003</xref>). Although the American Dream is unique to the United States, many of its components, such as independence, success, and freedom constitute cultural stories that cross multiple cultures internationally. Specifically, “a strong work ethic, centered on individual initiative, is the key to realizing the American Dream” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0893318912438687">Lair, Sullivan, &amp; Cheney, 2005</xref>, p. 322). There is also a moral component of the American Dream in that people who are hard working and independent deserve to achieve upward mobility. Those who do not achieve upward mobility are cast as morally problematic and therefore unworthy of our concern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0893318912438687">Winslow, 2010</xref>). The American Dream is one key way in which the illusion of the United States as a classless society is communicated. Like all social class discourses, the American Dream is both fluid and stable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0893318912438687">Dougherty, 2011</xref>). As a result, although the primary themes of self-reliance and hard work remain relatively stable, the means through which the dream is achieved shifts and evolves across time and contexts.</p>
<p>Interestingly, small-n narratives supported by the American Dream master narrative tend to mask the ways in which social class, race, age, and gender influence who can achieve the American Dream. In these narratives, both success and failure are attributed to the individual, deflecting attention from group obstacles to achieving the success (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0893318912438687">Smith, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0893318912438687">Winslow, 2010</xref>). For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0893318912438687">Lair et al. (2005)</xref> identified the corporate notion of personal branding as a means of self-commodification in which success and failure are perceived to be the result of individual effort. By focusing on the individual, “personal branding treats race, age, and class in a similar manner [to gender] by excluding them from conversation of who is allowed to succeed through personal branding” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0893318912438687">Lair et al., 2005</xref>, p. 330). In other words, those attributes that are used to create systematic differences in access to success are discursively erased, creating the perception of equality where none exists. The individualism apparent in the American Dream also appears in narrative accounts of the “enterprising self” that come from other national cultures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0893318912438687">Ainsworth &amp; Hardy, 2008</xref>), suggesting that the American Dream is not fully exclusive to U.S. culture.</p>

<title>Retirement and Master Narratives</title>
<p>In the United States, retirement is a relatively new phenomenon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0893318912438687">Achenbaum, 2006</xref>). Prior to social security, older people were often pushed out of the workplace but continued to work in some capacity, largely because there was no retirement system to support them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0893318912438687">Achenbaum, 2006</xref>). With social security came the notion of retirement as the golden years of leisure and freedom (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0893318912438687">Achenbaum, 2006</xref>). Nonetheless, a strong association continues between retirement and crisis and decline. Some research, however, has begun to document a growing connection between retirement and lifestyle benefits. Specifically, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0893318912438687">Jones, Leontowitsch, and Higgs (2010)</xref> found that early retirees both conferred status on their early retirement because of their ability to choose to retire and experienced anxiety over the loss of status associated with not working. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0893318912438687">Simpson and Cheney (2007)</xref> documented a more systematic marketing of retirement as an active lifestyle in two retirement communities. It is fairly clear that the meaning of retirement has evolved considerably over the years.</p>
<p>Retirement is closely linked to identity and that identity development begins as people anticipate what working life will be like (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0893318912438687">Reitzes &amp; Mutran, 2006</xref>). Work identities develop early and are refined and enhanced as a person proceeds through the working phase of life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0893318912438687">Reitzes &amp; Mutran, 2006</xref>). As a result, it is unlikely that this identity developed over a long period of time becomes obsolete when retirement occurs. Not surprisingly, then, retired people still primarily associate themselves with their professional identities, although they also have a larger identity repertoire than nonretired individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0893318912438687">Teuscher, 2010</xref>). Additional research suggests that retirement identity can be mediated by factors such as health status, race, and socioeconomic status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0893318912438687">Reitzes &amp; Mutran, 2006</xref>). Nonetheless, working role identity continues to have a long-term influence on retirement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0893318912438687">Reitzes &amp; Mutran, 2006</xref>). Consequently, although most people link their identities to their present or past employment, retired people talk about themselves in a much more expansive way by including leisure activities, volunteer work, and organizational memberships, for example (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0893318912438687">Teuscher, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Suggestive of a master narrative is the adjustment people must make to their new lifestyle. Since retirement is so closely linked to identity, experiencing retirement takes some adjustment. The experience of retirement has been shown to have a deep impact on the life of the individual who is ending the working phase of life. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0893318912438687">Weiss (2005)</xref> discovered that although each individual’s experience of retirement is unique, all retirees must cope with the same two challenges: managing the threat of being marginalized and using the freedom expected during retirement. He contended that the way individuals manage those challenges will determine their adjustment to retirement. Interestingly, managing marginalization and using retirement freedom seem to segue with the master narrative of aging as decline and the American Dream. As people age, they become marginalized as mentally and physically in decline and therefore as unable to contribute to society (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0893318912438687">Harwood, 2007</xref>). Retirement is the ultimate signifier of aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0893318912438687">Achenbaum, 2006</xref>) and therefore feeds into the master narrative of decline. However, the American Dream suggests that the ability to retire is the ultimate marker of success. If one works hard enough and smart enough, then they will have earned a period of leisure and freedom from work. Master narratives, of course, oversimplify social reality by asking people within a given culture to focus on specific narratives while ignoring others. Retirement is highly complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0893318912438687">Buse, 2009</xref>). If people create a culturally simple story of retirement, it is likely that a master narrative of retirement is at work.</p>
<p>Circumstances surrounding retirement—both the decision to retire and the adjustment to it—are likely to be influenced by a master narrative of retirement. To understand how a master narrative permeates societal discourse, it is important to consider how individuals of various ages and levels of experience communicate about retirement. Therefore, the following research questions will be explored:</p>

<sec id="section4-0893318912438687">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>Eighty-four individuals representing four work-life stages were interviewed for this study. Participants were recruited using snowball and maximum variation sampling to include participants with a wide range of characteristics and life experiences. Each group contained at least 20 participants and was diverse in terms of work experience, age (18-82), race (African American, 10; African, 1; Asian, 3; White, 64; Hispanic, 2; Native American 1; Not specified, 3), gender (male, 41; female, 43), and social class (both in terms of income and job performed). Readers can contact the corresponding author for a complete demographic accounting of the participants.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0893318912438687">
<title>Procedures</title>
<p>Interviews were conducted in 2007, just before the brunt of the impact was felt from the massive recession that began in 2007. Most participants lived in the Midwest or Southern United States, although some were from other U.S. areas such as the West Coast. Semistructured interviews were conducted using interview guides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0893318912438687">Lindlof &amp; Taylor, 2002</xref>). To understand each participant’s construction of retirement, participants were asked to bring an item to the interview that represented retirement to them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0893318912438687">Hurdley, 2006</xref>). This served as a conversation-starter that allowed the interviewer to gain more insight into the meanings participants assigned to retirement.</p>
<p>Research suggests that a process orientation to work-life cycle is an appropriate way of exploring how people experience organizational exit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0893318912438687">Jablin, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0893318912438687">Super, 1980</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0893318912438687">Super (1980)</xref> discusses a career development model that follows the life span. We, too, use a life-span orientation toward work to ground this study. To explore retirement as a process that occurs across organizational life, participants were categorized into one of four groups based on work experience. The anticipatory phase represents individuals who have begun training for a selected occupation. The early work-life phase represents the early time in an individual’s occupation. The preretirement phase represents individuals who believe that they are within 10 years of retiring from work. Finally, the retired group represents what happens as an organizational member exits the occupation due to retirement.</p>
<p>Interviews were conducted at locations throughout the communities where the participants lived. Interview protocols varied somewhat for each group so as to better illicit work-life phase experiences. Participants were not given incentives to participate. Interviews across all work experience groups lasted on average 40 min; however, the average interview time within each group varied. As participants advanced in work experience, they also participated in longer conversations about retirement. Developmental models of work suggest these differences may be a result of more experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0893318912438687">Jablin, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0893318912438687">Super, 1980</xref>). From a master narrative perspective, all of the participants had developed the big-N Narrative, but some did not have the experience to provide a small-n narrative. Interviews were recorded using a digital voice recorder designed for interviewing and transcription. Interviews continued until saturation was achieved and beyond to ensure depth of participants’ experiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0893318912438687">Strauss &amp; Corbin, 1998</xref>).</p>
<p>Participants’ experiences were transcribed word-for-word by the first author and a trained transcriber. The hired transcriber signed a written confidentiality notice. Identifying information was removed from the transcripts to protect confidentiality of the participants. Transcriptions produced 751 single-spaced pages of data. All transcriptions were thoroughly checked for accuracy with the audio recordings.</p>

<sec id="section6-0893318912438687">
<title>Analytical Procedures</title>
<p>A traveler metaphor was used to guide the interview process for this study. The traveler metaphor requires that researchers recognize themselves as part of the co-construction of meaning. When using the traveler metaphor, the researcher wanders with the meanings as they emerge in the data, willingly dropping expectations and trying on new explanations for emergent meanings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0893318912438687">Kvale &amp; Brinkmann, 2009</xref>). To assist in our openness to emergent meanings, we used a thematic analysis. A thematic analysis allows the interviewer to make unique connections with the emerging imagery of the interviews (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0893318912438687">Van Manen, 1997</xref>).</p>
<p>Thematic analysis involved a process of data management, reduction, and conceptual development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0893318912438687">Lindlof &amp; Taylor, 2002</xref>). During the interviewing and transcribing process, a separate document was created in which memos were written about possible themes and questions related to the data. After the transcription was complete, data analysis was conducted using NVivo 7 qualitative research management software. NVivo 7 allows researchers to sort large qualitative data sets thematically. Codes were created in NVivo 7 by highlighting meaningful phrases and stories within the imported transcripts and naming them with a code. These codes were then linked together into categories. Because of the volume of data, it was necessary to reduce the analysis to those emergent categories that seemed most urgent or present in the participants’ experiences. For the present analysis, we noted a curious tendency for highly positive expectations for retirement emerging persistently among the participants, regardless of their years of work experience or demographic categories. Codes such as “worry-free,” “unstructured time,” “leisure,” and “lack of pressure” continued to reoccur. As participants continued to discuss retirement in positive terms, the master narrative theme as well as fractures in the narration became evident as a persistent part of the retirement discussion among all participants in each working group.</p>
<p>Themes were then verified. Verification attests to the credibility and transferability of the findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0893318912438687">Creswell, 2003</xref>). Creswell recommends that at least two forms of verification are used in any qualitative study. This study used both member check and rich, thick description. Overall, 15 participants responded to the member check. All member checks agreed with the interpretation of their experience. No changes were made as a result of their comments. The second form of verification was rich, thick description in which large sections of transcripts are provided, exemplifying the themes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0893318912438687">Creswell, 2003</xref>). This allows the reader to determine the transferability of the participants’ experiences.</p>

<sec id="section7-0893318912438687">
<title>A Master Narrative of Retirement</title>
<p>A master narrative of retirement emerged among these participants as a guiding cultural story about retirement. The following paragraphs demonstrate that, first, the master narrative of retirement is deeply enmeshed in the master narrative of the American Dream in that retirement is the ultimate marker of success and freedom. Second, similar to other studies exploring master narratives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0893318912438687">Bergen, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0893318912438687">Tannen, 2008</xref>), there were fractures in the master narrative of retirement. We also include a critique of the master narrative of retirement.</p>
<sec id="section8-0893318912438687">
<title>Retirement as Freedom</title>
<p>Retirement was described by participants as a chance for freedom. In narrative form, participants collectively described a story of working for a time—paying their dues—and then having the ability to stop working and live a life free of work in retirement. Of course, retirement is not achievable for all, especially for those who come from a lower socioeconomic class. Nonetheless, all participants, regardless of social class told their story through a master narrative of retirement. To illustrate the persistent commonalities, we provide quotations from a diverse group of people from each of the work-life stages represented in this study.</p>
<sec id="section9-0893318912438687">
<title>Anticipatory group</title>
<p>The anticipatory group, despite their inexperience in the workplace, told a similar narrative about retirement as did more experienced study participants. This master narrative was made particularly evident as participants discussed the item they brought to the interview that symbolized retirement. Objects included items related to travel, time, golf and other hobbies, flowers, pay stubs, and photographs. Each of these objects symbolized the freedom obtained through retirement. The following are examples taken from individual narratives that demonstrate contribution to this master narrative:
<disp-quote>
<p>. . . I brought a beach towel because, this just kind of like reminds me of summer and like going to the pool. Doing what I . . . like during the summer I don’t have a lot of responsibilities. Just kind of do whatever I want. . . . So that to me is like what I want my retirement to be like. . . . It’s just kind of like a never ending summer. (White female, 18 years old, college journalism major)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This young, female college student used the metaphor of summer to symbolize retirement. In the summer, she did not have to contend with the responsibilities that plagued her the rest of the year. She had no restrictions on time and no worries. Retirement, as she characterized it, was also a time of no worries or responsibilities. Another participant in the anticipatory group also described freedom in retirement.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Uh, [retirement] means uh, not really having to worry about a whole lot of money. You know, having all the toys and things that I’ve wanted. Like a house and yada yada. And then uh, just kinda traveling around and doing whatever. (25-year-old White male, sheet metal apprentice)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This participant indicated that he would not have to be concerned about money in retirement and he could buy the things he had always wanted. Financial freedom is an important part of this master narrative of retirement. Note the similarity in the story told by these anticipatory group members. Despite the social class differences in career training, retirement expectations were surprisingly similar. It was as though their working phase of life would end in financial reward. Turn in your work clothes and receive your check—you are now set for life.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0893318912438687">
<title>Early work life</title>
<p>The early work-life group told similar stories about what retirement would be like. The similarities of these stories were persistent across this highly diverse group of participants. For example, a 26-year-old White male marketing manager used a symbol that represented freedom in retirement:
<disp-quote>
<p>. . . I brought a blank sheet of paper. . . . Because the more I thought about that, I thought, you know, that really symbolizes retirement for me, because, the whole idea is, I can do anything I want. And I don’t have to pick one thing or I don’t have to pick a couple of things that I want to focus my attention on. I can do everything I want. . . . And so, and if I want to change in the middle of it and say, “You know what? I really, I’m really focused on family and I’m going to travel and see family.” And then halfway through that if I decide, “You know what? I’ve had enough family. I want to travel to Fiji. I’m going to Fiji!” Whether, you know, it fits with what I planned or not. I’m just going to do whatever strikes me at the moment. (White male, 26 years old, marketing manager)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Again, this participant describes retirement as something that will free him of responsibility. Furthermore, he does not have to make decisions about what he will do. He is carefree. Retirement is a blank page—a book on which he can write his own story. The next quotation comes from a 46-year-old Black female secretary. This early work-life group participant also described retirement as a form of freedom as represented through vacations and spontaneity:
<disp-quote>
<p>[Retirement is] a long vacation. An extended vacation, I mean you know, where, it’s something that’s kinda spontaneous. You know, where it’s not, it’s not anything thought out and planned out. It’s just something spontaneous. Just because I can. Yeah. So I guess you know, frequent trips, frequent vacations, you know, just little trips. (African American female, 43 years old, secretary)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>When asked to describe retirement, this participant identified the ability to be spontaneous as part of the freedom in the retirement phase of life. Like other participants, she envisioned a fulfilling life without planning—a freedom from routine. A spontaneous vacation implies having the financial freedom to travel. Although the two early work-life participants quoted here are different in many ways such as gender, race, age, and income levels, they both view retirement as the opportunity to be free from worry, schedules, and financial concerns.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0893318912438687">
<title>Preretirement</title>
<p>Members of the preretirement group told similar stories about retirement as freedom. A participant in the preretirement group used the metaphor of a bonus to describe retirement:
<disp-quote>
<p>Oh, I think to think about [retirement] is just a wonderful feeling. I love people. . . . I love being outside, but I love that feeling of having the freedom just to sit and do that. That’s what I see um, retirement. Retirement is the freedom to follow your dreams. I guess if I were to symbolize. . . . I think retirement’s a bonus. It’s kind of . . . a raise or a bonus, for living and being productive and having given something to the community and to yourself. (White female, 60 years old, receptionist)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Similar to other preretirement participants, this participant focused on all the options she would have in retirement. A single mother and receptionist, her financial situation did not allow her to dream of trips to Fiji whenever she wanted them, as the early work-life participant dreamed; however, she focused on the dreams she felt she could attain—meeting people, going on a driving trip around the country, sitting on the front porch. Her narrative painted a picture of someone who had worked hard and been productive and who at the end of that life-phase received the bonus of retirement—the bonus of freedom.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0893318912438687">
<title>Retirees</title>
<p>Similar to the anticipatory, early work life, and preretirement groups, the retirees also perpetuated this master narrative of retirement by focusing on the good things retirement had brought them. The positive focus persisted across retirees, regardless of age, race, gender, or social class. For example, an 82-year-old African American man discussed how retirement offered him and his wife the opportunity to pursue activities they had always wanted to do. He brought a photograph from a family cruise he and his wife had taken for an anniversary. When asked why that photo represented retirement to him, he responded,
<disp-quote>
<p>Because it, uh, reminds me of, that’s something that [wife] and I always did for fun activities, cruises and travel. We traveled to Europe, uh, 5 times. We went to Japan, so traveling was really our forte. And we looked forward to retirement to expand our travel experiences. (African American male, 82 years old, retired director of guidance)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This retiree did get to live out the dream of traveling in retirement. He embodied this master narrative of retirement through his ability to spend time with family, travel, and enjoy freedom retirement supposedly offers to all. It is not altogether surprising that this man viewed retirement as freedom. Interestingly, other participants who did not have the same economic advantages as this man told similar stories. For example, a White female title clerk who was forced into retirement also described the freedom she had obtained in retirement:</p>
<speech>
<speaker>Janet:</speaker>
<p>Well, I did bring a little travel alarm.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Interviewer:</speaker>
<p>A travel alarm!</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Janet:</speaker>
<p>I mean just a clock, in general.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Interviewer:</speaker>
<p>Oh, ok. Why? Talk to me about that.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Janet:</speaker>
<p>Ok. Really, that is what . . . I think I’ve had such a structured life, getting up, going to work, it was so nice after retirement to turn over in bed and see, maybe it was 7:00 and “Gee Whiz! It’s 7:00. I’d be on my way to work maybe,” or that type of thing. So that was mainly, I think, that.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Interviewer:</speaker>
<p>So having time?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Janet:</speaker>
<p>Yes. Uh, being unstructured, I guess you’d say. (White female, 66 years old, retired title clerk)</p>
</speech>
<p>This 66-year-old, White female participant embodies the notion of retirement as freedom from routine. She was released from her job and forced into retirement. When she wrote her yearly income on the demographic questionnaire before starting the interview, she looked at the interviewer and said, “Isn’t that pathetic?” Her socioeconomic status would have been characterized as lower-middle class; however, despite her involuntary retirement and low income as a result, she ultimately saw retirement as an opportunity to be unstructured.</p>
<p>With these descriptions of retirement, who would not want to be retired? Participants talked about retirement in a way that sounded so inviting. Retirement represented freedom from a constraining life of work, worries, and schedules. A dreamy look would come over the participants’ faces as they would describe hopping on a plane to Fiji or Europe, taking the RV to see the changing of the leaves in New England, sleeping as late as they wanted and reading the morning paper, or pursuing the hobby they always wanted to master but never had the opportunity. This master narrative of retirement was not limited to participants who were anticipating retirement. Those who were retired also narrated retirement as an affirming experience, while also mentioning that perhaps there were some negative effects such as missing coworkers or declining health and ability; however, even in those discussions of the difficulties in retirement, retirees overall felt satisfied with their decision to retire—even when it was a forced retirement.</p>
<p>The master narrative of retirement also reflects the participants’ construction of work. If retirement means freedom from responsibilities, schedules, and restraints, work means having those characteristics. Constrained by bosses, calendars, deadlines, and punch clocks, workers see retirement as their opportunity to free themselves into a life that <italic>they</italic> control as opposed to a life that is controlled by work. Interestingly, the master narrative of retirement was resilient to different types of work performed and persisted regardless of the prestige of the participants’ employment.</p>

<title>Fractures in this Master Narrative</title>
<p>Scholarship on master narratives suggest that master narratives are often accompanied by cracks and fissures that need to be accounted for by the story teller (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0893318912438687">Bergen, 2010</xref>). It is therefore not particularly surprising that fractures in the master narrative of retirement also emerged. These fractures do not eliminate the power of the master narrative nor do they allow for its total reconstitution. Instead, they illustrate the various ways in which language reconstructs an imperfect cultural story. For this article, a fracture will be defined as an inconsistency described by participants that contradicts a master narrative. Two fractures in the master narrative of retirement emerged: the freedom/routine fracture and an individual responsibility/universal expectation fracture.</p>
<sec id="section14-0893318912438687">
<title>Freedom/routine fracture</title>
<p>The participants in this study simultaneously anticipated retirement because of the freedom from routine while fearing retirement because of the freedom from routine. This tension between the desire for freedom and the need for routine represents the first fracture in the master narrative of retirement. The participants frequently mentioned multiple forms of freedom associated with retirement, such as financial freedom and freedom to travel. However, freedom from routine was one of the most frequently mentioned forms of freedom these participants felt retirement would offer. The freedom/routine fracture was revealed by participants as they discussed the rewards of retirement as freedom from routine while indicating that they also needed the routine and schedule provided by work.</p>
<p>When participants who were not retired were asked if they would change anything about their work if they woke up the next day US$10 million richer than they were the day before, most participants said they would not retire, at least not right away. The analysis of these data revealed that participants were more likely to “still work” (49), “volunteer” (11), or “open a business” (11) than “quit” (8). Despite the fact that these participants almost universally indicated a yearning for retirement so they could have various forms of freedoms, the participants’ need for routine was so important to them that they would forgo the other forms of freedom expressed in the master narrative of retirement, such as the freedom to travel, in order to maintain the routine provided through work. Consider this example of the freedom/routine fracture:
<disp-quote>
<p>Ten million dollars richer . . . hmmmm . . . well, if it was tomorrow I’d definitely move back home. And I’d still look for, or maybe start my own business. Or, just something, you know. I have the money to venture, just something I was curious about and start my own company there. But definitely I wouldn’t stop working though. Not right now cause I think I might lose a little bit of myself or my motivation if I’m just . . . You know, you can’t shop everyday and get motivated or go to the pool every day. Think you need a little bit of mental work out or something. (Hispanic female, 28 years old, computer support technician)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This participant indicated that too much unstructured activity would cause mental and motivational deterioration. If she stopped working, she would lose part of herself and therefore she would not stop working, or retire, if she had the opportunity. Like other participants, she described the need to maintain a schedule to keep herself motivated.</p>
<p>Another interesting reason participants desired a schedule is to stay busy. Retirees described their typical days or weeks with much routine and at least a self-imposed schedule. Although participants described retirement as an opportunity to be freed from a schedule and activities, they also stated that the schedule and activities were important in retirement.</p>
<speech>
<speaker>Interviewer:</speaker>
<p>. . . Is there a typical retiree in your particular line of work?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Veronica:</speaker>
<p>. . . I don’t, my line of work, I don’t think people seriously retire. Cause if they’re, if they’re not doing this, or if they’re retired, they wanna sub. What is that all about? [laughing] You know, they want to go back and they want to sub, they want to be . . . So I [sigh]. That’s kind of a hard question to answer too.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Interviewer:</speaker>
<p>Any guess about why? Why do they, either not retire or they wanna come back to it?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Veronica:</speaker>
<p>I think, more so like I am. Um. Bored. Bored. Have worked so many years and just changing the routine is just hard. Um, um. That would be my notion. You know, the routine is just hard. It’s hard to get out and say, you know, I’m gonna get up today and I’m gonna go to work. You know, it’s just hard to say, “No, I’m gonna get up. No, I’m gonna go back to bed.” You know. “I’ll get up some other time.” You know. I, I just think, just the change of routine is hard for them to switch over to, not doing anything at all. That would be my, the way I would be. (African American female, 43 years old, secretary)</p>
</speech>
<p>This participant discussed how it was important to have routine and a reason to get out of bed in the morning. Earlier in the interview, she indicated that she was looking forward to retirement and being able to watch television when she wanted; however, she was also interested in obtaining part-time work that would offer her a flexible schedule. She described herself as someone who enjoyed work and so retirement would offer her a chance to work in a part-time, flexible job.</p>
<p>Activities in particular were viewed as important so that individuals could remain healthy. Participants in all work experience groups indicated that individuals who do not stay busy or have a routine in retirement often died sooner than those who stayed active. Particularly in the preretirement group, staying healthy and active was a common concern among those reaching retirement age. The emphasis on staying active in retirement also implies that work provides an important element to one’s self-identity. Although work may be constraining, it also provides purpose in an otherwise unstructured life. An individual’s identity is tied up in those schedules and constraints such that a retired life without any structure may leave one without an identity to pursue. Therefore, work provides meaning and identity that must be revised when one is retired.</p>
<p>The result of the freedom/routine fracture could be due to the proliferation of competing master narratives. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0893318912438687">Gullette (1997)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0893318912438687">Trethewey (2001)</xref> described the master narrative of aging-as-decline in which as people age they are viewed as less productive and able. Furthermore, the master narrative of the protestant work ethic promotes the importance of work and being productive. Someone who does not work is not useful to society. Retirees are generally older and therefore they are seen as declining in ability. They are “allowed” to stop working due to their declining status. Younger workers are not in a state of decline. Therefore, even if they were to benefit from a financial windfall, the combined master narratives of aging-as-decline and the protestant work ethic would not allow them to stop working. Master narratives of age and work ethic compete with this master narrative of retirement to make the freedoms enjoyed in retirement potentially stigmatizing. The next fracture in this master narrative centers on individual responsibility/universal expectations.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-0893318912438687">
<title>Individual responsibility/universal expectations fracture</title>
<p>Participants in this study universally expected that they would have freedom in retirement. Although the most persistent anticipated form of freedom was from routine, regardless of their income the participants also universally expected financial freedom in retirement. However, despite the universal expectation of freedom in retirement, successful retirement was deemed to be fully the individual’s responsibility. This fracture describes how freedom in retirement, just like success in the American Dream, is individualized. In one sense, this master narrative of retirement is one filled with hope and promise. Of course, people are going to look forward to a time in life when they do not have to worry about responsibility or money; however, is that a reality for all retirees? Previous research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0893318912438687">Calasanti &amp; Slevin, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0893318912438687">Gibson, 1987</xref>), and stories from the present study, would suggest that it is not. Although the participants in this study did not anticipate much hardship for themselves in retirement, participants did talk about others who were unhappy in retirement or unable to retire at all. Failure to achieve the master narrative of retirement was placed firmly on the shoulders of the individual. Consider the following example:</p>
<speech>
<speaker>Interviewer:</speaker>
<p>Describe someone you know who’s retired.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Matthew:</speaker>
<p>One person, in mind in particular, a minister who retired. I see him occasionally. He’s a good friend. The most miserable man I guess I know.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Interviewer:</speaker>
<p>Why?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Matthew:</speaker>
<p>He feels like he gave and gave and gave and gave all those years and he now feels like nobody cares. He has, his wife has died, he has two children who are somewhat involved in his life, but they have their own lives. And he sits alone and feels sorry for himself, a good bit of the time. And I’m not blaming his children and I’m not blaming the churches he used to serve. I’m saying he needs to get off and get on. He needs to get going. And I’ve tried to help him do that a little bit, but he doesn’t feel good. He’s, uh, at 60-, probably now he’s 69 or 70. And uh, he is not in real good physical health, but he wasn’t enjoying his retirement at 62. He retired the day he could, at 62, with very limited social security income. And, unfortunately through the years, he hasn’t been able to save much. So he just doesn’t have much income. But he did not want any more of the preaching life, at all. . . . And just miserable. That’s not what I want. And I, I still think that there’s an obligation on the part of the family, and on the part of the brethren and all that to be compassionate and all that, but by and large, it’s up to the individual. (White male, 61 years old, minister)</p>
</speech>
<p>This participant described someone he knew who was retired from his own occupation. As he described this person’s misery, he indicated that really the retiree had only himself to blame. This master narrative of retirement—which describes a life filled with happiness—is not automatic. The individual is responsible for his or her own happiness. Other participants concurred as below:
<disp-quote>
<p>I guess it all depends on the person. Some people you know, retirement just kinda brings ‘em down. And then some people enjoy retirement immensely. They’re just like, “I’m happy, I don’t have to do, I can do what I wanna do. Freedom.” But it all depends on the individual. (African American female, 43 years old, secretary)</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>[long pause] I think there are two kinds of retirees. I think that there are retirees that are stuck with no job and limited income. And they’re trapped as far as what they can do. And then there are the retirees that planned in advance for that. (White female, 43 years old, graphic artist)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>These participants are clear that the failure to experience freedom in retirement is a result of poor planning on the part of the individual. Interestingly, although the participants questioned others’ abilities to achieve a successful retirement, none of the participants questioned their own ability to achieve a successful retirement. For example, one anticipatory participant described his grandparent’s anxiety-laden retirement and then explained that life was too short for that type of anxiety so he was going to “go for it” (White male, 26 years old, sheet metal worker). Like many of the participants in this study, this man had not yet enacted his plan for retirement.</p>
<p>This fracture of this master narrative of retirement is parallel to the American Dream. As promoted in the American Dream, success is an individual pursuit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0893318912438687">Hochschild, 1995</xref>). Retirement is viewed the same way in this master narrative. Everyone has the opportunity to be happy and have freedom in retirement. If you do not have freedom in retirement, it is your own fault. Thus the class-based reality that underlies the American Dream is reproduced. Individuals who have the means to be happy and have financial freedom in retirement see that as a natural reward of their hard work. Those who do not have the means to fulfill this master narrative of retirement in their lives are blamed for their own misfortune. In fact, the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0893318912438687">U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (2008)</xref> found that the number of senior citizens working full-time has been steadily increasing since the late 1990s. In 2007, 56% of full-time workers were older workers. There are many possible reasons for this continual increase, but one reason may be that these individuals must continue to work full-time or reenter full-time employment because they were unable to live out the master narrative of freedom in retirement. By believing in this master narrative of retirement, individuals who are not living out their retirement years in bliss are forced to live with the stigma of having brought this state of life on themselves.</p>
<p>Despite the articulation of this master narrative of retirement being positive and hopeful, these and other participants remarked that they knew, or suspected, that some people did not enjoy retirement. Whether that was for financial reasons, a lack of ambition, or health, participants seemed to know that not everyone in retirement was going to be happy; however, most of them were quick to say that they would enjoy retirement.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section16-0893318912438687">
<title>Critique of This Master Narrative of Retirement</title>
<p>Like the American Dream, this master narrative of retirement prescribes success as an attainable goal for all individuals. A life of freedom and happiness is available to all people after a life of hard work, irrespective of dividing issues such as race and class. By discovering this master narrative of retirement, we learn how much the notion of the classless society has permeated cultural narratives in the United States.</p>
<p>This master narrative of retirement is so ingrained in U.S. social discourse that participants did not recognize the reality that some retirees, perhaps themselves, face. Social security payments will likely not cover a spur-of-the-moment trip to Fiji (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0893318912438687">Achenbaum, 2006</xref>). Nor will retirees be able to be the master of their own schedule if they have to continue working in retirement just to pay bills. Critically speaking, this master narrative of retirement has an impact on individuals as they live out their work life. Retirement is not always attainable in the way this master narrative describes it; however, embedding this master narrative of retirement within societal discourse dangles the carrot in front of the horse. Working-class individuals envision the “bonus” of retirement at the end of a difficult, albeit productive, life and leave the status quo unquestioned. They continue to work toward a goal they are unlikely to achieve. By creating false hope for economically disadvantaged people, this master narrative further promotes the idea that there is no class system in the United States. By creating the illusion that all people have the right to retire and the ability to pursue their dreams and aspirations within that retirement, this master narrative of retirement reinforces the notion that there are no oppressed people who lack the ability to do so. Instead, the master narrative of retirement suggests that failure is the fault of the individual, averting attention from the reality that social inequality weaves the fabric of society (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0893318912438687">Dougherty, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>The problem with this master narrative for some individuals is the fact that they can never attain retirement. Their life situation is such that retirement is impossible. For others, freedom in retirement could be achieved, but they are so engrossed in the illusion of this master narrative that they do not adequately prepare for that life stage. Participants in all work experience groups indicated that one key to happiness in retirement is staying active and healthy. Creating a new retired identity for one’s self through volunteering, family, part-time work, or other activities may be a key to enjoying retirement; however, too many people go into retirement with little more than this master narrative to rely on. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0893318912438687">Hershey and Mowen (2000)</xref> found that an increasing number of people enter retirement without adequate planning. They do not realize, until it is too late, that they have not adequately planned, either financially or socially. Adequate retirement planning cannot be done by those who do have means to plan for it because the many important facets of retirement are not part of the cultural story.</p>
<p>This master narrative of retirement guides retirement financial planning also. Those who do have means to plan financially for retirement often do not take the opportunity to do so. This master narrative of retirement tells them that they automatically obtain their financial freedom once they are retired. In the age of pensions, that may have been a common occurrence; however, more organizations are no longer supplying retirement pensions. If individuals do not take their own initiative, they will not have a savings with which to retire. A realistic picture of retirement must be painted to encourage those who have not yet reached retirement to prepare for that stage in life, if possible. Financial planning for retirement is important and possibly makes the difference in being able to live out this master narrative as it is spoken.</p>

<sec id="section17-0893318912438687" sec-type="discussion">
<title>Discussion and Implications</title>
<p>The first research question asked, “How do people socially construct a master narrative of retirement?” Analysis of 84 participants with various levels of work experience and socioeconomic class revealed that there is a master narrative that constructs retirement as the ultimate marker of success and freedom. Participants in all work experience groups discussed retirement through metaphors and symbols as a life stage filled with freedom and independence. The cohesiveness of this master narrative is disrupted by the narrative inconsistency in the freedom/routine and individual responsibility/universal expectations fractures.</p>
<p>The potential for resistance to this master narrative was revealed when participants expressed a need to have the structure of work and therefore they would not want the freedom of retirement at this time. This deviation produced the freedom/routine fracture. The fracture of individual responsibility/universal expectations perpetuated this master narrative by claiming that being happy in retirement was contingent on the individual. Although the participants in this study did not actively resist the master narrative of retirement, the fractures create a potential space for resistant discourse by highlighting the differences between cultural expectations and human needs. Individuals create and sustain this master narrative of retirement as they discuss their future expectations for retirement and others’ experiences within it.</p>
<p>The second research question asked, “What are the implications of these constructions for how retirement is experienced, particularly for people from different class locations?” The master narrative may obscure the difficulty of achieving retirement in our present economic system. People from lower socioeconomic locations are less likely to be able to retire during their lifetimes. When they are forced to quit working, many of these people face economic hardship. Instead of recognizing the class-based nature of retirement, the master narrative places blame on the individual for the failure to achieve retirement.</p>
<p>This study makes three important contributions to organizational communication literature. First, this study contributes to existing research in organizational exit. Important models articulate exit as the final stage of socialization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0893318912438687">Jablin, 2001</xref>) and of career (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0893318912438687">Super, 1980</xref>). Despite these articulations, exit has yet to receive the same attention as various other aspects of either model. This study confirms that retirement is an important benchmark for the end of one’s work life that organizational communication scholars need to recognize. Through this study, we begin to paint a picture of how communication about retirement affects individuals throughout all stages of their working lives. Retirement is a unique form of exit because it is supposed to mark the end of life in an occupation. Although retirement, at least as it is practiced in contemporary times, is a relatively new phenomenon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0893318912438687">Achenbaum, 2006</xref>), the present study suggests that it is infused with positive sentiments that resonate with cultural expectations about work and leisure. Interestingly, it is also infused with an underlying anxiety related to aging and decline. Despite the fact that retirement is supposed to signal an exit from working life, 56% of workers are older workers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0893318912438687">U.S. Department of Labor Statistics, 2008</xref>). There are likely a number of reasons for this failure to retire. Given differences in wealth dividing the social classes, many people simply may not be in a position to retire. Other people may maintain employment because they enjoy work or because they fear the stigma associated with the failure to work. Regardless of the reason, it is intriguing that for many, retirement is not the exit from work that most people dream about. By opening the door to this research in organizational communication, we can begin to understand how communication throughout one’s work life can affect the retirement years.</p>
<p>The second contribution made by this study is to the study of organizational narrative. Narrative has long been recognized as an important part of identity construction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0893318912438687">Fisher, 1987</xref>). The present study provides support for those who argue that neither narrative nor identity is neutral. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0893318912438687">Mumby (1988)</xref> provides the clearest relationship between power and narrative, arguing that organizational narratives support dominant interests at the expense of marginalized people. Although people may believe that they are telling retirement stories that are unique to their own experience, the participants in this study tapped into a master narrative that promotes the interests of middle and upper social classes over those with lower social and economic standing. In this way, these participants reified the existing class structures.</p>
<p>The third and most theoretically important finding regarding master narratives as a whole is identification of the ways in which various master narratives are woven together to create a cultural fabric. The master narrative of retirement gains form and substance by borrowing from other master narratives, specifically the American Dream and the aging-as-decline master narratives. For example, the master narrative of retirement supports the master narrative of the American Dream by promoting the idea that the United States is a classless society. Working class and poor individuals may be lured by this master narrative into believing they have the same advantages as middle- and upper-class groups. The web-like nature of master narratives not only likely defines a culture in narrative form but also likely makes master narratives more difficult to resist.</p>
<sec id="section18-0893318912438687">
<title>Future Research</title>
<p>Future research should consider master narratives, including the master narrative of retirement, to further understand how they affect communication about life and identity. As we continue to understand master narratives and the fractures that appear as they are perpetuated, we will continue to learn how individuals are confined by those ideas. Furthermore, future studies should center more on individuals in lower socioeconomic classes to expand what has been found in this study. Future studies should also focus on the larger questions of the meaning of retirement and work as well as consider other important distinctions such as race and gender and the potential impact those differences may have on retirement.</p>
<p>Our study was conducted shortly before the massive recession. The investment and purchasing behaviors occurring prior to the recession suggest an extreme optimism about the future that people may not experience in present times—particularly as so many people’s retirement funds have been decimated. At this point, many people are still working in crisis mode. As a result, it is unlikely that they have shifted to long range retirement planning. Additional research should explore the “new normal” of retirement planning resulting from the economic downturn, particularly as it pertains to the master narrative of retirement.</p>
<p>Retirement has not been given adequate attention by organizational communication scholars. Most individuals will experience retirement in their lifetime. Therefore, it is important that we continue to consider how communication affects the retirement experience.</p>
