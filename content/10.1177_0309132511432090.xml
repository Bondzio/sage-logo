<p>Religion is not going away. This contemporary social axiom has been the impetus for dozens of recent books and conferences and scores of journal articles on the failings of secularism, secularity and secularization theory. The central notion that runs through this work is that religion not only endures in the modern world but it thrives, and now we moderns must learn how to endure and even thrive alongside it. The apparent contradiction between modernity and religion has spawned a third term: ‘the postsecular’. As a negative term – it only tells us what it is not – it has been used in a wide range of ways. For some it has meant the revival of religion in the late modern world, while for others it implies religion’s increasingly ill-fitting position in this world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0309132511432090">Dalferth, 2010</xref>). For all, however, the term is used to analyze and discuss the problems the secular and the religious pose for each other.</p>
<p>Only recently have geographers joined this discussion. The edited volume <italic>Postsecular Cities: Space, Theory and Practice</italic> by Justin Beaumont and Christopher Baker attempts to spatialize the  ‘postsecular problem’ by examining the ways in which cities – the secular temples of modernity – are infused with religiously inspired social action. As should be expected, there are no easy answers. <italic>Postsecular Cities</italic> approaches the problem from a dizzying variety of perspectives. Geography, sociology, anthropology, urban planning, public policy, and theology are all represented in its pages. While such variety can hardly be expected to comprise a cohesive whole, two central themes run through the individual chapters and seem to compete for prominence. Ultimately their tension suggests a deeper, lingering problem with the postsecular. </p>
<p>The first and more obvious theme is the dogged endurance of religion, that is, the staying power of religious practice and discourse in the late modern world. To speak of the postsecular city, then, is to speak of the ‘growing resurgence of faith and spirituality in the [contemporary] urban and public realm’ (p. 5). It means also that the most important questions revolve around accommodating and coping with religious practices in a secular urban environment. And so the analytical spotlight shines on the role of urban immigrant religious communities, faith-based organizations [FBOs], innovative megachurches, religiously marked urban enclaves, and the meaning of urban planning and urban governance in a religiously diverse urban environment. The conclusions offered are of course tentative and partial, but they cohere largely along the lines Jürgen Habermas has laid out in his growing work on the postsecular. As noted by the editors and several other contributors, Habermas has argued that religion cannot and should not be removed from the public sphere. Contributors to <italic>Postsecular Cities</italic> hasten to add that this is doubly true for urban space, and they also sometimes seem content to leave the matter here and explore the data of such postsecular space. </p>
<p>Habermas, however, adds that in this tolerant, postsecular society, religiously motivated actors in the public sphere must ‘translate’ their religious language into universally understandable, secular language (2006: 8). And, as some have pointed out, there is little <italic>post</italic>secular about this (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0309132511432090">Pecora, 2011</xref>). Regardless, the difficulty of accepting the first part of the Habermasian postsecular without the second is revealed in a number of the chapters in the volume. There is an overarching concern with ‘enhanced understanding’ between secular and religious urban actors, but there is also an uneasiness with the Habermasian proposal that religious actors must do the heavy lifting of translating – and thus transforming – their concerns into secular ones. The chapters by Baker and Beaumont, Greg Ashworth, Rachael Chapman and Leila Hamalainen, and Paul Cloke particularly grapple with this problem.</p>
<p>And it is clearly a vexing problem. For what else is a city than a culturally plural environment? And what other mode of social interaction better mediates between difference than that of secular civil society? How, then, is it possible to have a <italic>post</italic>secular city? One answer can be found in the second theme that threads through many of the chapters: religion as a renewing source of affective energy. The editors, again taking a cue from Habermas, see religion not just as a set of practices and beliefs for the devout but also as ‘an inspiring energy for all of society’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0309132511432090">Habermas, 2006</xref>: 8). In Chapter 5, Leonie Sandercock and Meged Senbel argue, ‘[S]omething beyond secular humanism is essential if we are to tackle the social and ecological crises that are upon us. And that something … is some kind of spirituality’ (p. 88). In the final two chapters, Angus Paddison and Cloke argue that a truly postsecular city should welcome a ‘theological politics’ and a ‘theo-poetics’ that can re-energize progressive politics today.</p>
<p>While this second theme is more properly postsecular than the first, it raises just as many questions. The affective energy of religiosity appears to be largely prophetic – it calls the world to become something different than what it is. Both Paddison and Cloke write in this prophetic tone, of a ‘politics of becoming’ in which particular religious visions can point to ‘new possibilities for human life together’ in the postsecular city. </p>
<p>But in what kind of city is this either possible or desirable? Surely not the postmetropolis of Edward Soja that Baker and Beaumont invoke in the afterword. For this is an irreducibly plural and fragmented city, and a city that requires the sort of secular translation that Habermas has in mind. And further, what sort of actually existing religious energies appear most effective in these post-metropolises? Goh’s chapter on global city megachurches suggests that it is not a progressive prophetic religiosity but rather a pliable, world-accommodating theology that seeks to mirror the postmetropolis rather than change it. </p>
<p>These are the postsecular problems. While they likely do not have solutions, <italic>Postsecular Cities</italic> shows us that they cannot be ignored.</p>
