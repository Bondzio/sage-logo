<sec id="sec1-1469540511429503b"><title>Tim Cooper (ed.) <italic>Longer Lasting Products: Alternatives to the Throwaway Society</italic>, Farnham: Gower, 2010; 432 pp. £70. ISBN 9780566088087 (hbk)</title>
<p>Contemporary policies on achieving more sustainable consumption and production are dominated by the ecological modernization paradigm. The principles that underlie this approach are effectively consumerist as they do nothing to suggest that society should consume less; rather, that the developed world can carry on consuming as long as production and recycling processes are more closely aligned and streamlined. As Cooper himself states, the ecological modernization approach is effectively acting after much of the damage has been done either at the design or disposal stages. Accordingly, <italic>Longer Lasting Products</italic> is devoted to explaining – from a variety of perspectives – why it is that so many products are fully functional when they are disposed of and what might be done about it.</p>
<p>The book is split into five parts. The first part is an introductory chapter by Cooper that introduces key debates for and against increased product longevity. The second part consisting of six chapters focuses on design issues and different forms of obsolescence. The third part consisting of three chapters looks at public policy issues that frame obsolescence such as the law and warranties. The fourth part comprising three chapters focuses on the role of marketing in framing product obsolescence and the fifth and final part with four chapters looks at product use and reuse. Throughout, the focus is on consumer durables, and despite a number of non-UK contributors, it is fair to say that the book will appeal most to those concerned with issues of product longevity in a UK/ western setting.</p>
<p>The central argument of the volume is that we live in a throwaway society; that for a number of reasons we are discarding things well before they have reached the end of what Cooper terms their ‘technical life span’ – the maximum length of time the product could function for (p. 9). Research on second-hand cultures and disposal in particular has contested this idea of the throwaway society, suggesting instead that products are rarely just disposed of, rather they are handed down, stored or sold on. Indeed Gregson et al. found that only 29 percent of discards were routed in the direction of waste (2007: 682). In light of this, does Cooper’s argument that we need to extend the lifespan of products still stand up? I would suggest that it does because there are many unanswered questions relating to what happens to stored and handed down items. With this in mind I would agree with Cooper et al. that the throwaway society is very much a reality and there are certainly gains to be made in explaining how premature obsolescence is structured and how it might be avoided.</p>
<p>While the quality of the contributions is generally high, some of the chapters felt a little ‘under-socialized’ in their approach, rooted as they are in the psychological ‘behaviour change’ paradigm that tends to focus on individual consumer behaviours. Van Nes, for example, states that, ‘the ending of a product’s life is the result of a user’s decision and not necessarily a predetermined design criterion’ (p. 109). By way of contrast, Peattie takes a more post-structuralist perspective when discussing marketing arguing that, ‘it is unrealistic and unfair to regard the consumer as the primary actor whose decisions must move the economy towards sustainability’ (p. 251).</p>
<p>As these two contrasting perspectives suggest, it could be argued that the book suffers from the lack of a common epistemological perspective. Elisabeth Shove, for example, has quite pointedly problematized current attempts to harness interdisciplinarity in relation to research on sustainable consumption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1469540511429503b">Shove, 2010</xref>). This collection evidently reflects the interdisciplinary nature of the problem being discussed in the varied epistemologies and methodologies of contributors, and whilst it does little to bridge any such gaps, the heterogeneity of approaches at least suggests a modesty that no one perspective can provide all the answers. Having said that, consumer-oriented solutions to achieving more sustainable consumption are well rehearsed by now and it is the chapters dealing with the ways in which consumer decisions regarding disposal are structured by the law, warranties, designers and marketing professionals that I found most engaging. These are topics that are rarely discussed in the literature on sustainable consumption and production and yet have far-reaching effects on product lifespan and replacement cycles.</p>
<p>Evans and Cooper in an exploration of consumer influences on product life spans found that technical durability is often not the problem; consumers most often replace products in response to fashion and new technology amongst others (p. 321). The implication is that it is the way these trends are structured by manufacturers and retailers that really needs to be addressed. Similarly, in his chapter on marketing, Peattie argues that whilst consumer sovereignty might be a comforting concept that allows governments to avoid regulating industry, it is also deeply flawed (p. 251) and fails to account for the role marketers play in constructing consumers. Indeed Peattie goes on to argue that marketers are to a large extent responsible for constructing the very consumer they seek to respond to.</p>
<p>Ervine points out that despite changes in the law that ensure that durability is a legal requirement of a good, for a variety of reasons consumers rarely use the legislation to enforce their right to durable goods with the knock on effect that there have been no test cases that can clarify the law (p. 189). Compounding this, Twigg-Flesner notes in a study of warranties that there exists no legal obligation in the UK to repair products under warranty or for a firm to have facilities and capacity to do so with the result that consumers are often given new products when existing ones fail, a policy that is likely to be more energy and resource intensive than repair (p. 295).</p>
<p>What is refreshing about these accounts is that rather than seeing consumer preferences as pre-existing they point to the many different ways that consumer behaviours are structured by other actors in the supply chain. As such, warranties, the law, marketing and sales data are here re-cast as performative in that they are seen to enact particular patterns of consumption. Whilst a minority of chapters may be overly individualist in their outlook, the major contributions of the book are to point out the shortcomings of eco-efficient production approaches and to move beyond notions of consumer sovereignty by demonstrating the ‘more than’ representational nature of various legal, institutional and market devices. In doing so Cooper has brought together a suite of papers that more than adequately re-state the importance of considering questions of lifespan in debates on sustainable production and consumption.</p>
