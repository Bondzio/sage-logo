<abstract>
<p>Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a common cause of respiratory failure in medical and surgical ICUs, totaling an estimated 200 000 cases per year in the United States. Despite improved supportive care, the mortality associated with ARDS remains high (30% to 40%). ARDS results from a variety of direct or indirect insults, including sepsis, aspiration, and trauma, all of which lead to pulmonary endothelial and epithelial injury. Several recent trials have led to improvements in the care of patients with ARDS, including the use of a fluid conservative treatment strategy and the use of neuromuscular blockade for severe ARDS. Patients with refractory hypoxemia due to ARDS may benefit from advanced therapies, including inhaled nitric oxide and extracorporeal life support; however, evidence from large clinical trials is lacking. Currently, clinical trials are underway for the treatment of ARDS with statins and inhaled heparin and preclinical evidence is promising for adoptive cellular therapy with mesenchymal stem cells.</p>

<p>Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) afflicts nearly 200 000 people in the United States each year.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1944451612457409">1</xref></sup> Although the mortality from ARDS is decreasing, there is increasing recognition that survivors of ARDS develop durable physical and cognitive deficits. The management of patients with ARDS requires a multidisciplinary approach with attention dedicated to treating the underlying predisposing medical illness and on appropriate ventilator strategy, fluid management, sedation, and supportive care. Patients who develop severe refractory hypoxemia require an individualized approach, which may include rescue therapies for ARDS. The goal of this article is to review the history, definitions, epidemiology, incidence, and pathophysiology of ARDS. In addition, this article will review state of the art treatment strategies for ARDS.</p>

<title>History</title>
<p>Prior to mechanical ventilation, acute respiratory failure meant certain death. Inspired by the widespread neuromuscular respiratory failure of the polio epidemic, Drinker and Shaw invented the iron lung in 1929.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1944451612457409">2</xref></sup> This innovation allowed some patients with polio-induced neuromuscular hypoventilation to survive their illness. Twenty-five years later, Ibsen developed a cuffed endotracheal tube which, in combination with positive pressure ventilation, could prolong the lives of patients suffering from both neuromuscular and hypoxemic causes of respiratory failure.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1944451612457409">2</xref></sup> This evolution in ventilator technology set the stage for the original description of the acute respiratory distress syndrome or ARDS. In 1967, Ashbaugh et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1944451612457409">3</xref></sup> described “acute respiratory distress in adults” in their landmark <italic>Lancet</italic> publication. This work recognized that ARDS could stem from a variety of direct or indirect insults (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1944451612457409">Table 1</xref>) that led to bilateral pulmonary infiltrates, hypoxemia, and decreased pulmonary compliance.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1944451612457409">3</xref></sup></p>

<title>Definitions</title>
<p>For the past 18 years, the American/European Consensus Conference (AECC) definition has been the primary classification used for clinical research on ARDS. This definition includes the acute onset of hypoxemia (Pao<sub>2</sub>/Fio<sub>2</sub> &lt; 300 mm Hg) in the setting of bilateral airspace opacities without clinical or invasive hemodynamic signs of left atrial hypertension or volume overload.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1944451612457409">4</xref></sup> This definition split patients into 2 groups, those with acute lung injury (ALI; Pao<sub>2</sub>/Fio<sub>2</sub> &lt; 300 mm Hg) and those with ARDS (Pao<sub>2</sub>/Fio<sub>2</sub> &lt; 200 mm Hg). However, subsequent observational studies called the validity and reliability of this classification into question. Major limitations of this definition included no standardized level of peak end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) and no definition of acute. In addition, observational data showed that it was unclear if the distinction of ALI from ARDS provided prognostic value. Additional studies found that the level of PEEP during the measurement of the Pao<sub>2</sub>/Fio<sub>2</sub> could reclassify patients from one category to the other. Last, this definition does not distinguish a set of patients with severe ARDS. This group of patients is known to have a high mortality and is currently the target of trials of advanced therapies for ARDS.</p>
<p>Because of the limitations of the AECC definition, a new diagnostic classification called the Berlin definition of ARDS was recently proposed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1944451612457409">5</xref></sup> This definition was created by consensus process during which a panel of experts created a definition and then tested its validity and reliability against a large database of ARDS demographic and physiologic data. This new definition partitions patients into mild, moderate, and severe ARDS based on their Pao<sub>2</sub>/Fio<sub>2</sub> ratio (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1944451612457409">Table 2</xref>). In addition, this definition clarifies several holes left by the AECC definition, including onset, which must be within 1 week of known clinical insult or worsening respiratory symptoms; chest imaging, which must include bilateral opacities not fully explained by effusions, lobar collapse or nodules; and origin of edema, which cannot be fully explained by cardiac failure or fluid overload and must be objectively evaluated (eg, by echocardiography) if no clear predisposing factor is present. Finally, this new definition sets minimal PEEP levels during Pao<sub>2</sub>/FiOo<sub>2</sub> determination, which must be ≥5 cm H<sub>2</sub>O. Throughout this review, ARDS will be used to describe all patients with a Pao<sub>2</sub>/Fio<sub>2</sub> &lt; 300 mm Hg.</p>

<title>Epidemiology, Incidence, and Outcomes</title>
<p>Despite advances in understanding the pathophysiology and treatment of ARDS, there is still considerable debate about its worldwide incidence. The largest study of ARDS incidence is the KCLIP study in Kings County Washington.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1944451612457409">1</xref></sup> This prospective cohort study captured ARDS patients in academic and community hospitals in western Washington over a 16-month period. The incidence of mild ARDS in this cohort was 78.9 per 100 000 person-years and the incidence of severe and moderate ARDS was 58.7 cases per 100 000 person-years with an overall mortality of 40%. More recent studies indicate that the incidence of ARDS may be decreasing. For example, an 8 year observational study of patients in Minnesota showed an overall decrease in the incidence of ARDS from 81 to 38.3 cases per 100 000 person-years between 2001 and 2008.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1944451612457409">6</xref></sup> Despite higher APACHE scores, the mortality of patients who went on to develop ARDS was similar to prior studies, suggesting that improvements in supportive care may both prevent and attenuate the severity of lung injury.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1944451612457409">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>Differences in race and genetic background may also influence outcomes during ARDs. African American and Latino patients who develop ALI have increased mortality.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1944451612457409">7</xref></sup> Increased severity of illness at the time of presentation may help explain the increased mortality in African Americans; however, the etiology for increased mortality in Latino patients is less clear. Genetic factors, such as polymorphisms of the Duffy antigen/receptor for chemokines, may also play a role in the increased mortality and increased organ injury in African American patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1944451612457409">8</xref></sup> The cause for increased mortality in Latino patients is less clear, but further research into genetic causes for the development and severity of ALI may shed light on important biologic pathways that both lead to and perpetuate lung injury.</p>
<p>Recent data highlight that patients who survive ARDS go on to suffer enduring physical, psychological, and cognitive dysfunction.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1944451612457409">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1944451612457409"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1944451612457409">11</xref></sup> Although pulmonary function testing frequently returns to normal 5 years after discharge, fitness as measured by 6-minute walk tests is frequently reduced and up to a third of patients show signs of clinically relevant depression. In addition, even relatively young patients who were working before their critical illness may find it difficult to return to work. Finally, family members of critically ill patients may also experience depression and decreased productivity.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1944451612457409">
<title>Pathophysiology</title>
<p>The hallmark of the early “exudative” phase of ARDS is the leakage of protein-rich inflammatory edema fluid into the interstitial and alveolar space. This process usually unfolds in 2 steps. First, some inciting event such as sepsis or trauma leads to endothelial injury, with leads to the accumulation of neutrophils, platelets, and monocytes in the pulmonary circulation. Alveolar epithelial injury follows due to the release of proteases, cationic peptides and reactive oxygen species from innate immune cells that have migrated into the interstitium and alveolar space.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1944451612457409">12</xref></sup> The release of inflammatory cytokines from these cells (tumor necrosis factor, interleukin-1, interleukin-8) perpetuates inflammatory injury to endothelial and epithelial structures, permitting further leakage of red blood cells and procoagulant proteins into the alveolar space. The accumulation of activated neutrophils and macrophages leads to the destruction of type II alveolar cells, which can decrease surfactant production and lead to atelectasis. Finally, endothelial injury and exposure of pro-coagulant tissue factor can lead to capillary thrombosis, which can exacerbate V/Q mismatch and hypoxemia. A detailed review of the molecular mechanisms of endothelial and epithelial injury during ARDS was recently published.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1944451612457409">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>After the exudative phase of ARDS, some patients develop the fibroproliferative stage.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1944451612457409">14</xref></sup> It is unclear why some patients develop these pathologic changes, which are heralded by a decrease in compliance and an increase in interstitial fibrosis. A combination of genetic predisposition, severity of lung injury and ventilator strategy may dictate which patients enter the fibroproliferative phase of ARDS.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1944451612457409">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1944451612457409">15</xref></sup> Observational studies suggest that a progressive decrease in pulmonary compliance, which may be an indication of the fibroproliferative phase of ARDS, is a harbinger of poor outcomes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1944451612457409">16</xref></sup></p>

<title>Ventilator Management</title>
<p>The cornerstone of therapy for patients with ARDS is a lung protective ventilation strategy and appropriate supportive measures for critically ill patients. The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute–sponsored ARDSnet group has conducted an important set of clinical trials over the past 15 years, which provide the foundation for an evidenced based approach to patients with ARDS. In 2000, the ARDSnet compared a low tidal volume (TV) ventilator strategy (6 mL/kg based on ideal body weight) with what was characterized as traditional TVs (12 mL/kg ideal body weight).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1944451612457409">17</xref></sup> This strategy specified that plateau pressures should be limited to 30 cm H<sub>2</sub>O in the low TV group, which in some cases required permissive hypercapnea and a TV as low as 4 mL/kg ideal body weight. This protocolized ventilator strategy (summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1944451612457409">Table 3</xref>) includes a matched escalation of PEEP and Fio<sub>2</sub> based on measure of oxygenation and was different from prior strategies in that it utilized higher PEEP levels. Ventilation with a low TV decreased mortality from 40% to 31%. Notably, patients in the low TV group had a shorter duration of ventilation, fewer ICU days and fewer non-pulmonary system organ failures. Subsequent trials have tried to assess the optimal PEEP level (high vs low) and found no difference between groups based on randomization to higher or lower amounts of PEEP.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1944451612457409">18</xref></sup> However, in cases of ARDS where atelectasis is thought to play a major role in hypoxemia, higher PEEP levels may be beneficial.</p>

<title>Fluid Management</title>
<p>Patients who develop ARDS often do so in the context of severe medical illnesses such as sepsis, trauma and pancreatitis. The acute phases of these conditions require aggressive volume administration. However, continued volume administration after the return of hemodynamic stability is likely detrimental.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1944451612457409">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1944451612457409"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1944451612457409"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1944451612457409">22</xref></sup> The ARDS Network tested the important question of liberal versus conservative fluid management in patients with ALI during the FACTT trial, which enrolled 1000 patients and was published in 2006. In this multicenter trial, patients were randomized to a protocol of liberal or conservative fluid administration therapy for the first 7 days of ARDS. The primary end point was death at 60 days and secondary endpoints were ICU-free days and ventilator-free days. After resolution of shock, patients in the conservative fluid management group were administered diuretic therapy (furosemide) with a goal central venous pressure &lt;4 or PAOP of &lt;8. In the liberal therapy group, fluids were administered to keep the central venous pressure 10 to 14 or pulmonary artery occlusion pressures 14 to 18 as long as the cardiac index was not greater than or equal to 4.5 and the Fio<sub>2</sub> was not greater than 0.7. There was no significant difference in the primary end point of mortality in this study. However, patients in the conservative fluid therapy group had a significant improvement in measures of oxygenation, increased ventilator-free days (14.6 vs 12.1, <italic>P</italic> &lt; .0001), and a shorter ICU stay (13.4 vs 11.2, <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001). Notably, the fluid conservative group, in which there was concern that aggressive diuresis might lead to renal hypoperfusion, had a trend toward decreased dialysis use (10% vs 14%, <italic>P</italic> = .06) despite having a near even fluid balance over the first 7 days. The fluid liberal group received on average 7 more liters of fluid over the 7 study days, which is in line with standard practice.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1944451612457409">20</xref></sup> These data suggest that aggressive diuretic use in shock-free patients with ALI does not increase the risk for acute kidney injury and may expedite liberation from mechanical ventilation.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1944451612457409">
<title>Sedation, Analgesia, and Paralytics</title>
<p>Over the past 10 years, sedation practices for critically ill patients have changed dramatically. In general, these practice changes have been adopted in the care of patients with ARDS. Historically, patients undergoing mechanical ventilation were thought to require high doses of sedative infusions, including the benzodiazepines midazolam and lorazepam. A movement away from deep sedation with benzodiazepine infusions started with the hypothesis that interruption of sedation might decrease both the duration of mechanical ventilation and ICU stay as well as empower physicians to evaluate the neurologic status of patients more effectively. In 2000, Kress et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1944451612457409">23</xref></sup> published a landmark trial showing that the daily interruption of sedative infusions decreased the duration of mechanical ventilation and length of ICU stay. This trial was replicated in the multicenter Awakening and Breathing Controlled trial, in which interruption of sedation was paired with daily spontaneous breathing trials.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1944451612457409">24</xref></sup> As a consequence of these trials and the development of 2 newer sedative medications, propofol and dexmeditomidine, continuous infusion of benzodiazepines should be avoided in favor of intermittent as needed dosing based on standardized sedation scales such as the Richmond Agitation Assessment Scale. Several recent studies have shown that dexmedetomidine,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1944451612457409">25</xref></sup> a selective α<sub>2</sub> agonist that does not cause respiratory depression, is safe and effective in the ICU, may facilitate extubation in agitated patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1944451612457409">26</xref></sup> and can shorten the duration of mechanical ventilation and length of ICU stay in selected ICU patients. Although there was a strong trend away from paralytic use in the ICU because of fear of prolonged neuromuscular weakness, a recent trial showed that early neuromuscular blockade with cisatracurium in patients with a Pao<sub>2</sub>/Fio<sub>2</sub> &lt; 150 mm Hg decreased ventilator days and improved adjusted 90-day mortality without increasing the incidence of neuromuscular weakness.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1944451612457409">27</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1944451612457409">
<title>Adjunctive Therapies</title>
<p>Several recent trials have evaluated pharmacologic and nutritional therapies for ARDS. The ARDSnet consortium and other groups have performed large multicenter trials of the treatment of ALI with glucocorticoids, surfactants, antioxidants, protease inhibitors, and rhAPC (recombinant human activated protein C).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1944451612457409">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1944451612457409">29</xref></sup> Unfortunately, none these interventions decreased mortality, ventilator-free days, or ICU length of stay. The recently completed ALTA trial tested the hypothesis that the inhaled β-agonist albuterol would improve alveolar fluid clearance. Despite sound rationale and compelling animal and preliminary human data, the trial failed to show an increase in the ventilator free days or a decrease in mortality. In addition, the BALTI-2 trial, a European multicenter study of the intravenous β-agonist salbutamol for ARDS, showed that β-agonist therapy actually increased mortality compared to untreated controls. Thus neither inhaled nor intravenous β-agonist therapy can be recommended for ARDS. Finally, several recent ARDSnet trials, the EDEN and OMEGA trials, have focused on nutrition in patients with ARDS. The EDEN trial compared lower volume enteral trophic feeding with full volume enteral feedings during the first 6 days of ARDS and the OMEGA trial compared dietary supplementation with ω-3 fatty acids, antioxidants and γ-linolenic acids with isocaloric feeds in ALI patients. Neither of these studies showed an improvement in the primary outcomes of ventilator-free days or the secondary outcome of mortality.</p>

<title>Advanced Therapies for Refractory Hypoxemia</title>
<p>The optimal therapy for patients with severe ARDS continues to be debated and will likely depend on available treatment modalities and expertise. Therapies for severe ARDS include inhaled nitric oxide (iNO), inhaled prostacylin, prone positioning (PP), high-frequency oscillatory ventilation (HFOV), and extracorporeal life support (ECLS).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1944451612457409">30</xref></sup> Despite multiple large randomized trials of these therapies, none of them has shown a mortality benefit in a general population of patients with ARDS.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1944451612457409">31</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1944451612457409"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1944451612457409">33</xref></sup> This may be because the major cause of mortality in patients with ARDS is sepsis and multiorgan failure, not refractory hypoxemia. In addition, large trials of severe ARDS are often composed of a heterogeneous group of patients who have developed ARDS from a variety of different causes. Variation in the etiology of ARDS may mask a potential survival benefit of individual therapies. However, a pervasive theme throughout trials of advanced therapies for severe ARDS is that many of the interventions, including iNO, HFOV, and PP, lead to transient improvements in oxygenation, despite their lack of a mortality benefit. Thus, in selected patients at risk of dying from refractory hypoxemia, these therapies may be beneficial. Selected modalities may benefit specific patients, for example, patients with elevated pulmonary pressures may benefit from iNO or inhaled prostacyclin. Patients with severe atelectasis may benefit from PP. Finally, patients in whom plateau airway pressures cannot be kept less than 30 cm H<sub>2</sub>O may benefit from HFOV or ECLS. The recent CESAR trial in the United Kingdom, in which patients with severe hypoxemic respiratory failure were randomized to standard care versus transfer to a center that could provide ECLS (75% of patients randomized to the intervention arm received ECLS) showed a mortality benefit.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1944451612457409">34</xref></sup> As institutional experience with ECLS improves, it may become an important part of the treatment algorithm for severe ARDS.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Acute respiratory distress syndrome is a major cause of hypoxemic respiratory failure in adults and despite declining mortality, ARDS continues to be a major contributor to ICU mortality and resource utilization. Therapy for ARDS includes treating the underlying medical illness, implementation of a lung protective ventilation strategy and the facilitation of early extubation by using a conservative fluid management style, daily interruption of sedation, and aggressive weaning protocols. Advanced therapies such as paralytics, PP, iNO, and ECLS may be required in patients with severe hypoxemic ARDS. Future studies should focus on reducing the risk of ARDS development in patients at risk for ARDS and on identifying patients during the earliest stages of ARDS. In addition, ongoing studies focusing on adoptive cellular therapy, statins, and inhaled anticoagulants may further improve mortality in patients with ARDS.</p>
