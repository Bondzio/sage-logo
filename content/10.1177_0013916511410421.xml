<abstract>
<p>Marketing managers are increasingly using olfactory marketing instruments in the retail environment. However, the question is whether scents in the store are desirable for all consumer types. Research on the moderating role of individual differences on the impact of scents in the marketplace is scarce. This article focuses on how ambient fragrances in the store can influence customers’ affective, evaluative, and approach reactions and considers the moderating role of shopping motivation and affect intensity. A field experiment reveals that a pleasant fragrance positively influences consumers’ affective reactions, evaluations, and intentions to revisit the store, especially when the consumers score high on affect intensity. Strategically manipulating the store environment via ambient scents is an inexpensive yet effective way to positively influence consumer behavior. Retailers can use ambient scents to heighten their differentiating ability; however, the decision to diffuse a scent should be based on the target audience.</p>

<p>Characteristics of a store’s environment can have a substantial impact on consumers’ shopping behavior. Music (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0013916511410421">Sweeney &amp; Wyber, 2002</xref>), color (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0013916511410421">Crowly, 1993</xref>), lighting (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0013916511410421">Areni &amp; Kim, 1994</xref>), crowding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0013916511410421">Michon, Chebat, &amp; Turley, 2005</xref>), and ambient scents (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0013916511410421">Seo, Roidl, Müller, &amp; Negoias, 2010</xref>) are a few atmospheric cues that have been found to affect consumers. In practice, marketing managers have also shown interest in the use of scents in retail and service organizations. For example, a number of hotels such as Westin Hotels and Resorts diffuse fragrances into their lobbies to relax the guests by alleviating stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0013916511410421">Palmer, 2007</xref>). Travel agent Thomson scents three quarters of its stores with a coconut aroma to convince customers to book their summer vacation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0013916511410421">Roberts, 2008</xref>). Even department stores such as Harrods in London, England (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0013916511410421">Rosenthal, 2008</xref>), and Bloomingdale’s Inc., in New York City (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0013916511410421">Smith, 2009</xref>), have experimented with olfactory marketing, diffusing different odors into their various departments.</p>
<p>However, previous research has revealed mixed findings regarding the effect of ambient scent on consumer reactions (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0013916511410421">Morrin &amp; Ratneshwar, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0013916511410421">Spangenberg, Crowley, &amp; Henderson, 1996</xref>). The setting in which the experiments took place may account for this. Ambient scent effects may vary depending on the product categories offered by the store. Atmospheric cues seem to have the greatest effect on consumer reactions when customers are either high affective involved or low involved with the store’s offerings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0013916511410421">Bruner, 1990</xref>). Our experiment is conducted in a high-affective-involvement setting. Second, we study the moderating effect of affect intensity and shopping motivation. To our knowledge, no prior research has studied the moderating role of affect intensity and shopping motivation on the relationship between scent and consumer shopping behavior. Shopping motivation may affect this relationship because it determines consumers’ openness to sensorial and emotional experiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0013916511410421">Babin, Darden, &amp; Griffin, 1994</xref>). It is proposed that individuals who enjoy the shopping experience will be more positively affected by the presence of a pleasant ambient scent in the store than people who shop for utilitarian reasons. In addition, it is expected that consumers who respond more intensely to emotional stimuli will be more strongly affected by the presence of an ambient scent because it is an emotional stimulus in the shopping environment.</p>
<p>Although some studies have been conducted in realistic (e.g., a casino, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0013916511410421">Hirsch, 1995</xref>, or a mall, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0013916511410421">Chebat &amp; Michon, 2003</xref>) or semirealistic settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0013916511410421">Spangenberg et al., 1996</xref>), most research has been conducted in artificial laboratory situations (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0013916511410421">Bosmans, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0013916511410421">Morrin &amp; Ratneshwar, 2003</xref>). Our study was conducted in an upscale clothing store to ensure ecological validity.</p>
<p>The remainder of this article is organized as follows. First, the concept of sensory marketing is discussed as well as the effect of ambient scent. In the subsequent section, the moderating role of shopping motivation and affect intensity is addressed. Next, the methodology and results are discussed. Finally, limitations and implications are presented.</p>
<sec id="section1-0013916511410421">
<title>Sensory Marketing and Ambient Scent Effects</title>
<p>Sensory marketing is an element of experiential marketing. Experiential marketers view consumers as rational yet emotional creatures that like to encounter pleasant experiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0013916511410421">Schmitt, 1999</xref>). In a retail context, this entails a shift from an emphasis on the product to the creation of customer experiences in the store (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0013916511410421">Soars, 2009</xref>). According to retailers, appealing to the senses is an important factor in these shopping experiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0013916511410421">Bäckström &amp; Johansson, 2006</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0013916511410421">Schmitt (1999)</xref> defined sensory marketing as follows:
<disp-quote>
<p>Sense marketing appeals to the senses with the objective of creating sensory experiences through sight, sound, touch, taste and smell. Sense marketing may be used to differentiate companies and products, to motivate customers and to add value to products (e.g., through aesthetics or excitement; p. 61).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<sec id="section2-0013916511410421">
<title>Retail Atmospherics</title>
<p>Because consumers perceive retail atmospherics with their senses (i.e., sight, sound, scent, touch, and taste), store atmosphere is an important aspect of the shopping process. The most common theoretical basis for studying the effects of atmospheric cues on shopping behavior is based on environmental psychology. One of its basic paradigms is the stimulus–organism–response (S–O–R) paradigm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0013916511410421">Donovan &amp; Rossiter, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0013916511410421">Mehrabian &amp; Russell, 1974</xref>). In the retail context, a store’s atmosphere (S) is the stimulus that affects consumers’ internal evaluations (O). These evaluations then lead to behavioral responses, that is, approach or avoidance responses (R). Approach responses are positive responses to a store environment, such as a desire to stay in a store and explore the products. In contrast, avoidance responses are negative responses to the store environment, such as a desire to leave the store or not wanting to explore the merchandise.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0013916511410421">Turley and Milliman (2000)</xref> divided atmospheric stimuli into five categories: (a) external variables, (b) general interior variables, (c) layout and design variables, (d) point-of-purchase and decoration variables, and (e) human variables. General interior variables such as music, color schemes, and scents have received the most attention in empirical studies. These atmospheric cues influence the emotional state of consumers in the shopping environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0013916511410421">Donovan &amp; Rossiter, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0013916511410421">Mehrabian &amp; Russell, 1974</xref>). This emotional state can be divided into three dimensions as follows: pleasure, arousal, and dominance (PAD). Pleasure refers to the degree to which a person feels good, happy, or satisfied in a situation. Arousal is the degree to which a person feels excited, stimulated, or active in a situation, and dominance refers to the degree to which a person feels that he/she has control over the situation. However, the dominance dimension is often omitted in research that uses the S–O–R paradigm because of a lack of empirical support (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0013916511410421">Donovan, Rossiter, Marcoolyn, &amp; Nesdale, 1994</xref>). The emotional state of the consumers is not the only internal evaluation that environmental cues can influence; they can also affect consumers’ cognition (e.g., attention, information search, and evaluations; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0013916511410421">Bitner, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0013916511410421">Lam, 2001</xref>). A possible explanation is that consumers may use atmospheric elements as cues when assessing the quality of a store and its products (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0013916511410421">Chebat &amp; Michon, 2003</xref>). Furthermore, some environmental elements can affect the physiological state of shoppers in a store (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0013916511410421">Bitner, 1992</xref>). For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0013916511410421">Birren (1997)</xref> found that the color red increases the blood pressure and pulse rate of experimental participants.</p>
<p>The current study focuses on the effect of ambient scent (S) in a store environment on customers’ affective response (O) and their evaluations of the store environment (O) and products (O) as well as their intention the revisit the store (R).</p>

<title>Olfaction Research</title>
<p>A human being breathes approximately 15,000 to 20,000 times a day. As such, the nose is an instrument that receives communication continuously. Moreover, in contrast to other sensory cues that are processed in higher level brain centers, scents are first directly processed in the limbic system of the brain, which is the centre of emotions and memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0013916511410421">Bosmans, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0013916511410421">Ehrlichman &amp; Halpern, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0013916511410421">Hirsch, 1995</xref>). In fact, approximately 75% of our emotions are influenced by smell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0013916511410421">Lindstrom, 2005</xref>). For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0013916511410421">Orth and Bourrain (2008)</xref> found that the presence of an ambient scent evokes nostalgic memories, which in turn lead to heightened exploratory behavior such as variety-seeking behavior.</p>
<p>Two types of scents are important to consumer reactions, those scents that are intrinsic to an evaluation object (e.g., scented product) and ambient scents, which are the main focus of this study. An ambient scent is “a scent that is not emanating from a particular object but is present in the environment” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0013916511410421">Spangenberg et al., 1996</xref>, p. 67). This kind of scent may affect responses to the entire store and its products, even those that have no intrinsic fragrance of their own (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0013916511410421">Gulas &amp; Bloch, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0013916511410421">Parsons, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0013916511410421">Gulas and Bloch (1995)</xref> developed a model of ambient scent effects that fits the S–O–R paradigm. The model, which was later extended by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0013916511410421">Davies, Kooijman, and Ward (2003)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0013916511410421">Ward, Davies, and Kooijman (2003)</xref>, stipulates that the way in which an ambient scent is perceived depends on the objective ambient scent and the acuity of the consumers, which is influenced by individual characteristics such as age and gender. Subsequently, the perceived ambient scent in combination with scent preferences causes an affective response (i.e., PAD dimensions) in the consumer. However, this process may be moderated by other atmospheric cues and the congruency of the scent with the environment. Indeed, shopping is a holistic experience in which a consumer is simultaneously exposed to several atmospheric cues, and a pleasant scent may not have the desired effect when it is mismatched with other environmental elements. For example, when ambient scent and music are matched with each other in terms of their arousing quality (i.e., high/high or low/low; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0013916511410421">Mattila &amp; Wirtz, 2001</xref>) or consistent with a holiday (i.e., Christmas music/Christmas scent; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0013916511410421">Spangenberg, Grohmann, &amp; Sprott, 2005</xref>), consumers experience increased pleasure, evaluate the store more positively, and exhibit higher levels of approach behavior than when scent and music are mismatched. Moreover, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0013916511410421">Bone and Ellen (1999)</xref> developed a conceptual model in which ambient scent not only influences affective responses but also cognitive responses such as elaboration and evaluation of the target object. A pleasant ambient scent can even neutralize negative elements of a shopping experience such as queues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0013916511410421">McDonnell, 2007</xref>). Finally, the affective and cognitive responses alter consumer behavior, resulting in either approach or avoidance behavior.</p>

<title>Product Type and Scent: The Affective, Cognitive, and Behavioral Effects</title>
<p>Most links of the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0013916511410421">Gulas and Bloch (1995)</xref> model are supported by empirical studies. Concerning affective responses, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0013916511410421">Baron and Thomley (1994)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0013916511410421">Baron (1997)</xref> demonstrated that a pleasant fragrance induces positive affect, which in turn leads to increased willingness to help as well as increased task performance. However, in a marketing environment, the presence of a scent enhanced evaluation of the store, the store environment, and the products in the store, all without enhancing affective responses (i.e., pleasure and arousal; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0013916511410421">Spangenberg et al., 1996</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0013916511410421">Morrin and Ratneshwar (2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0013916511410421">2003</xref>) also found that scent had no effect on mood. Instead, the presence of a scent only improved brand evaluations and brand memory through enhanced attention. A possible explanation is that these studies worked with low-involvement products, that is, school supplies (e.g., backpacks), decor items (e.g., calendars; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0013916511410421">Spangenberg et al., 1996</xref>), and toiletry and household cleaning products (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0013916511410421">Morrin &amp; Ratneshwar, 2003</xref>). In our research, the experiment was conducted in an upscale clothing store. Prestigious clothing is a high-affective-involvement product according to the Foote-Cone-Belding (FCB) grid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0013916511410421">Belch &amp; Belch, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0013916511410421">Vaughn, 1980</xref>), which has two dimensions: high/low involvement and a think/feel dimension. Together, these two dimensions create four quadrants, that is, informative (think/high involvement), affective (feel/high involvement), habitual (think/low involvement), and satisfaction (feel/low involvement). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0013916511410421">Bruner (1990)</xref> stated that music has the greatest effect on consumer behavior when consumers are either high affective involved or low cognitive involved with the product. Because ambient scent is also an atmospheric element, it is most likely that scent influences consumers when they buy products based on emotional motives (e.g., prestigious clothing) or when they are low involved with the purchase decision. In the latter case, consumers have little motivation to process the current information, and they evaluate the store and products based on peripheral cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0013916511410421">Petty &amp; Cacioppo, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0013916511410421">Petty &amp; Wegener, 1999</xref>). The store atmosphere (e.g., scents, music, and visual elements) can act as such a peripheral cue, thereby influencing consumers’ evaluation without affecting their mood. When buying products that provide psychological benefits (i.e., high affective involvement), consumers are increasingly guided by their emotions. Thus, in our experiment, an ambient scent is expected to create enhanced affective and cognitive responses.</p>
<p>Previous research also demonstrated that pleasant (high arousing) environments lead to approach behavior, whereas unpleasant (high arousing) environments lead to avoidance behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0013916511410421">Bone &amp; Ellen, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0013916511410421">Spangenberg et al., 1996</xref>). For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0013916511410421">Hirsch (1995)</xref> found that gamblers spent more money in a casino with a pleasant scent than those in one without a fragrance. Furthermore, the presence of a pleasant scent increases time spent exploring the products in the store, intention to revisit the store, and intention to buy certain products but decreases perceived time spent in the store (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0013916511410421">Spangenberg et al., 1996</xref>). However, these studies were conducted in an artificial laboratory situation (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0013916511410421">Bosmans, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0013916511410421">Morrin &amp; Ratneshwar, 2000</xref>), semirealistic settings (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0013916511410421">Spangenberg et al., 1996</xref>), or in other consumer environments (a casino; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0013916511410421">Hirsch, 1995</xref>). By testing the effect of scents in a traditional retail context, we can generalize experimental findings.</p>
<p>Thus, we offer the following hypothesis:</p>

<list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 1</italic> (<italic>H1</italic>): The presence of a pleasant ambient scent will lead to (a) enhanced positive affect, (b) enhanced arousal, (c) enhanced evaluation of the store environment, (d) enhanced evaluations of the products, and (e) enhanced approach behavior (intention to revisit the store) compared with the absence of a pleasant ambient scent.</p></list-item>

<title>Individual Differences</title>
<p>As the model of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0013916511410421">Gulas and Bloch (1995)</xref> specifies, the effect of an ambient scent depends on characteristics of the individual consumer. Previous research has already identified several individual differences that influence the relationship between the presence of a scent and consumer behavior. However, until now, no study has examined the moderating role that affect intensity and type of shopping motivation play in the effect of scent on consumers’ affective responses, evaluations, and approach behavior.</p>
<sec id="section6-0013916511410421">
<title>Affect Intensity</title>
<p>Affect intensity refers to the degree to which people experience emotions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0013916511410421">Moore, Harris, &amp; Chen, 1995</xref>). Individuals scoring high on affect intensity respond more strongly to emotional stimuli than do low-scoring individuals. For example, high-affect-intensity consumers show more emotionally intense reactions to positive and negative emotional appeals in advertisements than do low-affect-intensity consumers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0013916511410421">Moore et al., 1995</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0013916511410421">Moore &amp; Homer, 2000</xref>). They also evaluated ads with positive emotional appeals more positively. Moreover, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0013916511410421">Moore and Homer (2000)</xref> found that high-affect-intensity consumers felt more enjoyment when smelling freshly baked bread or perfume compared with low-affect-intensity consumers. Because a pleasant ambient scent in a shopping environment is also an emotional stimulus, we offer the following hypothesis:</p>
<list id="list2-0013916511410421" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 2</italic> (<italic>H2</italic>): For consumers who experience intense emotions (high affect intensity), it is expected that the presence of a pleasant ambient scent will have a positive effect on (a) positive affect, (b) arousal, (c) evaluation of the store environment, (d) evaluations of the products, and (e) approach behavior (intention to revisit the store) compared with the absence of such a scent. This effect is not expected for consumers who do not experience intense emotions (low affect intensity).</p></list-item>

<sec id="section7-0013916511410421">
<title>Shopping Motivation</title>
<p>Another personal predisposition that might affect the relationship between scents and consumer behavior is shopping motivation. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0013916511410421">Tauber (1972)</xref> was the first to examine the motivation behind shopping behavior. This exploratory research found that people shop not only for utilitarian reasons but also for entertainment and emotional value. At a generic level, consumers shop either because of necessity (task fulfillment) or because of personal pleasure (recreation; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0013916511410421">Wagner &amp; Rudolph, 2010</xref>). Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0013916511410421">Babin et al. (1994)</xref> distinguish between utilitarian and hedonic shopping value, the latter being highly correlated with hedonic shopping motivation. Consumers with a utilitarian shopping motivation are goal oriented, rational, and decision effective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0013916511410421">Babin et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0013916511410421">Hirschman &amp; Holbrook, 1982</xref>). They gain value from shopping when a product can be bought in a deliberate and efficient way. Consumers with hedonic shopping motivation are searching for happiness, fantasy, and enjoyment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0013916511410421">Babin et al., 1994</xref>). Hedonic shopping value lies in the shopping experience, rather than in the acquisition of goods. Because a scent is diffused in a store to create a pleasant environment that produces sensorial and emotional experiences, we expect that hedonic shopping motivation has a positive influence on the impact of an ambient scent in a store. Moreover, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0013916511410421">Wagner and Rudolph (2010)</xref> found that consumers with a high hedonic shopping motivation desire increased levels of sensory stimulation causing them to be more attracted to pleasant store environments.</p>
<p>Thus, we propose the following hypothesis:</p>
<list id="list3-0013916511410421" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 3</italic> (<italic>H3</italic>): For consumers with high hedonic shopping motivation, it is expected that the presence of a pleasant ambient scent will have a positive effect on (a) positive affect, (b) arousal, (c) evaluation of the store environment, (d) evaluations of the products, and (e) approach behavior (intention to revisit the store) compared with the absence of such a scent. This effect is not expected for consumers with low hedonic shopping motivation.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Thus, we expect a scent effect at high levels of affect intensity and hedonic shopping motivation. Hence, we no longer expect a simple effect of scent nor a simple effect for affect intensity or shopping motivation.</p>

<title>Scent Selection</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0013916511410421">Spangenberg et al. (1996)</xref> performed a pretest to determine the affective and arousing quality of five scent categories (i.e., floral, spices, woods, citrus, and mints). They found that scents in the citrus and mint categories were evaluated as more pleasant and arousing than other fragrances. Moreover, lemon was found to be the most pleasant scent. Based on these findings, the “Fresh Office” scent—a slightly minty lemon scent marketed by Scents, an olfactory marketing firm in Belgium—was selected for this study. This scent is frequently used in practice to create a pleasant environment.</p>
<p>A pretest was conducted to verify the affective and arousing quality of the Fresh Office scent. There were 30 participants (10 men and 20 women) aged between 19 and 54 years. First, the participants signed a consent form to screen for allergies. Next, they were asked to sniff the olfactory stimulus placed on a cotton ball in a vial. Finally, the participants evaluated the affective and activation dimensions of the scent, using relevant items from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0013916511410421">Fisher’s (1974)</xref> 7-point semantic differential (e.g., negative/positive; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0013916511410421">Spangenberg et al., 1996</xref>; previously used by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0013916511410421">Crowley (1993)</xref> in environmental marketing research). Results indicated that the participants found the scent more pleasant (<italic>M</italic> = 5.41) than the scale middle point, <italic>M</italic> = 4, <italic>t</italic>(29) = 10.71, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, and more arousing (<italic>M</italic> = 5.55) than the scale middle point, <italic>M</italic> = 4, <italic>t</italic>(29) = 12.94, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001.</p>
<p>In a separate pretest, the intensity of the scent was determined. As the salience of the extraneous source (here, the odor) increases, people become more aware that a source other than the store or product is responsible for their response and may correct for it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0013916511410421">Bosmans, 2006</xref>). Therefore, it is necessary to check the intensity of the odor. The Fresh Office scent was diffused in the store where the experiment would take place and visitors were asked to answer two questions: “Did you spontaneously notice a scent in the store?” and “Now that we have mentioned the presence of a scent, do you detect it?” The intensity of the scent was lowered until all the respondents answered negatively to the first question and positively to the second.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0013916511410421">
<title>Independent Variables</title>
<p>Besides the presence or absence of the ambient scent, individual differences in shopping motivation and affect intensity were measured as moderators. Hedonic shopping motivation was determined by means of a measurement scale developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0013916511410421">Arnold and Reynolds (2003)</xref>. This scale consists of 23 items on a 7-point Likert-type scale (e.g., “To me, shopping is an adventure”; α = .92), ranging from 1 = <italic>totally disagree</italic> to 7 = <italic>totally agree</italic>.</p>
<p>Affect intensity was measured with the short-affect-intensity scale developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0013916511410421">Geuens and De Pelsmacker (2002)</xref>, who reduced the 40-item scale of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0013916511410421">Larsen and Diener (1987)</xref> to 20 items (e.g., “When I am feeling happy, I burst with joy”). Cronbach’s alpha indicated very good reliability (α = .87).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0013916511410421">
<title>Dependent Variables</title>
<p>Dependent measures were affective response toward the store environment (i.e., pleasure and arousal), evaluation of the store environment, evaluation of the products, and intention to revisit the store.</p>
<p>Shoppers’ affective reactions toward the store environment were measured with the “pleasure” (sum of six items; e.g., annoyed/pleased; α = .87) and “arousal” (sum of three items; relaxed/stimulated; α = .74) dimensions of the PAD scale developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0013916511410421">Mehrabian and Russell (1974)</xref>. Using a 7-point semantic differential scale, the participants indicated the extent to which these emotions were triggered by the store.</p>
<p>The evaluation of the store environment was captured using <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0013916511410421">Fisher’s (1974)</xref> 13-item environmental quality scale (e.g., unattractive/attractive). In accordance with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0013916511410421">Spangenberg et al. (1996)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0013916511410421">Mattila and Wirtz (2001)</xref>, the unpleasant/pleasant item was added. These 14 items were measured via a 7-point semantic differential scale, and afterward, these items were summed (α = .97) to calculate an overall score of the evaluation of the in-store environment.</p>
<p>The evaluation of the products was assessed using a combination of two 7-point scales used in prior research, that is, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0013916511410421">Bellizzi, Crowley, and Hasty (1983)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0013916511410421">Spangenberg et al. (1996</xref>; outdated/up to date, low quality/high quality, bad/good, unpleasant/pleasant, unfavorable/favorable, unattractive/attractive, and poor value/good value). This scale showed very good reliability (α = .91) and a summated scale (means of items) was calculated and used in further analysis.</p>
<p>Approach behavior, specifically, the intention to revisit the store, was measured by asking the participants the following question: “Assuming you were looking for products like those sold at this store and you had the money, how likely would you be to revisit the store?” (unlikely/likely: 7-point scale; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0013916511410421">Spangenberg et al., 1996</xref>).

<title>Participants and Procedure</title>
<p>The data were collected in two parts. First, a field experiment was conducted in the summer of 2009 in Step 2, a prestigious clothing store (160 m<sup>2</sup>) located in Belgium. This retailer sells both women’s and men’s clothing, jewelry, and other accessories. The experiments were conducted over two consecutive weeks: the 1st week studied the control group and the 2nd week studied the experimental group. These 2 weeks were identical in terms of shopper traffic and weather circumstances. The shop owner also made sure that no special promotions were launched during the 2 weeks of the experiment. In the 1st week, no scents were diffused in the store. In the 2nd week, a pleasant ambient scent (Fresh Office) was diffused through the entire store with the “Aerostreamer 500” fragrance appliance. The appliance works according to the principle of warm evaporation (electrical). The liquid scent is heated on a metal plate so that it evaporates, then a fan distributes the fragrance. Changing conditions on a weekly basis was necessary to ensure that no scents were present in the control group. As the customers were leaving the store, they were asked to fill out a questionnaire concerning their affective reactions, evaluations, and approach behavior toward the store environment and products. In addition, the participants were notified that we would contact them again in a couple of days for an additional online survey. In all, 194 shoppers (20 men and 174 women) between the ages of 18 and 55 years participated. A total of 105 participants visited the store in the 1st week and 89 in the 2nd week.</p>
<p>To prevent any influence of scent on the self-reported rating of the shopping motivation and affect intensity of the respondents, participants were contacted 2 days later and asked to complete an online survey containing questions regarding hedonic shopping motivation and affect intensity. Of the 194 participants, 129 (12 men and 117 women) completed the online survey. In total, 74 participants visited the store in the control condition and 55 in the scent condition. Participants who completed both questionnaires had a chance to win a 50-euro gift certificate from Step 2 (the store where the experiment took place). A summary of the questions in our study are reported in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0013916511410421">Table 2</xref>.</p>

<title>Moderating Role of Affect Intensity and Hedonic Shopping Motivation</title>
<p>Before testing the hypotheses concerning the moderating role of hedonic shopping motivation and affect intensity, independent sample <italic>t</italic> tests with pleasure, arousal, evaluation of the store environment, evaluation of the products, and intention to revisit the store as dependent variables and scent as the grouping variable were repeated. This time, the <italic>t</italic> tests were conducted for the sample of 129 participants who responded to the online survey because information regarding the individual differences was only available for these participants. In this smaller sample, all hypothesized directions were still intact, although the positive impact of the pleasant ambient scent remained significant only for the customers’ evaluation of the store environment and their evaluation of the products in the store (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0013916511410421">Table 3</xref>).</p>
<p>To test the moderating role of hedonic shopping motivation and affect intensity, for each of the five dependent variables (pleasure, arousal, evaluation of the store environment, evaluation of the products, and intention to revisit the store), a moderated regression analysis was conducted with scent (categorical variable, 0/1 coded), one of the individual differences (hedonic shopping motivation or affect intensity; continuous variables, mean corrected), and the interaction term of these two variables as independent variables (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0013916511410421">Cronbach, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0013916511410421">Irwin &amp; McClelland, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0013916511410421">McClelland, 1997</xref>). The results are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0013916511410421">Tables 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0013916511410421">5</xref>. As expected, ambient scent and affect intensity did not have a significant simple effect on the dependent variables when affect intensity was added to the analysis. When hedonic shopping motivation was considered, one significant simple effect of ambient scent was found, evaluation of the products—<italic>t</italic>(125) = 1.76, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .10. Moreover, consumers who had a high hedonic shopping motivation felt more pleasure, <italic>t</italic>(125) = 1.93, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .10, and evaluated the store environment, <italic>t</italic>(125)= 2.80, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01, and the products, <italic>t</italic>(125) = 3.34; <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01, more positively than consumers with a low hedonic shopping motivation.</p>

<p>Concerning affect intensity, the presence of a pleasant ambient scent had a positive influence on pleasure, the evaluation of the store environment, the evaluation of the products, and the intention to revisit the store for customers who responded intensely to emotional stimuli (high affect intensity). The presence of an ambient scent had no influence on customers who do not respond intensely to emotional stimuli (largest <italic>t</italic> value ≤ −.47, all <italic>p</italic> &gt; .10; two-tailed test because there was no expected direction). Hence, H2 is largely supported.</p>
<p>However, regarding hedonic shopping motivation, the presence of a pleasant ambient scent had no influence on customers with high hedonic shopping motivation (largest <italic>t</italic> value ≤ −.80, all one-tailed <italic>p</italic> ≥ .10). However, the presence of an ambient scent had an unexpected positive influence on pleasure, evaluation of the store environment, and evaluation of the products of customers with low shopping motivation (two-tailed test because there was no expected direction). Hence, H3 is not supported.</p>

<title>Discussion and Conclusion</title>
<p>The aim of this article was to first, examine the impact of a pleasant ambient scent on affective reactions, evaluations, and intentions to revisit the store in a high affective involvement retail environment and second, to determine whether shopping motivation and affect intensity have a moderating role in this effect. We expected that the presence of a pleasant ambient scent would lead to enhanced affective reactions, evaluations, and behavioral intentions compared with the absence of a pleasant scent and our hypotheses were, for the most part, supported. Indeed, the presence of a pleasant ambient scent in the store positively impacted all dependent variables (i.e., pleasure, arousal, evaluation of the store environment, evaluation of the products, and intention to revisit the store). These findings are in line with past research that identifies ambient scent as an important marketing instrument (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0013916511410421">Bosmans, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0013916511410421">Spangenberg et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0013916511410421">Spangenberg, Sprott, Grohmann, &amp; Tracy, 2006</xref>). Moreover, our research confirms that in a high-affective-involvement setting, pleasant ambient scent positively influences affective reactions experienced in a retail environment as compared with studies conducted in a low-involvement setting (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0013916511410421">Morrin &amp; Ratneshwar, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0013916511410421">Spangenberg et al., 1996</xref>). In our subsample of 129 participants who completed the second survey regarding the individual differences in hedonic shopping motivation and affect intensity, this positive pleasant scent effect was also found in consumers’ evaluations of both the store environment and the products. In addition, theory is advanced by the finding that affect intensity has a significant moderating influence on the relationship between scent and consumer reactions (in four out of five cases). More precisely, individuals who scored highly on affect intensity were more sensitive to the presence of a scent in the shopping environment, leading to enhanced positive affect, evaluations, and behavioral intentions. These results support and give substance to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0013916511410421">Gulas and Bloch’s (1995)</xref> notion that individual consumer characteristics influence the effect of an ambient scent in a shopping environment.</p>
<p>Regarding shopping motivation, we found no effect of a pleasant ambient scent on customers with a high hedonic shopping motivation. Consumers who shop for entertainment and personal pleasure actively search for hedonic experiences. As the experiment took place in a prestigious clothing store already filled with hedonic elements, it is possible that a pleasant ambient scent did not enhance the shopping experience for consumers with a high hedonic shopping motivation. In fact, high hedonic shoppers already highly rated all dependent variables except arousal in the control condition (≥6 on 7-point scale), which may have provided too little room for improvement by diffusing a scent (ceiling effect). However, for consumers with a low hedonic shopping motivation, the pleasant ambient fragrance had an unexpected positive effect on pleasure and evaluations although these consumers are more driven by nonhedonic motives and do not actively search for hedonic experiences. This might be because fragrances also alter consumer reactions when they are unconsciously perceived (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0013916511410421">Labbe, Rytz, Morgenegg, Ali, &amp; Martin, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0013916511410421">Soars, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0013916511410421">Ward, Davies, &amp; Kooijman, 2007</xref>). This means that for consumers with a high hedonic shopping motivation, the type of store that they were in inhibited the scent effect. This may also imply that a pleasant ambient scent will affect both high and low hedonic shoppers in a more downscale store.</p>
<p>In support of the above discussed relationship between hedonic shopping motivation and the dependent variables in this prestigious clothing store, we found that hedonic shopping motivation had a positive influence on a few aspects of consumer behavior (i.e., pleasure and evaluation of the store environment and the products). As suggested above, this might be explained by the type of setting in which the experiment took place. An upscale clothing store may be more appreciated by consumers who score high on hedonic shopping motivation.</p>

<title>Limitations, Further Research, and Implications</title>
<p>In this study, a single scent in a single retail environment was used. Hence, we must be cautious to infer results from this scent and setting to other conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0013916511410421">Soars, 2009</xref>). In addition, the fragrance used in this study appears to be not only pleasant but also arousing. A pleasant yet slightly arousing scent may not have the same result. Moreover, we did not verify whether the scent evoked a particular concept or memory. Future research could replicate this study with a variety of scents that exhibit differences in pleasantness, arousal, evocativeness, and congruency with the product (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0013916511410421">Mitchell, Kahn, &amp; Knasko, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0013916511410421">Schifferstein &amp; Blok, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0013916511410421">Seo et al., 2010</xref>) in various types of stores and settings. It is possible that the presence of a pleasant scent in the store affected participants’ willingness to take part in the study. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0013916511410421">Baron and Thomley (1994)</xref> found that exposure to a pleasant odor increased the time a participant was willing to spend volunteering in an experiment. Future research should also investigate the interaction of fragrances with other atmospheric cues because shopping is a holistic experience in which a consumer is exposed to several environmental elements at the same time. Although some studies have already explored the combined effect of scents and other atmospheric stimuli on shopping behavior (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0013916511410421">Fiore, Yah, &amp; Yoh, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0013916511410421">Spangenberg et al., 2005</xref>), additional research is still needed. Future research should also focus on identifying other individual differences that moderate the effect of fragrances on consumer behavior.</p>
<p>Using pleasant ambient fragrances in a shopping environment can create promising opportunities for retailers. An ambient scent is a malleable atmospheric cue; it can be altered relatively easily to change the atmospheric sensation a consumer may experience while shopping. Even consumers who do not search for hedonic experiences can be influenced by a pleasant ambient scent because it operates on a subconscious level. Moreover, retailers can use ambient scents to differentiate their store from their competitors. However, retailers must keep in mind that not all consumers will be affected by the presence of a fragrance. Based on the target audience, a retailer should decide whether or not to disperse a scent. In addition, our results with respect to hedonic shopping motivation and affect intensity have practical implications. For example, previous research shows that women score higher on affect intensity than men (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0013916511410421">Larsen &amp; Diener, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0013916511410421">Moore, 2004</xref>), indicating that scent marketing would be more appropriate for stores with a female target audience.</p>
