<abstract>
<p>Phase out of specific refrigerant use within extruded polystyrene foam requires reformulation to meet ever-evolving regulatory considerations; elimination of hydrochlorofluorocarbon-based blowing agents is one such example. While this transition has been applied to insulation sheathing addressing the bulk of extruded polystyrene use, large-celled formulations intended for billet applications can differ considerably from these. Reformulation, however, cannot result in unacceptable changes which impact desired performance. Further, the differences inherent to hydrochlorofluorocarbon and hydrofluorocarbon blowing agents require additional attention around appropriate co-blowing agent and resin selection strategies. The unique approaches for large-celled foams to balance the often competing needs and relationships between material selection, processing conditions, expansion behavior and end-use properties are described. Large-celled hydrofluorocarbon-based foams with zero-ozone depletion potential that can perform in a manner consistent with hydrochlorofluorocarbon predecessors are demonstrated.</p>

<sec id="sec1-0021955X13479390" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Since the first development of the technology over 60 years ago,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0021955X13479390">1</xref></sup> extruded polystyrene (XPS) foams have demonstrated utility in commercial and industrial applications targeting thermal insulation,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0021955X13479390">2</xref></sup> with their mechanical properties and moisture resistance differentiating them from alternatives such as expanded polystyrene (EPS) and insulating glass batting. Within the XPS foam family there are products which have additional mechanical attributes that can differ considerably from standard residential and commercial insulation to meet specific application needs. One such need is the ability to be easily machined and fabricated into intricate shapes. A second requirement is for thicknesses much greater than standard rigid-board insulation to allow foam fabrication into large, three-dimensional shapes.</p>
<p>An important application requiring the traditional physical properties of XPS foam coupled with the ability to be fabricated into intricate shapes is insulation intended for industrial process piping, as this requires differing shapes and sizes for shells, valves, and fittings. Typical fabricated pipe shells with their method of assembly are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0021955X13479390">Figure 1</xref>.
<fig id="fig1-0021955X13479390" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Image of fabricated pipe shells from extruded polystyrene billets (top) and schematic of an insulated pipe (bottom).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0021955X13479390-fig1.tif"/>
</fig></p>
<p>These additional attributes of XPS foam require alternate formulation approaches in order to achieve the desired range of characteristics.</p>
<p>Experience has shown that large cells are necessary to accommodate machining with appropriate surface quality. Foams with cells under 1 mm are typically more difficult to generate surfaces with adequate finishes due to mechanical tearing and smearing which accompanies the increased number of cell walls. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0021955X13479390">Figure 2</xref> illustrates the relative differences between insulation foams intended for use in pipe and residential wall sheathing.
<fig id="fig2-0021955X13479390" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p>Cell size and morphology differences between typical large-celled billet foam (left) and extruded polystyrene insulation sheathing (right).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0021955X13479390-fig2.tif"/>
</fig></p>
<p>It is particularly challenging to achieve all of the desired mechanical characteristics for refrigerant piping insulation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0021955X13479390">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0021955X13479390">4</xref></sup> such as insulation performance, compressive and flex strength, density, and heat distortion resistance alongside the competing need of larger cell sizes for acceptable fabrication performance. In refrigerant piping applications, the thermal conductivity, water vapor permeance, and water absorption resistance are critical. Failure to manage moisture issues can lead to thermal efficiency loss, condensation, ice formation beneath the insulation, and subsequent disruption of the mechanical fit and associated thermal integrity. While low permanence vapor and weather retarding layers are typically employed, the insulating material itself must be inherently resistant to moisture intrusion and exhibit consistency within the cellular matrix. Consequently, materials with relatively high moisture absorption and transfer rates such as molded bead EPS are not usually used in refrigerant piping applications. Extruded polystyrene, cellular glass, and polyisocyanurates are the predominant insulation products used in the refrigerant piping insulation market.</p>
<p>Traditional formulations for XPS billet applications have employed chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) and hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC)-based refrigerants. However, evolving regulatory considerations such as the 1987 Montreal Protocol dictated phase-outs of such gasses due to their high-ozone depletion potentials (ODPs) by 1 January 2010. Additional considerations around the use of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and their subsequent propensity for photochemical reactivity within the lower atmosphere also constrained available blowing agent (BA) options.</p>
<p>Consistent with these requirements, The Dow Chemical Company converted<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0021955X13479390">5</xref></sup> production of STYROFOAM™ Brand foam away from HCFCs in 2009. This article describes the formulation considerations to accommodate the often competing needs between processing conditions, nucleation, foaming behavior, and their associated impact on BA selection and subsequent properties for the unique needs of large-celled, large cross-sectional foam products. The resultant zero-ODP products implemented exhibit equivalent performance to past HCFC-containing formulations, meeting all the application requirements.</p>

<sec id="sec4-0021955X13479390"><title>Blowing agent and nucleation considerations</title>
<p>The impact of cell size on both foaming behavior and application performance is considerable. In general, insulating foam products target small cell sizes for optimal thermal performance. Market needs for large cross-sections and improved machinability dictate the requirement for larger foam cell sizes. Consequently, the factors governing cell growth and stabilization of larger cell foams become critical considerations in formulation design.</p>
<p>If the nucleation rate is high, rapid diffusion of the dissolved BA within the mixture to the numerous initiated voids occurs with a rapid increase in cell vapor pressure, thus resulting in high expansion rates. However, this process characteristic also quickly depletes the surrounding areas of BA content, leading to more rapid cooling due to evaporation and associated expansion. This in turn influences resin viscoelastic properties, constraining overall board growth. Conversely, with fewer nucleation sites, slower overall expansion occurs. There is (i) greater dissolved gas available for cell expansion due to their fewer numbers, (ii) longer diffusion distances between the nucleated cells, and (iii) extended plasticization/<italic>T</italic><sub>g</sub> depression because of the longer residence of the solubilized BA within the polymer. Consequently, the foam expands at a lower rate under these conditions.</p>
<p>Moderating nucleation and selecting proper BA characteristics are then key elements for large-celled foam. Lower overall BA levels and those with lower vapor pressures and higher solubility within the polymer are generally favored for lessened nucleation rates. Slower transport properties are also preferred for large-celled expansion, as is minimization of chemical and particulate additives which promote heterogeneous nucleation.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0021955X13479390">Table 1</xref> lists a select number of BAs which represent practical potential candidates, with their relevant properties in PS for comparison. While the most soluble BAs possess ideal physical characteristics for large-cell generation, excessive solubility at use temperatures can subsequently result in degraded mechanical foam behavior, eliminating them from consideration. Consequently, prior large-cell formulations employed blends of HCFC-142b and HCFC-22 due to coincident favorable solubility, vapor pressure, and transport properties. Elimination of HCFC’s due to their associated non-zero ODP levels, along with regional considerations around VOC classifications can further restrict hydrocarbon choices or high solubility alcohols such as EtOH.</p>
<p>Chlorine-free options include hydrofluorocarbon (HFC)-134a, HFC-152a and HFC-32. The higher molecular weight of HFC-134a with its accompanying lower diffusivity in styrenic polymers makes it a desirable BA for insulating applications. However, among its trade-offs are higher nucleation resulting in decreased cell size. An appropriate selection of co-BAs is required to modify overall formulation behavior, with the specific combination and content levels reflecting interdependency among the variables controlling processing, nucleation potential, board growth, shaping and setup of the plasticized foam, and final resultant mechanical characteristics.</p>
<p>Water is an ideal formulation choice from an environmental perspective, though its use requires modification to other system characteristics to take full advantage of its potential. Since its solubility in PS is low, the amount which can be employed prior to the onset of pinholes and non-uniform or open cells is minimal. Consequently, Dow Chemical has adopted modifications to PS which include PS-<italic>co</italic>-AN, enabling use of water as a benign, non-nucleating constituent at loadings which can provide significant impact to density.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-0021955X13479390"><title>Extrusion of plasticized polymer</title>
<p>In addition to nucleation potential and the ability to achieve appropriate cross-sectional dimensions via foam growth, BAs facilitate processing the polymer at extrusion rates consistent with production demands. Dissolution of sufficient BA within the polymer lowers system pressures through plasticization and <italic>T</italic><sub>g</sub> depression. However, excess BA can lead to undesirable expansion behavior and prevent stable board formation with the desired dimensions and mechanical properties. Furthermore, dynamic solubility must be anticipated for the particular foaming hardware employed, as clusters of incompletely solubilized BA can lead to pre-foaming, open cells, and inability to adequately control the foam exiting the die.</p>
<p>As an example, a typical large-celled formulation can consist of PS with HCFC-142b, HCFC-22 (R22), and CO<sub>2</sub>, whose simulated pressure drop within a given foaming system can be represented as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0021955X13479390">Figure 4</xref>. Also illustrated are curves representing HFC-134a/CO<sub>2</sub> combinations. Excess pressures at the extruder are undesirable in that they ultimately represent upper limits associated with rates in conjunction with hardware design, and are coupled with the need to maintain sufficient pressure at the die to prevent premature nucleation within the system. Previous HCFC-based formulations meet a variety of criteria around overall pressure drop. In comparison, limitations of potential BA replacements with respect to processing become apparent as insufficient HFC-134a/CO<sub>2</sub> alone cannot provide adequate plasticization within thermodynamic and kinetic solubility limits, and drastically increased processing pressures are observed. Conversely, at relatively higher loadings this BA combination may perform acceptably with respect to system pressures, but cell sizes can be reduced below acceptable limits for large-celled applications due to excess nucleation. Also, though combinations of plasticizing and/or cell size enlarging agents may offset selected processing and nucleation issues, mechanical properties detrimental to application requirements will prevail if additives remain non-fugitive.

<p>PS resin variations have previously been demonstrated to offer advantages<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0021955X13479390">8</xref></sup> with respect to insulation performance. Use of PS-<italic>co</italic>-AN also allows introduction of sufficient quantities of water to reduce mixture viscosity, while avoiding excessive nucleation. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0021955X13479390">Figure 5</xref> illustrates simulation results which demonstrate that water with additional co-BAs whose solubilities differ, such as HFC-152a and HFC-32, allow further flexibility around reduction in system pressures. Consequently, proper co-BA selection at the appropriate ratios can enable acceptable line operation, while addressing coincident constraints associated with nucleation, foam growth, dimensional stability, and thermal conductivity.

<sec id="sec6-0021955X13479390"><title>Machinability</title>
<p>Primary application considerations include machinable foam characteristics which are compatible with historically applied fabrication techniques following curing. Machined surface requirements in some instances are purely aesthetic, while others demand close fit tolerances to maintain thermal performance of an assembled insulation system. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0021955X13479390">Figure 6</xref> illustrates typical differences which can be observed between foams using otherwise identical machining procedures. Not only do varying cellular characteristics introduce changes in machining behavior, but resin molecular weight, orientation,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0021955X13479390">9</xref></sup> and foam density also impact resultant surface roughness and uniformity.
<fig id="fig6-0021955X13479390" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><p>Contrast of machined sections demonstrating excessive edge damage/pitting/tears (upper) vs. uniform surfaces (lower).

</fig></p>
<p>In particular, design of specific molecular weight co-polymer blends assist in achieving not only the melt properties and viscosities demanded by the foaming process for successful board forming, but also for acceptable performance within mechanical shaping processes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0021955X13479390">10</xref></sup> PS-<italic>co</italic>-SAN foam with effective <italic>M</italic><sub>w</sub> ranging from 83 to 144 kg/mol was produced with similar densities (∼29–30 kg/m<sup>3</sup>) and cell sizes ranging from ∼1.8 to 2.2 mm. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0021955X13479390">Figure 7</xref> demonstrates the prevailing inverse friability relationship of mass loss with molecular weight. A rapid decrease with increasing molecular weight results in identification of blend ranges whose mass losses are approximately equivalent to the incumbent HCFC-142b formulation.

</fig></p>
<p>Additionally, if molecular weight is too low, overall mechanical properties are inadequate for handling purposes; conversely, as molecular weight is increased, minimal weight loss will be experienced but commercially practiced cutting methods can introduce excessive heat buildup accompanied by smear and tear, rendering unacceptable surfaces. Practical machining tests summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0021955X13479390">Figure 8</xref> illustrate this qualitative impact of molecular weight and also, that while cell size and density may be similar between foams, not all BA selections result in similar machining behavior. Differences can be attributed to their respective solubility impact on expansion rates, and the fact that some BA will remain within the cell struts and windows at atmospheric pressures which can then influence polymer behavior during the cutting process.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0021955X13479390">11</xref></sup>
<fig id="fig8-0021955X13479390" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><p>Evaluation of fabricated articles from PS-<italic>co</italic>-AN foam of varying effective molecular weights using HFC-152a (top) or HFC-32 (bottom).

</fig></p>
<p>Additional physical property evaluation reveals further constraints around formulation requirements. As machined articles are three-dimensional, compressive strength in the three orthogonal directions would ideally be equal. Cellular orientation imposed by the extrusion and forming process renders this physically impossible, but control via appropriate forming practices can be exercised. As the ratio of compressive strengths in two directions (balance) approaches unity, mechanical properties generally exhibit greater homogeneity. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0021955X13479390">Figure 9</xref> illustrates additional machinability sensitivity associated with the general non-homogeneity inherent to extruded cellular structures, in that high balance values can result in scattered machining results even at similar molecular weights.

Solid horizontal line represents qualitative acceptability boundary.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0021955X13479390-fig9.tif"/>
</fig></p>
<p>Further factors associated with machinability include the degree of polymer chain orientation within the cured foam, as increased chain alignment can contribute to heterogeneous mechanical characteristics. Increased orientation can be imparted through greater foam cooling and expansion rates following die exit, which then couples with cellular morphology and board-forming influences. Machinability is further impacted by density due to the greater overall mass associated with struts and cell walls which must be cut to generate a surface. This can induce rougher topography and require modifications to cutting technique, resulting in reduced throughput. Consequently, re-formulation must also yield foams within appropriate density ranges.</p>

<p>Although the selection of a given BA impacts the processing behavior, for insulation-related use the thermal performance within the resultant foam is the primary driver. HFC-134a is a preferred choice from a thermal conductivity standpoint due to its lower diffusivity and thus, its retention within the cells for longer durations. As previously described, lower BA levels are limited in part by processing pressures, while upper limits can be restricted due to nucleation and dynamic solubility within a given processing system. Commonly practiced BA retention techniques such as surface lamination are impractical for machined articles, and so thermal performance for such applications revolves around the interdependent system variables such as BA types and levels, overall density, and cell size. Once foam material selections are made, cell size and BA levels then become critical design elements.</p>

<p>Diffusion-driven exchange of cell gas with ambient air over time is a characteristic of all polymeric cellular structures, inducing the thermal performance shifts described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11-0021955X13479390">Figure 11</xref>. Thermal conductivity modeling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0021955X13479390">7</xref></sup> enables cell gas pressure to be calculated as function of time, foam properties, and specific formulation content. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12-0021955X13479390">Figure 12</xref> illustrates projected cell contents for HCFC and HFC systems. Overall internal gas pressure at any given time is a balance between this simultaneous exchange, influenced by both the transport properties of the BA/resin and the relative constituent concentration differences which prevail at a given time. Pressure will typically rise to a maximum followed by a decrease, with eventual equilibration of the internal contents with the surroundings. Control of cell pressure is critical, particularly within large-cell billets whose thicknesses are greater than 200 mm, as excessive gradients through the cross-section can lead to elastic deformation following billet sectioning and fabrication until overall equilibration is complete. This post-foaming phenomenon further emphasizes the importance of co-BA selections compatible not only with processing needs, but also with unique application requirements.

<sec id="sec8-0021955X13479390"><title>Summary</title>
<p>Large-celled foam formulations differ considerably from typical insulated sheathing, requiring unique approaches to balance the often competing needs between processing conditions, expansion behavior, and meeting the properties necessary for their targeted applications. Further, the differences inherent to HCFC and HFC BAs require additional attention around appropriate co-BA and resin selection strategies. Reformulation, however, cannot result in unacceptable changes which impact desired performance.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0021955X13479390">Table 2</xref> illustrates that such consideration of the material and processing interrelationships has resulted in zero-ODP large-celled HFC foam which can perform in a manner consistent with HCFC predecessors.
