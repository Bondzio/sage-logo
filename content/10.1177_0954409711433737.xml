<abstract>
<p>The introduction of personal rapid transit (PRT) systems has been widely discussed in the field of transportation research. However, there is no robust criterion to derive station capacities, which is the determinant of overall capacity for a PRT system. The present study has provided a methodology to rigorously compute the capacity for simple serial-berth PRT stations with a single platform by considering three decisive factors: the demand level of incoming cars and outgoing passengers, the station structure and the operation strategy. A micro-level simulator was developed to analyze and derive station capacities for various combinations of these factors. In particular, the relationship between the wave-off rate and the waiting time, the factors that represent the level of passenger service, was investigated in detail. The station structure, represented by the number of platform berths, input queue berths and output queue berths, was also taken into account. Although a sufficient number of berths were provided (11 platform berths, 11 output queue berths and more than 22 input queue berths), it was impossible to operate a PRT station at an acceptable service level for passengers when the total demand was high (2500 per hour). Even when the total demand was less than or equal to 2000 per hour, it turned out that a relatively large number of station berths is required to ensure the service level.</p>

<sec id="sec1-0954409711433737" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Experts in the field of transportation have debated the utility of personal rapid transit (PRT) systems since the concept was introduced in the early 1960s. Although some researchers doubt the feasibility of PRT to accommodate passenger demand in densely populated areas,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0954409711433737">1</xref></sup> they rarely provide plausible evidence to support their arguments. Even proponents of PRT who are attempting to install PRT systems in real sites take little account of the operating capacity of PRTs, emphasizing only the physical elements of the PRT system such as tracks, cars and signals.</p>
<p>Of course, there are several studies that have dealt with PRT capacity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0954409711433737">2</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0954409711433737">4</xref></sup> However, these studies were all limited due to the intrinsic complexity of PRTs and the large number of factors associated with PRT capacities. According to previous studies, there are three unit capacities that determine the overall capacity of a PRT system. The first is the main line’s capacity. For a general PRT system, a very short headway between consecutive cars running on a main line is allowed (&lt;0.5 s). The rationale for this headway can be found in Anderson<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0954409711433737">5</xref></sup> and McKinnon.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0954409711433737">6</xref></sup> While these two studies were dependant on their own arguments and assumptions, a field test conducted by the NAHSC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0954409711433737">7</xref></sup> provided the practical groundwork for such a short headway. The test confirmed that it was possible to obtain a headway time of 0.3 s when eight cars operated in a platoon were running at 80 k/h on a real highway segment. A point that shows even more promise is that cars adopted in PRT systems were much smaller and lighter than those that participated in the test, which could offer an extra advantage in accomplishing a shorter headway. If a headway of 0.5 s were used, the line throughput would be 7200 vehicles in an hour. Such a high level of throughput is enough to provide a PRT system with great flexibility in both design and operation. Nevertheless, a surge in traffic demand might exceed this level on a specific track segment. Such an overflow is not within the range of capacity adjustment, but has to be resolved by revising either the car-routing strategy or the network configuration.</p>
<p>Second, the merging point is another determinant of the overall capacity of a PRT system. Generally, even PRT systems based on an asynchronous control strategy use a synchronous control strategy at least partly in the vicinity of merging points. Since merging more than two upstream legs is not allowed in most PRT systems, the sum of traffic flow of the two upstream segments should be less than the maximum throughput on the downstream segment, which is the same as the capacity of the main line. If traffic demand on the downstream segment exceeds the threshold value, which is more likely to happen than in the case of main line overflow, the problem can be sorted out by re-routing cars en route.</p>
<p>Finally, the most complicated factor among unit capacities of a PRT system is station capacity, which is the focus of the present study. It is highly likely that station capacity will govern the overall capacity of a PRT system. Of course, previous studies have already dealt with station capacity, but, as mentioned earlier, these studies presented capacity outcomes for limited cases of traffic demand conditions. The present study investigates capacities of PRT stations and influential factors for various conditions with respect to traffic demand patterns and physical configurations given a specific operating strategy. The present study deals with a single type of PRT station, i.e. a simple serial-berth station with a single platform (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0954409711433737">Figure 1</xref>) since it is the most basic and common configuration of PRT stations; its results can, however, be extended to other types of stations.
<fig id="fig1-0954409711433737" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Serial-berth station with a single platform.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0954409711433737-fig1.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>A definition of station capacity is provided in the next section along with a discussion on the factors that influene station capacity. A brief description of the simulator, which was developed based on the aforementioned factors and their effects on station capacity is provided in the third section. The maximum throughputs for incoming cars and outgoing passengers are drived in the fourth section and the obtained results are compared to those reported in the literature. The wave-off rate and waiting time to ensure an acceptable level of passenger services are also investigated. In the last section conclusions are drawn and further studies needed to extend the value of the present study are proposed.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-0954409711433737"><title>Factors determining station capacity</title>
<p>The definition of station capacity must be clarified prior to describing its influencing factors. There are two types of station capacity. The first one is the maximum number of occupied cars that can enter a station during an hour under given conditions, which hereafter will be referred to as “car throughput.” The second one is the maximum number of passengers who can depart from a station during an hour under given conditions, which hereafter will be referred to as “passenger throughput.” The difficulty in calculating these two capacities is that they are interdependent factors. This means that maximizing one may entail sacrificing the other. The wave-off rate, which is defined as the fraction of cars unable to enter a station due to the unavailability of waiting berths, should be considered when dealing with car throughput. Passenger waiting time should also be taken into account with respect to passenger throughput.</p>
<p>The external factors affecting station capacities can be categorized into three groups. The first group includes factors regarding the traffic demand pattern. For a given station demand, the number of passenger departures correlates with demand for car arrivals. They sometimes supplement or sometimes conflict with each other. Unlike previous studies of PRT station capacity, the present study examines the effects of various proportions of these factors on both wave-off rate and waiting times. When the number of passengers awaiting departure is greater than that of arriving cars, the station calls extra cars to accommodate the surplus passengers. The availability of empty cars on the main line is another key factor that determines passenger throughput. However, the impact of empty car availability is not considered in the present study. Instead, it is assumed that enough empty cars are always available to accommodate calls from the station. A car leaving a platform has to wait in the output queue until an empty slot is found on the main line. When the traffic load on the main line is heavy, it is hard to find an empty slot, and then passenger throughput may decrease. However, such a condition was rarely found in the present investigation because of the off-line structure of the station and the relatively small headway on the main line.</p>
<p>The second group of factors represents the physical configuration of the PRT station. The number of berths is well known to affect both car and passenger capacities. Previous studies delved into the effects of combinations of station berths on station capacities.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0954409711433737">2</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0954409711433737">4</xref></sup> The effect of the number of berths on station capacities is also examined in the present study. Once the platoon operation is used, it is clear that the number of output queue berths has to be equal to the number of platform berths, and that the number of input queues has to be greater than or equal to the number of platform berths.</p>
<p>The last group of factors includes operation strategies such as moving cars on the main line, controlling cars off the line, and boarding and disembarking passengers. As mentioned earlier, most PRT systems use synchronous control in the vicinity of stations with both merging and diverging points regardless of the control systems they use on the main line. The present study also follows this convention. When cars are moving within a station, a platoon strategy is safer than a trickle strategy, because it can avoid the potentially dangerous situation of a car approaching behind a car that is disambarking and boarding passengers. In the platoon strategy, the same number of cars as platform berths collectively enters or leaves the platform when they are ready to move. The time taken to complete both disambarking and boarding of cars in a platoon has a major influence on station capacity. It is well known that passenger boarding or disembarking time follows a lognormal distribution; i.e. the time period is greater than zero, and its distribution takes an asymmetrical form with a longer right tail.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec3-0954409711433737"><title>Simulator to analyze station capacity</title>
<p>A simulator was developed to analyze station capacities based on various combinations of the aforementioned factors. The code for the simulator was written in Java 1.6 and fully conformed to object-oriented programming conventions. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0954409711433737">Figure 2</xref> shows the simulator’s main window. For brevity, details of the simulator will not be presented instead the four main logic elements used to implement the simulator are briefly addressed.
<fig id="fig2-0954409711433737" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p>Main window of the simulator.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0954409711433737-fig2.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>The logic for moving cars forward on the line was based on synchronous control<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0954409711433737">8</xref></sup> in which tracks are divided into short segments or “slots,” and cars proceed by a single slot in a time period that is equal to a given headway interval. The slot size is determined automatically by the product of the given headway and the speed. To avoid collisions, cars move forward only when the next slot is empty. The present study used a headway of 0.5 s and a speed of 9 m/s, so that the slot size on the main line was 4.5 m. The deceleration rate of cars entering the input queue and the acceleration rate of cars leaving the output queue was set as 2.5 m/s<sup>2</sup>, which resulted in the same length for entering and exiting sections. The used parameter values were set to be the same as in Irving et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0954409711433737">2</xref></sup> to allow easy comparison of the results obtained in the two studies. Cars were assumed to move in a platoon between the platform and the input queue or between the platform and the output queue. The speed at which cars in the platoon proceeded was set to 6.6 m/s, and the corresponding slot size was then 3.3 m. The car length was set at 3 m, and the slack distance between two consecutive cars was then 0.3 m, both of which are the same as that adopted by Irving et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0954409711433737">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>Even though parameters regarding car manuvering such as headway, speed and acceleration (or deceleration) rate are not primary concerns of the present study, their impact on station capacities was briefly investigated prior to dealing with the three factors chosen in the previous section. Headway had little impact on the operation of a station, as long as it was small enough to accommodate the sum of traffic flows passing through and being discharged from a station. In the present study, the maximum flow passing through and being discharged from a station was set as 3600 vehicles in an hour, which required a headway of 1 s on the next downstream link of a station. Thus, at least in the present study, headway time was not a determinant of station capacity unless it exceeded 1 s. As mentioned ealier, it is common in PRT operations to assume a headway time shorter than 1 s. Given a headway time, the increase in speed simply extended both the slot size and the length of the acceleration (deceleration) section, but had little influence on the operation of the station, since the vehicles maneuvers performed in the queue and the platform berths are totally different from those on the main line. The acceleration and deceleration rate only affected the length of the entering and exiting sections which have little impact on the performance of a station operation within a practical range of acceleration rate (less than 3.0 m/s<sup>2</sup>).</p>
<p>Passenger boarding and disembarking was the next logic element for the simulator. When assigning boarding and disembarking times to each passenger in the simulation, variability was considered along with the mean value. As mentioned earlier, boarding and disembarking times were assumed to follow a lognormal distribution. Normal variates were first generated using the Box–Muller method;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0954409711433737">9</xref></sup> then they were simply transformed to the corresponding lognormal variates. The mean and standard deviation values of the boarding and disembarking times used in the simulation are listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0954409711433737">Table 1</xref>.

<p>Car generation is simpler than the other logic elements since it can be done using a Monte Carlo simulation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0954409711433737">10</xref></sup> Of course, the average flowrate should be identical to the flowrate given in advance, even though cars enter the simulation at random. A Monte Carlo simulation was also used to distinguish empty cars, bypassing cars and cars destined for the station based on their predefined proportions. The simulation recognized a car generation by allotting a value of one to the binary variable that indicated whether or not the first slot on the upstream main line was occupied. Once a car was generated, the motion logic conveyed it through the station network (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0954409711433737">Figure 1</xref>) until it left the last slot on the downstream main line.</p>
<p>The arrival of passengers at a station, which represents the demand level of passenger departures from the station, was implemented based on a negative exponential distribution. <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula1-0954409711433737">Equation (1)</xref> denotes the form of the cumulative distribution function that is generally used in traffic engineering studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0954409711433737">11</xref></sup>

where <italic>h</italic> is the time headway between consecutive passengers, <italic>t</italic> is the time and <italic>T</italic> is the average period calculated as the reciprocal of the hourly passenger demand. The present study does not deal separately with passengers in groups, since the lognormal distribution is enough to reflect the variation in boarding and disembarking times based on to various sizes of passenger groups.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-0954409711433737"><title>Results from the simulation experiments</title>
<p>Prior to presenting the experimental results, it is necessary to make clear that the numbers reported in this section represent the average of more than 100 replications of the simulation experiment, and the random seeds were altered for each of the replications. A promising point is that the variation in performance measures such as the car throughput, the passenger throughput, the wave-off rate and the waiting time were very small across each replication. However, the variance in the waiting times across individual passengers in a single simulation experiment was so high that the waiting time could not be used as a robust performance measure. Details on this will be discussed later in this section.</p>
<p>In order to validate the simulator, the obtained throughputs for cars and passengers were compared with those of previous studies. The car throughput was derived under the assumption that a sufficiently large flow of occupied cars was destined to enter the station. In this case, the reverse flow was passengers who were to leave the station. The present study tested three levels of reverse flow: 200, 600 and 1000 passengers in an hour. The passenger throughput was derived under the assumption that an infinite queue of passengers was waiting for departure. Conversely, in this case the reverse flow was occupied cars arriving at the station. The same values of the former case were tested for reverse flow. For both cases, the simulation confirmed that based on the number of platform berths the variation in car and passenger throughput showed the same pattern as in previous studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0954409711433737">2</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0954409711433737">4</xref></sup> That is, car and passenger throughputs monotonically increased as the number of berths got larger, and their increase rate was damped with the number of berths. However, throughput results from the present investigation were slightly smaller than those from previous studies. The difference was exacerbated as the number of platform berths got larger. In the case of a minimal reverse flow (200 in an hour), the car and passenger throughput derived in the previous studies reached the level of 2000 in an hour,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0954409711433737">2</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0954409711433737">4</xref></sup> while those in the present study did not exceed 1800 in an hour as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0954409711433737">Figure 3</xref>. This shortfall was due possibly to the randomness of both car generation and passenger arrival, which was reinforced in the present study.
<fig id="fig3-0954409711433737" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p>Station capacities for ideal conditions for (a) car throughput as a function of the number of platform berths and (b) passenger throughput as a fuction of the number of platform berths.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0954409711433737-fig3.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>The previous studies were focused on two extreme cases where occupied cars arrived sufficiently, or an infinite queue of passengers existed with minimal reverse flow. However, the present study deals with various traffic conditions of car arrivals and passenger departures. Station capacities, which ensure an acceptable passenger service level, should be approximated through repetitive simulations, since a single run of a simulation only provides throughputs and performance measures for a given set of influencing factors. For brevity, only nine cases with three levels of total hourly demand (<italic>D</italic>) and three platform berth levels (<italic>N</italic><sub>p</sub>) were tested. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0954409711433737">Figure 4</xref> shows the relationship between wave-off rate and waiting time for several ratios between car arrivals and passenger departures. When <italic>D</italic> = 2500 per hour and <italic>N</italic><sub>p</sub> = 7, the equilibrium point (5:5), at which the level of car arrivals (1250 per hour) equals passenger departures (1250 per hour), is located roughly at the middle level of both the wave-off rate and the waiting time. When <italic>D</italic> decreases or <italic>N</italic><sub>p</sub> increases, the wave-off rate at the equilibrium point is likely to be at its minimum value, and the corresponding waiting time should be approaching its minimum value. The acceptable service level, at which the wave-off rate is less than 5%, and the waiting time does not exceed 1 min, is guaranteed only at the equilibrium point in which case the total demand is lower (<italic>D</italic> = 1000 per hour) and the number of platform berths is higher (<italic>N</italic><sub>p</sub> = 11).
<fig id="fig4-0954409711433737" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><p>Wave-off rate as a function of waiting time for total demand levels of (a)1000 per hour, (b) 2000 per hour and (c) 2500 per hour.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0954409711433737-fig4a.tif"/><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0954409711433737-fig4b.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>The wave-off rate and waiting time for the equilibrated traffic conditions was investigated further with respect to the berth configuration of the station. A station located in an area of mixed land use is likely to have an equilibrated demand pattern. Recently, new urban development studies that emphasized a transit-oriented approach to transportation infrastructure has confirmed that transit ridership is maximized when mixed land use prevails in the vicinity of stations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0954409711433737">12</xref></sup> Many PRT system proponents have also claimed that PRT systems can help achieve environmental sustainability.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0954409711433737">13</xref></sup> In this context, focusing on the equilibrium demand condition can be helpful to those who are attempting to provide commercial PRT services in urban areas with mixed land use. In order to approximate station capacities for the equilibrated traffic conditions, which guarantee an accepable service level for passengers, the same levels of total demand as previously used were chosen again, i.e. 1000, 2000 and 2500 passengers in an hour, each of which was the sum of the passenger departures and the car arrivals and represented a normal level of demand for other rapid transit systems in urban areas. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0954409711433737">Figures 5</xref> to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0954409711433737">7</xref> display the wave-off rate and the waiting time for the three levels of total demand, respectively. For each figure, three platform berth levels were chosen to identfy their impact on the wave-off rate and the waiting time. The total number of berths (“Total <italic>Q</italic>”) essentially represents the number of input queue berths, since the number of output queue berths was taken to be identical to the given number of platform berths.

As seen in the figure, an increase in the number of input queue berths becomes meaningless after exceeding a certain threshold. The effect of platform berths was found to be more important than that of input queue berths on reducing wave-off rate. It was found that more than 44 berths are necessary to accommodate 1000 arrivals and 1000 departures per hour simultaneously, ensuring that the wave-off rate should be kept to less than 5%. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0954409711433737">Figure 6(b)</xref> shows the relationship between the total number of berths and waiting time. The simulation showed that the waiting time remained constant once the number of input queue berths exceeded a certain threshold. The effect of platform berths was found to be more important than the number of input queue berths on reducing waiting times. However, it should be noted that when the total number of berths was 34, having only nine platform berths with 16 input queue berths was more advantageous than 11 platform berths with 12 input queue berths. More than 42 berths were required to ensure that the waiting time would be less than 1 min.

Both wave-off rate and wating times were flatter than the previous cases of smaller demand. Even when a large number of berths were provided, the wave-off rate and waiting times could not be reduced to an acceptable service level to ensure a wave-off rate of 5% and a waiting time of 1 min.</p>
<p>As a result, at least 23 berths were necessary to accommodate 500 passengers and 500 cars per hour at the acceptable service level. When each demand increased to 1000 per hour, the minimum required number of berths was more than 44 in order to guarantee an acceptable service level. For a total demand of more than 2000 per hour, given a sufficient number of berths (11 platform berths, 11 output queue berths and more than 22 input queue berths), it was impossible for a PRT station to be operated at an acceptable service level. Even though PRT is well known for non-stop and no-wait service, this would require a large amount of resources or even be impossible to achieve.</p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, the variation in waiting times for passengers was relatively higher as the total demand increased. The mean and variance proportionally increased as a function of the number of platform berths. This trend can be confirmed by reference to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0954409711433737">Figures 6(b)</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0954409711433737">7(b)</xref> for a bandwidth of mean±1 standard deviation. The variance was higher, particularly when the number of platform berths was insufficient. It is clear that special care must be taken when using waiting time as a criterion for judging station capacities.</p>

<p>The present study investigated station capacities of a PRT system based on various influencing factors. A simulator to derive station capacities for various combinations of factors was developed based on object-oriented programming conventions. The throughput for both car arrivals and passenger departures was obtained using the simulator. The simulator was then fully validated by comparing its outputs to those from previous studies. Various traffic demand patterns were adopted to investigate the relationship between wave-off rate and waiting time. The equilibrium condition, in which the level of car arrivals equals the number of passenger departures, was found to reduce both the wave-off rate and waiting time to an acceptable level. For equlibrium, station berths were found to significantly affect both the wave-off rate and the waiting time. When the total demand was more than, or equal to, 2000 per hour, platform berths affected the passenger service level more than the number of input queue berths. Although a sufficient number of berths (11 platform berths, 11 output queue berths and more than 22 input queue berths) were provided, it was impossible to operate a PRT station at an acceptable service level for passengers when the total demand was high (2500 per hour). Even when the total demand was less than 2500 per hour, a relatively large number of station berths was required to ensure a set level of service. In particular, the fluctuation of waiting times was so great that it could not be used as a robust performance measure.</p>
<p>The present study did not consider different kinds of station topology such as a multi-entrance station, parallel station or docking station. These kinds of stations might enhance PRT station capacity at the cost of more space. The trade-off between capacity and cost will be examined in future studies.</p>
