<p>This study of burn survivors in China makes an important contribution in further testing whether gender differences in coping patterns observed in North American studies of burn survivors are also observed in another culture. As such, it supports coping and cognitive behavior theories that posit that one’s outlook or appraisal is inextricably linked to coping responses and health outcomes.</p>
<p>The study contributes to the international literature that also demonstrates gender differences in response to illnesses and treatment. This differential response has implications for health and social policies governing eligibility for, and length of, compensation following injury.</p>
<p>Given the role of women in child rearing and housekeeping, the findings also have implications for the nature of social and health supports required by women in these circumstances after discharge. The findings demonstrate the need for nurses to be prepared in recognizing depressive symptomatology, even in cultures reluctant to endorse mental health problems.</p>
<p>In addition, nurses should be prepared to intervene with persons using avoidant coping styles as it is precisely these persons who would refuse a referral to a mental health professional.</p>
