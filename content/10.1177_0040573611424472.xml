<abstract>
<p>The Gospel is taken here as a model of the type of personal knowing and witness that gives its peculiar status to knowledge in the humanities. The Gospel according to Matthew is viewed in comparison with the other canonical Gospels in order to bring out its peculiar slant, particularly the way it reads Jesus’s life retrospectively in the light of Easter. This is especially apt for bringing out the way that the Gospel story is made to serve as a narrative illustration of what is known theologically through faith in Christ as experienced in worship and liturgy. The question of literary genre as raised by the Gospel threatens to crack the system of genres and force an acknowledgment of the uncanny type of knowledge that the humanities entail.</p>

<sec id="sec1-0040573611424472"><title>I. Gospel as Personal Knowing</title>
<p>At first glance, a Gospel would seem to be a kind of biography, the life-story of Jesus of Nazareth. Moreover, to the extent that it purports to be a true story about events among a certain people in a particular time and place, it might also be assimilated superficially to history. Indeed, much research into the Gospels has traditionally taken the form of the search for “the historical Jesus.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0040573611424472">1</xref></sup> But these resemblances to other genres are deceptive, for the Gospel is in crucial respects <italic>sui generis</italic>. Gospel, considered as a literary genre, is not to be confounded with history or biography. Its purpose is not to recount the facts of Jesus’ life per se, but to show what he meant for his disciples. Specifically, it shows how he revealed God to them in himself and thereby became their Savior. The Gospel witnesses to the power of Jesus to transform human lives and give them a new meaning. Gospel means literally “good news” (from Old English <italic>god,</italic> good, and <italic>spel</italic>, message or story—like <italic>Spiel</italic> in German, used also in English: “a long spiel”), and indeed it is good news that is meant to change people’s lives: it proclaims a message of salvation rather than simply telling a story or a history for its own sake.</p>
<p>If the Gospels only presented the objective facts of Jesus’ historical existence, they would not be able to say what is most important about him, for this is revealed only by his significance in the lives of the people whom he meets and who believe in him. It is his life-transforming power for the individuals who were changed by their belief in him that is supremely important, indeed miraculous. His followers were given new hope and were empowered to love in previously unattainable ways for which they could not possibly have accounted otherwise. A purely factual account of Jesus’ life—one hundred percent certain and demonstrated—would never be able to witness to the experience of this sort of power. A historian could at most tell us about a man, whereas those who believed in Jesus personally perceived and experienced God. The idea that Jesus was a divine being, the Son of God—how could that ever be an observable fact and be recorded as such? How can such a conviction even be meaningful, except within the context of a personal relationship? If you look, you see a man. And if you insist on looking for objective, empirical proof of his being something else, you will never know what Jesus meant to those who knew him and followed him and loved him and believed in him and found in him their salvation.</p>
<p>To appreciate the Gospels accurately even just as literature, we need to read them not as transparent to the historical Jesus, but as testimonies of faith.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0040573611424472">2</xref></sup> This makes it to a large degree futile to inquire, Did it really happen that way? What is being recorded fundamentally is how Jesus was <italic>experienced</italic>. To understand the Gospels as gospel—as the unique literary form and genre of religious testimony that they are—we need rather to ask, What meaning does that which is recounted have for those who experienced and perhaps <italic>still</italic> experience it? This is the meaning that can be interpreted and re-experienced as true in the present by readers in all ages, hence also by us still today. The Gospel is based on witness to purportedly historical happenings, yet it is fully unveiled never as naked history but rather always only for those who have made the commitment and decision of faith. Indeed, if humanities texts generally give us history and tradition always mediated by present reality and beliefs, this is acutely true in the case of the Gospels. For intrinsic to the Gospels as a genre is a further purpose beyond simply recording something that happened in the past: they deliver their testimony in order that the reader or hearer of the word of the Gospel might believe in turn and be saved. Their message is directed towards an actualization of God’s saving grace through Jesus in the lives of hearers and readers <italic>now</italic>, in the present tense of the Gospel as it is proclaimed, even in being read.</p>
<p>If the Gospel is also in some sense a history, it is best understood as a <italic>prophetic</italic> type of history. For what is at stake is a living of history in the present in the light of a divine revelation of its meaning. Such revelation takes up a point of view outside the sequence of past events and is not attainable from within that series. The Gospels are indeed prophetic in the way that the whole Bible is prophetic, namely, in the sense that by recounting history they reveal something beyond history, what in a certain traditional language of faith is called eternity. This is something which cannot be grasped as an objective fact in the order of the past or the future; it can only be lived and fathomed in the infinite freedom and openness of the present. As such, it is not fully formed and determinate, but is rather in the process of determining all facts in their deepest significances. History in this way opens towards eternity. But this eternal dimension of significance to human life cannot be experienced as anything positively given. It is projective rather than positive, and it claims the whole individual in the intimate sphere of personal experience and decision. The revelation of Jesus Christ cannot be approached without such directly personal engagement.</p>
<p>To this extent, it is clear that the Gospel concerns what can be called personal knowing.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0040573611424472">3</xref></sup> It is not fundamentally about facts but about their significance. It aims at opening up personal lives to possibilities beyond their parameters as ordinarily perceived. The knowledge of Jesus, in particular of Jesus as God, is inseparable from what people experience <italic>about themselves</italic> in relation to him. This experience occurs in the present and is decisive for the whole of their lives projected into the future without limit—and in this sense, for all eternity.</p>
<p>To appreciate the different sorts of personal significance that can be conveyed by the Gospel as a genre, it is important to distinguish a variety of sub-genres operating within it. Examples of these sub-genres include the miracle story, the controversy (against the scribes and Pharisees, for instance) and the parable. A parable is a comparison developed in story form, usually to induce the auditor to make a judgment on him- or herself. The parable told by the prophet Nathan to David in 2 Samuel 12 illustrates this well. It is told as a means of stirring up David’s conscience against himself for having had Uriah the Hittite placed in the front lines of battle to be killed, so that he, David, might possess Uriah’s wife, Bathsheba. Nathan recounts that a rich man, in order to dress a meal for a wayfarer, instead of using his own livestock took from a poor man his ewe lamb, his one and only, which he carried in his bosom. When David’s indignation is kindled, provoking him to cry out angrily for the offender’s death, Nathan concludes dramatically, “Thou art the man!”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0040573611424472">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>This example vividly illustrates how the effectual meaning of a parable arises out of and speaks into the specific situation of its hearers. These situations actually change through the process of transmission of the Gospels. Especially the conclusions or lessons drawn from parables tend to shift from being about the Kingdom of God—when Jesus tells them to the crowds—to being about Jesus himself, when they are told by the Gospel writers. In the light of Easter, their sense is transformed from being theological to being christological. They may even become ecclesiological in the light of Pentecost, when the Holy Spirit is bestowed in order to constitute the church (Acts 2:1–41). For example, the marriage feast parable addressed to the Pharisees in Matt 22:1–14 is taken by Luke 14:15–24 as addressed to Christians. Whereas for Jesus the good news was the advent of the Kingdom of God, for the writers of “the Gospel of Jesus Christ” (Mark 1:1), Jesus himself becomes the good news. He is himself the central event of the new world that he announces, which may not be how he originally intended it. And it is an even further extrapolation to understand the wedding banquet to be the church, which did not yet exist at the time of Jesus’ original telling of the parable.</p>
<p>In their quest for the historical Jesus, scholars seek to reconstruct Jesus’ preaching and ministry as it took place around 30 <sc>ce</sc>. However, this is only one of several types of study of the Gospels, each endeavoring to gain access to a different level of their meaning and significance for subsequent generations. Another type of study focuses on the stage immediately after Jesus’ ministry—on the oral elaboration of the Jesus tradition, from about 30 to 50 <sc>ce.</sc> This material is studied particularly by the discipline of Form Criticism, which endeavors to individuate the <italic>kerygma</italic>, or the proclamation of the essential Christian message of salvation, together with the liturgy and catechisms of the earliest churches as deposited in the documents of the New Testament and Apocrypha.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0040573611424472">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>After this period, the first written traditions would have begun to form, and attempts to isolate them constitute another discipline known as Source Criticism. This discipline offers, for example, the hypothesis of a Q document comprising the sayings of Jesus common to Matthew and Luke but not found in Mark. Such a text seems to have been available to Matthew and Luke, since they repeat large sections of Jesus’ teaching, agreeing with each other almost verbatim, though also with certain characteristic inflections of their own. Then sometime after 70 <sc>ce</sc>, the written Gospels began to appear, and establishing the derivations and transmission of the manuscripts is the business of Redaction Criticism.

<sec id="sec2-0040573611424472"><title>Comparison of Synoptic Traditions</title>
<p>If we pay attention to how they write about Jesus, we can discover the significance that the traditions conveying Jesus’ words and deeds had for each of the several Gospel writers and for the communities to which they belonged. For all the Gospel writers, that significance was that he was divine, and thus a miracle: their lives were changed by him, they experienced redemption and salvation. But it is also possible to finely distinguish between the various writers and their very distinct experiences of Jesus, reflecting their different communities and cultural backgrounds, as well as their different theological agendas.</p>
<p>The Gospel according to Matthew is characterized, in the first place, by its conspicuous Jewishness. It was evidently written by and for Christians converted from Judaism. This appears from the outset in its special emphasis on genealogy and on Jesus’ Davidic ancestry. Whereas Mark declares Jesus in his opening sentence to be the “son of God,” Matthew opens by identifying Jesus as “the Messiah, the son of David.” The first two chapters of Matthew, moreover, establish the pattern of reading every detail of Jesus’ life as a fulfillment of Old Testament prophecy. This can be verified for events of the Gospel from the virgin birth of the Messiah—understood as having been foretold by Isaiah (7:14)—to his coming out of Bethlehem, as predicted by Micah (5:2), to the going down to Egypt, which Matthew links to a verse of Hosea: “Out of Egypt I have called my son” (1:11). Similarly, the slaughter of the innocents is read by Matthew (2:18) in correspondence with the weeping and lamentation in Ramah of Rachel for her children, spoken of by Jeremiah (31:15).</p>
<p>This pattern continues throughout the Gospel according to Matthew with repeated references—they are much more insistent in Matthew’s version of the Gospel—to the Jewish Scriptures, most often to Isaiah and the Psalms, as proof texts. The procedure becomes fully explicit when, for example, Matthew adds to an account of Jesus’ miraculous healings: “This was to fulfill what had been spoken through the prophet Isaiah, ‘He took our infirmities and bore our diseases’” (8:17). The same appeal to fulfillment of Isaiah’s prophecies is made with reference to the chosen servant of the Lord and the oracle “I will put my Spirit upon him” in 12:17 (see further 4:14–16; 12:17–21; 13:35; 21:4–5; 27:9–10). Other clear indications of intimate involvement in Jewish affairs and their rival communities are the mission to Israel (10:6, 23), the story of the Canaanite woman (15:21–28) and the bitterness against the scribes and Pharisees (23:1–36; 12:1–14 etc.). At Jesus’ Roman trial, Matthew adds the dream of Pilate’s wife, thus deepening the guilt of the Jews as contravening a supernatural sign.</p>
<p>Sharply polemical against the unconverted Jewry of his day, Matthew’s message is that Jesus is the fulfillment of the Law and the prophets represented symbolically by Moses and Elijah, with whom Jesus appears transfigured on Mount Tabor. His face shines like the sun (17:2), just as did Moses’ when he came down from Mount Sinai bearing the tablets of the Law (Exod 34:29–35). Indeed, Jesus recapitulates in his own life the history of the Israelites coming up out of Egypt and wandering forty years in the desert. His forty days fasting in the wilderness, where he is tempted by the devil (ch. 4), are immediately followed by the proclamation in the Sermon on the Mount, starting from ch. 5, of what in effect is a new covenant with God that fulfills the covenant made with Moses on Mount Sinai. In showing that the revelation of God is now fully vested in Jesus, Matthew nevertheless always carefully articulates the emergence of the new faith from the matrices of Judaism.</p>
<p>The Gospel according to Matthew is also distinguished as characteristically Jewish by the weight given to Jesus’ teachings. His quintessentially rabbinical activity gives priority to the word, just as in the priestly story of the creation in Genesis. More about Jesus’ teaching is learned from Matthew than from any other Gospel writer. The teachings are concentrated into five great discourses (echoing the five-fold division of the books of Moses in the Pentateuch) that define the basic structure of this Gospel: the Sermon on the Mount in chs 5–7; the commissioning of the disciples sent upon missions in ch. 10; seven parables of the kingdom of heaven in ch. 13; the rule of life for a community of disciples in 18:1–20; and the apocalyptic discourse in chs 24–25. The alternation of such discursive passages with narrative sequences is repeated throughout this Gospel as a whole. This divides the Gospel according to Matthew into words and deeds: Jesus’ preaching is followed by his enactment of the Kingdom of God (again paralleling the creation paradigm: “And God said … and it was so”).</p>
<p>The greatest of these discourses is the Sermon on the Mount, in which Jesus fulfills the teaching of the law delivered by Moses from Mount Sinai. It begins with the beatitudes, which define a new kind of existence still immersed in the suffering of the world, yet in relation to God and therefore “blessed.” The beatitudes condense the core meaning and message of the gospel and present it as an intensification and interiorization, but not an abrogation, of the Jewish Law and Scriptures. This is stated explicitly, as we have noted, in the ensuing antitheses of ch. 5, beginning, “Think not that I am come to destroy the law or the prophets; I have come not to destroy but to fulfill” (5:17).</p>
<p>A related distinguishing characteristic of Matthew among the Gospels is that the role of the church is particularly pronounced. As the so-called “ecclesiological Gospel,” Matthew bears the communitarian stamp of its Jewish origins. Its religion is conceived as the religion of a people. The fundamental experience of the Messiah occurs particularly in community worship. Indeed, Matthew’s Jesus all along is the Risen Lord celebrated in the liturgy—far more than just the man Jesus peregrinating around Palestine. All these distinctive traits, and the biases they embody, come out by comparison of the accounts of given incidents and exchanges with the other synoptic writers, each marked by its own specific theology and cultural background.</p>
<p>Whereas Mark leads us to discover first the man Jesus of Nazareth, Matthew presents the glorified Lord right from the prostrations of the Magi in adoration before the infant Jesus (“they knelt down and paid him homage,” 2:11). The same gesture is repeated in closing this Gospel of the risen Christ with the disciples’ prostration before the resurrected Jesus on the mountain in Galilee (28:17). Matthew’s Jesus, moreover, is hieratic and solemn. He has a plethora of titles such as “King of Israel,” “Son of David.” At his Jewish trial, Jesus foretells his coming in glory as the Son of Man. Jesus presents himself, moreover, explicitly as the beloved Son of his Father (11:27) and is repeatedly recognized as such by his disciples (14:33; 16:16), whereas in Mark the disciples never seem able to grasp his messianic identity.</p>
<p>Matthew eliminates the emotion and ignorance attributed to Jesus by Mark. Jesus’ impotence as a prophet without honour in his own country (“he could there do no mighty work”) according to Mark 6:5 becomes in Matthew, “And he did not many mighty works there because of their unbelief” (13:58). Matthew consistently accentuates Jesus’ power. Matthew’s Passion narrative (chs 26–27) begins with Jesus’ foretelling of his crucifixion. From this point forward, Jesus is in control of the whole drama. He interprets the woman’s pouring of costly ointment on his head in a house in Bethany as an anointing for his burial (26:6–12). He is like a priest celebrating the sacrifice of the Mass. The last supper is framed by Jesus’ announcement of Judas’s betrayal and of Peter’s denial of him. He is conscious of himself as fulfilling the Scripture (26:31). The agony in the garden of Gethsemane shows Jesus’ human side and vulnerability, though he is still master of the situation, unlike his sleep-prone disciples, to whom he is able to announce, just before the event, that his betrayer is at hand (26:45–46). Even when he is arrested, Jesus has the power to summon twelve legions of angels, but he declines to use it (26:53) and rather preaches and practices non-resistance.</p>
<p>Matthew also streamlines the miracle stories, eliminating much realistic detail and presenting the disciples as much more like Christians of his own time, so as to suggest how Jesus continues his work of salvation in the community currently. An excellent example of this is the healing of Peter’s mother-in-law. Mark 1:29–30 tells of this incident as part of a day at Capernaum. Jesus exerts power physically, actually taking the woman by the hand and lifting her up. Luke 4:38–39 has organized a sequence of exorcisms within the day’s work at Capernaum and accordingly turns this healing into an exorcism in which Jesus “rebukes” the fever and “immediately she rose and served them.” The word “immediately” here represents a certain enhancement with respect to Mark: it heightens the wonder of the miracle. Matthew 8:14–15 gives this healing a different narrative setting altogether as part of ten miracles following the Sermon on the Mount. He concentrates the story on Jesus alone, eliminating the secondary personages and details. Jesus no longer needs to be told of the illness, nor is he beseeched to heal it. He simply “saw” the woman lying sick and “touched” her hand so that the fever left her, “and she rose and served him.” Mark and Luke conclude that she served “them” (the disciples), but Matthew insists that she served <italic>him</italic>. This, in effect, simplifies the story to make the mother-in-law a symbol of the resurrected church serving its glorified Lord.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0040573611424472">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>Similar tendencies in Matthew to sacrifice incidental narrative detail in order to more sharply focus the exact significance of Christ for the church can be documented by comparison of the synoptic accounts of the stilling of the storm (Matt 8:23–27; Mark 4:35–41; Luke 8:22–25). The disciples are swamped by the waves in a violent storm—<italic>seismos</italic>, suggesting a seismic eruption, which is symbolic of the end of the world. They wake and implore Jesus, saying, “Save, Lord; we are perishing.” The Greek <italic>Kyrie sōson</italic> (“Save, Lord”) was a liturgical formula in the early church, like <italic>Kyrie eleison</italic> (“Lord, have mercy”). It makes audible the church’s pleading for help and salvation. Matthew thus allows us to descry the contemporary experience of the early church at worship beneath the narrative of Jesus’ acts with his original disciples. The former is the experience out of which his narration arises and in which it remains embedded.</p>
<p>Such experience is the locus of religious truth experienced as always present in the revelation of Jesus as alive in the faith community and thus always the believer’s contemporary: it makes the Gospel the perfect paradigm of a humanities text. The truth of such texts happens all over again, ever again, in the event of their performance and interpretation. In liturgy and worship, Jesus is revealed as the risen Lord and as with his Church always, “even unto the end of the world” (28:20).</p>
<p>One must experience Jesus in the present in order to believe in the truth of the Gospel story. It is especially the present experience of the death and resurrection of Jesus that remains the literally crucial event out of which the whole of the gospel is conceived. This event and its being relived every day—<italic>hodie resurrexit</italic> (“He is risen today”), as the Easter liturgy has it—establishes the frame for the Gospel portrait of Jesus’ life as a whole.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec3-0040573611424472"><title>II. The Gospels Begin from Easter</title>
<p>As a testimony of faith in the risen Lord, the Gospels begin essentially from Easter. That is when the protagonist is revealed finally in his true identity and as establishing the Kingdom of God. Previously, apart from exceptionally privileged moments, such as Peter’s confession at Caesarea Philippi (Matt 16:13ff.), this identity has been closely guarded as the “messianic secret.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0040573611424472">7</xref></sup> Even after the revelation to Peter at Caesarea Philippi, the secret is reinstated immediately: “Then he sternly ordered his disciples not to tell anyone that he was the Messiah” (16:20). When asked why he speaks in parables in public, Jesus replies, “To you it has been given to know the secrets of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it has not been given” (13:11). It is only with the Easter event, comprising Christ’s death and resurrection, followed up by Pentecost and the pouring out of the Spirit, that the good news of Jesus Christ as the Son of God is ripe to be publicized beyond the circle of his intimates and disciples. From that point forward, everything is seen in a new light with the help of the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>The Easter experience is behind and within everything recounted by Matthew even about Jesus’ earthly existence: all the memories of him are transfigured in the light of Easter. Upon Easter are leveraged not only the New Testament’s celebrations of the risen Christ and the preaching of salvation through him, but also the narratives—especially Matthew’s—about his earlier life and mission: all point towards the Paschal mystery as the story’s climax and consummation.</p>
<p>Particularly significant, then, is the way the Gospels represent the Easter event itself narratively. There are basically two sets of images used to express the mystery of Easter: return to life and Ascension to glory. The first is a before/after schema serving to affirm continuity between the earthly and the exalted Jesus. The second is a high/low schema emphasizing the radical otherness of the resurrected life.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0040573611424472">8</xref></sup> He is both the same Jesus come back again (resurrected) and yet totally different, transfigured (exalted, glorified). These are two complementary faces of the same mystery.</p>
<p>Matthew does not actually narrate any ascension, as do Luke (24:50–53; cf. Acts 1:9–11) and Mark (16:19), but the apparition of Jesus after his resurrection in Matthew presents a glorified, perhaps already ascended Christ. In fact, seeing the resurrected Jesus on the appointed mountain in Galilee already requires faith: “And when they saw him, they worshipped him: but some doubted” (28:17). Nor is he given fish to eat, as in the other synoptic Gospels before the Ascension. Rather, Jesus “came” (28:18) to his disciples, even though they were already bowed down before him. Evidently, there is some other sense besides the merely physical one in which he “came,” since, according to the narrative, he is already standing there before them. As the one who comes, Jesus is assimilated to the Son of Man in Daniel 7:13 and to Christ at the Second Coming as he is invoked at the end of the Book of Revelation (“Even so, come, Lord Jesus,” 22:20).</p>
<p>Matthew portrays Jesus as he is in and for his church. Matthew enables us to see not only the superimposition of the present experience of Christ in the faith community upon the past, the “history” of Jesus: he clearly brings out also the anticipation in the church of the future fulfillment of the Kingdom that is to be definitively accomplished at Christ’s second coming. It is already announced in Jesus’ ministry—“The Kingdom of God is at hand”— and is actually inaugurated by the Easter event, as marked by the earthquake and the rending of the veil of the temple (27:51), alongside other apocalyptic signs. Jesus’ death is the beginning of the end of the world. His resurrection is the beginning of the Kingdom of God, as suggested by the <italic>general</italic> resurrection that Jesus’ death and resurrection inaugurate: indeed immediately after Jesus’ death on the cross, with the earthquake “the graves were opened,” and after his resurrection many bodies of saints arose and were seen in Jerusalem (27:52–53).</p>
<p>Matthew is the Gospel writer who actually develops the idea of the church as an eschatological community, the Kingdom of God. The Gospel according to Mark breaks off abruptly with the Resurrection. John is not interested in the historical Church. His Jesus says, “My kingdom is not of this world” (18:36). Luke reserves his ecclesiology for a second work, the Acts of the Apostles. Only at the very end of the Gospel according to Luke, at the breaking of bread, that is, in the celebration of the sacrament of the Eucharist, is Jesus recognized as the risen Lord by the pilgrims to Emmaus (24:13–35). But Matthew’s Jesus all along stands in the light of Easter, in which the glorified Lord is recognized and worshipped by his community. The Easter event is apocalyptic and casts present life, the daily life of the church, in the light of the end-time.</p>
<p>If Easter guides the story all along, the Resurrection is really where the Gospel of the Kingdom begins. But this is to say that the Gospel begins with faith, for to perceive the resurrected Jesus, for example, at his last appearance on the mountain in Galilee, requires faith, as we saw, and some even doubted (28:17). This acknowledges that the Gospel revelation is not a wholly objective event, but depends rather on how different individuals receive it. The miracle takes place, in the first instance, inside people and manifests itself in the transformation of their lives. The physical healing, for example, of the two blind men in 9:27–30 is added as a sign of the spiritual recovery of sight accomplished already in their acceptance of Jesus as Savior: “According to your faith be it unto you” (see also 9:1–8). Prophecy in general works this way—not by imposing an inevitable fate or solid fact but by inviting to the realization of possibilities of life through interpreting the past with a view to the future in the freedom of the present. The Gospels in this perspective are paradigmatic for the way humanities texts are constantly re-actualized; they live a resurrected life themselves in each successive age. They are animated by being appropriated and lived anew, thanks to interpretations in which their potential for truth is newly tapped into and revealed.</p>
<p>These select observations on the Gospel according to Matthew have been offered in an attempt to give some sense of how the Gospels represent a consummate work of interpretation, where the facts of Jesus’ life are recounted not for their own sake, but as a testimonial of faith and in order to reveal an overarching order of significance, a providential plan for history and redemption. As such, moreover, the Gospel works as interpellation—it calls all who hear to conversion of life in light of the truth it discloses. Near the end of his Gospel, John states explicitly that everything in it is written to the end that its hearers or readers might believe “that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God; and that believing ye might have life through his name” (20:31). Beyond this common purpose, the differences between the various Gospels highlight how different writers and communities accentuate and inflect the Gospel message in ways reflecting their own cultures and concerns. Precisely this variability according to context serves to reveal a meaning that is not limited to any one historical moment, but rather transcends its own time and is prophetic. Like prophetic works generally, the Gospels reveal the end of history, its ultimate destination and purpose—of course, always from within specific historical limits, yet as if these limits were miraculously suspended.</p></sec>
