<p>It is a privilege to write a book review for this text as an advanced practice nurse. This reviewer recognizes the need for nurses to clarify their thinking and applications of nursing theory and philosophical assumptions in the delivery of care that distinguishes nursing from other disciplines. This reviewer notes that the 5<sup>th</sup> edition of the text offers a framework for the novice to appreciate the history and future of advanced practice nursing, knowledge and theory development within the discipline; and the challenges nursing faces in the coming decades. The text offers thoughtful articles that provide a lens to view philosophy, theory, and knowledge that differentiates nurses from other care providers.</p>
<p>This book provides a venue for advanced practice nurses to examine their practice, values, praxis, and contemporary issues. It is divided into five parts with 31 chapters; daunting at first blush because of the density in content, but engaging because of the organization of the text and the thoughtful threads of values, praxis, definitions of evidence, and science connected with the metaparadigm of nursing.</p>
<p>Part 1 of the book (chapters 1 to 7) explores the knowledge base of the discipline and what guides nursing practice. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0894318413477150">Cody (2013)</xref> challenges the reader to consider personal assumptions about “values-based care and evidence-based practice” (p. 11) in order to establish that care is values-based. Additionally, he sets the stage for the discussion about evidence and threads this throughout the book to establish linkages among theory, practice, evidence, and conceptualization of new ways of knowing or generating evidence unique to the nursing discipline based on philosophical and ontological underpinnings.</p>
<p>Part 2 of the book (chapters 8 to 18) offers conceptualizations of human beings, health, environment, and nursing practice for advanced practice nurses to reflect on the experiences of people (and nurses) in the context of the environment, communities, and society. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0894318413477150">Reed (2013)</xref> offers a description of the ontology of the discipline and the unique position of nursing as, “an inherent human process of well-being” (p. 69). She distinguishes nursing as a basic and applied science. Concepts of caring, nurturing, and healing are offered as essential elements of nursing practice and theory, highlighting the embedded nature of the nurse and the patient within the environment. The seminal works of nurse scholars in theory development are offered as foundational and historical perspectives for the ontology and epistemology of nursing.</p>
<p>Part 3 of the book (chapters 19 to 24) captures the contemporary perspective on nursing. It includes a discussion about nursing as a human science, and the influences of feminism on professionalism. A discussion about increasing dependence on technology on human life and nursing brings a philosophical lens to experiences in a changing care delivery system. Metaphor is offered as a point of reflection recognizing that the military metaphor has shaped nursing practice and may have outlived its utility. Mitchell, Ferguson-Pare, and Richards (chapter 22) offer the frontier metaphor as an alternative that is responsive to current challenges and demands for consideration. Ketefian and Redman (chapter 23) offer an international perspective of nursing science to address diversity and dominance of Western perspectives present in current nursing theories. These chapters offer contemporary issues for reflection and they challenge the reader to consider definitions of health and nursing for meaningful discourse.</p>
<p>Part 4 (chapters 25 to 27) of the book explores the interrelatedness of theory, research, and practice, highlighting a cogent argument that practice is values-based and practitioner-driven, while care is evidence-based and consumer-driven. These chapters offer discussion about nursing knowledge and science that is limited by how evidence is created and valued because of the dominance of traditional science rather than a philosophical or aesthetic way of knowing that is accepted in nursing.</p>
<p>Part 5 of the book (chapters 28 to 31) offers recognition for the complexity of advanced practice nursing in the current healthcare environment. Chapter 28, was written by the late Janet Kenney, the sole editor of the first three editions of this book. She offers a personal synthesis of theories philosophical perspectives from the literature. In chapter 29, Reeder draws attention to different eras of evidence and encourages reflection so that readers might envision a different future. In Chapter 30 and 31, readers are confronted with the responsibilities of nurse scholars. There is uncertainty, meaning, choice, and presence within the context of building the next generation of advanced practice nurses committed to social justice, an understanding of health as a process within a community, the nature of suffering, and the import of ethics to honor the human experience.</p>
<p>Distinguishing this text from previous editions are nine new chapters. “A Practice Discipline That’s Here and Now” (chapter 7 by Litchfield and Jonsdottir) offers a discussion on the nursing discipline and the professional responsibility to participate in the dialogue that closes the gap between the academy and nursing workforce. The authors offer a conceptualization of the human condition; experiences, spirituality, sentience, and mystery with a participatory paradigm that emphasizes the context of health service delivery and action in social systems.</p>
<p>Banfield (chapter 9) offers Orem’s self-care deficit nursing theory and a philosophical inquiry process as a lens to examine Orem’s assumptions and beliefs about human beings engaged in development. She challenges nursing to undertake an in-depth and comprehensive review of the self-care deficit nursing theory when making decisions about the types of knowledge to be developed and the research approaches to be used to develop this knowledge.</p>
<p>In chapter 18, Doane and Varcoe present “Relational Practice and Nursing Obligations” and share the assumption that nurses are obligated, through patient relationships, to achieve patient outcomes. They propose a description of how nurses can meet this obligation, in complex, multifaceted, contextually-dependent situations. Doane and Varcoe highlight that trust, empathy, and respect in concert with ethical concepts of obligation, responsibility, and good action through a relational lens of inquiry can enhance nurses’ capacity to navigate the challenges and competing obligations found in healthcare.</p>
<p>Locsin and Purnell, in “Rapture and Suffering with Technology in Nursing” (chapter 21) showcase the reality of advancing technology and elevate the discussion to a philosophical consideration of its influence on the quality and duration of life. Highlighting that nurses care for patients as participants rather than objects of care, the authors call out the impact of technology on practice and offer it as a resource for consideration within a caring environment.</p>
<p>In “Exploring an Alternative Metaphor for Nursing: Relinquishing Military Images and Language,” Mitchell, Ferguson-Paré, and Richards (chapter 22) advance the frontier metaphor for consideration. After providing a thorough review of the historical underpinnings of the military metaphor and the influence on language and workflow processes today, they describe how the frontier metaphor may be more applicable now and for an envisioned future of healthcare.</p>
<p>In chapter 24, Arnold and Bruce, offer an example for expanding worldviews in “Nursing Practice with Aboriginal Communities: Expanding World Views.” In displaying work with Aboriginal understandings of health, they offer humanistic, interpretive, and phenomenological approaches to scientific inquiry to distinguish it from the traditional nursing lens of analytical and empirical knowing. They examine health belief models, definitions of healing, and representations of Western medicine, and the gaps that exist in nurses’ understanding of cultural differences.</p>
<p>Pipe, in “Optimizing Nursing Care by Integrating Theory-Driven Evidence-Based Practice” (chapter 25) discusses Rosswurm and Larabee’s framework for translating evidence into practice through the review of leadership strategies for the implementation of evidence-based practice guided by nursing theory. She describes the setting, recognition of the need for change in practice, how nursing problems are linked to outcomes, synthesis of the literature, design, implementation, and evaluation followed by lessons learned in an organizational case review. She offers the enthusiasm of staff members in translating theory into practice and their ability to integrate elements of patient safety, relationship-based care concepts, and nursing workflow to enable application to consider one’s assumptions about how staff might respond to this challenge.</p>
<p>Reeder (Chapter 29) in “What Will Count as Evidence in the Year 2050,” provides the questions of who, what, when, where, and how as the relevant and appropriate questions for readers to consider in the future. She makes a compelling case that addresses a cosmic pattern of change in the life-world by breaking down the integral nature of human-environment relationships. Reeder shares published literature, philosophical concepts, a global perspective, and human science in the nursing discipline that she says emphasizes interdependence in belonging that is universal and moral. Because of this, she believes the human consciousness with support from theoretical and philosophical writings brings one to a truth that evidence needs to consider all living beings.</p>
<p>In Chapter 30, “An Ontological View of Advanced Practice Nursing,” Arslanian-Engoren, Hicks, Whall, and Algase illustrate the need for a disciplinary focus for care delivered by nurses. The authors present an ontological perspective for nursing education, practice, research through knowledge development, and nursing science. The authors posit that by embracing the values that unify the discipline, nurses will advance the profession.</p>
<p>Shortcomings of this book reside in two areas. First, if the reader is new to nursing theory and philosophy, some of the seminal works included in parts 1 and 2 will require outside reading to fully appreciate the context of what is offered. While there are several new chapters in this book, many of the chapters were published in previous editions and more current examples with contemporary applications for praxis would add meaning for the practitioner who is wading through complex care delivery systems and confusing language that rests outside the vernacular used to describe practice found in the extant published literature.</p>
<p>Second, development of new roles in nursing is notably absent. Additionally, clarification between advanced nursing practice and advanced practice nursing was not presented, and with new regulation found in the APRN Consensus Model for APRN Regulation: Licensure, Accreditation, Certification and Education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0894318413477150">APRN Consensus Work Group and the National Council of State Boards of Nursing APRN Advisory Committee, 2008</xref>) and the growth of the Doctorate in Nursing Practice, the qualifying distinctions highlight inclusivity and exclusivity related to the requirements for establishing standards and expectations for practice. Greater attention to the points of contrast between advanced nursing practice in its praxis and the distinctions between medicine and other professional disciplines would offer reference points for any advanced practice nurse irrespective of specialty or setting.</p>
<p>In conclusion, this reviewer would recommend this book to faculty, graduate students, and advanced practice nurses contemplating the value and need for a philosophy and theory of nursing. Throughout the text, readers are offered points of reflection, challenges, and points for discourse to more fully develop and articulate advanced practice nursing as a unique discipline. As in previous editions of this book, the 5th edition offers seminal work and contemporary issues that confront advanced practice nurses in a complex delivery system and encourages contemplation of nursing’s unique contributions to fulfilling its social contract with people, communities, and society. While historical components are highlighted, the advanced practice nurse is encouraged to consider innovative and potentially disruptive discourse to more fully develop their contributions to health and care-giving in this time of health reform. Highly appreciated are the articles that require the reader to meet head-on the multifaceted elements of complicated care delivery systems that can be answered by a thorough understanding of the epistemology and ontology of nursing.</p>
