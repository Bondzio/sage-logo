            <p>This cross-sectional survey of 533 clinical research coordinators (CRCs) investigated working conditions, CRCs’ perceptions of their jobs, job satisfaction, and CRCs’ intentions to stay at their jobs in the Republic of Korea. Only 11.3% of CRCs hold full-time positions, and 37.9% have an annual salary of US$13,055–$17,406. The average perception of 20 job attributes was 3.14 points on a 5-point scale; interest in job (3.90 points) ranked the highest, while promotion possibility (1.97 points) was the lowest. Seven factors related to job satisfaction were identified as a result of multiple logistic regression analysis: variety (OR = 2.24), interest in job (OR = 4.26), job stress (OR = 2.00), salary (OR = 2.85), influence (OR = 2.03), work value (OR = 2.24), and job security (OR = 3.01). The factors related to CRCs’ intentions to stay at their jobs were variety (OR = 2.12), interest in job (OR = 4.49), work hours (OR = 2.12), and job security (OR = 3.45). According to the results, CRCs were interested in their jobs and evaluated their jobs as important and worthwhile; they also showed high job satisfaction and an intention to stay at their jobs. Therefore, it is recommended that various efforts be made to maintain the current status of CRCs and to improve their job stability and salary, so that they remain CRCs for longer.</p>

         <title>Introduction</title>
         <p>The demand for clinical research coordinators (CRCs) has drastically increased as the number of clinical trials for new drug development has rapidly increased in Korea since 2000. According to the clinical trial registry, the percentage of clinical trials held in Korea increa sed from 0.42% in 2005 to 1.48% in 2009; Korea also rose from 31st to 12th place in a ranking of countries according to the number of clinical trials held therein.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0092861512436841">1</xref>
            </sup> The number of clinical trials approved by the Korea Food and Drug Administration (KFDA) sharply increased from 33 in 2000 to 400 in 2009.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0092861512436841">1</xref>
            </sup> Considering that the sites of clinical trials for new drug development have been rapidly moving from North America and Europe to the third world, such as Asia, it is expected that the number of clinical trials for new drug development in Korea will continue to increase.</p>
         <p>Clinical trials are generally managed by principal investigators (PIs) and various support personnel so the PIs can perform the trials smoothly.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0092861512436841">2</xref>
            </sup> The CRC, 1 of the personnel, plays an important role in various parts of the trials, such as submitting the plans; recruiting and training subjects; obtaining written consent; managing subjects’ visit schedules; collecting and storing clinical data; and communicating between subjects, investigators, and sponsors.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0092861512436841">3</xref>
            </sup> Therefore, they are recognized as a necessary part of the process, like a glue that holds everything together,<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0092861512436841">4</xref>
            </sup> so maintaining competent CRCs is important to ensure safe, effective, and successful clinical trials.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0092861512436841">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0092861512436841">5</xref>
            </sup>
         </p>
         <p>Unfortunately, according to a previous study, only 16 of 25 institutions (64%) employed CRCs,<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0092861512436841">6</xref>
            </sup> and the study found there was a high demand among investigators for experienced CRCs. In the study, more than 71% of investigators had experienced difficulty in hiring CRCs.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0092861512436841">7</xref>
            </sup> Accordingly, the Korea National Enterprise for Clinical Trials (KoNECT) planned the “Current Status and Strategies Development of CRC’s Employment” project, which has attempted to identify working conditions, job satisfaction, and workers’ intentions to stay at their jobs for CRCs.</p>
         <p>A couple of studies on working conditions, job satisfaction, and workers’ intentions to stay at their jobs have been conducted for CRCs in Korea.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0092861512436841">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0092861512436841">9</xref>
            </sup> According to the studies, working conditions for CRCs are poor, their positions are unstable, and as a result, their general job satisfaction is not high, even when they recognize the importance of their job.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0092861512436841">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0092861512436841">9</xref>
            </sup> Although the total number of CRCs increased in 2009 compared with 2004, the increase affected the number of contract or part-time workers rather than regular or full-time workers, and payment of CRCs has not improved.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0092861512436841">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0092861512436841">9</xref>
            </sup> However, the previous studies used small and unrepresentative CRC samples, making it difficult to use them as accurate reflections of the general status and job satisfaction of CRCs in Korea. There is no CRC management system at the institutional or national level in Korea because most CRCs are hired and managed by individual investigators, not institutions. Accordingly, it is difficult to identify the CRC population that is working at clinical trial centers (CTCs) or institutions and their working conditions and job satisfaction. Therefore, this study attempted to investigate the current working conditions, CRCs’ perceptions of their jobs, job satisfaction, and CRCs’ intentions to stay at their jobs and to identify the factors related to job satisfaction and job retention from as many CRCs as possible, using the support of KoNECT and the Korea Association of Clinical Research Coordinators to overcome the limitations of the previous studies.</p>

            <p>This study adopted a cross-sectional design to investigate the current working conditions, CRCs’ perceptions of their jobs, job satisfaction, and CRCs’ intentions to stay at their jobs and to identify the factors related to job satisfaction and job retention among CRCs in Korea.</p>

            <title>Study Participants</title>
            <p>The participants were 533 CRCs working at 15 regional CTCs designated by the KFDA in 2010 and 11 nonregional CTCs, which had a similar number of hospital beds and were located in similar geographical areas to the regional CTCs. According to a previous study, there are currently an estimated 1,750–1,850 CRCs in Korea.<sup>
                  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0092861512436841">7</xref>
               </sup> Therefore, approximately 30% of the CRCs predicted to be in Korea were selected as participants in the study.</p>

            <title>Study Instrument</title>
            <p>The study instrument was a self-administered questionnaire divided into 5 sections: general characteristics of the participants, working conditions, CRCs’ perceptions of their jobs, job satisfaction, and CRCs’ intentions to stay at their jobs. Questions were developed by referencing survey tools used in previous studies.<sup>
                  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0092861512436841">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0092861512436841">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0092861512436841">9</xref>
               </sup>
            </p>
            <p>The items related to participants’ general characteristics included 5 questions on participants’ gender, age, education level, licenses and certificates, careers in a clinical setting, number of years as a CRC, education completed in relation to a CRC job during the last 2 years, amount of education completed, certifications related to clinical trials, and future plans to obtain certification related to CRCs or clinical trials.</p>
            <p>The items related to working conditions included type of employment, type of employer, number of trials done by CRCs, work hours per week, annual salary, method of payment, and training programs held by each institution.</p>
            <p>The items related to CRCs’ perceptions of their jobs identified how the CRCs perceived the following aspects of their jobs: variety, clarity, difficulty, interest in job (job pleasure), job stress, work hours, workload, salary, workload in relation to salary, autonomy, influence, conformity with their major, sufficiency of manpower, size of workspace, work value (importance), job security, promotion possibility, relationship with investigators, development opportunities, and social recognition of CRCs. Participants answered each question on a 5-point scale from “absolutely no” (1 point) to “definitely yes” (5 points). The higher the score, the more relevant the characteristic was considered.</p>
            <p>There was only 1 item related to job satisfaction, which measured participants’ subjective satisfaction on a 5-point scale from “very dissatisfied” (1 point) to “very satisfied” (5 points). The scale was divided into 2 parts for analysis: “satisfied” (very satisfied or somewhat satisfied) and “dissatisfied” (so-so, somewhat dissatisfied, or very dissatisfied).</p>
            <p>There was also only 1 item related to CRCs’ intentions to stay at their jobs. It simply asked whether the CRC intended to keep his or her job as a CRC. Responses were measured on a 2-point scale (yes or no).</p>

         <sec id="section6-0092861512436841">
            <title>Data Collection</title>
            <p>Data was collected from August to November 2010 after receiving approval from the ethics committee at Pusan National University Yangsan Hospital Institutional Review Board which is affiliated with the researchers’ school.</p>
            <p>In 2010, the KFDA approved 142 institutions as CTCs. Among those, 98 had conducted at least 1 KFDA-approved trial in the last year, and 45 had administered more than 10 trials in the last year.<sup>
                  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0092861512436841">10</xref>
               </sup> From the 45 active institutions, we selected 15 regional CTCs and 15 nonregional CTCs, which were located in the same area as the regional CTCs and had a similar number of hospital beds and clinical trials. The purpose and procedures of the study were explained to the CRCs’ directors or administrative personnel at the 30 centers, and phone contacts were used to request their cooperation in the data collection. Fifteen regional and 11 nonregional CTCs agreed to participate in the study. After that, packages containing an official document under the name of KoNECT, the questionnaires, and stamped return envelopes were mailed to the CRCs’ directors or administrative personnel to be distributed to each CRC. We asked the directors and administrative personnel to distribute the questionnaires to as many CRCs as possible. To do this, we included all CRCs who worked for the CTCs; CRCs who were using the centers, even if they were not employed there; and any CRCs that could be identified through phone contacts with the directors and administrative personnel, even if they did not use the centers. Completed questionnaires were returned to the directors and administrative personnel, who delivered them to the research team using the stamped return envelopes.</p>

            <title>Data Analysis</title>
            <p>The collected data was coded and analyzed using SPSS Version 18.0 for Windows (SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL). All statistical tests were performed at a 0.05 level of significance for 2-tailed tests. The general characteristics of the participants, working conditions, CRCs’ perceptions of their jobs, job satisfaction, and CRCs’ intentions to stay at their jobs were analyzed using means and standard deviations for continuous variables and frequencies and percentages for categorical variables. Simple logistic regression was used to identify the factors related to job satisfaction (satisfied versus dissatisfied) and CRCs’ intentions to stay at their jobs (yes versus no). Multiple logistic stepwise regression analysis was done using significant variables from the simple regression as explanatory variables.</p>

            <p>The CRCs’ working conditions are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0092861512436841">Table 2</xref>. In terms of the type of employment, 83.1% of respondents were contract workers who worked full time, and only 11.3% had full-time positions. Regarding their work environment, 46.3% of respondents worked for a hospital or CTC, but 93% wanted to work at a hospital or CTC because it reflected an improvement in job security and stability. CRCs worked on an average of 4.5 trials (median: 4), but the desired number was 3.1 on average (median: 3). The average work hours was 41.4 (median: 40), and the majority (62.5%) of CRCs worked at least 40 hours. With regard to annual salary, 37.9% of respondents reported receiving US$13,055–$17,406; the next highest percentage was 29.3%, who reported receiving $17,407–$21,758. On the other hand, 34.3% of respondents desired an annual salary in the range of $21,759–$26,110, while 25.5% wanted $26,111–$30,461. There was a significant difference between the number of CRCs who received an annual salary of more than $26,111 (8.4%) and the number who desired that salary (45.7%). While 69.8% of respondents were paid a fixed monthly salary, 85.2% would like to earn incentive pay that took the number of trials or hours worked into account, in addition to their monthly salary. According to the questionnaires, 73.2% of the CRCs responded that their institutions had held official job education programs for CRCs, with workshops and seminars being the most common (70.2%).</p>

            <title>CRCs’ Intentions to Stay at Their Jobs and Related Factors</title>
            <p>According to the questionnaires, 82.7% of respondents intended to stay at their CRC job (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0092861512436841">Figure 2</xref>). The top 5 attributes related to CRCs’ intentions to stay at their jobs were interest in job, work hours, autonomy, salary, and job security (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0092861512436841">Table 3</xref>).</p>
            <p>As a result of simple logistic regression analysis, we identified several factors related to CRCs’ intentions to stay at their jobs: type of employment (nonregular versus regular workers; <italic>P</italic> = 0.028) and 18 of the job attributes (excluding size of workspace and possibility of promotion) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0092861512436841">Table 5</xref>). After we completed the multiple logistic regression analysis, we identified 4 job attributes as the factors related to CRCs’ intentions to stay at their jobs: variety (OR = 2.12, 95% CI = 1.17–3.82), interest in job (OR = 4.49, 95% CI = 2.45–8.12), work hours (OR = 2.12, 95% CI = 1.24–3.64), and job security (OR = 3.45, 95% CI = 1.02–11.70) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0092861512436841">Table 5</xref>).</p>

         <title>Discussion</title>
         <p>This study investigated the factors related to job satisfaction and CRCs’ intentions to stay at their jobs so that we could develop strategies to secure qualitatively excellent CRCs in Korea, in response to the increasing number of clinical trials in the country. We recruited CRCs from many CTCs as study participants, representing approximately 30% of the estimated number of CRCs in Korea. This significant participation rate was meant to address the lack of representativeness that was a problem in previous studies<sup>

            </sup> related to CRCs in Korea.</p>
         <p>We found no significant differences in the gender or age distribution of the CRCs. In previous studies,<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0092861512436841">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0092861512436841">9</xref>
            </sup> the majority of CRCs were women, with a mean age between 30 and 32.5 years, and this study showed very similar results. Most of the CRCs majored in nursing science, which showed little change from the 94% who did so in a previous study.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0092861512436841">9</xref>
            </sup> The percentage of CRCs who are nurses is very high in Korea, compared with a foreign study that showed 49.3% of 1,000 CRCs registered with the Association for Clinical Research Professionals (ACRP) were registered nurses.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0092861512436841">11</xref>
            </sup> CRCs’ work experience showed a tendency to increase little by little, as the average was 1.8 years<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0092861512436841">8</xref>
            </sup> and 2.1 years<sup>

            </sup> in the previous studies and 2.4 years in this study, but many CRCs had less than 2 years of work experience at the time of the study. Considering that 59% of CRCs had 2 to 5 years of work experience in a foreign study,<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0092861512436841">11</xref>
            </sup> the work experience of CRCs in Korea is very short, which could be a significant barrier to securing stable, qualitatively excellent CRCs.</p>
         <p>The number of CRCs who had received education related to clinical trials or their jobs increased from 67.5%<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0092861512436841">8</xref>
            </sup> and 73.3%<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0092861512436841">9</xref>
            </sup> in the previous studies to 85% in this study, which was a very encouraging result. Korean CRCs were judged to have a relatively good education, considering that 55% of CRCs in a foreign study had no education experience before starting their current job as a CRC.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0092861512436841">11</xref>
            </sup> Since 2008, KoNECT has supported basic, advanced, and continuing education, including lectures and practicum, for CRCs to revitalize CRC education at the national level, and this national support has contributed to more educational opportunities for CRCs and an upgrade of their education to a global standard. Very few CRCs have a CRC-related certificate like those provided by ACRP or the Society of Clinical Research Associates, as KoNECT does not offer a CRC certification program in Korea. The introduction of a CRC certification program in Korea has been positively reviewed, and a specific plan has been considered. It is expected that the number of CRCs with certificates will rapidly increase, considering that more than 75% of respondents were interested in obtaining a certificate in the future.</p>
         <p>With regard to job satisfaction, 64.3% of respondents were very or somewhat satisfied with their jobs, which showed a steady increase from 46.7%<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0092861512436841">8</xref>

               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0092861512436841">9</xref>
            </sup> in the previous studies, despite an unstable job status and low annual salary. Fortunately, the percentage of CRCs who intended to stay at their jobs also increased from 75.3%<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0092861512436841">8</xref>
            </sup> and 79.3%<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0092861512436841">9</xref>
            </sup> in the previous studies to 82.7% in this study. Variety, interest in job, and job security were related to both job satisfaction and CRCs’ intentions to stay at their jobs in this study.</p>
         <p>Most CRCs have worked as nurses in a clinical setting. In general, a CRC’s job is completely different from that of a nurse in a hospital, and it varies from trial to trial. In addition, CRCs meet investigators, as well as monitors, inspectors, IRB members, and others. Some CRCs are threatened by these new experiences, but others seem to enjoy the diversity of the job and hope to remain a CRC.</p>
         <p>One of the most important factors influencing job satisfaction and job retention in this study was interest in job. CRCs found their jobs to be interesting and pleasant in this and the previous studies.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0092861512436841">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0092861512436841">9</xref>
            </sup> Even as time passed, the reason for CRCs’ job satisfaction did not significantly change. This is similar to the result of a previous study, which found that interaction with subjects was the most important factor affecting job satisfaction.<sup>

            </sup> Interest in job received 3.9 of 5 points, the highest among the 20 attributes in this study. This factor should be considered in the development and management of official incentive and encouragement programs so that CRCs are able to continuously perform the work in which they are interested, because CRC development and reward programs are helpful for increasing workers’ personal sense of accomplishment.<sup>

         <p>Job security was another important factor influencing job satisfaction and dissatisfaction and CRCs’ intentions to stay at their jobs. An issue to be considered in relation to job security is the small percentage of full-time positions. The percentage of CRCs who had full-time positions (11.3%) in this study is much lower than the percentages in previous studies (27.3%<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0092861512436841">8</xref>
            </sup> and 12.1%<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0092861512436841">9</xref>
            </sup>). While the composition of participants may have varied between the 3 studies, the percentage in this study is unquestionably low, and not having a full-time position can be related to negative perceptions of job security and poor salaries. Since, along with salary, job security is a very important factor for job retention and job dissatisfaction, the decrease in the percentage of full-time positions could lower job satisfaction among CRCs. However, encouraging a change to more full-time positions may be difficult because it is hard to estimate the demand for CRCs who are employed on a trial-by-trial basis. Therefore, we need to prepare another plan for guaranteeing the job security of CRCs. Next, we suggest a few ways to address this issue.</p>
         <p>The first way to solve the problem of job security is to address the issue of CRCs’ employers. In the study, most CRCs hoped to work for a hospital or CTC, not for an individual investigator. Working for a hospital or CTC means more secure working conditions and welfare services (better workspace and 4 types of insurance), equal to those received by other healthcare workers in the hospital. This is thought to contribute to increased job satisfaction and decreased turnover for CRCs, considering that most of the CRCs in the study wanted to work at a hospital or CTC for job stability.</p>
         <p>The second way to solve the problem of job security is related to CRCs’ respect for their careers (career path and career ladder). CRCs with longer careers performed the same work as newly employed CRCs and had very limited promotion opportunities. The perception of promotion possibilities received only 1.97 points of 5 points, the lowest score in this study. In Japan, CRCs are divided into 4 levels: assistant, beginner, certified, and senior.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0092861512436841">14</xref>
            </sup> Granda et al (2009) suggested a career ladder as a measure for increasing a worker’s chance of promotion.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0092861512436841">12</xref>
            </sup> Using the career ladder, the CRC’s responsibilities, role, payment level, and level of recognition gradually improve over the course of their career as a CRC.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0092861512436841">12</xref>
            </sup>
         </p>
         <p>Workload was identified as one of the related factors to job dissatisfaction in the study, and it was shown to influence job dissatisfaction in a previous study.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0092861512436841">8</xref>
            </sup> Workload received a lower than average score among the 20 attributes in this study. CRCs reported being in charge of 5.6 trials on average, a significant increase over the 2.9 reported in a previous study.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0092861512436841">8</xref>
            </sup> We assume this increase is related to the increase in the number of clinical trials in Korea. The desired number of trials was approximately 4 in this study, and a foreign study found that 53.2% of CRCs hoped to handle between 4 and 7 trials each year.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0092861512436841">11</xref>
            </sup> The discrepancy between the current and desired number of trials may have caused the below-average score for workload. We recommend that an acuity tool for evaluating workload be used to allocate the workload evenly among the CRCs. Fowler and Thomas (2003)<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0092861512436841">14</xref>
            </sup> calculated the workload per trial based on the procedures and time given to each subject; they then multiplied that number by the total number of subjects in the trial to get the total workload per trial. A workload evaluation tool has not yet been used in Korea, despite the fact that it could help investigators and managers evaluate the skill level needed for CRCs based on the rigidity and complexity of each trial. Such an evaluation tool could help CRCs and investigators measure the expected workload of each trial, so that CRCs could be allocated an appropriate amount of work.</p>
         <p>Along with job security, salary was a major factor related to CRCs’ job dissatisfaction.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0092861512436841">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0092861512436841">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0092861512436841">12</xref>
            </sup> The logistic analysis also showed it to be one of the factors related to job satisfaction. In this study, 45% of respondents received less than US$17,406, and salary scored just 2.25 of 5 points, the lowest level. The average clinical career was approximately 5 years, and the average CRC’s salary was a little low compared with the annual salary of nurses with 7-year clinical careers, considering that the average CRC had 2.4 years of work experience. Therefore, a guideline needs to be prepared for estimating personnel expenses, considering CRCs’ work by area and their career records. To increase satisfaction regarding the ratio of workload to salary, a minimum standard should be established for a fixed monthly payment, and proper incentives should be introduced with consideration of the work hours and the amount of work done. However, it may be difficult to easily improve salaries because increasing salaries affects the entire research expense. The minimum standard for fixed monthly payments should be determined by referring to the standard payments for similar occupations in hospitals, and standards for the incentive amount should be based on specialist groups.</p>
         <p>In this study, the work hour was a significant factor for CRCs’ intentions to stay at their jobs. Compared with a previous Korean study,<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0092861512436841">9</xref>
            </sup> CRCs reported a small increase in their average work hours per week, from 39.4 hours to 41.4 hours. There was also an increase in work hours overall, as the percentage of workers who worked more than 40 hours per week increased from 18.1% to 30%. The hours worked by CRCs in Korea was considered appropriate compared with the previous foreign study,<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0092861512436841">11</xref>
            </sup> in which 69% of CRCs worked 40–50 hours per week and approximately 20% worked more than 50 hours. However, an appropriate incentive needs to be provided for overtime work, as some CRCs said they had sometimes worked up to the maximum of 72 hours per week without receiving more than their fixed monthly payment.</p>
         <p>Although autonomy was not related to either job satisfaction or CRCs’ intentions to stay at their jobs in the logistic analysis, it was identified as 1 of the key factors influencing job satisfaction and job retention when 2 of the 20 attributes of CRCs’ jobs were freely selected. Autonomy received 3.74 of 5 points, a relatively high number compared with other attributes in the study. Granda et al (2009)<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0092861512436841">12</xref>
            </sup> suggested that autonomy could be increased by creating an atmosphere in which CRCs are able to make decisions freely and work independently. They also recommended the use of an evaluation tool for workload to help managers properly allocate work.</p>

         <title>Conclusion</title>
         <p>This cross-sectional survey of 533 CRCs investigated working conditions, CRCs’ perceptions of their jobs, job satisfaction, and CRCs’ intentions to stay at their jobs in the Republic of Korea. Working conditions changed little compared with previous studies, and the majority of CRCs were still contract positions with poor salaries, which were related to lowered intentions among CRCs to stay at their jobs. However, they perceived their jobs in a relatively positive light, particularly with relation to their interest in the job and the variety and value of their work, which were related to increased job satisfaction. According to the results, CRCs are interested in their jobs and consider them important and worthwhile. They also show high job satisfaction and intentions to stay at their jobs. Therefore, it is recommended that various efforts be made to not only maintain the current status of CRCs but to also improve their job stability and salaries so they are able to stay in the profession for a longer period.</p>
