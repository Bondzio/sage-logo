<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Chronic heart failure is characterized by progressive exercise intolerance and exertional dyspnoea during minimal exercise, resulting in poor prognosis and quality of life. The changes occur in the periphery as a consequence of the systemic effects of chronic heart failure, and may become the limiting factors more than the heart dysfunction itself.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0269215511403941">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>Peripheral limitations included reduced quality of skeletal musculature initially caused by reduced blood supply. There is evidence that the skeletal muscles of chronic heart failure patients undergo structural and biochemical changes by reduced skeletal muscle perfusion during exercise resulting in impaired strength and endurance.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0269215511403941">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0269215511403941">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>The sleep apnoea prevalence reaches 45–82% of chronic heart failure.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0269215511403941">4</xref></sup> It may be associated with increased morbidity and mortality.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0269215511403941">5</xref></sup> Due to similarities in the pathophysiology of sleep apnoea and chronic heart failure, there is an emerging interest in the link between these conditions and in the benefits of the exercise training for patients with chronic heart failure and sleep apnoea.</p>
<p>Symptomatic improvements in chronic heart failure will depend on the resolution of peripheral abnormalities, and will be associated with treatments aimed at specifically improving muscle and respiratory function or exercise responses. Physical training should be considered<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0269215511403941">6</xref></sup> as adjunct therapy for patients with chronic heart failure. Recent data have shown that exercise is considered beneficial for these patients in terms of improved mortality and morbidity, quality of life, functional capacity and improved cardiac and vascular function.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0269215511403941">7</xref></sup> However, supervised rehabilitation is not available for the majority of chronic heart failure patients and home-based exercise could be more accessible and acceptable.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0269215511403941">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0269215511403941">9</xref></sup> The effects of home-based exercise training for patients with chronic heart failure and sleep apnoea have not been demonstrated. The majority of the trials with exercise and chronic heart failure study only specific aspects, and in our study we evaluated the patients in a global form.</p>
<p>The purpose of our study was to evaluate the effects of home-based exercise training on functional capacity, strength and endurance of lower limbs, quality of life and sleep for patients with chronic heart failure and sleep apnoea. As home-based programmes are very heterogeneous, we also aimed to compare the improvements on two different training protocols.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<sec id="section3-0269215511403941">
<title>Subjects</title>
<p>We prospectively evaluated consecutive patients who were followed regularly at a specialist heart failure medical centre from São Paulo Federal University, Brazil. All patients were evaluated by the same medical staff, and the diagnosis of chronic heart failure was based on the presence of symptoms and signs (such as exertional intolerance, dyspnoea and fluid retention) in combination with objective evidence of cardiac systolic dysfunction (ejection fraction &lt;40%). The recruitment took place between March 2007 and November 2008.</p>
<p>Inclusion criteria included: age range 30–70 years, New York Heart Association<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0269215511403941">10</xref></sup> Class II–III, clinically stable for three months, ejection fraction &lt;40%, peak VO<sub>2</sub> &lt;20 ml/kg/min, stable and optimized medical therapy at least two months before the study, β-blocker therapy, sleep apnoea and ability to attend regular training since in a home programme the patient must be able to correctly follow the exercise prescription without supervision. Exclusion criteria included: New York Heart Association<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0269215511403941">10</xref></sup> Class IV, myocardial infarction or revascularization within the past four months, unstable angina, complex or symptomatic ventricular arrhythmias, obstructive aortic or mitral valvular disease, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, abnormal exercise testing, hypotension, pulmonary arterial pressure ≥50 mmHg, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, leg claudication, musculoskeletal disorders or psychiatric disease that prevents the patient from underrstanding and following the exercise prescription.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0269215511403941">
<title>Study design</title>
<p>This was a prospective, randomized controlled trial. A statistician not implicated in the rehabilitation protocol using a computerized programme undertook randomization after all study outcomes were measured at baseline and each patient had consented. Thus they were randomized in three groups: Group 1 (aerobic training), Group 2 (aerobic with strength training), and Group 3 (untrained). Patients were advised to take their medication as usual and the prescription remained unchanged during the programme. The Joint Research Ethics Board of São Paulo Federal University approved this protocol. All patients were informed about the aim of the study and informed consent was obtained. The trial flow diagram for the study is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0269215511403941">Figure 1</xref>.</p>

<sec id="section5-0269215511403941">
<title>Procedures</title>
<p>The eligible patients underwent all the procedures at baseline and these that completed the programme were also evaluated after three months of home-based rehabilitation (Groups 1 and 2) or untrained period (Group 3).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0269215511403941">
<title>Exercise training programme</title>
<p>The training programme for Groups 1 and 2 began with three supervised exercise sessions to plan an individualized training programme and the patients were instructed in the correct techniques. They learnt to check their heart rates with a frequency meter (Polar FS1, Kempele, Finland), for controlling the heart rate at home training. Blood pressure was measured before and after each supervised session. They also used a Borg exertion scale (15-point)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0269215511403941">11</xref></sup> to evaluate the training intensity. The supervised sessions took place at the rehabilitation department and were supervised by a physiotherapist and a cardiologist. The last 10 minutes of the sessions were devoted to education regarding exercise and coronary risk factors.</p>
<p>After supervised training, Groups 1 and 2 underwent three months of home-based exercise. It consisted of three sessions/week in the first and second months and four sessions/week in the third month, on non-consecutive days. The aerobic protocol consisted of a warm-up (strengthening exercises, 10 minutes), walking in the street or parks (30 minutes in the first month and up to 45 minutes in the last two months) and cool-down (strengthening exercises, 10 minutes). The exercise intensity was established by heart rate levels that corresponded to anaerobic threshold (VO<sub>2</sub> AT), 10 heart rates down and 10 heart rates up, assessed by cardiopulmonary exercise testing.</p>
<p>The strength training was added for Group 2. It consisted of three exercises for upper limbs and four exercises for lower limbs, attending the major muscle groups, with graduated free weights. The intensity was determined by 30–40% of one-repetition maximum for elbow and knee extension/flexion. In the first month one series of 12 repetitions was performed with a one-minute rest period. Exercise progression was either by increasing resistance (heavier free weight) or the number of repetitions: 14 repetitions in the second month and 16 repetitions in the third month, for all exercises.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0269215511403941">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>Complementing the home-based programme, patients received a frequency meter (Polar FS1, Kempele, Finland), free weights (only Group 2) and a manual with (1) illustrations of the strengthening and strength exercises, (2) details about safe progressive exercise and self-monitoring of frequency, duration and intensity, (3) a questionnaire about the presence of symptoms during exercise, (4) the frequency of exercise and heart rate values to be completed every day of the exercise programme.</p>
<p>The patients in Groups 1 and 2 were followed by weekly telephone calls to monitor progress, assess adherence and provide support, and were reviewed monthly by a physiotherapist and a cardiologist in our institution to adjust the exercise intensity.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0269215511403941">
<title>Untrained group</title>
<p>The patients in the untrained Group 3 were followed weekly at a specialist heart failure medical centre from São Paulo Federal University, Brazil. However, they were not encouraged to exercise. And they had the status of physical activity evaluated weekly by interview to make sure that they remained untrained. After the three months of enrolment in the study and the final tests these patients also received educational sessions about the importance of the exercise training and were encouraged to improve physical activity.</p>

<title>Outcome measures</title>
<sec id="section9-0269215511403941">
<title>Cardiopulmonary exercise testing</title>
<p>All patients underwent a symptom limited, treadmill test with respiratory gas exchange analysis, according to Weber protocol.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0269215511403941">13</xref></sup> Metabolic measurements were made using Medgraphics CPX Ultima system operating BreezeSuite 6.4.1 software (Minneapolis, MN, USA). Heart rate and rhythm were monitored by 12-lead electrocardiogram (Welch Allyn Cardioperfect, Skaneatles, NY, USA). Blood pressure was determined by a mercury sphygmomanometer (Oxygel, São Paulo, Brazil) at rest and at the end of each stage. The self-perceived level of exertion (15-point Borg scale)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0269215511403941">11</xref></sup> was assessed at peak effort. Participants were encouraged to exercise until exhaustion. Gas exchange data was collected in a breath-by-breath manner and averaged into 30-second time periods. The peak oxygen consumption (peak VO<sub>2</sub>) was calculated as the highest 30-second time. VO<sub>2</sub> AT was measured by the V-slope method.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0269215511403941">14</xref></sup> The slope relating ventilation to carbon dioxide production (VE/VCO<sub>2</sub> slope) was calculated by linear regression, excluding the nonlinear part of the data after the onset of ventilatory compensation for metabolic acidosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0269215511403941">15</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0269215511403941">
<title>Isokinetic strength and endurance</title>
<p>Strength and endurance of the knee extensors and flexors were measured using an isokinetic dynamometer (Biodex Medical, Shirley, NY, USA), which modifies the speed and angle of movements. The test protocol consisted of a warm-up (five minutes on a cycle ergometer), three repetitions at 60°/second and 10 repetitions at 180°/second, followed by a cool-down (five minutes on a cycle ergometer). A resting phase of three minutes between the different velocities was applied. The procedure always started with a trial of the non-dominant leg at submaximal level. Maximal dynamic strength (peak torque, Nm) was determined at 60°/second and endurance (total work, J) was determined at 180°/second, in each leg separately. The results were corrected for weight and length of the leg. All tests were performed under the supervision of experienced physiotherapists not implicated in the rehabilitation programme. The patients were verbally encouraged to maximal effort. The following variables were recorded before and after the test: heart rate (Polar FS1, Kempele, Finland), blood pressure (mercury sphygmomanometer - Oxygel, São Paulo, Brazil), oxygen arterial saturation (Nonin 9500, Plymouth, MA, USA), and self-perceived level of exertion (15-point Borg scale).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0269215511403941">11</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0269215511403941">
<title>Quality of life assessments</title>
<p>Quality of life was measured by the Minnesota Living with Heart Failure Questionnaire (MLHFQ).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0269215511403941">16</xref></sup> This questionnaire assesses disease-specific health-related quality of life by including the patient’s perception of the effects of chronic heart failure and its treatment on daily life.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0269215511403941">17</xref></sup> The MLHFQ is composed of 21-items that measure physical, socioeconomic and psychological impairment related to chronic heart failure and higher scores representing a lower quality of life.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0269215511403941">
<title>Polysomnography</title>
<p>Overnight polysomnography was performed using a digital system with 17 channels (EMBLA, Medicare Medical Devices). The following variables were monitored: electroencephalogram (four channels: C3-A2, C4-A1, O1-A2 and O2-A1), electrooculogram (two channels: LOC-A2 and ROC-A1), electromyogram (two channels: submental and anterior tibialis muscles), electrocardiogram (one channel), snoring and body position. Airflow was monitored using a thermocouple and pressure transducer. Chest and abdominal piezo-sensors monitored respiratory effort. Arterial oxygen saturation and pulse were recorded with a pulse oxymeter (Nonin 9500, Plymouth, MA, USA). All polysomnograms were performed and scored by an experienced sleep technician following guidelines for sleep studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0269215511403941">18</xref></sup> and reviewed by a sleep medicine physician. Arousals were defined using criteria from the Sleep Disorders Atlas Task Force of the American Sleep Disorders Association.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0269215511403941">19</xref></sup> Sleep efficiency was defined by total time of sleep/total time of record and showed the real sleep time.</p>
<p>The following respiratory events were defined.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0269215511403941">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0269215511403941">20</xref></sup> An apnoea as a decrease in airflow at least 80% ≥10 seconds, a hypoapnoea as a decrease in airflow of at least 50% ≥10 seconds, accompanied by desaturation and/or arousal, and desaturation as a decrease of at least 4% from baseline in arterial oxygen saturation. Obstructive apnoea was defined as complete cessation of airflow with continued paradoxical chest and abdominal excursion ≥10 seconds. Central apnoea was defined as a complete cessation of airflow and complete cessation of chest and abdominal excursion ≥10 seconds. An apnoea hypoapnoea index (AHI) &gt;5/hour was considered diagnostic of sleep apnoea, and can be classified as mild (5–14/h), moderate (15–29/h) or severe (≥30/h).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0269215511403941">20</xref></sup></p>

<title>Statistical analyses</title>
<p>Data are expressed as means ± standard deviation and 95% confidence intervals for quantitative variables, and absolute frequency (%) for qualitative variables. Statistical analysis was performed using: (1) one-way ANOVA for quantitative variables to compare possible group differences at baseline; (2) Chi-square test or Fisher's exact test as appropriate for qualitative variables to compare possible group differences at baseline; (3) multivariate ANOVA procedure was used to compare the exercise responses of the three groups on the moments baseline, after the exercise training period (3 months, Groups 1 and 2) or after the no-training control period (3 months, Group 3); (4) independent Student's t-test to compare the changes within Group 1 and Group 2 for continuous variables. All tests are two-sided, and a <italic>P</italic>-value &lt;0.05 was considered statistically significant.</p>

<title>Functional Capacity</title>
<p>In the trained groups (Groups 1 and 2), home-based rehabilitation resulted in a significant increase in peak VO<sub>2</sub> and in VO<sub>2</sub> AT, as well as a significant decrease in VE/VCO<sub>2</sub> slope (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0269215511403941">Table 2</xref>), demonstrating that the exercise is a important therapeutic to improve the functional capacity. However, in Group 3 patients had a significantly decrease in peak VO<sub>2</sub> and VO<sub>2</sub> AT, and no significant changes were observed in VE/VCO<sub>2</sub> slope, without training for three months (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0269215511403941">Table 2</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section18-0269215511403941">
<title>Muscle strength and muscle endurance</title>
<p>The results of the isokinetic tests are shown for both flexors and extensors of the leg (left or right) with the highest peak torque at 60°/second at baseline. Muscle strength and endurance improved significantly or did not change after home-based rehabilitation in Groups 1 and 2 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0269215511403941">Table 2</xref>). Whereas in Group 3, a small deterioration or no change was found (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0269215511403941">Table 2</xref>). Therefore home-based training preserved or even improved muscle strength and endurance in trained patients.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section19-0269215511403941">
<title>Quality of life</title>
<p>The training groups (Groups 1 and 2) had significant improvement in the quality of life demonstrated for a significant decrease on total scores of MLHFQ (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0269215511403941">Table 2</xref>). No significant changes were observed in untrained Group 3 after three months (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0269215511403941">Table 2</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section20-0269215511403941">
<title>Sleep</title>
<p>There was no change in weight after home-based rehabilitation (Group 1, <italic>P</italic> = 0.543; Group 2, <italic>P</italic> = 0.545) or untrained period (Group 3, <italic>P</italic> &gt; 0.999), so this variable did not affect the sleep results.</p>
<p>Sleep apnoea characteristic at baseline was similar (<italic>P</italic> &gt; 0.999) among groups: Group 1 (obstructive = 88.2%, obstructive and central = 11.8%), Group 2 (obstructive = 82.4%, obstructive and central = 17.6%), Group 3 (obstructive = 81.8%, obstructive and central = 18.2%). These characteristics showed no change after three months for all the patients. According to the classification of the AHI, at baseline severe sleep apnoea was also similar (<italic>P</italic> = 0.768) among Group 1 (23.5%), Group 2 (35.3%) and Group 3 (36.4%).</p>
<p>The home-based rehabilitation improved the quality of sleep of Groups 1 and 2, demonstrated by a significant decrease in AHI (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0269215511403941">Table 2</xref>). For Group 1, this result was a consequence of a decrease only in hypoapnoea events, but Group 2 demonstrated a significant decrease in the number of apnoea and hypoapnoea events (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0269215511403941">Table 2</xref>). The number of nocturnal arousals also decreased, associated with a significant increase in sleep efficiency (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0269215511403941">Table 2</xref>), also demonstrating the importance of exercise for sleep quality. However Group 3 showed a significant increase in the number of nocturnal arousals, and no significant changes were observed in AHI and in sleep efficiency (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0269215511403941">Table 2</xref>), after three months without training. The mean oxygen saturation (%) at sleep for the three groups showed the same conduct (<italic>P</italic> = 0.479) after three months: Group 1 (94.6 ± 1.6 to 94.6 ± 1.7), Group 2 (93.2 ± 2.5 to 93.3 ± 2.8) and Group 3 (94.1 ± 1.3 to 93.5 ± 1.4).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section21-0269215511403941">
<title>Different protocols</title>
<p>Compared with Group 1 (aerobic training), patients in Group 2 (aerobic with strength training) showed a significant higher increase in some variables of isokinetic strength and endurance of the knee extensors and flexors at 60°/second and at 180°/second, for peak torque and total work (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0269215511403941">Table 3</xref>). There were no significant between-group differences in cardiopulmonary exercise testing, MLHFQ and polysomnography (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0269215511403941">Table 3</xref>). In addition, the adherence in training programmes was also similar (P = 0.743) for Group 1 (98.5 ± 13.7%) and Group 2 (100.2 ± 11.2%).</p>

Home-based exercise training appears to be a safe, low-cost exercise that can be integrated into the overall drug management of chronic heart failure.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0269215511403941">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0269215511403941">22</xref></sup></p>
<p>The cardiopulmonary exercise testing is regarded as the gold standard measure of aerobic capacity and peak VO<sub>2</sub> is often used for stratifying risk independently from other risk factors. In our study, Groups 1 and 2 improved the peak VO<sub>2</sub> and the training patients changed to low risk (VO<sub>2</sub> &gt; 18 ml/kg/min)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0269215511403941">15</xref></sup> according to this variable. In contrast, untrained patients (Group 3) had a significant decrease in peak VO<sub>2</sub> after three months. Therefore recent studies have shown that the VE/VCO<sub>2</sub> slope is more powerful to predict mortality than peak VO<sub>2</sub> alone. The relation between ventilation and carbon dioxide production during incremental exercise is atypical in chronic heart failure, and an abnormally high VE/VCO<sub>2</sub> slope (typically &gt; 34) are at a greater risk of a cardiovascular event.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0269215511403941">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0269215511403941">23</xref></sup> After home-based exercise programmes this variable demonstrated a significant decrease to normal rates only in trained Groups 1 and 2.</p>
<p>Our findings are consistent with Niebauer and colleagues (2005)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0269215511403941">24</xref></sup> and Müller and colleagues (2009)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0269215511403941">9</xref></sup> who demonstrated that home exercise training increased peak VO<sub>2</sub>, and no significant change was demonstrated in the controls. On the other hand, the study by Dracup and colleagues (2007)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0269215511403941">25</xref></sup> with resistive and aerobic home exercise, did not result in significant changes in patients' performance, that may have occurred because of lack of adherence to the exercise protocol.</p>
<p>Research increasingly suggests that complementary strength training for chronic heart failure, when appropriately prescribed, has favourable effects on muscular strength and endurance, cardiovascular function, metabolism, coronary risk factors and psychosocial well-being.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0269215511403941">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0269215511403941">26</xref></sup> And these favourable effects were demonstrated in our study. Isokinetic testing for strength and endurance improved after home-based exercise training for both Groups 1 and 2, whereas there was a small deterioration or no change in control Group 3. The same benefits were demonstrated by Senden and colleagues (2005),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0269215511403941">27</xref></sup> with combined supervised and home-based exercise.</p>
<p>In addition, our results showed a significant higher increase in muscle strength and endurance in Group 2 with aerobic and strength exercises. Mandic and colleagues (2009)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0269215511403941">28</xref></sup> demonstrated that combined aerobic and resistance-supervised training significantly improved strength and muscular endurance, by one-repetition maximum test, compared with aerobic training or usual care.</p>
<p>Chronic heart failure is a syndrome that strongly affects the quality of life because of the limitations produced by the symptoms such as dyspnoea and fatigue, as well as loss of muscle mass. A common activity, such as walking, might increase patient motivation because it can be done so easily.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0269215511403941">22</xref></sup> As shown in our study, patients randomized to the home exercise groups showed improvements in quality of life demonstrated by a significant decrease on total scores of MLHFQ (Group 1 = −48.8%; Group 2 = −44.4%). In addition, we speculated that the regular physical activity proposed by the home programmes, that increased the physical conditioning, may explain the improvement in quality of life. Oka and colleagues (2000)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0269215511403941">29</xref></sup> showed that home-based programme (walking and resistance exercise) are safe and effective to reduce symptoms and increase quality of life.</p>
<p>Sleep apnoea, that is characterized by nocturnal apnoea and hypoapnoea associated with a reduction in arterial oxygen saturations and arousals from sleep, has recently attracted much attention in the treatment of chronic heart failure.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0269215511403941">30</xref></sup> The prevalence of sleep apnoea may contribute to the progression of the chronic heart failure and increase the risk of death. However, the effects of home-based exercise training on sleep apnoea and chronic heart failure have not been determined.</p>
<p>Within this context, reflecting the importance of the cardiac rehabilitation, our results showed that the home-based exercise training programmes for chronic heart failure and sleep apnoea improved the sleep quality. This was demonstrated by a significant decrease in AHI (Group 1 = −33.7%; Group 2 = −38.1%) and in the number of patients with severe sleep apnoea (Group 1 = −50%; Group 2 = −84.3%). Nocturnal arousals also decreased and sleep efficiency increased. Two previous studies with supervised aerobic training for chronic heart failure demonstrated improvement in exercise capacity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0269215511403941">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0269215511403941">32</xref></sup> and in the central<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0269215511403941">31</xref></sup> and obstructive<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0269215511403941">32</xref></sup> sleep apnoea.</p>
<p>In our study, adherence was assessed by the number of exercise sessions completed in comparison to the goal number of sessions for the total 12-week intervention. Patients in Groups 1 and 2 were encouraged to record in the manual all exercise sessions performed during the week. Log books were used to monitor weekly adherence and were reviewed monthly in our institution. We also assessed the number of sessions completed by weekly telephone call.</p>
<p>The home groups demonstrated high rates of participation and exercise adherence. The potential reasons for that may be attributed to the greater flexibility in the programmes, and the emphasis in the benefits of the cardiac rehabilitation programme, promoting independent exercise. Yohannes and colleagues (2007)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0269215511403941">33</xref></sup> demonstrated that lower perceptions of exercise consequences and lower illness perception of treatment control were predictors of early drop-out from a cardiac rehabilitation programme.</p>
<p>We also speculated that weekly telephone calls to each patient in the home groups and monthly return contributed to the positive outcome in adherence and safety. Support provided by telephone by the doctor and physiotherapists was important to monitor the patients and may have helped them to feel connected to the healthcare system.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0269215511403941">22</xref></sup> Our rigorous exclusion criteria of chronic heart failure patients probably accounts for the absence of cardiac events related to training in this study.</p>
<p>The major limitation of our study was the inclusion of the patients. The majority seen by the specialist heart failure clinic were not eligible (84.7%). As an initial protocol in our institution, we were rigorous in the exclusion criteria for safe home exercise; it is possible that a large number of studies with home-based exercise for chronic heart failure can reduce the number of excluded patients. Chronic heart failure patients showed co-morbidities that contributed to clinical instability, like uncontrolled arrhythmias, pulmonary embolism, pulmonary hypertension, decompensated diabetes, musculoskeletal disorders, renal insufficiency. These patients were not able to train safely at home without monitoring and supervision.</p>
<p>As mentioned previously, we followed the orientations of the juridical consultantship and of the joint research ethics board of our institution in opting for a rigorous patient selection and this choice resulted in a large number of exclusions. The results, however, are still promising and replication in a larger study will allow us to assess the wider external applicability of this programme.</p>
<p>Because of the self-monitored nature of home-based exercise training it was not possible to ensure that the patients complied with their individualized exercise programme. However, training groups showed improvement in all evaluated data and the adherence was an important factor in our results, fundamental in demonstrating the benefits of the home-based exercise programmes for chronic heart failure.</p>
<p>In conclusion, our home-based exercise programmes were designed to be safe and easily reproducible in a wide community with minimal cost and equipment with security, avoiding the need for patients to attend more than a small number of centre-based sessions. Results included improvement of exercise performance, functional capacity, muscle strength and endurance, quality of life and sleep apnoea, and registered high adherence. However, it is important to recognize that our original study demonstrated results with restricted subgroups of chronic heart failure patients with stringent inclusion/exclusion criteria, emphasizing training security. Replication in a larger group would demonstrate the results for chronic heart failure in general.</p>
