<p>Racial inequality continues to be an ugly sore festering in the heart of twenty-first-century America, despite claims that it has become a post-racial society. America’s first black President—Barack Obama—has been in office for almost four years. Yet, social conditions for poor and working-class blacks have actually worsened since Obama took office. The black/white wealth gap has widened; the black unemployment rate has risen to alarming proportions, especially in inner cities; the home foreclosure crisis has hit the black community with fiercely disproportionate consequences; poor black and brown communities continue to be devastated by crime. The murder of black and brown youth is commonplace, even just blocks from Obama’s Chicago mansion and his new home in the stately White House. At the same time, public education for blacks has deteriorated drastically. In March of 2012, the Department of Education released data demonstrating, “Although black students made up only 18 percent of those enrolled in the schools sampled, they accounted for 35 percent of those suspended once, 46 percent of those suspended more than once and 39 percent of all expulsions” (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/06/education/black-students-face-more-harsh-discipline-data-shows.html">http://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/06/education/black-students-face-more-harsh-discipline-data-shows.html</ext-link> March 6, 2012). The report concludes that, “One in five black boys and more than one in 10 black girls received an out-of-school suspension. Over all, black students were three-and-a-half times as likely to be suspended or expelled than their white peers.” Above all, the massive incarceration of black and brown people during the first decade of the twenty-first century has been so crippling for those communities that it has been diagnosed as the New Jim Crow.</p>
<p><italic>State of White Supremacy: Racism, Governance, and the United States</italic>, edited by Moon-Kie Jung, João H. Costa Vargas, and Eduardo Bonilla-Silva, argues that such racial outcomes in America should be expected as routine, predictable phenomena. In fact, evidence is provided suggesting that such racism is also routine business in other countries where there is a mix of blacks and whites, because America is an integral part of a global white dominant order working its racial mischief far beyond the boundaries of nation-states. The volume is organized into eleven chapters covering such topics as the racial nature of the state, the underpinnings of white supremacy, democratic theory and racism, citizenship and racial profiling, race and public education, race and public welfare, immigration and racism, and racism against Muslims in the wake of the 2001 terror attack. The authors consist of some scholars who are well known and others not so known. Collectively, they attack the problem of racism and white supremacy from varying angles including theoretical abstract pieces and those anchored in empirical case studies.</p>
<p>Yet there is a thread, even if implicit, running through all the chapters. The authors reject any claims that racial oppression is a superficial feature of American society manifesting itself in episodic ad hoc aberrant fits rooted in individual psyches. For them, claims of American color-blindness are ridiculous and unsustainable by serious social scientific analyses. To the contrary, they argue that American white supremacy and racial inequality are deeply systemic given that both are rooted in America’s history, culture, social structure, and the state throughout its federal, state, and local branches. In this sense, the volume argues that white supremacy was not a practice grafted onto the American state that waxes and wanes given the sensibilities and racial temperaments of those holding office. Instead, the empire-building American state was founded as a white state whose ambitious interests could only be realized through racial oppression, colonization, and genocide against people of color. Thus, the American state is foremost a racial state incapable of operating contrary to its own inner logic of dominating non-white populations.</p>
<p>In the view of these authors, contemporary America is as driven by racial oppression as the original thirteen colonies that broke from the colonializing ways of Britain in order to freely pursue their own brand of colonization and empire-building. Moreover, by conquering peoples of color whom they viewed as savage and barbarous, early American colonialists seized their land, resources, and indigenous cultures emphasizing self-determination to erect a vast white empire upon the spoils. According to these scholars, contemporary America continues the original racist project. Blacks, browns, and immigrants are racially profiled and jailed lest they become rebellious when no longer needed as surplus labor. Single mothers receiving welfare are monitored and sanctioned by the state to make sure they do not burden white Americans. Muslims have become profiled as a new dangerous racial group, thus justifying the undue oppression they must now endure. Members of those perceived as illegal immigrants are forced to confront constant supervision and loss of dignity. Racial segregation and inequality in the public schools are currently being legitimized and upheld by the courts, including the Supreme Court.</p>
<p>These authors would agree with Secretary of Education Arne Duncan that, “The undeniable truth is that the everyday education experience for too many students of color violates the principle of equity at the heart of the American promise.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0094306112457769">1</xref></sup> Yet, they would argue that his conclusions apply to every dimension of American life. The solution to racial inequality cannot be generated by elected officials, including a black President, because such officials operate within the confining walls of a racist state whose inner laws require that white supremacy prevail at all costs. Only a mass-based social movement, they argue, that follows a logic of resistance, is capable of producing racial transformation.</p>
<p>Those whose taste requires “objective” detached social science will find no comfort in this volume. Those who believe science and activism are separate domains that should never be fused, will find no reasons to embrace this book. I, for one, appreciate social scientists who use straightforward analyses to shed light on one of the most vexing social problems known to the human race—a more explicit analytic thread running through the volume could have made the chapters more tightly woven. In some of the more abstract chapters the authors could have planted at least one foot more securely in the empirical world and shaken loose from unnecessary jargon of the less weighty varieties. But when it is all said and done, this volume provides troubling and disturbing insights that we social scientists need not be too timid and cautious to absorb. This volume will prove valuable to experts on race as well as to students at all levels of academia.</p>
