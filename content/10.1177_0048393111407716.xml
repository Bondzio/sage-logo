<abstract>
<p>The Oxford Handbook provides an extensive and innovative review of developments in Analytical Sociology (AS) which is a theory program which seeks to develop ‘thin explanations’ of social phenomena by understanding their micro-foundations through explicitly developed models and then tracing through the broader consequences of these actions and interactions for aggregate social patterns. The volume covers the key characteristics of this approach in terms of ontology and epistemology and then assays recent developments across over two dozen areas of application: each a particular social mechanism. Methodological approaches particularly pertinent to AS are also covered. However, some of the criticisms of the AS programme are also noted, especially its lack of attention thus far to meso-level and macro-level mechanisms.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Although sociologists attend mainly to their own particular subject-matter concerns, a task for all is to develop a workable image of how knowledge production is working for their discipline. This very important volume on Analytical Sociology (AS) is necessary consideration for all those wanting to keep tabs on one of the main directions in which the discipline is going, and they should be reflecting on this approach even if it seems not directly connected with their immediate interests.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0048393111407716">
<title>Contents</title>
<p>An assemblage of 38 authors (many highly prestigious and with long and effective publishing records) has produced the 30 chapters in the volume: some authors write several chapters. It is a magnificent collection of high-quality essays that assemble an immense base of knowledge, buttressed by a superb consolidated bibliography.</p>
<p>The <italic>Handbook</italic> is organized in four parts. The two essays in Part 1 provide an overview and focus on philosophy of (social) science issues (which are then not returned to) and so are crucial in intellectually holding the volume together. The opening definitional move is to see AS as explaining collective social phenomena within a particular way: so AS is:
<disp-quote>
<p>Concerned first and foremost with explaining important social facts such as network structures, patterns of residential segregation, typical beliefs, cultural tastes, common ways of acting and so forth. It explains such facts not merely by relating them to other social facts . . . but by detailing in clear and precise ways the mechanisms through which the social facts under consideration are brought about. (p. 3)</p>
<p>The two crucial features of AS are that it explains by detailing mechanisms through which social facts are brought about, and these mechanisms invariably refer to individual’s actions and the relations that link actors to one another. (p. 4)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This latter point is formally named and slightly elaborated as the doctrine of “structural individualism,” which is “a methodological doctrine according to which social facts would be explained as the intended or unintended outcomes of individual’s actions.” This contrasts with the more traditional methodological individualism of classic rational action theory (RAT) in emphasizing the causal importance of relational and also contextual structures that precede, but also are generated by people’s actions.</p>
<p>The components of AS are built up as an array of middle-range theories (MRTs), each propounding and sketching the operation of a mechanism. The goal is to see sociology as a toolbox of semi-general mechanisms (p. 6). Each is limited in what it explains but broad in how widely it explains these specific features. MRTs are not content- or context-specific and therefore provide “thin explanation” in direct contrasts with Geertz’s famous context-rich “thick descriptions.” The mechanism approach is contrasted with the more traditional variables-centered and statistical modeling approach to understanding causal processes that most sociologists adopt, especially in the mode of survey research.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>[M]echanisms can be said to consist of entities (with their properties) and the activities that these entities engage in, either by themselves in concert with other entities. These activities bring about change and the type of change brought about depends upon the properties and activities of the entities and the relations between them. (p. 5)</p>
<p>There seems to be entire equivalence between change, outcome and (aggregate) social fact, although this equivalence may deserve more careful probing. Another type of analysis concerns selection mechanism[s that] . . . can explain how and why the relative frequency of entities with different properties changes over time. (p. 8)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The editors go on to suggest that sociologists follow a somewhat incomplete analytical sequence that, beginning with a social fact, alternative hypotheses (translated into computational models) are developed that simulate outcomes and these are then compared against observed outcomes with the final step (presumably) being the analyst choosing which mechanism seems to be working.</p>
<p>The final analytical device pressed into service is a Coleman diagram/boat/graph that (as is well known) vitiates a macro-variable to macro-variable link in favor of indirect linkage of two macro-variables only through micro-to-micro-variable casual effects. There then ensues a micro-macro link, together with a prior macro-micro link. The volume affirms this approach: macro-properties are seen only as a result of micro-properties and therefore characterizable as “supervenience.” Macro-properties can have a contextual influence although they “also can have causal efficacy by being components which individuals consciously take into account when deciding what to do” (p. 11).</p>
<p>On this platform the subsequent array of theoretical work provided by the volume is built. The architecture of the volume begins by examining various micro-foundations provided by various mechanisms (with an eye to their consequential collective outcomes) followed by treatment of various outcomes (looking back at the micro-mechanisms that have produced them). The micro-mechanisms are referred to as “cogs and wheels”—each comprising both actions and relations among people—which are linked aspects since much action is orientated to others (i.e., relational). Thus, cogs and wheels are seen as being embedded within social structures.</p>
<p>Part 2 has eight chapters on the role of action and interaction in explaining diverse social processes, and is split into two subparts. One deals with ego-centered (mental state) explanations of action—emotions, beliefs, preferences, opportunities, heuristics—and the second set are actor-centered explanations focusing on causes centering on the actions of others—signaling, norms, trust.</p>
<p>The editors’ summary of one of the beliefs chapters gives a clear model of what might be aimed at in such treatments.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Rydgren considers in depth the multiple mechanisms by which beliefs are formed . . . from observation, influence/socialization, induction, deduction from other beliefs, adaptation to desire (wishful thinking), and dissonance-reduction mechanisms—and identifies both the conditions under which each obtains and the characteristics processes (and problems) associated with each. For example, conformity processes occur more frequently in repeated-interaction groups and generate snowball effects on others; dissonance reduction occurs only when beliefs are part of the same belief system. (p. 17)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Part 3 focuses on the generic and processural features (“macroscopic dynamics”) of social structures that are built up from the basic “cogs and wheels.” Its 15 chapters explore the processes of: segregation, self-fulfilling prophecy, social influence, contagion, matching, collective action, conditional choice, networks, social influence thresholds, scheduling, homophily, status/dominance hierarchies, and conflict.</p>
<p>Finally, part 4 provides links to potential allies: game theory, experimental economics, analytical ethnography, survey research, and comparative history. These are seen as the next “layer” of sociologies that might soon be incorporated into the AS stable and potential ways of such linking are explored.</p>
<p>The volume should be read in conjunction with an earlier volume (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0048393111407716">Hedström and Swedberg 1998</xref>) and an extended book-length manifesto (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0048393111407716">Hedström 2005</xref>), together with several essay-length reviews of the approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0048393111407716">Adams 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0048393111407716">Barbera 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0048393111407716">Bortolini 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0048393111407716">Manzo 2010</xref>). Rapidly developing AS needs to be tracked, for example as in the more developed statement on “mechanism-explanations” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0048393111407716">Hedström and Ylikoski 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Apart from reviewing and packing down large wodges of material, the volume’s other fruits are revelations of otherwise hidden, interesting findings, often yielded from massive (and nicely located and retrieved) data-sets: for example, dating pattern complexities or work-based suicide effects for men. It is impossible to completely review such a volume, so the following comments are addressed to the overall program that the volume seeks to unfold.</p>
<p>The intellectual and social composition of the alliance may tell us something about AS’s likely trajectory. This volume draws on an array of work which stretches back in various threads into the entire post–World War II period but as a package is brand-spanking new. It could be described as an alliance of networks analysts necessarily concerned to link with some RAT theoretical work and strongly drawing on the particular research methods of experimentation and (agent-based) simulation. AS can also be seen as part of a broader “analytical turn” in social theory that emphasizes precision and clarity.</p>
<p>In terms of personnel, broadly, two-thirds of the contributors are men, two-thirds from the United States (the rest from Europe), and two-thirds sociologists (the rest from political science, statistics, and other related disciplines: although intellectual and geographical migrations muddy the clarity of the picture). It is interesting that this volume is firmly anchored (and very prestigiously in Oxford and Columbia Universities) on either side of the Atlantic. AS does not have so much of a UK base, as Hedström links rather more to Scandinavian and Continental scholars. Indeed there seems (evidenced in the provenance of reviews of Hedström’s writings and analytical sociology more generally) to be a very considerable resonance with AS from Continental writers. (Perhaps more research would find that these links go back quite a way in Continental sociology: for example the journal <italic>Analysis &amp; Critique</italic> had much the same goal in the 1970s and has continued to explore this approach ever since.) It seems to me that writers on either side of the Atlantic have rather different emphases: the US writers tend to take a quite subject-matter-centered approach, are less theoretically reflective, and so do not cleave so explicitly to an openly analytical sociology approach.</p>

<title>Implications</title>
<p>Since the individual components seem so splendidly carried out my concern lies with the overall packaging and implications. The key issue is a concern that this approach is seen as sufficiently sociological to attract widespread interest: partly because it is too social psychological and partly because of its formal and mathematical expressions.</p>
<p>It is hard to disagree with the proposition put forward in this volume that sociology’s causal performance has been underpowered and that there has been a debilitating lack of cumulation of findings and confirmed sociological knowledge. The development of sociology over time often seems to lurch between more qualitative (or related) and more quantitative emphases, although of course the picture is more complicated. Perhaps we have learned important negative lessons (in a broadly Popperian sense) and each new iteration comes back with a sounder approach in an overall dialectical pattern. Whether the AS approach will successfully yield its promises has yet to be seen. Hopefully, in a more diversity tolerant atmosphere of sociology an exposition of AS such as this will not get bogged down in the trenches of the “science wars.”</p>
<p>The theme of obtaining analytical depth and cumulation in sociology has been in continuous interplay with more vividly descriptive reality-based approaches, although analytical sociologists, it seems from this volume, are rather more interested in getting on with the business of developing their science than in tracing its roots and departure points from its fathers and mothers. Establishing such linkages seems to be seen as a task better left to historians of sociology. Some of the following are explicitly noted in the volume, but I have added others whose influence a future historian might expound on: Marx, de Tocqueville, Simmel (formal sociology), Popper (logic of situations), Blau (macrostructural intersections), Schelling, Coleman, Black (pure sociology), Goldthorpe, Boudon, Harrison White, Tilly, analytical Marxists, and, more recently, the parallel work of Levi Martin. The literature of sociology (and other social sciences) has many more usages of mechanisms which are not drawn in this volume and work locating and relating to some of these other mechanism-based analyses might well be rewarding, particularly as it might be a way of quickly extending the stock of knowledge that can be amassed under the AS “brand.”</p>
<p>There are two pertinent points about the historical context set out in the volume. It was an interesting move to locate Merton as providing the founding impulse, although entirely justified bearing in mind that he was a great supporter of Coleman’s work and Merton did indeed live to validate this approach (footnoted in chapter 2). However, while undoubtedly supporting this application Merton would have insisted on flanking it with other more enriching visions of how sociology was to be accomplished. But perhaps Coleman’s other great mentor (and Merton’s close colleague), Paul Lazarsfeld, is also important, as I will point out below.</p>
<p>Four major difficulties are the unclarity of the basic conceptual architecture, the need to also consider corporate actors (à la Coleman) together with other more loosely linked social formations and the under-attention to both Opportunities and Unintended Consequences.</p>
<p>A major fault of the volume is that there is only the slimmest guidance about how the huge array of material is to be packaged. In particular, we need to know how exhaustive the coverage of mechanisms is in each of the volume’s parts and whether there is any formula that generates the range of possibilities. In this area we could be guided by Hedström’s earlier efforts where he takes his own rendition of a more extended RAT model and then shows how different mechanisms are nested in the model’s several options. Presumably the strategy of AS is to build up a complete “Inventory” of mechanisms. The next question then becomes, can the classificatory axes of such an inventory be theoretically underpinned eventually by something akin to the periodic table in chemistry? When will “saturation” be reached?</p>
<p>Similarly, it might be helpful to see the final part of the <italic>Handbook</italic> as having two rather different components. One is reviewing those components of the core conceptual alliance of AS—in addition to the epistemology of mechanism-based explanations, which is covered in the opening two chapters. Thus game theory and experimentation are reviewed, although the other methodological candidates of simulation and formal modeling are unfortunately not so covered.</p>
<p>The final three chapters do stand apart as broad and popular methodological areas of sociology that need to be brought into a closer relationship with analytical sociology. In each of these three broad methodologies domain- (or context-) specific “substantive theory” is the usual outcome of studies rather than more “formal” theory concerning mechanisms, and in each of these three cases the authors are able to point to substantial achieved advances in identifying and describing mechanisms, although not always portrayed as such. Linking actions, interactions, and outcomes into mechanism type descriptions or even models is central in much ethnography, and (usually at a different scale) more analytical comparative/historical sociologists also lace their accounts of broad trends and developments with the identification of the underlying mechanisms that have generated the complex surface patterns. Since explanations of historical matters are often highly contested, recourse to highlighting mechanisms is often useful in ordering debates. Both methodologies tend to be process-orientated and to go with flows over time, which makes them ever more well suited to linking with AS. Survey research sometimes seems least readily accommodated within the analytical sociology fold, although if adequate information relating to various postulated mechanisms is available it can readily be recruited for the task, and moreover has the unusual advantage of often being able to provide estimates of the distribution of a mechanism’s operations over a population. However, surveys need to be considerably reconceptualized (and often extra ranges of information gathering added) to make them fit-for-purpose.</p>
<p>It is interesting, too, that in these last three chapters the language is alive with concerns for micro/meso/macro linkages, which are far less prominent throughout the preceding chapters of the volume. Those placed more firmly in the three methodological traditions are clearly far more sensitive to such issues—and to stressing the multilevel capabilities of each of their three perspectives. This is particularly encouraging, since it suggests that the more limiting and “pure” core components of analytical sociology may well be pushed into a wider and more relevant sociological frameworks as their expansion rubs up with these wider methodological domains.</p>
<p>A second issue is whether it is necessary for AS to remain focused only (hopefully only in its current unnecessarily restrained rendition) on individual-level mechanisms. For example, Merton’s illustrations are of mechanisms centered in role-sets or status-sets, which are quasi-institutionalized sets of relationships amongst people. Taking this a step further, in a powerful (but too-often neglected) typology, Lazarsfeld and Menzel distinguished between global (indivisible properties of the collectivity itself), relational (the emergent links amongst components), and aggregate (combinations arising from massed properties of individuals) types of collective properties. The AS sociologists do not include the global, presumably because they deny such properties of a collectivity an ontological status. True, social collectivities cannot act as a collectivity, but for many analytical purposes it is methodologically efficient to analyze groups that are closely socially bonded as a collective unit. Teams, cultures, and corporate units have many empirically substantiated properties that cannot be decomposed into the individual properties of their members, even if their animation comes from individual actions. Amongst the social facts AS attends to, “typical beliefs” are enumerated but not global cultures, ignoring the point that much of culture is not merely shared but there may only be limited versions of key symbolic items. More generally, the operation of institutions and fields need to be considered, such as institutional analyses (e.g., the work of Nobel-winner Elinor Olsen) where major breakthroughs in understanding the effect s of collective frameworks have been achieved. There is no need to restrict a definition of mechanisms to only the individual level—even if this is a necessary (yet far from sufficient) component in any sociological explanation.</p>
<p>Hedström’s desires, beliefs, and opportunities (DBO) model recognizes that opportunities are indeed perceived opportunities although attention is also given to the interests and capacities of actors in expanding and/or contracting their own opportunity spaces. However, this line of analysis needs to be pushed out further (à la Merton) to also consider the differential means through which actors can mobilize to achieve outcomes, and so on.</p>
<p>Finally, a major bridge to understanding wider (and more institutionalized) social structures requires consideration of the unintended consequences of actions—which is included in the AS paradigm but not emphasized enough (or possibly not extracted enough from where relevant discussion occurs in other discussions). To a considerable extent higher-level structures are “built on the backs” of intended actions and focusing on RAT models tends to deflect sufficient attention to such processes. Too much notice is taken in AS of the immediately obvious inputs and outputs rather than also considering, and developing models of, more complex structurations.</p>
<p>It is important that the more specifically philosophical implications be pointed out. The direct attack by AS on the covering law model of explanation seems partially misplaced, although the discussions of mechanisms certainly take understanding of how to develop explanations much further than hitherto. Mechanism explanations are an outgrowth of the covering law model, providing the necessary processural understanding of how the causal effect “works”—somewhat as Lazarsfeld suggested with the concept of intervening variables. Compared to covering laws, mechanisms seem to be imbued with a more delimited operation.</p>
<p>Should there be more of an engagement with critical realism since this approach deals with networks of entities and their mutual effect on outcomes (sometimes including the suppression of effects by one mechanism or the impact of another)? Again, in Lazarsfeld’s terms: suppression or sometimes spuriousness. Unfortunately, critical realism cannot itself provide too many solutions on this complexity issue since it is itself deficient, but it might help AS think though the issues of how to analyze situations in which multiple mechanisms are in operation (or not!).</p>
<p>The analytical and empirical adequacy of RAT-related micro-foundations needs much consideration since it is the anchoring point of the AS approach. This volume extends further the desire-belief-opportunity (DBO) model used by Hedström in earlier work, although it is not clear what the volume provides is a sufficiently encompassing model of additional components. This needs to be bolstered empirically by descriptive research into the relevant weights of these components across a range of situations, so that appropriate initial conditions for model-building can be specified. A clear understanding of what is involved in any individual-level mechanism is needed to bring to life the abstract definitions supplied in the volume. This must surely include the “energy” generated, the sources from which it is generated, and how it is steered. A link with Randall Collins’ “interaction chains” might well be very fruitful.</p>
<p>Another wider philosophical point for contemplation concerns whether the AS approach has potential for emancipatory, critical and/or constructive analysis beyond its more descriptive and explanatory core tasks. Since formalization has some potential for providing analytical leverage for such extra tasks, this might well be an interesting extra rationale for AS to develop.</p>
<p>AS is poised to expand out from beyond its present beachhead, or to remain hemmed in. A major effort is needed to explode out of its current confines. At present it is too limited by its simulation/experimentation base and the elaborate sophistication within which its simple ideas are cloaked. It is not readily accessible to most sociologists and (as yet) insufficiently linked up with key disciplinary concerns and “deep problems” to attract the attention it deserves. Fortunately, the volume lays the foundation for a potential breakout by lining up ethnography and survey research (the most common modes of sociological empirical research) as the next areas for it to link up with. Work within the AS paradigm over the next few years will be crucial for expediting this breakout.</p>
