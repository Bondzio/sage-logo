<abstract>
<p>The electromagnetic shielding effectiveness (SE) of various weft-knitted fabrics made of hybrid yarns is investigated by considering the anisotropy of the structures, which has not been analyzed in previous studies. The anechoic chamber with aperture method at different polarizations of electromagnetic waves within the frequency range of 30 MHz and 9.93 GHz is used to determine the SE of knitted fabrics manufactured on a circular weft knitting machine from siro-spun and siro core-spun yarns without and with a metal core. The results show that SE depends on the orientation of the fibers within the structure regarding the direction of the electrical field in addition to parameters such as metal content, loop length and frequency; these results can be used to outline the basic points in determining a knit structure with desired SE.</p>

<body>
<p>Electrical and electronic devices, which intentionally or unintentionally radiate electromagnetic waves, are being used more as a necessity of modern life. As a result of the increase in the usage of electrical and electronic devices, we are being exposed to more electromagnetic environmental pollution with each passing day. Besides waste and noise pollution, electromagnetic wave pollution, a so-called “electrosmog” problem, also appears to be of major concern in this century.</p>
<p>The simplest and most effective way to prevent electromagnetic radiation hazards is to stay away from the radiation source. However, as this is not always possible, different protection methods have been developed. One of the main methods used in protection from electromagnetic radiation is “shielding.” Shielding can be described as isolation to keep the electromagnetic radiation from external sources outside or to prevent unwanted emission of electromagnetic energy radiated by internal sources.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0040517512456758">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>Electromagnetic shielding materials are usually used to reduce the intensity of electromagnetic fields. Lately, applications of electromagnetic shielding with textile materials are used more widely<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0040517512456758">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0040517512456758">13</xref></sup> instead of metal screens and other traditional shielding materials, these materials havingthe disadvantages of weight, corrosion, difficulty in adjusting the shielding effectiveness (SE) and limited mechanical flexibility, while textile materials are lighter, more flexible and have a relatively lower cost.</p>
<p>Textile structures for electromagnetic shielding can be manufactured as textiles using conductive yarns including conductive filler and textiles, with conductivity obtained by various finishing processes on textile surfaces. The usage of 100% continuous metal wire in fabric production leads to various problems in the production and the end-use of the fabric. Therefore, it is preferable to use conductive yarns produced as a mixture of metal wires and synthetic or natural fibers/yarns.</p>
<p>Among the textile applications, knitted structures have been also under investigation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0040517512456758">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0040517512456758">13</xref></sup> In these studies, various knitted structures have been compared and it has been indicated that the electromagnetic shielding effectiveness (EMSE) is related to the amount of conductive filler that can be varied by changing the knit structure, stitch density and yarn count. In these studies coaxial transmission line tester was used as the EMSE test method; however, this test method is suitable for symmetric/isotropic samples and test results are reported to be sensitive against the geometry and orientation of the samples<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0040517512456758">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0040517512456758">15</xref></sup> while knitted structures are already proved to be anisotropic.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0040517512456758">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0040517512456758">23</xref></sup> In all of these studies, therefore, knitted fabrics have been examined but without regard for the effect of the anisotropy of the structure, and overall evaluation of the effect of the knitted structures has been expressed mainly relating to the amount of the conductive filler independently of the fiber orientation. Thus the knit structure could be indicated to be effective but the reasons and the mechanism could not be expressed. In this study we aimed to investigate the EMSE characteristics of various knitted structures made from hybrid yarns containing stainless steel wire by considering the two major axes of the structures: namely, course (horizontal) and wale (vertical), using the anechoic chamber method as the test method. In this way, it will be possible to understand the effect of the knitted structure not only in terms of the amount of conductive filler but also in terms of the orientation of the conductive filler within the structure. As a result, the effect of the knit structure may be explained and the basic guidelines in designing a knitted structure with desired EMSE may be outlined.</p>

<p>The siro core spinning method was used for producing hybrid yarns containing stainless steel wire as the conductive filler because siro core spinning is better than other core spinning methods in terms of covering effectiveness of core wire.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0040517512456758">24</xref></sup> In this method, two rovings of short staple fibers and metal wire are combined with a pair of front cylinders of the drafting system. An additional feeding apparatus (V-shaped, metal wire guiding roller) is needed on the ring spinning frame to be able to feed the metal wire to the drafting zone. The production of the hybrid yarn in this study was achieved on the sample ring spinning machine, which has a special siro-spun and siro core-spun spinning apparatus. The modified drafting zone of the ring spinning frame can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0040517512456758">Figure 1</xref>.

</fig></p>
<p>Ne 24, 100 % cotton siro-spun yarns (24-C) and siro core-spun hybrid yarns (24-SS), having twist factor α<sub>e</sub> = 3.7, were manufactured using 20 micron AISI 316 L-type stainless steel (SS) wire as the core part of hybrid yarn and by using combed rovings, which are of Ne 1.7 with a twist of 62 T/m as the sheath part. The gap between the rovings was set to 8 mm for the production of all siro yarns.</p>
<p>As the knit structure, plain knit, pique knit and double-knit structures were chosen. Plain knit (Y1C, Y1S-a) and pique knit (Y3S) samples were fabricated on a Mayer MV 4-3-2II model (19 inch-28E) circular knitting machine whereas double-knit fabric samples (Y2S-a, Y2S-b, Y2S-c) were manufactured on a Mayer PV 2.0 model (14 inch-18E) circular knitting machine.

<p>The SE of the fabrics was measured using the anechoic chamber method between a frequency range of 30 MHz and 9.93 GHz with the test setup prepared according to Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) standard 299-1997 and IEEE standard 1302-1998.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0040517512456758">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0040517512456758">26</xref></sup> The schematic diagram of the test setup is given in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0040517512456758">Figure 4</xref>. The transmitting antenna (signal source) was placed outside the shielded chamber and the receiving antenna was within the shielded chamber. Signals were measured by a spectrum analyzer with the antenna inside the chamber. The test area, in the shape of a square (0.6 × 0.6 m<sup>2</sup>), was obtained by creating an opening in the wall of the shielding chamber. Radio frequency (RF) absorber materials were used on the walls inside the shielding chamber to diminish the reflection that may occur at the walls. For different frequency ranges, different antennas, such as biconical (30 MHz–300 MHz), log-periodic (300 MHz–1GHz) and horn (1 GHz–9.93 GHz) were used. Measurements were performed using both the horizontal and vertical polarization of the antennas while the fabric samples were placed so the wales of the samples were in the vertical direction. SE of the fabric samples for each frequency was calculated according to <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula1-0040517512456758">Equation (1)</xref>.

<p>For each sample, the measurement results at the vertical and horizontal polarization of the antennas between the 30 MHz and 9.93 GHz frequency range were taken into consideration for investigating the SE values of the sample fabrics.</p>
<p>As the control group for the shielding effectiveness of the hybrid yarn, Y1C fabric produced from 24-C (100% cotton) yarns was checked for SE at both the vertical and horizontal polarization of incident electromagnetic waves; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0040517512456758">Figure 7</xref> shows that the fabric does not have SE for either of the polarizations.

<p>SE measurements of Y1S-a fabric produced from 24-SS hybrid yarns were also done at the vertical and horizontal polarization of incident electromagnetic waves and, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0040517512456758">Figure 8</xref>, Y1S-a fabric does not show any SE for vertical polarization but its SE value reaches above 30 dB at the 94–641 MHz frequency range for horizontal polarization of incident electromagnetic waves. The obtained SE value, which is 30 dB or higher, is within normal shielding range.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0040517512456758">27</xref></sup> The highest SE value of Y1S-a fabric was recorded to be 45.35 dB at 263 MHz for horizontal polarization.

</p>
<p>In a previous study,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0040517512456758">28</xref></sup> weft-knitted fabrics were also reported to show EMSE for horizontal polarization while no shielding was reported at vertical polarization, but no reason was offered for such behavior and the behavior could only be related with the movement direction of the yarn during the knitting process. However, the reason why weft-knitted fabrics have horizontal polarization (coursewise) SE while not having vertical shielding (walewise) effectiveness can be explained by the fiber orientation within the knitted fabrics. It has already been indicated by studies done on the anisotropic behaviors of knitted fabric reinforced composites in terms of inplane properties<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0040517512456758">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0040517512456758">23</xref></sup> that fiber orientation along the walewise direction is higher than the fiber orientation along the coursewise direction within weft-knitted fabric structures, meaning that the amount of fibers aligned in the walewise direction is more than that in the coursewise direction. As the fiber orientation is higher in the walewise direction, the conductive filler amount is higher in the walewise direction of the samples in this study. So the horizontal electromagnetic waves are shielded by the vertically (walewise) oriented conductive filler, and the samples show SE for horizontal polarization of incident electromagnetic waves while horizontally oriented conductive filler amount is not sufficient for EMSE at vertical polarization.</p>
<p>Such an SE dependent on the fiber orientation has also been examined in the studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0040517512456758">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0040517512456758">30</xref></sup> done on woven fabrics produced from hybrid yarns, indicating that fabrics woven of hybrid yarns only in the warp direction show SE for horizontal polarization but no SE for vertical polarization.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0040517512456758">30</xref></sup></p>
<p>When examining EMSE for horizontal polarization of the samples having the same knit structure but different loop length, namely Y2S-a, Y2S-b, Y2S-c (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0040517512456758">Table 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0040517512456758">Figure 9</xref>), Y2S-a at the 50 MHz–1 GHz frequency range, Y2S-b at the 50 MHz–1 GHz frequency range and Y2S-c at the 60 MHz–1 GHz frequency range show SE above 20 dB for horizontal polarization, and SE values of Y2S-a, Y2S-b and Y2S-c fabrics are observed to vary depending on the loop length (stitch density) and wave frequency. The sample Y2S-a, which has the shortest loop length, shows higher SE compared to the other samples for all frequencies. As has already been indicated in previous studies,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0040517512456758">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0040517512456758">13</xref></sup> the increase in SE with decreasing loop length and hence increasing loop density is the result of the increase in stainless steel wire content per unit area of the samples. Regarding the decreasing tendency of SE of the same sample (when examining the samples individually) with the increasing frequency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0040517512456758">Figure 9</xref>), the frequency and wave length of the electromagnetic waves emitted with light speed (3 × 10<sup>8 </sup>m/s) in space are inversely proportional, and as the frequency increases the wave length decreases. Thus the SE value decreases for the same fabric sample because the porosity of the fabric samples becomes more important with the decreasing wave length.</p>
<p>For the samples having the same loop length but different knit structures, namely Y1S-a, Y2S-b and Y3S (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0040517512456758">Table 1</xref>), SE measurements of horizontal polarization show that the Y1S-a sample at the 90–800 MHz frequency range, the Y2S-b sample at the 90–300 MHz frequency range and the Y3S sample at the 70–800 MHz frequency range reach an SE value of 30 dB or more (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-0040517512456758">Figure 10</xref>), which are within normal shielding range. The highest SE values are measured as 45.35 dB at 263 MHz for sample Y1S-a, 37.36 dB for sample Y2S-b at 284 MHz and 49.94 dB for sample Y3S at 284 MHz. It is confirmed that the SE values of Y1S-a, Y2S-b and Y3S sample fabrics change between 20 and 50 dB depending on the fabric structure and the frequency of 0.03 to 1 GHz.</p>
<p>To explore the effects of the knit structure, samples Y1S-a, Y2S-b and Y3S were examined for SE performance at horizontal polarization by pairing the samples based on whether they are single- or double-needle bed structures.</p>
<p>When the SE performance of Y1S-a and Y3S samples are compared, both of them being single-bed structures, Y3S shows better SE performance even though the loop lengths and fabric weights are the same. This difference in SE values can be explained by the difference in fabric structures. As the knit structure of Y3S is “pique knit” (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0040517512456758">Figure 2</xref>), there is a course including tuck stitches for each course composed of only plain stitches, thus the plain stitch (of the previous course), which will be followed by a tuck stitch for the current course, will be elongated in comparison to the adjacent plain stitch of the current course. This means elongated loop arms for the plain stitch in addition to the existence of inclined loop arms of the tuck stitch, which will seem to be placed between the two neighboring plain stitches on the surface of the sample. So due to the tuck stitches and elongated plain stitches within the structure of Y3S, the fiber orientation in the walewise direction will likely to be higher, leading to more effective shielding at horizontal polarization.</p>
<p>When SE performance for horizontal polarization of Y1S-a and Y2S-b, having the same loop length, are examined with the aim of comparing single-bed and double-bed knitted structures, Y2S-b has less shielding performance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-0040517512456758">Figure 10</xref>), although the weight thus the amount of the conductive filler of Y2S-b is higher. Having double-knit structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0040517512456758">Figure 2</xref>), where each course is composed of both front and back loops, Y2S-b has more fibers in the cross-section, which means more conductive filler as well. However, the loops on the front and back sides of the fabrics are aligned so that the loop arm of the back loop is just behind the loop arm of the front loop, thus the loop arms of the back loops cannot be seen when examined from the front side of Y2S-b (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0040517512456758">Figure 3</xref>). The loop arms of the back loops, therefore, cannot contribute to the shielding performance of sample Y2S-b, which means only the loops on the front side can perform shielding; thus, while determining the fiber quantity aligned for shielding, the amount will be considered lower since only the fiber quantity on the front side of the fabric is effective. This results in Y2S-b having a lower fiber alignment regarding the SE at horizontal polarization when compared with the plain knit sample Y1S-a.</p>
<p>As a result, metal containing knitted fabrics developed in this study can be used in various fields as underwear, especially by pregnant women working in information technology departments or in offices, people using cardiac pacemakers, security personnel or military people who are exposed to high electromagnetic radiation because of their working environment. In addition, these fabrics can be used in the manufacture of composite separator panels for the construction of fully isolated offices and studios.</p>

<sec id="sec3-0040517512456758" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title>
<p>In this study, various weft-knitted fabrics having different knit parameters and structures were manufactured from siro-spun cotton and siro core-spun hybrid yarns on a circular knitting machine. The SE measurements of the fabrics were made using to the anechoic chamber method with horizontal and vertical polarization of the antennas with the aim of investigating the effects of the knit structure considering the anisotropy of the structures.</p>
<p>It can be concluded that such siro core-spun hybrid yarns containing stainless steel are effective for shielding purposes and that SE of knitted fabrics made of hybrid yarns depends not only on the amount of conductive filler but also the orientation of the conductive filler in relation to the direction of the electronic field. Thus it is possible to adjust SE of the knitted fabrics by designing the structure accordingly. For SE at various polarizations, single-needle bed knitted structures with high-stitch densities containing tuck and miss stitches and inlay yarns in different directions shall be preferred.</p>
<p>Future research to determine the porosity of different weft-knitted structures will provide more light on the effect of the conductive filler amount facing electromagnetic waves.</p>
