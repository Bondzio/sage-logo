<title>2012 John R. Hayes Award for Excellence in Research</title>
<p>Catherine Schryer, Ryerson University, Canada</p>
<p>Allan McDougall, University of West Ontario, Canada</p>
<p>Glendon R. Tait, Dalhousie University, Canada</p>
<p>Lorelei Lingard, University of Toronto, Canada</p>
<p>“Creating Discursive Order at the End of Life: The Role of Genres in Palliative Care Settings.” <italic>Written Communication, 29</italic>, 111-141.</p>
<p>The Awards Committee, consisting of Davida Charney (chair), Sarah McCarthey, Nancy Penrose, and Lynda Walsh, provided the following citation:<disp-quote>
<p>This year’s nominated articles extended our understanding of the cognitive processes underlying writing skills, the acquisition of discipline-specific argument strategies, and the co-construction of discourse in real-world settings. Their data sources ranged from keystrokes to extended genres. Like its fellow nominees, the winning article is exemplary in its grounding in previous research and rigorous in its application of its chosen methods but it stands out in its implications for practice and future research.</p>
<p>“Creating Discursive Order at the End of Life: The Role of Genres in Palliative Care Settings,” by Catherine Schryer, Allan McDougall, Glendon R. Tait, and Lorelei Lingard, studies an emerging genre in medical discourse in Canada, the patient legacy document which is co-created by a medical resident and a dying patient.</p>
<p>Previous research shows that the most common genres of medical discourse limit patient agency and frame death as a medical failure. In contrast, the patient legacy document increases a patient’s sense of dignity and purpose. In this study, Schryer et al. hypothesize that the therapeutic benefit of the document stems from the patient’s increased rhetorical agency as he or she reflects on and interprets their life experiences. The authors contrast this personal meaning-making with the other-centered discourse of related genres such as eulogies and medical intake interviews. Schryer et al. analyze the interview protocol itself as well as twelve cases. They pay close attention to linguistic features as they trace the discursive links by which rhetorical agency is created—for example, how the patients pick up on verb forms in the interview questions as they shape an interpretation of their own memories.</p>
<p>An important goal of writing research is to foster improved communication not only in schools and workplaces but also in the world. This study has the potential to improve doctor-patient communication on several levels. First, the research team, which included specialists in rhetoric and professional communication, linguistics, medical training, and psychiatry, has the ethos to disseminate the findings in real-world settings. Second, the quality of exposition of the article and the universality of its topic make this a study that will attract attention from a wider readership. Finally, the study has promising implications for future research exploring the effect of this kind of communication on the medical community itself. “The article stands as an eloquent example of how rhetorical genre studies can yield valuable academic insights while respecting the integrity of human expression.” Thank you for the opportunity to read again and to evaluate this fine set of articles.</p>
