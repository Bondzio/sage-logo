<abstract>
<p>Pyrocarbon arthroplasty of the proximal interphalangeal joint is a relatively new concept. Early studies have been encouraging, reporting improved pain and function, but a largely unchanged arc of motion. Subsidence of the implant is common, but how it relates to outcome has not been analyzed. This study was performed to review the results of 57 pyrocarbon proximal interphalangeal implanted joints. Results showed a statistically significant increase in the arc of motion, excellent pain relief, and improved function. Subsidence was observed on radiographs in 40% of joints, but no correlation was found compared with arc of motion or function. The incidence of complications is fairly high and usually related to the peri-articular soft tissues, but they are usually minor and do not require further treatment. From this review, we can recommend the use of this implant for treatment of arthritis of the proximal interphalangeal joint.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Arthritis of the proximal interphalangeal joint (PIPJ) can be a debilitating condition, resulting in pain, loss of range of motion, deformity, and restriction in activities of daily living. Osteoarthritis is the most common type of arthritis. It has been estimated that one-quarter of postmenopausal women will present with osteoarthritis of the hands. Mostly this involves the distal interphalangeal joint and basal joint of the thumb, but in 18% of patients the PIPJ is involved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1753193411434053">Swanson, 1972</xref>).</p>
<p>Following failed conservative management of a destructive arthropathy of the PIPJ, surgical options include arthrodesis or arthroplasty. Arthrodesis of the PIPJ results in substantial loss of function and is associated with limited patient acceptance. PIPJ arthroplasty was first introduced by Swanson in 1968 using silicone implants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1753193411434053">Swanson, 1968</xref>). Satisfactory results are obtained with these implants, although not without complications, which included implant fracture, subsidence, bone resorption, dislocation, silicone synovitis, heterotopic bone formation, and decreased range of movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1753193411434053">Koboyashi and Terrono, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1753193411434053">Merle et al., in press</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1753193411434053">Sierakowski et al., in press</xref>).</p>
<p>In the last four decades, there have been various modifications and designs to improve the implants, including the use of different materials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1753193411434053">Linscheid et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1753193411434053">Nicolle and Calnan, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1753193411434053">Uchiyama et al., 2000</xref>). There have been some significant failures, including the LPM (Leuwen, Poeschmann, Metal) ceramic-coated prosthesis and RM finger prosthesis made of polyetheretherketone (PEEK) and coated with titanium, which have both shown unacceptably high revision rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1753193411434053">Field, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1753193411434053">Middleton et al., 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>In 2000, a semi-constrained pyrocarbon implant was introduced in Europe. The Ascension PIP (Ascension Orthopedics, Inc., Austin, Texas) pyrocarbon total joint is a bicondylar, anatomically shaped, articulating implant that allows joint flexion and extension, while providing some restriction of adduction and abduction motion. It is a press-fit implant with no cement fixation. These implants are made of a graphite core coated with pyrocarbon. Pyrocarbon has a very similar elastic modulus compared with cortical bone (creating a favourable environment for load transfer) and a very low wear rate (much less than titanium or zirconia) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1753193411434053">Cook et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1753193411434053">1989</xref>). It is biologically inert, with high strength and low friction. The pyrocarbon coating is made by heating carbon gas to 1300°C. The inner graphite core is radiopaque and the outer pyrocarbon coating is radiolucent. In comparison to silicone implants, pyrocarbon finger joint implants offer biological compatibility, low wear rates, and durability, while providing pain relief and improving the arc of motion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1753193411434053">Cook et al., 1999</xref>). Pyrocarbon implants also have the potential for long-term survival, because it is a biologically inert polymer and has an elastic modulus better matched to bone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1753193411434053">Cook et al., 1999</xref>). Pyrocarbon implants have been shown to be well-suited for small joint replacement and used with success in the metacarpophalangeal joint (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1753193411434053">Beckenbaugh, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1753193411434053">Cook et al., 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>Relatively few studies of pyrocarbon PIPJ replacements have been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1753193411434053">Branam et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1753193411434053">Bravo et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1753193411434053">Chung et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1753193411434053">Stutz et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1753193411434053">Tuttle and Stern, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1753193411434053">Wijk et al., 2010</xref>). Most report favourable outcomes, but there are some studies with less than satisfactory results. Despite overall high patient satisfaction, failure to improve on preoperative range of motion and substantial complication rates continue to influence surgical indications.</p>
<p>This study was performed to assess the results of pyrocarbon PIPJ replacement in a cohort study.</p>

<title>Patients</title>
<p>We performed a retrospective review of 57 consecutive pyrocarbon PIPJ replacements performed in 46 patients between 2002 and 2011.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1753193411434053">
<title>Technique</title>
<p>All surgical procedures were performed by the two senior authors. Initially, the dorsal Chamay approach was used for the first four patients, but thereafter a modified central-slip splitting technique was adopted, which will now be outlined. A dorsal curvy linear skin incision is made and a midline split of the central slip performed. The central slip is split and sharply dissected off the middle phalanx. The collateral ligaments are preserved. The articular surfaces of the proximal and middle phalanx are broached. The middle phalanx is prepared with minimal bone resection and care is taken to preserve the dorsal lip. The prosthetic trials are inserted and the amount of tension is assessed. There should be no hyperextension at the joint. Before inserting the definitive implant, a suture is placed through a drill hole in the middle phalanx. The definitive implants are then inserted. The central slip is then reattached with the same suture threaded through the drill hole. Haemostasis is achieved and the skin is closed. A bulky dressing is applied with a dorsal slab. The metacarpophalangeal joints are held in 45° flexion and the interphalangeal joints in extension.</p>
<p>Postoperative rehabilitation was a team approach, involving the surgeon, occupational therapists, physiotherapists, wound care sister, and patient. Initially, when the dorsal Chamay approach was used, rehabilitation followed the guidelines stipulated by the manufacturers of the pyrocarbon implant. The rehabilitation regimen was altered as the surgical technique was changed to a modified central slip-splitting technique. The rehabilitation followed could be described as an early active protocol in view of the fact that it was slightly accelerated compared with the standard pyrocarbon arthroplasty protocol recommended by the manufacturers.</p>
<p>The plaster slab was removed at day four or five, postoperatively, and changed to a dorsal thermoplastic splint. This splint is hand-based and keeps the metacarpophalangeal joint in 70° flexion and the PIPJ in approximately 15° flexion to avoid the dreaded complication of hyperextension or swan neck deformity. The finger restraining straps were removed every 2 hours for active flexion exercises. The patient was encouraged to flex to a maximum of 45° in the first week and 60° in the second week. Unrestricted active flexion was allowed thereafter. No passive flexion was permitted for 4 weeks postoperatively. After 2 weeks, the splint was used only at night, for 2 hours in the morning, and for 2 hours in the afternoon. If the patient developed an extensor lag of more than 15°, a dynamic extensor splint was worn during the day for 2 weeks. This was then switched to a static extension splint at night. A pressure garment sleeve was fitted to the operated finger to ensure adequate control of oedema.</p>
<p>All patients were regularly reviewed by the surgeon and therapist, with weekly visits to 4 weeks, assessment and radiograph at 3, 6, and 12 months, and a minimum of 1 year follow-up.</p>
<p>The following data were recorded: indication for surgery; finger operated on; age and sex of patient; surgical approach; arc of motion using a standardized technique with a goniometer (preoperatively, at 6 months, and at final follow-up); satisfaction scores were recorded using a Likert scale (graded as unsatisfied/would not want same procedure again, less than expected/would consider procedure again, result as expected, better than expected result, fantastic result/happy to recommend procedure); complications; radiographs (postoperatively and at final follow-up looking specifically for fracture, alignment, subsidence — axial and/or angular, loosening); and need for secondary surgical intervention.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>There were 46 patients with a mean age of 61 (range 40–83) years that underwent 57 PIPJ replacements between 2002 and 2011. There were 10 men who had 11 PIPJ replacements and 36 women who had 46 PIPJ replacements. Mean follow-up was 27 (range 12–70) months. The middle finger was most commonly operated on, with 25 joint replacements, followed by the ring finger with 12, the index finger with 11, and the little finger with 9. Primary or post-traumatic osteoarthritis were the indications for surgery in 56 joints, with only one joint replacement done for rheumatoid arthritis.</p>

<title>Range of motion</title>
<p>The arcs of motion were recorded for each patient, and results calculated for the group of patients as a whole (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1753193411434053">Table 1</xref>). The increases in mean arc of motion and median arc of motion were extremely statistically significant (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001).</p>

<title>Pain relief</title>
<p>Pain relief was excellent. Patients were asked to grade their satisfaction on a Likert scale (see methods section above). The average score was 4.2 out of 5, which indicated high patient satisfaction. In 88% of cases, patients gave a score of 4 or 5 on the scale.</p>
<p>There was no difference in outcomes between the first four patients operated on using a Chamay approach and the rest of the patients using an extensor splitting approach.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1753193411434053">
<title>Radiological assessment</title>
<p>Pyrocarbon does not osseointegrate potentially leading to unstable fixation and may result in the migration of the implant within the medullary canal. This can be assessed by comparing immediate postoperative films with those at final follow-up.</p>
<p>There are three ways in which the components tend to migrate. Firstly, they can migrate in a longitudinal direction with no angular change. We have termed this <italic>axial subsidence</italic>. Secondly, migration can be in the varus/valgus or volar/dorsal direction, which we have termed <italic>angular subsidence</italic>. And, lastly, it can be a combination of both angular and axial subsidence.</p>
<p>We found that the proximal component subsided in 17 joints (30%). Six joints (11%) were angular only, eight joints (14%) were axial only, and three (5%) were a combination of axial and angular subsidence. The distal component demonstrated subsidence in six joints (11%), all in an axial direction only. No patient had distal component subsidence without concomitant subsidence of the proximal component. There was no migration of either component observed in 40 joints (70%). There was no correlation observed between subsidence and ROM.

<title>Complications</title>
<sec id="section11-1753193411434053">
<title>Stiffness</title>
<p>Six joints (11%) developed stiffness. If a patient lost flexion with a well-sited prosthesis and no obvious subsidence, then a dorsal release involving an extensor tenolysis and dorsal capsulotomy was performed to improve end-range flexion. This relatively simple procedure improved range of motion in all six joints by an average of 55°.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-1753193411434053">
<title>Swan neck deformity</title>
<p>Eleven joints (19%) developed swan neck deformity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1753193411434053">Figure 3</xref>), a troublesome condition where the patient struggles to initiate flexion from a slightly hyperextended position. Average arc of motion for these patients was 49°. Two of these deformities were mild, and the patients refused further surgery. Seven patients agreed to a flexor digitorum superficialis (FDS) tenodesis, which corrected the deformity and gave a pain-free average arc of motion of 64°. Two patients were considering a tenodesis at the time of print.</p>

<sec id="section13-1753193411434053">
<title>Boutonniere deformity</title>
<p>This deformity occurred in three joints (5%). Two patients developed this early postoperatively, but both resolved with appropriate splinting. One patient developed the boutonniere deformity after a fall and a release was performed. The patient then developed a swan neck deformity, which later required a FDS tenodesis. On final follow-up, the range of motion was 30–90°, and the patient was pain free and satisfied.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-1753193411434053">
<title>Fracture at insertion</title>
<p>This unfortunate complication occurred in two joints (3.5%). One patient had a coronal split of the proximal phalanx at the time of insertion. An attempt was made to stabilize this with a cerclage wire. Unfortunately, this failed and the prosthesis was revised to a silicone implant at 3 weeks. Another patient sustained a coronal split of the middle phalanx at the time of insertion. The fracture was deemed to be stable and treated conservatively. The fracture had united by the 6 week follow-up. The patient did well and had a pain free arc of motion of 45° at final follow-up.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-1753193411434053">
<title>Revision</title>
<p>Five joints (9%) required revision. One joint required revision for impending cut-out of the proximal component due to angular subsidence. The proximal component was revised to a larger pyrocarbon component. The patient did well and had a pain free arc of motion of 75° at final follow-up (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1753193411434053">Figure 4</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>Three joints (in two patients) required revision to silicone joints for unexplained pain with the pyrocarbon implant in situ. No evidence of sepsis was found pre- or intraoperatively. Both of patients were pain free with an excellent range of motion following the revision surgery.</p>
<p>One joint was revised to silicone due to fracture at insertion, which failed conservative treatment (discussed above).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section16-1753193411434053">
<title>Squeaking</title>
<p>This potentially annoying complication occurred in two joints (3.5%). Both cases were associated with swan neck deformities, but neither had component subsidence. Average arc of motion was 82.5°. The noise was not too bothersome to the patients. One patient had surgery to correct the swan neck deformity, which improved the arc of motion and the squeaking resolved. The other patient elected not to have any further surgery.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Since the introduction of PIPJ replacements by Swanson in 1968, silicone has been the predominant material used in these prostheses. Overall satisfactory results have been reported in the literature with this implant. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1753193411434053">Kobayashi and Terrono (2003)</xref> reported satisfactory long-term results using silicone prostheses. They did, however, find varying rates of bone resorption (up to 35%) and subsidence leading to a decreased arc of motion.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1753193411434053">Takigawa et al. (2004)</xref> retrospectively reviewed 70 silicone implants in 48 patients at a mean follow-up of 6.5 years. They reported similar results to Kobayashi, showing silicone arthroplasty to be effective in relieving pain, but did not improve range of motion or correct deformity. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1753193411434053">Lin et al. (1995)</xref> reported similar results. Silicone synovitis, instability, and implant longevity continue to be the major concerns with the use of these implants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1753193411434053">Merle et al., in press</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1753193411434053">Sierakowski et al., in press</xref>).</p>
<p>Pyrocarbon PIPJ arthroplasty is a relatively new idea, first becoming available in 2000. Since then, studies reviewing the use of this implant have shown encouraging results. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1753193411434053">Chung et al. (2009)</xref> reviewed 14 patients with 21 pyrocarbon implants at a 12 month follow-up. They found good pain relief in all patients. The mean arc of motion decreased slightly from the preoperative state (mean preoperative arc, 40°; mean postoperative arc, 38°). Complications included three joints that developed squeaking and three joints that dislocated.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1753193411434053">Tuttle and Stern (2006)</xref> reviewed 18 pyrocarbon implants in eight patients with a mean follow-up of 13 months.

(2005)</xref> reviewed 13 joints and found good pain relief in most patients.

<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1753193411434053">Bravo et al. (2007)</xref> retrospectively reviewed 50 joints in 35 patients at a mean follow-up 27 months.

They noted that radiological subsidence without apparent loosening occurred in 20 joints (40%).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1753193411434053">Wijk et al. (2010)</xref> reviewed their results of 53 pyrocarbon PIPJ replacements performed in 43 patients. All patients reported decreased pain. They found no improvement in range of motion and grip strength. One-third of patients reported a clinically significant improvement in occupational performance and satisfaction. A total of 13% of joints required a secondary surgical procedure.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1753193411434053">Branam et al. (2007)</xref> compared the outcomes of silicone PIPJ arthroplasties with pyrolytic carbon implants in patients with osteoarthritis in a retrospective review of 41 arthroplasties in 22 patients with severe PIPJ osteoarthritis performed by a single surgeon. There were 22 silicone joints and 19 pyrocarbon joints. Their results showed that silicone had a statistically higher number of coronal plane deformities and, as a result, satisfaction with appearance was better with the pyrocarbon group. Both groups had good pain relief. Arc of motion was not improved in either group.</p>
<p>Other studies have published poor results, including problematic bone fixation with pyrocarbon implants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1753193411434053">Herren et al., 2006</xref>). In this study, migration of the pyrocarbon prosthesis occurred in eight out of seventeen joints and radiolucent lines in a further three joints. Patients were evaluated at a mean of 20 months. Grip strength and range of motion outcomes were found to be less favourable for these patients, although it was not statistically significant.</p>
<p>All studies showed improvement in pain. With regard to improvement in range of motion, only one other study showed an improvement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1753193411434053">Stutz et al, 2005</xref>), but they did not say if it was statistically significant or not.</p>
<p>Because the margins of the implant are radiolucent, loosening should be assessed using serial radiographs demonstrating progressive periprosthetic lucency, rather than using a single radiograph (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1753193411434053">Bravo et al., 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Comparing our results to those in the reported literature, we found that some of our outcomes were comparable and some were conflicting.</p>
<p>Overall patient satisfaction in our study was good, as assessed using a Likert scale (average score 4.2 out of 5, indicating patients generally thought the result was better than expected or fantastic). Other studies in the literature that also used a scoring system had similar results to ours. Pain relief was excellent in our study. All other published reviews in the literature have also reported good pain relief.</p>
<p>Subsidence — either angular, axial or both — occurred in 30% of joints in our series. Similar results for subsidence were found in the literature. As discussed previously, these pyrocarbon implants cannot osseointegrate. As a result, a high proportion of these implants tend to migrate in the medullary canal, but they usually settle into a stable position and do not progress. In our series, only one patient developed severe subsidence and impending cut out, which required revision to a larger proximal component. All the other cases stabilized, and we found no correlation between subsidence and range of motion. The outcome of those joints that developed subsidence was similar to those joints that did not.</p>
<p>The ranges of motion in our study improved from a mean arc of 30° preoperatively to 66° postoperatively, an improvement of 120% calculated to be extremely statistically significant. This is in contrast with the results of most of the studies in the literature, in which the arc of motion was largely unchanged or if it did improve, it was not statistically significant. We postulate that our improvement in range of motion may be due to the accelerated active flexion protocol, which is facilitated by bony attachment of the extensor tendon to prevent extensor lag.</p>
<p>There are other surface replacement arthroplasty implants available for the PIPJ. Avanta SR PIP arthroplasty involves a proximal component, with a cobalt chrome alloy articulating surface, and a distal component, consisting of ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene. Both components have a textured titanium stem allowing for an uncemented press-fit fixation. Previous versions of this implant relied on cement fixation. A retrospective study that compared the long-term results of the use of the cemented and uncemented versions of this implant from a single surgeon’s experience found there was no difference in postoperative pain scores or postoperative arc of motion for the cemented versus uncemented group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1753193411434053">Johnstone et al., 2008</xref>). There were significantly more cases with radiologic evidence of loosening in the uncemented group. Revision rate was higher in the uncemented group (26%) compared with that of the cemented group (8%), but this difference was not statistically significant. An earlier study by the same surgeon that reviewed 20 joints in 13 patients using the cemented implant found all patients had excellent pain relief and no patients lost motion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1753193411434053">Johnstone, 2001</xref>). The author did note that results improved as experience was gained and a more intensive rehabilitation protocol was used. These results are similar to the results of studies of the pyrocarbon surface replacement implant, in that excellent pain relief is achieved, but range of motion is largely unchanged.</p>
<p>The main limitation of this study is the relatively short minimum follow-up period (1 year). While final follow-up was average of more than 2 years (27 months), it could be anticipated that those patients with only a 1 year follow-up might still show progressive radiological deterioration. Another potential limitation is that functional scores were not performed pre- or post-operatively. However, in a progressive polyarthritic condition such as osteoarthritis, we do not believe that functional scores offer meaningful interpretation, as improvement in a particular joint postoperatively may not reflect as an improvement in the functional score as disease in adjacent fingers may skew the result.</p>
<p>The results of our study suggest that pyrocarbon PIPJ replacement is a safe and effective treatment for arthritis of the PIPJ. Pain relief is excellent and arc of motion is increased by more than double that of the preoperative range of motion. The incidence of complications is fairly high, but most are minor and often do not need further treatment. The complications that require treatment often are relatively easy to manage and are usually associated with a successful outcome. Further research into the ideal surgical technique and improved implant materials will no doubt lead to improved outcomes. From the results we obtained using the pyrocarbon implant we can recommend its use for the treatment of osteoarthritis of the PIPJ.</p>
