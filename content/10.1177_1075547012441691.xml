<p>Given that trust plays a key role in the communication of scientific information about the environment to the public, this study examines what explains trust in specific sources of such information. In doing so, it analyzes whether—and, if so, how—political ideology, support for environmental regulation, religiosity, trust in people, and trust in government predict trust in scientists, the Environmental Protection Agency, environmental organizations, news media, and science media. It also examines whether trust in scientists is associated with trust in the other sources in light of how each of the latter draws on the credibility of the former.</p>

<p>In recent decades, environmental issues ranging from local wildlife habitat destruction to global climate change have risen to occupy prominent roles in public life. As concern about these issues has grown, so, too, has scientific research on the environment. The outcomes of such research can hold high epistemological status and carry important social consequences. As a case in point, U.S. regulatory bodies may require scientific proof of harm before implementing more stringent environmental policies. The results of environmental science also inform industry practices, environmental advocacy efforts, media coverage of environmental issues, and consumer choices. At the same time, environmental science is a contested terrain. Methodological and other technical limitations can render scientific proof of harm difficult to ascertain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1075547012441691">Brown, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1075547012441691">Ley, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1075547012441691">Tickner &amp; Raffensperger, 2001</xref>). Consequently, there is often a certain amount of “interpretive flexibility” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1075547012441691">Pinch &amp; Bijker, 1984</xref>, p. 409) regarding what types of scientific evidence matter, how much evidence is needed to determine whether an environmental problem exists, and how best to solve such problems. Moreover, the personal, professional, political, economic, and cultural stakes that various actors, groups, and institutions hold in particular knowledge outcomes can lead to the politicization of environmental science.</p>
<p>Given both the uncertainties involved in scientific research and the stakes involved in public decisions about the environment, it is not surprising that public debates about environmental issues often feature competing claims about scientific evidence. For example, a host of actors in the controversy surrounding global climate change have advanced conflicting arguments about “what the science shows” regarding the subject (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1075547012441691">Boykoff &amp; Boykoff, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1075547012441691">McCright &amp; Dunlap, 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1075547012441691">2003</xref>). Likewise, numerous players in the public debates about potential links between the environment and various forms of cancer have clashed over the scientific record (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1075547012441691">Ley, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1075547012441691">Lichter &amp; Rothman, 1999</xref>). The actors who participate in such debates include—but are by no means limited to—scientific researchers, governmental officials and agencies, and interest groups. Their claims about scientific evidence, in turn, may reach the broader public through not only newspapers and television news but also more specialized science-oriented media (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1075547012441691">Nelkin, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1075547012441691">Nisbet et al., 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>Within such contested terrain, trust can play a crucial role in the communication of scientific information about the environment to the public. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1075547012441691">Renn and Levine (1991)</xref> observe,
<disp-quote>
<p>In this situation all parties, particularly the . . . opposing camps rely on trust and credibility for their communication efforts to impress the audience or even to influence their attitudes . . . Credibility of information sources is, therefore . . . the major social resource that may determine which group or [faction] will finally shape social risk policies and enhance its social power. (p. 175)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This premise is supported by a sizable body of research indicating that people often use the credibility of the messenger as a heuristic, or information shortcut, for deciding whether to accept communicative messages (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1075547012441691">Eagly &amp; Chaiken, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1075547012441691">Petty &amp; Cacioppo, 1986</xref>). For example, the individual-level impact of information about climate change on concern about the issue can depend on the extent to which citizens trust what scientists say about the environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1075547012441691">Malka, Krosnick, &amp; Langer, 2009</xref>). Thus, it is important to understand the nature and foundations of public trust in different actors as sources of scientific information about the environment. To date, however, there has been little research on the subject (for two exceptions, discussed below, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1075547012441691">Bickerstaff, Lorenzoni, Pidgeon, Poortinga, &amp; Simmons, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1075547012441691">Nisbet &amp; Myers, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>With this in mind, the present study uses original survey data collected in the Milwaukee metropolitan area (a midsized U.S. city selected for reasons of convenience) to examine not only how much citizens trust a range of sources of scientific information about the environment but also what explains individual-level variation in such trust. Some of the sources in question are types of actors that often play key roles in scientific controversies involving the environment: university scientists, government agencies (here, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency [EPA]), and environmental organizations. Others are types of news media that often serve as sources of scientific information for many members of the public: newspapers and television news (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1075547012441691">Nelkin, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1075547012441691">Nisbet et al., 2002</xref>). Still others are types of media that focus on science and reach sizable audiences: science television channels and programs such as the Discovery Channel and <italic>Nova</italic>, science magazines such as <italic>Scientific American</italic> and <italic>Popular Science</italic>, and science websites such as <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://Discover.com">Discover.com</ext-link> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ScienceDaily.com">ScienceDaily.com</ext-link> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1075547012441691">Pew Research Center for the People and the Press, 2009</xref>). In analyzing trust in these sources, the following account looks at a range of potential explanatory factors, including political values (specifically, ideology and support for environmental regulations), religiosity, trust in people, trust in government, and demographics. It also considers potential relationships between trust in scientists and trust in the other sources of interest, given how the latter draw on the credibility of the former to bolster their own credibility.</p>

<title>A Framework for Studying Trust in Sources of Information About the Environment</title>
<p>In broadest terms, trust can be defined as a “willingness, in expectation of beneficial outcomes, to make oneself vulnerable to another based on a judgment of similarity of intentions or values” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1075547012441691">Earle, Siegrist, &amp; Gutscher, 2010</xref>, p. 4). Put another way, trust is a “standing decision” to give someone else “the benefit of the doubt” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1075547012441691">Rahn &amp; Transue, 1998</xref>, p. 543). Such standing decisions can provide citizens—who often know little about the science related to specific environmental issues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1075547012441691">Bord, O’Connor, &amp; Fisher, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1075547012441691">Bostrom, Morgan, Fischhoff, &amp; Read, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1075547012441691">Shwom, Dan, &amp; Dietz, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1075547012441691">Smith, 2002</xref>)—with heuristics for evaluating conflicting scientific claims about the environment. By helping alleviate uncertainty, trust “makes information processing more efficient” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1075547012441691">C. Lee, Scheufele, &amp; Lewenstein, 2005</xref>, p. 246) and reduces the cognitive complexity of “complicated risks that are difficult to evaluate” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1075547012441691">Priest, Bonfadelli, &amp; Rusanen, 2003</xref>, p. 753). Indeed, research shows that trust can shape public perceptions regarding numerous scientific issues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1075547012441691">Besley &amp; Shanahan, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1075547012441691">Brossard &amp; Shanahan, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1075547012441691">Cobb &amp; Macoubrie, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1075547012441691">Gutteling, Hanssen, van der Veer, &amp; Seydel, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1075547012441691">Liu &amp; Priest, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1075547012441691">Priest, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1075547012441691">Priest et al., 2003</xref>) as well as public opinion about an array of environmental issues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1075547012441691">Bord &amp; O’Connor, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1075547012441691">Kellstedt, Zahran, &amp; Vedlitz, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1075547012441691">Malka et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1075547012441691">O’Connor, Bord, Fisher, Staneva, et al., 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>Findings that trust can carry important consequences for perceptions of science and the environment raise the question of what explains trust itself. In answering this question, however, one must take into account the multifaceted nature of the concept. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1075547012441691">C. Lee et al. (2005</xref>, p. 246) warn against treating “trust as a generic construct” in light of evidence that trust in different sorts of actors “can have different influences on perceptions of science and technology.” Furthermore, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1075547012441691">Liu and Priest (2009)</xref> argue that the effects of trust may vary from one area of science and technology to another. They write,
<disp-quote>
<p>We believe trust should be further differentiated since each area of science and technology might trigger completely different concerns. For example, [genetically modified] foods might raise public health concerns, nanotechnology might make people worry about privacy, and stem cell research involves specific moral concerns. (p. 709)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Building on the notion that different forms of trust can exert differential effects, the following account seeks to explain trust in a range of specific actors. Building on the notion that the effects of trust may be domain specific, the present study also seeks to explain the extent to which people trust these actors within a particular context: that is, as sources of scientific information about the environment.</p>
<p>Accordingly, the following account focuses on what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1075547012441691">Renn and Levine (1991</xref>, p. 179) call <italic>trust in communication</italic>, which they define as “the generalized expectancy that a message received is true and reliable and that the communicator demonstrates competence and honesty by conveying accurate, objective, and complete information.” A small body of previous research has examined the extent to which citizens place such trust in certain sources of information about the environment, including scientists, government actors, and advocacy groups. Of particular note, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1075547012441691">Bickerstaff et al. (2008)</xref> draw on a 2002 survey to examine the extent to which British citizens trusted a number of actors to “tell the truth” about two environmental issues: climate change and radioactive waste. They found that university scientists and environmental organizations ranked among the most trusted sources for both issues, whereas government sources ranked lower. In addition, two surveys—one conducted in 2006 and the other in 2007—assessed the extent to which U.S. citizens trusted “the things that scientists say about the environment” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1075547012441691">Nisbet &amp; Myers, 2007</xref>). In each survey, around a third (32%) of the respondents said “completely” or “a lot,” whereas a plurality said “a moderate amount” (41% in 2006 and 43% in 2007), and the remainder said “a little” or “not at all.” Thus far, however, we know less about public trust in other sources of information about the environment, particularly the sorts of mass media sources that play critical roles in disseminating such information to the broader public. Furthermore, we know relatively little about what explains trust in different sources of information about environmental science.</p>
<p>The present study’s approach to the latter problem is guided in part by the premise that trust reflects “a judgment of similarity of intentions or values” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1075547012441691">Earle et al., 2010</xref>, p. 4). Thus, the following account examines the extent to which key values predict trust in specific sources of scientific information about the environment. In doing so, it focuses on values linked to major fault lines in the broader cultural landscape that surrounds controversies involving environmental science. These fault lines reflect a set of clashes among political, religious, and scientific perspectives that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1075547012441691">Nisbet (2005)</xref> collectively refers to as a “competition for worldviews” (p. 90; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1075547012441691">Nisbet &amp; Goidel, 2007</xref>). The study’s research questions, which revolve around the extent to which particular factors predict trust in each of the sources of interest, begin with the roles that two political values—ideology and general support for environmental regulation—may play:</p>

<list-item><p><italic>Research Question 1b</italic>: To what extent does general support for environmental regulation predict trust in each of the sources of interest?</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>With regard to the former, previous research demonstrates that ideology, defined as placement on a liberal-conservative continuum, can influence perceptions of science (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1075547012441691">Besley &amp; Shanahan, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1075547012441691">Ho, Brossard, &amp; Scheufele, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1075547012441691">Nisbet, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1075547012441691">Nisbet &amp; Goidel, 2007</xref>), environmental issues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1075547012441691">Kellstedt et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1075547012441691">Smith, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1075547012441691">Van Liere &amp; Dunlap, 1980</xref>), and news media (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1075547012441691">Jones, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1075547012441691">T. Lee, 2005</xref>). Thus, it seems plausible that this political value would predict trust in some or all of sources in question. Similarly, findings that general environmental beliefs shape public opinion about a range of specific environmental issues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1075547012441691">Bord et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1075547012441691">Dunlap, Van Liere, Mertig, &amp; Jones, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1075547012441691">Kellstedt et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1075547012441691">O’Connor, Bord, &amp; Fisher, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1075547012441691">Shwom et al., 2008</xref>) suggest that support for environmental regulation may predict trust in the sources of interest. This seems particularly likely in the cases of the EPA, which is the primary U.S. government agency responsible for generating and enforcing environmental regulations, and environmental activist groups, which typically advocate for more stringent environmental laws and regulations.</p>
<p>Citizens’ religious values could provide them with additional bases for evaluating sources of scientific information about the environment. To capture this phenomenon, the present study focuses on attendance at religious services as a potential explanatory factor:</p>
<list id="list2-1075547012441691" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><italic>Research Question 2</italic>: To what extent does attendance at religious services predict trust in each of the sources of interest?</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Research shows that members of the public who frequently attend religious services are particularly likely to be exposed to cues from religious leaders and to religion-based political discussions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1075547012441691">Scheufele, Nisbet, &amp; Brossard, 2003</xref>). Furthermore, the frequency of attendance at religious services can influence perceptions of science (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1075547012441691">Liu &amp; Priest, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1075547012441691">Nisbet, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1075547012441691">Nisbet &amp; Goidel, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1075547012441691">Stewart, Dickerson, &amp; Hotchkiss, 2009</xref>). Thus, such attendance may shape trust in sources of scientific information about the environment. In particular, the potential for conflict between religious and scientific worldviews (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1075547012441691">Gaskell et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1075547012441691">Nisbet, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1075547012441691">Nisbet &amp; Goidel, 2007</xref>) suggests the possibility of a negative relationship between attendance at religious services and trust in scientists as sources of information about the environment.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1075547012441691">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>The present study’s analysis also builds on the premise that citizens can derive their decisions regarding whether to trust specific actors in part from more general forms of trust. Here, it focuses on two forms of generalized trust: trust in people and trust in government. The former is a generalized “faith in others” or “belief that ‘most people can be trusted’” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1075547012441691">Uslaner, 2002</xref>, p. 3), whereas the latter is a belief that government typically acts with “efficiency, honesty, competence, and equity” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1075547012441691">Miller, Goldenberg, &amp; Erbring, 1979</xref>, p. 67).</p>

<list-item><p><italic>Research Question 3b</italic>: To what extent does trust in government predict trust in each of the sources of interest?</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Previous research indicates that generalized trust in people can serve as a basis for deciding whether to trust particular actors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1075547012441691">Rahn &amp; Transue, 1998</xref>), including government actors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1075547012441691">Brehm &amp; Rahn, 1997</xref>) and news media (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1075547012441691">Bennett, Rhine, &amp; Flickinger, 2001</xref>). Similarly, trust in government has been found to shape evaluations of specific government officials and bodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1075547012441691">Chanley, Rudolph, &amp; Rahn, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1075547012441691">Hetherington, 1998</xref>) as well as news media (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1075547012441691">Bennett, Rhine, Flickinger, &amp; Bennett, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1075547012441691">Cappella &amp; Jamieson, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1075547012441691">Jones, 2004</xref>). Thus, it is plausible that each form of trust could influence trust in specific sources of scientific information about the environment. Most obviously, one would expect citizens who trust government to be particularly likely to trust the EPA as a source of such information. Given that environmental activist groups such as the Sierra Club and the Environment Defense Fund typically advocate for more government action to protect the environment, it also seems likely that trust in government would predict trust in these groups as sources of scientific information about the environment.</p>
<p>Although general forms of trust may shape more specific forms of trust, another possibility is that trust in one specific source will “spill over” to trust in other specific sources. In exploring this possibility, the present study focuses on the potential associations between trust in scientists and trust in other sources of information.</p>

<p>The other sources under study rely substantially on the credibility of scientists in constructing their own credibility. For example, the EPA has historically drawn on its Scientific Advisory Council and other scientific advisory groups to bolster the scientific credibility of its regulatory decisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1075547012441691">Jasanoff, 1994</xref>). Likewise, environmental activist groups have worked to enhance their scientific credibility by forging connections to researchers as well as by developing their own in-house scientific expertise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1075547012441691">Ley, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1075547012441691">Lichter &amp; Rothman, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1075547012441691">Nelkin, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1075547012441691">Nisbet &amp; Lewenstein, 2002</xref>). The same is true of both types of media. News media such as newspapers and television news often rely on scientists as sources in covering scientific controversies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1075547012441691">Nelkin, 1995</xref>), including controversies involving science and the environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1075547012441691">Mazur &amp; Lee, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1075547012441691">Salomone, Greenberg, Sandman, &amp; Sachsman, 1990</xref>). For their part, science media—including science television, science magazines, and science websites—typically rely on the authority of the scientific community in presenting information to their audiences; in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1075547012441691">Hornig’s (1990)</xref> words, such media are “not just about science but about scientists” (p. 16). Given all of this, the present study tests the following specific hypotheses:</p>

<p>Although the account presented here emphasizes the potential for trust in scientists to spill over to trust in the other sources, the former could also partly reflect the latter—a point that the conclusion revisits in interpreting the results regarding these hypotheses.</p>

<title>Data</title>
<p>The data for this study came from a telephone survey of the adult population in the four-county Milwaukee metropolitan area. The survey was conducted from November 11, 2009, to March 29, 2010, by the Institute for Survey and Policy Research at the University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee. The 851 respondents were selected through random digit dialing. The response rate was 22% (calculated using the American Association for Public Opinion Research’s RR1 [response rate formula 1]). To be sure, the nature of the sample and the response rate raise concerns regarding the extent to which the results can be generalized to the U.S. population (let alone other national populations). Having said this, the present study focuses not on the absolute levels of trust in the sources of interest but on the extent to which other key variables predict trust in each source.</p>
<sec id="section3-1075547012441691">
<title>Measuring Trust in Sources of Scientific Information About the Environment</title>
<p>There is considerable—and varied—discussion in the literature regarding the dimensionality of trust (see, e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1075547012441691">Earle et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1075547012441691">Poortinga &amp; Pidgeon, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1075547012441691">Renn &amp; Levine, 1991</xref>). For example, Renn and Levine’s definition of trust in communication highlights both the competence and the honesty of the communicator. On the other hand, previous research on trust in communication in the context of environmental issues has relied on single-question (and, thus, unidimensional) measures of trust in particular actors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1075547012441691">Nisbet &amp; Myers, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1075547012441691">Bickerstaff et al., 2008</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1075547012441691">2</xref></sup> While acknowledging the potential multidimensionality of trust suggested by the former body of research, the present study follows the measurement strategy used in the latter body of research. Specifically, it relies on a series of single-item indicators to capture the levels of trust in eight sources of scientific information about the environment: “university scientists,” “the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency,” “environmental organizations such as the Sierra Club and the Environmental Defense Fund,” “the local daily newspaper,” “television news,” “television programs or channels about science like <italic>Nova</italic> and the Discovery Channel,” “science magazines like <italic>Popular Science</italic> and <italic>Scientific American</italic>,” and “science websites and blogs like <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://Discover.com">Discover.com</ext-link> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ScienceDaily.com">ScienceDaily.com</ext-link>.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1075547012441691">3</xref></sup> The following statement preceded the series:

<title>Measuring the Other Key Variables</title>
<p>Additional questions captured the other variables of interest. Political ideology was assessed by a standard measure that included seven categories (coded to range from 0 for <italic>extremely liberal</italic> to 6 for <italic>extremely conservative; M</italic> = 3.30, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.42). Attitudes about environmental regulation were captured by an item that asked respondents whether they favored or opposed “stricter laws and regulations to protect the environment” (coded to range from 0 for <italic>strongly oppose</italic> to 3 for <italic>strongly favor; M</italic> = 1.69, <italic>SD</italic> = 0.59).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1075547012441691">4</xref></sup> Trust in people was captured by a standard item that asked, “Generally speaking, would you say that most people can be trusted, or that you can’t be too careful in dealing with people?” The former response option was coded as 1 and the latter as 0 (<italic>M</italic> = 0.55, <italic>SD</italic> = 0.50). Similarly, trust in government was assessed by a standard item that asked, “How much of the time do you think you can trust the government in Washington to do what is right?” Response options here included <italic>just about always, most of the time</italic>, or <italic>only some of the time</italic> (coded as 2, 1, and 0, respectively; <italic>M</italic> = 0.27, <italic>SD</italic> = 0.48). Attendance at religious services was captured by yet another standard measure, this one including six response categories (coded to range from 0 for <italic>never</italic> to 5 for <italic>more than once a week; M</italic> = 3.03, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.38). The demographic measures included education (a 7-category measure coded to range from 0 to 6; <italic>M</italic> = 3.86, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.54), income (a 10-category measure coded to range from 0 to 9; <italic>M</italic> = 4.87, <italic>SD</italic> = 2.97), and age (in years; median age = 55), as well as sex (coded as 0 if <italic>male</italic> and 1 if <italic>female</italic>; 41% and 59%, respectively) and self-identification as African American (coded as 0 if <italic>no</italic> and 1 if <italic>yes</italic>; 85% and 15%, respectively).</p>

<p>The analyses focused on what predicted trust in these sources. Given that trust in newspapers was strongly correlated with trust in television news (<italic>r</italic> = .51, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01), the two forms of trust were averaged to create an additive index (<italic>M</italic> = 1.67, <italic>SD</italic> = 0.91). Similarly, the measures for trust in science television, science magazines, and science websites were averaged to create another additive index (α = .71; <italic>M</italic> = 2.35, <italic>SD</italic> = 0.76). Thus, the analyses incorporated five dependent variables: trust in scientists, trust in the EPA, trust in environmental organizations, trust in news media, and trust in science media. For each dependent variable, an ordinary least squares hierarchical regression analysis was conducted in which the first block of variables included the demographics (sex, age, education, income, and self-identification as African American) and the second included political ideology, support for stricter environmental laws, trust in people, trust in government, and attendance at religious services. For each of the sources other than scientists, a third block included trust in scientists. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1075547012441691">Table 2</xref> presents the results.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-1075547012441691">8</xref></sup></p>

<p>Mixed findings emerged regarding the roles that political ideology (Research Question 1a), support for stricter environmental regulations (Research Question 1b), and attendance at religious services (Research Question 2) played in predicting trust in the sources of interest. Ideology predicted trust in scientists (β = −.17; <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01) and environmental organizations (β = −.23; <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01) as sources of scientific information about the environment, with conservatives expressing less trust in scientists than did liberals; on the other hand, this value was not significantly related to trust in the EPA, news media, or science media. In contrast, support for stricter environmental laws and regulations predicted four of the five dependent variables, including not only trust in the EPA (β = .18; <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01) and environmental organizations (β = .18; <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01) but also trust in scientists (β = .27; <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01) and news media (β = .14; <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01). The one exception here was trust in science media. Attendance at religious services was negatively related to trust in scientists (β = −.09; <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05) but not significantly related to trust in any of the other sources.</p>
<p>One of the two forms of generalized trust, trust in people, was not significantly related to trust in any of the sources of interest (Research Question 3a). The other, generalized trust in government, predicted two of the five dependent variables (Research Question 3b). Not surprisingly, respondents who reported higher levels of trust in government were particularly likely to trust both the EPA (β = .12; <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01) and environmental organizations (β = .09; <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05) as sources of scientific information about the environment. Trust in government was not significantly related to trust in scientists, nor was it significantly related to trust in news media or trust in science media.</p>
<p>Turning to the study’s hypotheses, the results revealed significant and positive relationships between trust in scientists and trust in each of the other sources (Research Question 4). Compared to respondents who distrusted scientists, those who trusted scientists reported greater trust in the EPA (β = .41; <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01), environmental organizations (β = .43; <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01), news media (β = .23; <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01), and science media (β = .56; <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01) as sources of scientific information about the environment. Thus, the analysis yielded support for each of the hypotheses here (Hypotheses 1-4). Furthermore, trust in scientists played a substantively large role in predicting trust in three dependent variables: By itself, it explained 13% of the variance in trust in the EPA, 14% of the variance in trust in environmental organization, and fully 25% of the variance in trust in science media. In contrast, trust in scientists only explained 4% of the variance in trust in news media.</p>
<p>Finally, the results pointed to a variety of demographic divides in trust (Research Question 5). Compared to men, women expressed greater trust in the EPA (β = .13; <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05) and news media (β = .11; <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01) as sources of scientific information about the environment. Older respondents reported particularly low levels of trust in scientists (β = −.13; <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01). Education was negatively related to trust in news media (β = −.13; <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01), whereas income was negatively related to trust in environmental organizations (β = −.11; <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01), news media (β = −.10; <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05), and science media (β = −.11; <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05). Compared to other respondents, African American respondents expressed lower trust in university scientists (β = −.14; <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01) but greater trust in television news (β = .13; <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01).</p>
<p>Taken as a whole, the independent variables included in the analyses explained a substantial proportion of the variance for each aspect of trust. Specifically, they explained 20% of the variance in trust in scientists, 34% of the variance in trust in the EPA, 51% of the variance in trust in environmental organizations, 20% of the variance in trust in news media, and 32% of the variance in trust in science media.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The simplest finding to emerge from the survey data is that respondents trusted some sources of scientific information about the environment considerably more than they trusted other sources. At one end of the spectrum, the news media sources—newspapers and television news—stood out for the low levels of trust that they evoked among respondents. This result suggests that efforts by such news media to inform citizens about the science surrounding environmental issues may face a credibility gap. By contrast, respondents reported relatively high levels of trust in science magazines, science websites, and, most of all, science television. This public vote of confidence suggests that science media could serve as powerful outlets for communicating scientific claims about the environment to the public, particularly given that such media also reach sizable audiences. Indeed, a recent national survey conducted by the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1075547012441691">Pew Research Center (2009)</xref> found that 13% of respondents regularly used “science websites and blogs like <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://Discover.com">Discover.com</ext-link> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ScienceDaily.com">ScienceDaily.com</ext-link>,” 20% regularly used “science magazines like <italic>Popular Science</italic> and <italic>Scientific American</italic>,” and fully 67% regularly used “television programs or channels about science like <italic>Nova</italic> and the Discovery Channel.”</p>
<p>Another—and deeper—contribution of the present study is a better theoretical understanding of what explains trust in communication, particularly in the context of environmental science. Taken together, the results illuminate the structure underlying trust in specific information sources in a specific scientific domain. In part, the findings suggest that such trust can reflect political and religious values. Political ideology and religiosity predicted trust in scientists, and the former predicted trust in environmental organizations as well; meanwhile, general support for environmental regulation predicted trust in four of the five sources (all sources except science media). In this regard, the results are consistent with the premise that trust reflects judgments of similarity in values (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1075547012441691">Earle et al., 2010</xref>). The same results also offer new evidence of how the popular dissemination of scientific information can become entangled in broader political and religious clashes within society (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1075547012441691">Gaskell et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1075547012441691">Nisbet, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1075547012441691">Nisbet &amp; Goidel, 2007</xref>). To the extent that citizens use their levels of trust in sources of scientific information about the environment to evaluate claims in public debate, the relationships observed here between values and trust may not only reflect but also reinforce wider patterns of political and religious polarization surrounding environmental issues.</p>
<p>The results yielded no evidence that trust in the sources under study reflected generalized trust in people. On the other hand, the findings suggest that trust in some sources of scientific information about the environment—specifically, the EPA and environmental activist organizations—can reflect another generalized form of trust: namely, trust in government. Thus, the results reinforce and extend previous arguments that this aspect of trust can shape opinion about specific political actors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1075547012441691">Chanley et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1075547012441691">Hetherington, 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1075547012441691">2005</xref>). Given that few respondents trusted government (fully 73% said that they never trusted the government in Washington to do what is right), the pattern of results here also suggests that declining generalized trust in government may damage the credibility of some particular providers of information regarding environmental science. At the same time, the other sources—university scientists, news media, and science media—may have received a credibility boost, at least in relative terms, when respondents did not connect them to government.</p>
<p>Of particular interest in light of the study’s hypotheses, the results point to positive associations between trust in scientists and trust in the other sources of interest. One could interpret these relationships as evidence that trust in scientists can “spill over” to these other sources. Such an interpretation is plausible given how government agencies, environmental advocacy organizations, news media, and science media all draw on the credibility of scientists to construct their own credibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1075547012441691">Hornig, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1075547012441691">Jasanoff, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1075547012441691">Ley, 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1075547012441691">Lichter &amp; Rothman, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1075547012441691">Nelkin, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1075547012441691">Nisbet &amp; Lewenstein, 2002</xref>). Having said this, it is also possible that the former may help to construct the credibility of the latter. For example, news coverage of science may contribute to a scientific “mystique” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1075547012441691">Nelkin, 1995</xref>, p. 14). Likewise, science media may help construct an image of scientists as “reason and authority personified” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1075547012441691">Horning, 1990</xref>, p. 22). Thus, one should interpret these relationships with caution. If trust in scientists does help foster trust in the other sources, however, this might help explain the differing levels of trust across sources. Given the high aggregate level of trust in scientists, strong and positive associations to trust in scientists would have served to boost the aggregate levels of trust in the EPA, environmental organizations, and—most of all—science media (for which the strongest association was observed). By the same token, the relatively weak (though positive) association between trust in scientists and trust in news media could help account for the comparatively low level of trust in the latter.</p>
<p>As for the results regarding the demographic variables, they reinforce and extend previous findings that such factors can shape perceptions of science, the environment, and institutions. For example, the “gender gap” in trusting the EPA as a source of scientific information about the environment fits with existing evidence of broader divides between men and women on environmental matters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1075547012441691">Davidson &amp; Freudenberg, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1075547012441691">Flynn, Slovic, &amp; Mertz, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1075547012441691">Steel, Warner, &amp; Lach, 2010</xref>). Similarly, the finding that African Americans were particularly distrusting of university scientists parallels previous findings of racial divides regarding trust in scientific research and researchers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1075547012441691">Corbie-Smith, Thomas, &amp; St. George, 2002</xref>)—divides that may partly reflect the historical legacy of scientists exploiting African American research participants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1075547012441691">Freimuth et al., 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>To be sure, the analyses presented here are limited in ways that should temper any conclusions drawn from the results. One limitation revolves around the use of cross-sectional survey data, which constrains the extent to which one can draw causal inferences from the relationships observed. The second limitation revolves around the use of single-item indicators for key variables in the analyses. To the extent that these measures included random error, the analyses may have underestimated the relationships among the variables of interest; to the extent that they failed to capture the potentially multidimensional nature of trust, they may also provide an incomplete picture of what explains trust. The third limitation revolves around the nature of the sample, which came from a single metropolitan area in the United States. There is no obvious basis for speculating that this sample is unrepresentative of the U.S. public in ways that would alter the key findings, but the results may not generalize as well to publics in other nations. The fourth limitation revolves around the variance explained by the models, which was sizable for each dependent variable but nonetheless left room for additional potential explanatory factors. Future research could address these limitations through the use of panel data to allow for stronger causal inferences, the use of multiple indicators to increase reliability and validity in measuring the key variables, the use of additional surveys to test the extent to which the findings generalize to other publics, and the inclusion of additional potential predictors of trust (e.g., general and domain-specific scientific knowledge as well as more nuanced measures of religiosity and religious beliefs).</p>
<p>Looking beyond the scope of the present study, future studies could examine in greater depth how citizens decide whether to trust particular sources of scientific information about the environment. For example, such research could explore the potential for values to exert indirect effects on trust in these sources by shaping intermediate beliefs (see, e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1075547012441691">Brossard &amp; Nisbet, 2007</xref>), as well as the potential for values and knowledge to interact in shaping such trust (see, e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1075547012441691">Ho et al., 2008</xref>). Research along these lines could not only use the survey approach applied here but could also draw on qualitative methods such as in-depth interviews and focus groups to develop a more nuanced understanding of how citizens think about sources of scientific information about the environment. Furthermore, research could assess the consequences of trust in specific sources of scientific information about the environment. Although several strands of literature provide strong rationales for expecting citizens to evaluate messages about environmental science on the basis of communicator credibility, experimentation would be useful for testing the extent to which and conditions under which members of the public do so. Finally, future studies could extend the present study’s approach to other domains of science. In particular, such studies could build on the argument that the <italic>effects</italic> of trust in different information sources can vary across scientific contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1075547012441691">Liu &amp; Priest, 2009</xref>) by testing whether the <italic>underlying structure</italic> of trust in these sources varies across scientific contexts as well.</p>
