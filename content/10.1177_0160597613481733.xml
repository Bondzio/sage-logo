<p>In this hour-long investigation, Dan Rather explores the experiences of women coerced into relinquishing their newborn babies for adoption in the period between the end of World War II and 1972, the year before the Supreme Court decided <italic>Roe v. Wade. </italic>During this so-called Baby Scoop era, nearly 2 million women surrendered their infants for adoption; 8.7 percent of all never-married women placed babies for adoption, with the number soaring to 19 percent when considering only white women. Today, by contrast, only 1 percent of unmarried women place babies for adoption. In 1970, over 175,000 infants per year were placed through adoption. Presently, the average annual figure is approximately 14,000.</p>
<p>Primarily through interviews with historian Rickie Solinger and Ann Fessler, who have authored feminist, groundbreaking works on adoptions during this era, “Adopted or Abducted?” offers a cogent analysis of the reasons for these relatively high adoption rates among white women. Changing sexual mores, limited access to contraception and abortion, and intense stigma associated with unwed motherhood all contributed to an environment in which young, unmarried, white women were discouraged from parenting.</p>
<p>More pernicious—and Rather’s focus in the show—are the social workers, nuns, adoption agencies, hospital staff, clergy, and parents who pressured women into surrendering their new babies, sometimes engaging in outright fraud and manipulation. Rather is willing to name names, too; Catholic Charities comes in for particularly strong critique. In one heart-rending account after another, women now in their 50s and 60s tell of being pregnant teenagers who were dumped into inaptly named “maternity homes” staffed by uncaring nuns who abandoned them during their labor and delivery. “We were treated like cattle,” one woman says, pushed, prodded, and herded while the adoption bureaucracy “waited for their product.” When these homes were too crowded or out of the financial reach of young women’s families, they were delivered to work in the homes of wealthy, predominantly Catholic families, as sub-minimum wage household servants; forced, in one instance, to serve mixed drinks to guests at parties. Routinely, young pregnant women received “counseling” that consisted only of lectures about the need not to stand in the way of waiting, married couples who would provide a proper home for the young women’s children. One woman describes the futility of her resistance, of the social worker who grabbed her hand and forced her to sign the relinquishment papers. The show even travels to Australia to film legislative hearings on similar coercive adoption practices that occurred there. Political pressure is now being brought to bear to obtain apologies, and even reparations, for the victims (defined as the women as well as the adoptees).</p>
<p>“Adopted or Abducted?” also includes extensive interviews with two people who have worked in the adoption industry. “Mary” is a woman who was employed by various agencies during the Baby Scoop era. Her role in Rather’s investigation is to provide expert testimony, being queried by Rather as he tests the women’s claims. Mary validates everything: the abuse, exploitation, lying, and fraud. We never learn her last name, or the agencies for which she worked. The reasons for her requested anonymity are not explained. However, given her disclosures, the viewer assumes she fears censure from the agencies, or even criminal prosecution.</p>
<p>Rather’s investigation also includes interviews with Troy Dunn, a professional “locator” paid to search for adoptees and birth parents (and who stars in a show on WE TV called The Locator). Dunn reunites Carla, the show’s emotional focal point, with the daughter she was forced to relinquish over 40 years ago. Dunn is condescending throughout; he refers to the now-middle aged women as “girls.” We watch him patronizingly warn Carla that, just as a space shuttle cannot enter the earth’s atmosphere too quickly without burning up, she should “go slowly” as she gets to know her daughter. Dunn does not appear to have any counseling qualifications. Several blogs maintained by adult adoptees and other critics of the contemporary adoption industry question Dunn’s methods (How does he verify when he has found a match? Does he use DNA information or simply process of elimination?) and presumed expertise. “Adopted or Abducted?”, while helpfully bringing to light the coercive and unprofessional “counseling” offered by social workers during the Baby Scoop era, neglects to provide a needed critical perspective of Dunn.</p>
<p>But the show’s principal flaw is its pretention toward universality when in fact it addresses only the experiences of white women. Every woman interviewed in the show is white. While Black women, for example, were denied the same access to sex education, birth control, and abortion as whites, their experiences with the adoption industry historically have been unique. Rather than being pressured into giving up their babies, Black women were consistently discouraged from engaging with the private infant adoption industry. By contrast, black children have been disproportionately removed from their families of origin by child welfare agencies and placed in foster care, where they languish sometimes for years. “Adopted or Abducted” completely ignores the distinct experiences of black women as they, too, have lost their children through coercive, immoral practices of professionals and the state.</p>
<p>Likely, the show’s producers view the high poverty rates and institutional racism experienced by black mothers as they are forced to interact with the child welfare system as a less dramatic story to tell. One wonders, too, if the producers believed that obtaining viewer sympathy depended on presenting images of white, middle-class women. One of the interviewees seems to take pains to distinguish herself from the stereotypical “bad” mother in the child welfare system, explaining the importance of people understanding that she is not someone who “used drugs or dropped out of school.”</p>
<p>Also absent from the show is any discussion of the experiences of birth fathers. Recent research shows that strong connections between birth fathers and mothers can assist women with adjusting to life after relinquishing their child for adoption. Some information on the men involved with the women in the show would have been useful and interesting.</p>
<p>The show also suffers from an overly rosy assessment of contemporary domestic adoption policies and practices. (The exploitation, corruption, and in some cases child trafficking that go on in inter-country adoption are for another documentary and review!) For example, Mary repeatedly insists that things are better now, because “most adoptions are open.” Research shows that openness can lead to less intense experiences of grief and loss for birth mothers. Yet notwithstanding the trend toward increased openness in adoption, coercion, exploitation, and racism remain ugly realities in the United States adoption process. Young unmarried women continue to be told—by lawyers and adoption agencies—that the loving thing to do is to place their babies for adoption. Unfettered by comprehensive nationwide regulations, private adoption agencies can and do charge prospective adopters exorbitant fees. Many engage in race-based pricing, in which they charge higher fees for adoptive parents seeking to adopt white babies.</p>
<p>Clearly, much remains to be investigated regarding past, and current, policies and practices. In providing a rare look at the personal experiences of women coerced into relinquishing their babies, “Adopted or Abducted?”—even with its flaws—makes an important contribution to our understanding of the sometimes exploitative potential of adoption.</p>
