<p>“From the dawn of time, men and women have felt the need to worship, to make sense of life and what lies beyond, to find a purpose and to bring a shape to human existence.” These words opened the first episode of “Divine Women”, shown earlier this year on BBC2. That quest for spiritual experience continues in our generation, from all generations. The task for those of us leading worship is to create the context in which that thirst from old, young, and all in between, might be quenched. As the documentary continued viewers were taken to Gobekli Tepe (pronounced Go-beck-lee Tepp-ay) the oldest known sacred space dating from 10,000BCE – in what is now Turkey. Interestingly there is no evidence of settlement at Gobekli Tepe. Here is a place where people gathered solely for the purpose of having religious experience. And so the comment: “Society isn’t creating religion: it is religion which is forming human society.” During the 20 years of my ministry I have wrestled with the idea that worship might truly be “all age”; and on the occasions when I have caught a glimpse of it – it has been were there has been that sense of togetherness, a place of community bonding and society building.</p>
<p>Six years ago, I contributed a yearlong series of “Children’s Ministry” articles in <italic>Expository Times</italic>, and so having reflected upon the same section of the Lectionary cycle, there is the temptation to repeat! The years rather than being ever circling, take us ever forward! Recent years have brought many ‘fresh expressions’ and new ways of being Church – not least in the realm of “Age All” or Family centred ministry. “Messy Church” is one such new model – which, although it may feature some messy fun activities, is rather more about the messiness of the lives for which the Church exists, and the fuzziness of the boundaries that could define our understanding of Church. The Messy Church model of participative, fun, multi-sensory, activities leading into a brief time of worship and then fellowship around a meal is one where I have believed again in the possibility of “All Age Worship” (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.messychurch.org.uk">www.messychurch.org.uk</ext-link> for more information)</p>
<p>Two recent days away with my family have caused me to reflect on “all age” activity. One was to the bookshop where good coffee, juice and snacks served in the café, the brightly coloured Children’s area where handling and reading books was encouraged, the background music and quotes on the walls all took the experience way beyond that of being at a store where books could be purchased. The other was the Adventure Park where my elder son braved the Tarzan Trail, while his not-quite-tall-enough younger brother enjoyed playing on the chutes and climbing frames in the ‘under-fives’ area, and their less than year old sister seemed to be enjoying taking in the colours, noise and the experience. Mum and Dad had a good time too! The family had been together, doing different things.</p>
<p>My own recent experience of “Messy Church” has brought more people together in village halls on Saturdays, than to country churches on Sundays! A dummying down of Church? Or hope for the future? Rather than regurgitate what I did before – which you can still find in Volume 117, and at: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.talks2children.itsforministry.org">www.talks2children.itsforministry.org</ext-link>, I offer the following possibilities for lectionary based activities – some for a traditional setting… others need a new, and perhaps messy, context…</p>

<title>Mirror, Mirror…</title>
<p>Put the words of James 1: 22-25 on or beside a large mirror displayed in the worship space. For some this will be a challenging and inspiring ‘looking at self’. Younger children will enjoy the involvement of seeing their reflection and perhaps the experience will be remembered and may reinforce the message in later life.</p>

<title>James 1: 19 – quick to listen, slow to speak</title>
<p>Young children can be invited to draw a happy smiley face with two ears and one mouth – a reminder that it’s good to listen twice as much as talk.</p>

<sec id="section4-0014524612448040">
<title>Collect</title>
<p>A collect is a short prayer often used before Bible Readings. “Collect” is from the same root as collecting or gathering. What better gathering activity for all ages than to create a prayer.</p>
<p>In groups of mixed age, invite the creation of a collect. Traditionally this has these parts:</p>
<list id="list1-0014524612448040" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>God is addressed</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Something is said about God. “who…</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>A request or petition is made of God</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>A result is anticipated… “that we may…</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Conclusion such as “through Christ our Lord, Amen”</p></list-item>

<title>Prayer for Others</title>
<p>The song “O Lord all the world belongs to you” (Songs of God’s People 84) could be used as a framework for Prayers of Intercession, with words and silence coming between the verses.</p>
<p><italic>Verse 1</italic></p>
<p>With respect, we pray for the people of the world in their varied situations and circumstance. Especially… (silence)</p>
<p><italic>Verse 2</italic></p>
<p>With action, we pray that we might respond to opportunities to love our neighbours, just as much as we love ourselves. Especially… (silence)</p>
<p><italic>Verse 3</italic></p>
<p>With love, we pray that we might be open to the possibility that the last shall be first. Especially… (silence)</p>
<p><italic>Verse 4</italic></p>
<p>With faith, we pray that you continue to use us in the work of turning the world upside down. (silence)</p>
<p><italic>Verse 5</italic></p>
<p>Amen.</p>

<title>Proverbs 22: 1-2, 8-9, 22-23</title>
<p>The passage could be read with two voices, or antiphonally.</p>
<p>A: A good name is better that great riches</p>
<p>B: and favour is better than silver or gold</p>
<p>A: Rich and poor have this in common</p>
<p>B: The Lord is maker of them all</p>
<p>A: Whoever sows injustice will reap trouble</p>
<p>B: and the rod of his fury will be destroyed</p>
<p>A: Those who are generous are blessed</p>
<p>B: for they share their bread with the poor</p>
<p>A: Do not exploit the poor because they are poor</p>
<p>B: or crush the needy in court</p>
<p>A: For the Lord will take up their case</p>
<p>B: and will plunder those who plunder them</p>

<title>Proverbs</title>
<p>Until the 23<sup>rd</sup>, readings from Proverbs feature. Around the worship area quotes from Proverbs can be displayed – including the familiar, the pithy and the poignant.</p>
<list id="list2-0014524612448040" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Soft answer turns away wrath. 15:1</p></list-item>

<title>Participative Psalm</title>
<p>A very effective, simple, engagement with the Psalms is to invite all to open a Bible right in the middle… and hopefully at Psalms! One verse from the Psalms will already have been chosen as a refrain – such as Psalm 125 : 4 “Show your goodness, O Lord to those who are good” or “The law of the Lord is perfect and revives the soul” Psalm 19:7. Invite all to look over the Psalms on whatever page they are at – and, into the silence, to read out any verse which strikes them as poignant, interesting or speaks to them in any way, followed by the refrain verse which all say together. In this way a Psalm is created participatively. I have always found this to work well, and for longer than I had expected!</p>

<title>James 3: 1-12</title>
<p>Create a display featuring a bridle and bit, model boat with a rudder, and (if considered safe) a match. In a “Messy Church” setting this invitation to reflect on the Bible passage could be accompanied by a print out of the text, or Bibles with the passage marked for people to read and reflect upon on their own. In a traditional setting, the symbols could be displayed at the chancel– or perhaps better at a place where people will mingle and engage with them.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0014524612448040">
<title>Psalm 19</title>
<p>The final verse of Psalm 19 is often misquoted and used as a prayer before the sermon. After a talk or reflection on the James passage, these words could be said together:</p>
<p><italic>May the words of my mouth and the thoughts of my heart be pleasing in your sight, O Lord, my strength and my redeemer. Psalm 19: 14</italic></p>

<p>Come near to God and God will come near to you. Humble yourselves before the Lord, and he will lift you up. (James 4: 8a, 10)</p>

<sec id="section15-0014524612448040">

<title>Mark 9: 38-50</title>
<p>Two images are presented in this passage. Set a table with several cups of water, a pile of salt, a few Bibles – and two cards with words such as:</p>
<boxed-text id="boxed-text1-0014524612448040">
<title>Just a cup of water</title>
<p>“anyone by just giving you a cup of water in my name is on our side. Count on it that God will notice.” (Mark 9: 41, The Message)</p>
<p>As a sign of shared belonging in Christ, you are invited to give a cup of water to someone else… you may wish to say something like, “In Christ’s name, I give you this cup of water because you belong to him.”</p>

<title>The Salt of the World</title>
<p>From Lot’s wife being turned into a pillar of salt to James’ questioning if fresh water and salt water can flow from the same spring there are 43 references to salt in the Bible.</p>
<p>“Salt is good, but if it loses its saltiness, how can it make you salty again? Have salt in yourselves and be at peace with one another.” (Mark 9: 50)</p>
<p>Matthew records this too, preceded with “You are the salt of the earth.” (Matthew 5: 13)</p>
<p>Taste just a pinch of salt as a reminder that you are the salt of the earth – called to make a difference in the world.</p>

<title>Esther</title>
<p>Biscuit mixing, baking, decorating and eating is a popular Messy Church activity. Different shapes can represent seasonally appropriate symbols.</p>
<p>At Purim, when in Jewish tradition the book of Esther is read, <italic>Hamantashen</italic>, a traditional sweet biscuit is baked and enjoyed. If you Google “Hamantashen recipe” you will find how to make these triangular biscuits, representing Haman’s pockets into which went the silver offered for his evil intent.</p>
<p>Esther is the only book in the Bible which does not mention God by name. In the Hebrew, the divine name YHWH is hidden acrostically at 5:4 and 7:7 – God is involved, yet unseen, in the unfolding of human history. In Jewish tradition the reading of Esther at the festival of Purim (which falls in the Spring) includes pantomime like noisy response to the name of the evil Haman. In this respect it may be a story for all the family – a lightening of an otherwise unbearable story. People of all ages might be encouraged to read this ten chapter self contained book.</p>
<p>At <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://tinyurl.com/PurimAnimated">tinyurl.com/PurimAnimated</ext-link> there is a video clip summarising the Esther story which could be used within an All Age setting. Esther features in the Revised Common Lectionary in the Autumn; you may wish to consider waiting until next year and exploring the possibility of sharing with the Jewish community in an inter-faith event in the Spring. During Purim this year, at the instigation of the local Jewish community, I along with some of my congregation shared in the reading of the book of Esther in the Church, after which we shared food including <italic>Hamentashen.</italic></p>

<title>Coming Next Month</title>
<p>Next month, in our occasional series on Ethical Issues, Stephen Webb considers animal rights in “The Chicken and the Bathwater: Exploring a Basic Limit to the Vegetarian Ideal”. James Yu offers his thoughts on “Understanding Joshua 10.12-14 in its Context”. The Book of the Month is T. Burke’s <italic>Critical Greek Text of the Infancy Gospel of Thomas</italic>, reviewed by Paul Foster.</p>
