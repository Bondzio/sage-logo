<p>Farmer’s <italic>Public Administration in Perspective: Theory and Practice Through Multiple Lenses</italic> (2010) posits that there is more than one best way to approach public administration (PA) theory and practice. Farmer’s work expands the PA literature in two meaningful ways. First, Farmer directly responds to calls for greater scholarship addressing the issues faced by practitioners in the field and, second, Farmer advocates for the inclusion of important, but systematically ignored, theoretical perspectives from other disciplines to yield better erudition in PA. Instead of relying on the theoretical and practical guidance from a single discipline, Farmer suggests that knowledge across multiple disciplines should be synchronized in PA and that epistemic pluralism is the conduit through which that can happen. To Farmer, epistemic pluralism provides a framework for approaching PA from multiple perspectives and serves to guide PA scholars and practitioners to pursue lines of inquiry and plans of action that are, at once, relevant, well-reasoned, inclusive, equitable, legitimate, politically feasible, ethical, and creative. However, Farmer does not advocate the multidisciplinary perspective so much as he advocates for employing the lenses of multiple disciplines. The ultimate goal of the epistemic pluralism perspective is to address the lack of “data . . . theories, techniques, and insights from an array of non-PA disciplines . . . resulting from excluding political science, economics, political economy, moral philosophy, sociology, civil society, [and] the complex of action subjects like business administration, social work—and beyond” (p. 164).</p>
<p>As a theoretical concept, Farmer notes that epistemic pluralism can be thought of as the “second cousin of deterritorialism and anti-administration” (p. 10). Deterritorialism seeks to break down the silo-creating walls that serve to separate the disciplines from another. In Farmer’s view, disciplinary separations skew reality. In the context of PA, this results in fragmented knowledge and practice approaches. Antiadministration is germane because PA, Farmer argues, needs to embrace the knowledge from disciplines not traditionally associated with PA theory or practice.</p>
<p>Is not a global reckoning of PA theory and practice exactly what the field needs? To that end, Farmer attempts to apply a single perspective to resolve the epistemological issues that plague PA. More importantly, though, Farmer seeks to expand the current knowledge of PA by drawing on the existing knowledge of other disciplines. This means more than making PA “externally oriented” to other disciplines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0275074011412947">Catlaw, 2006</xref>). Subscribers to Farmer’s epistemic pluralism must use the knowledge from multiple disciplines to meet their responsibility of serving the public interest.</p>
<p>Based on Farmer’s approach in the book, some readers might find the chapter divisions formulaic. However, Farmer’s adherence to the strategy of first introducing the perspectives (each enjoys its own chapter), describing the relevance of the perspective to PA, and then explaining the implications owing to each perspective makes for an efficient approach. Specifically, with respect to each perspective, Farmer asks how the perspective is implicated in planning, management, the underlying, the field, and imaginative creativity. The probative value of each of these questions posed is significant to the PA scholar for the reason that scholars strive to produce theory that will augment the practitioner’s work, and significant to the practitioner for the reason that practitioners strive to meet the needs (and demands and wants) of the public’s call for action.</p>
<p>In Section I, the various PA perspectives are fragmented and analyzed in the way just described. Some of the perspectives are familiar—business, political, and ethical. Other perspectives are less familiar—psychoanalytic and neuroscience. Most of the perspectives aggregate around the familiar. Moreover, a full spectrum of perspectives would have likely included additional perspectives. Farmer, though, does not represent (even impliedly) that the perspectives analyzed are an exhaustive list of the relevant disciplines that importantly impact on PA. Farmer synthesizes the perspectives—or, more precisely, brings them into focus by applying epistemic pluralism—in Section II. Finally, Farmer offers a synoptic view of the PA field, in light of the various perspectives, in Section III.</p>
<p>Farmer respects hermeneutics, but he also acknowledges that PA, and more particularly traditional PA is not a panacea—it does not provide all of the theory and practice guidance that PA needs. In illustrating some of the disciplines impact on PA (namely, traditional PA, business, economic, political, critical theory, poststructural, psychoanalytic, neuroscience, feminist, ethical, and data), Farmer draws important lessons that each of the perspectives lend to PA.</p>
<p>Farmer’s analysis begins with traditional PA, or what he calls “mainstream” PA (p. 19). In Farmer’s view, traditional PA “focuses too much on surface administration problems” (p. 35). To that end, traditional administration is wanting and the attention of the text turns to the business perspective. The business perspective, as applied to PA, is familiar. As Farmer notes, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0275074011412947">Osborne and Gaebler (1992)</xref> are credited with bringing the business perspective to the forefront in PA. Specifically, the desire to mimic private business models (businesslike government) in the public sector brings with it an entrepreneurial spirit, innovation, leadership, and strategic advantages. Although these are admirable contributions to the field, PA is concerned with more than business matters. Accordingly, PA still needs more perspective.</p>
<p>In vein similar to the business perspective, the economic perspective is a rational and functional tool that has obvious application to public choice economics. Public choice economics may be more cogent compared to a purely economic perspective because of its practical impact on PA and the policy-making process. Recent work in public choice economics by Vincent <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0275074011412947">Ostrom (2008)</xref> urges PA to focus on “diversity, variety, and responsiveness to the preferences of the constituents” (p. 115). Nonetheless, applying an economic perspective is in furtherance of that goal because, as Farmer puts it, “[t]he economic perspective is so powerful in contemporary society that the ideas of economists should be approached by PA seriously and directly” (p. 63).</p>
<p>The political perspective takes a turn next in Chapter 5. Here, Farmer questions whether bureaucracy and democracy are compatible with one another and raises—without doing more—the politics-administration dichotomy. Bureaucracy and democracy may be incompatible because the former encourages “calculative inhumanity, technological efficiency, subordination of the individual to the agency, and nonparticipation” (p. 71). Farmer suggests that PA needs to be more philosophical with regard to policy studies, more reflective through political philosophy, and guided more by the U.S. Constitution. And, PA needs to place higher emphasis on citizen engagement such that it acts consistent with our democratic ideals.</p>
<p>Farmer cites Jürgen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0275074011412947">Habermas (1983)</xref> for the proposition that PA is a “rational organization of everyday social life” (p. 9). As such an institution, PA must navigate the lifeworld’s many issues; those matters are interdisciplinary of course. Naturally, critical theory is implicated here because PA can simulate its objective of emancipation by engaging in “outward discourse and action” (p. 87). To be outwardly, PA must engage and act in the lifeworld beyond the bureaucracy.</p>
<p>The poststructural perspective is likewise uncomfortable in view of traditional PA and it is this very reason why the perspective is important. Poststructuralism calls for interpretation and nuanced understanding of what is real, not what is contrived by various social institutions. Antiadministration, which advises the inclusion of “voices excluded from, or marginalized, in traditional discussions of governance” (p. 97) and rejects inventing trust “in order to produce a normalized person who fits in” (p. 98), is implied by the poststructural perspective. The perspective sets the bar higher for PA by imposing reality and demanding morality.</p>
<p>The next two perspectives analyzed by Farmer—the psychoanalytic and the neuroscience perspectives—lie at the far end of the spectrum. The psychoanalytic perspective, as shaped by Sigmund Freud’s work, lends the understanding that human action (as well as thought and emotion) are influenced by the unconscious. Carl Jung’s work expands that notion and reveals that the unconscious is not individual but in fact universal. In other words, people in a society share an unconscious. Offering clarity around that point, Jacques Lacan informs that the unconscious emerges as a language that is made up of symbols and other shared meanings. This is important knowledge for PA because the field must necessarily be “constructed and limited by unconscious factors” (p. 107). The unconscious resides in the human brain—the central nervous system’s message sending and receiving organ. Neuroscience, therefore, can give PA many lessons by helping the field think in ways that require understanding of human interaction thereby forcing the hand of PA to adopt “a different way of thinking for governance” (p. 120).</p>
<p>Much the way understanding the human condition is important to PA, understanding how PA “tends to other people and ideas who do not fit unto its way of seeing the world” (p. 128) is likewise important. Here, Farmer urges that that feminist perspective can help PA defeat the othering perpetrated by PA. Specifically, PA can adopt language that discourages othering rather than promulgating the traditional stance of appearing to “assert mastery” and “control meaning” (p. 139).</p>
<p>PA is advised, by Farmer, to expand its view of ethics to include understanding of moral philosophy. Furthermore, ethics applies not only to individual actors; it applies to organizational actors. Bureaucracies and agencies should be guided by the same principles that guide what individuals “ought” to do. Moreover, ethics is more than harboring normative values that are defined by what is legal or practicing utilitarianism that imposes a burden on minority groups “for the numerically superior units of happiness registered by majorities” (p. 150). There are no prescriptions given by the ethical perspective to PA save the guidance that PA should adhere to what “ought” to be done.</p>
<p>Finally, the data perspective informs that “[b]oth positivist and hermeneutic data can enrich” the field (p. 159). Positivist data can result in better delivery of services by revealing, among other things, ways to improve use of technology and implement planning protocols. There are many studies that support this claim. Hermeneutic data, by borrowing concepts from other disciplines, can result in better understanding of the way services are produced, delivered, and received. The primary aim of the data perspective in informing PA should be to change “professional ways of thinking” (p. 164). The various perspectives examined by Farmer inform how having a holistic view of PA, brought into focus by epistemic pluralism, is helpful.</p>
<p>PA scholars and practitioners regularly grapple with such weighty issues as morality, roles and identities, ideological and political divisions, and maintenance of equity. The import of that statement is that PA must branch out and adopt the knowledge of other fields. According to Farmer, PA scholars and practitioners need to be more expansive in their view of the field; they must be worldly in their field. In my concurrence with that position, those in the field would do well to consider Farmer’s epistemic pluralism and to examine <italic>Public Administration in Perspective</italic>. The book can be a good read for students, scholars and practitioners seeking a text bridging PA theory with practice.</p>
