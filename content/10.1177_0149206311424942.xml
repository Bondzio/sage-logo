<p>Over the past decade, the incorporation of a temporal perspective in merger and acquisition (M&amp;A) and alliance research has gained increasing popularity. Scholars have studied questions related to accelerating or slowing down postacquisition integration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0149206311424942">Homburg &amp; Bucerius, 2006</xref>), preemptive acquisitions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0149206311424942">Carow, Heron, &amp; Saxton, 2004</xref>), the impact of M&amp;A or alliance experience on performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0149206311424942">Haleblian &amp; Finkelstein, 1999</xref>), and M&amp;As and alliances as learning tools and races (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0149206311424942">Hamel, 1991</xref>). More recently, researchers have begun to explore the pacing and rhythm of acquisitions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr105-0149206311424942">Laamanen &amp; Keil, 2008</xref>) and the sequence patterns of M&amp;As and alliances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr166-0149206311424942">Shi &amp; Prescott, 2011</xref>) under the assumption that corporate performance increasingly hinges on the effective management of acquisition programs and alliance portfolios (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr95-0149206311424942">Kale &amp; Singh, 2009</xref>). One common thread among this diverse set of M&amp;A and alliance research is a shared orientation of assessing temporal-related constructs to describe and explain key organizational outcomes. That is, research has adopted a “temporal perspective” with the aim of enriching our understanding of how <italic>managing time</italic> can create a source of competitive advantage and survival within the context of M&amp;A and alliance initiatives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr147-0149206311424942">Prescott &amp; Shi, 2008</xref>). While a growing number of scholars question the underlying competitive advantage logic of engaging in M&amp;As and alliances given their poor track record and high failure rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr101-0149206311424942">King, Dalton, Daily, &amp; Covin, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr110-0149206311424942">Lavie &amp; Miller, 2008</xref>), we think a temporal perspective provides the potential to enrich our understanding of how firms should and do effectively manage these strategic initiatives.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0149206311424942">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>M&amp;As and alliances are externally oriented corporate development efforts with the goal of achieving economies of scale, scope, market share, prestige, survival, and other outcomes essential to temporary or sustained competitive advantage. During this decade, both corporate initiatives have achieved unprecedented growth. For example, in the United States the value of M&amp;A deals has grown from $676 billion at the beginning of 2001 to $2.4 trillion in 2010 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr178-0149206311424942">Thomson Reuters, 2011</xref>). Given that both activities are time-consuming and time is a scarce, valuable, and nonimitable resource (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0149206311424942">Carlstein, 1982</xref>), how firms leverage time in conducting and coordinating M&amp;A and alliance initiatives is a critical issue.</p>
<p>Since a temporal perspective focuses on the management of time and its consequences, it contributes a unique value proposition to the M&amp;A and alliance stream of research. Thus, it is not surprising that researchers have explored a wide variety of temporal topics and methodological approaches. As a result, research evidence has progressed in a somewhat fragmented manner where its cumulative impact is difficult to discern. The purpose of this review is to systematically assess the underlying logic, accumulated knowledge, and contributions of the temporal perspective of M&amp;As and alliances as well as identify core temporal constructs, mechanisms, and promising research directions. We center on empirical M&amp;A and alliance research where temporal mechanisms and constructs have either been implicitly inferred or explicitly identified as a unit of analysis in a study’s theory or methods. We benefit from and build on temporal research in management to provide a unique contribution to the M&amp;A and alliance literature (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0149206311424942">Bluedorn &amp; Denhardt, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0149206311424942">Butler, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr121-0149206311424942">McGrath &amp; Rotchford, 1983</xref>).</p>
<p>Our focus on M&amp;As and alliances enriches our understanding of the role of time for two fundamental corporate initiatives. This is an important issue since strategy scholars often view time as a hidden and unrecognized dimension of strategy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0149206311424942">Das, 1991</xref>) that has the potential to create competitive advantage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0149206311424942">P. S. Davis, Dibrell, &amp; Janz, 2002</xref>). Our temporal lens is directed toward the organizational theory/macro level (i.e., M&amp;As and alliances as the phenomenon of interest), although we include relevant studies at the micro level. The approach is complementary to prior temporal review articles that have focused on the micro level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0149206311424942">Bluedorn &amp; Denhardt, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0149206311424942">Butler, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr121-0149206311424942">McGrath &amp; Rotchford, 1983</xref>) while recognizing that the management of time for M&amp;A and alliances is a multilevel phenomenon.</p>
<p>Based on our assessment of 144 articles, we developed the following overall summary. The prototypical temporal M&amp;A and alliance study employs a <italic>cross-sectional design</italic> to examine how <italic>past</italic> alliance/acquisition <italic>learning and experience</italic> serve as <italic>proxies</italic> for organizational processes (e.g., knowledge, trust) that affect <italic>present</italic> learning, organizational structure, the probability of new alliances/acquisitions, or market-based <italic>outcome</italic>s while assuming <italic>objective clock time</italic> and that the timing of an alliance/acquisition <italic>event is unpredictable</italic>. We strongly recommend that future research be oriented toward establishing the construct validity of temporal constructs, measuring time directly whenever possible, redirecting research toward second-order time constructs involving the complex nature of change and assessing to what degree firms temporally manage acquisition and alliance programs.</p>

<title>Article Selection Criteria</title>
<p>We draw on prior temporal studies that underpin the role of time in the field of management (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0149206311424942">Bluedorn &amp; Denhardt, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0149206311424942">Butler, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0149206311424942">George &amp; Jones, 2000</xref>) to establish a boundary condition, on one hand, but also to leverage time-based research in the broader “management” domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0149206311424942">Ancona, Okhuysen, &amp; Perlow, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0149206311424942">Bluedorn, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0149206311424942">Bluedorn &amp; Denhardt, 1988</xref>) to the more specialized M&amp;A and alliance research stream.</p>
<p>We classify extant research based on seven temporal roles established in social science research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0149206311424942">Bluedorn, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0149206311424942">Butler, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr129-0149206311424942">Moore, 1963</xref>). The temporal roles are (a) “when,” (b) “how frequent,” (c) “how fast or what speed,” (d) “experience,” (e) “learning,” (f) “what order or sequence,” and (g) “what rhythm.” These temporal roles provide an organizing framework for categorizing research because they focus on how organizations manage time as a critical resource (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0149206311424942">Doob, 1971</xref>) and from a more general sense are linked to temporal aspects of decision making (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0149206311424942">Bluedorn &amp; Denhardt, 1988</xref>). A study can address multiple temporal roles.</p>
<p>We first classified each selected study into its temporal role and then evaluated each study on six criteria as a way to identify insights, gaps, areas of commonality, and differences within and across the temporal roles. The criteria developed from the time-based literature are (a) temporal constructs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0149206311424942">Bluedorn &amp; Denhardt, 1988</xref>), (b) assumptions of time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0149206311424942">Ancona, Okhuysen, &amp; Perlow, 2001</xref>), (c) temporal referent point (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr131-0149206311424942">Mosakowski &amp; Earley, 2000</xref>), (d) temporal study design, (e) single versus multiple M&amp;A and alliance initiatives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr166-0149206311424942">Shi &amp; Prescott, 2011</xref>), and (f) temporal influence on organizational outcomes. From a managerial perspective, the six criteria are central for understanding how and why time matters in making informed and high-quality M&amp;A and alliance decisions.</p>
<p>We included published articles that satisfy two criteria. First, we searched for M&amp;A and alliance articles that adopted a temporal perspective (relevance criterion). Specifically, we used keywords related to the seven temporal roles such as <italic>experience, learning, first mover advantage, pace</italic>,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0149206311424942">2</xref></sup> <italic>frequency, speed</italic>, and <italic>rhythm</italic>. Second, we searched for management-related M&amp;A and alliance articles in four theoretical domains: organizational theory/strategy, economics, sociology, and social psychology. We searched for articles in 18 academic referred journals (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0149206311424942">Table 1</xref>) across a wide variety of fields, including strategy, management, international business, and entrepreneurship from 1983 to the present. In our search, the first article related to time appeared in 1983. We used the reference section of the articles to identify articles published before 1983 and to identify other articles that were not revealed in our electronic search. We included studies that examine the antecedents, mediators, moderators, and outcomes of temporal related constructs. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0149206311424942">Table 1</xref> summarizes the chronological trends across journals and the overall frequency of articles for the seven temporal roles by journal. In total we identified 144 articles.</p>

<title>Seven Temporal Roles</title>
<p>A temporal role is the function attributed to time-related constructs. Since the first step in our evaluation process involves the classification of each article into a temporal role, we briefly overview each temporal role.</p>
<p>The <italic>when</italic> role includes studies that explore preemptive acquisitions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0149206311424942">Carow et al., 2004</xref>), early movers in acquisition waves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr122-0149206311424942">McNamara, Haleblian, &amp; Dykes, 2008</xref>), and entry timing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr126-0149206311424942">Miller &amp; Folta, 2002</xref>). In the alliance literature, scholars frame first movers as a key component of a firm’s strategic profile and correlate it with alliance partner characteristics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr139-0149206311424942">Oxley &amp; Sampson, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>The <italic>frequency</italic> role focuses on multiple acquisitions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr105-0149206311424942">Laamanen &amp; Keil, 2008</xref>), the temporal distance among multiple acquisitions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0149206311424942">Hayward, 2002</xref>), and the pace or frequency of one cycle of repeated activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr173-0149206311424942">Standifer &amp; Bluedorn, 2006</xref>). Scholars have examined both the antecedents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0149206311424942">Amburgey &amp; Miner, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr173-0149206311424942">Standifer &amp; Bluedorn, 2006</xref>) and performance implications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr105-0149206311424942">Laamanen &amp; Keil, 2008</xref>) of repetitive acquisitions and/or alliances.</p>
<p>The <italic>speed</italic> role investigates the impact of speed of integration on postmerger performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0149206311424942">Cording, Christmann, &amp; King, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0149206311424942">Graebner, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0149206311424942">Homburg &amp; Bucerius, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-0149206311424942">Inkpen, Sundaram, &amp; Rockwood, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr149-0149206311424942">Ranft &amp; Lord, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr163-0149206311424942">Schweizer, 2005</xref>) and the antecedents of the speed of new alliance initiatives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0149206311424942">Al-Laham, Amburgey, &amp; Bates, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0149206311424942">Haspeslagh &amp; Jemison, 1991</xref>).</p>
<p>The <italic>experience</italic> role explores the impact of acquisition experience or duration on firm performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0149206311424942">Haleblian &amp; Finkelstein, 1999</xref>) and how prior alliance experience affects alliance-related outcomes such as alliance capability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0149206311424942">Heimeriks &amp; Duysters, 2007</xref>), alliance performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0149206311424942">Hoang &amp; Rothaermel, 2005</xref>), and alliance governance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr153-0149206311424942">Reuer, Zollo, &amp; Singh, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>The <italic>learning</italic> role explores questions involving intra- and interpartner learning. The temporal element is embedded in contexts where it takes time to learn, build trust, and acquire knowledge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0149206311424942">Doz, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr96-0149206311424942">Kale, Singh, &amp; Perlmutter, 2000</xref>) and where competitive-cooperative relationships among partners coevolve over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0149206311424942">Hamel, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-0149206311424942">Inkpen &amp; Currall, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr99-0149206311424942">Khanna, Gulati, &amp; Nohria, 1998</xref>). This perspective explores learning mechanisms under different experience patterns, such as the impact of heterogeneity of experience on learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr194-0149206311424942">Zollo &amp; Winter, 2002</xref>). While the learning role is related to the experience role, its focus on process issues warrants separate attention. The process perspective has been explicitly addressed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0149206311424942">Hamel’s (1991)</xref> study, where he suggests that process is often more important than structure in determining learning outcomes. When there are asymmetries in the learning goals, processes, and outcomes of partners, they can alter the relative bargaining power between partners. In addition, a firm can have experience but not learn as in blind variation or learn without experience as in vicarious learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0149206311424942">Bresman, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>The <italic>sequence</italic> role emphasizes the sequence of decisions within a single alliance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr175-0149206311424942">Tallman &amp; Shenkar, 1994</xref>) or acquisition. Recently, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr166-0149206311424942">Shi and Prescott (2011)</xref> extended this line of research by empirically identifying a typology of distinctive sequence patterns in firms’ acquisition and alliance initiatives. The central focus of this role is to either study sequence as a context or examine the impact of order in M&amp;A and alliance decisions on organizational outcomes.</p>
<p>The <italic>rhythm</italic> role examines acquisition programs and alliance portfolios from a perspective that emphasizes degree of variability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr182-0149206311424942">Vermeulen &amp; Barkema, 2002</xref>) in acquisition and alliance initiatives and its implications. For example, high variability is an indicator that firms concentrate their deals or alliances within a specific period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr105-0149206311424942">Laamanen &amp; Keil, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr165-0149206311424942">Shi &amp; Prescott, 2007</xref>). <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0149206311424942">Table 2</xref> summarizes our definitions for each temporal role.</p>

<p>The <italic>temporal constructs</italic> criterion identifies the theoretical constructs used in each temporal role.</p>
<p>The <italic>assumptions of time</italic> evaluation criterion refers to how time is conceptualized and measured. We examine four assumptions of time. First, time can be conceptualized and measured based on a clock or by cycles where events repeat over and over or as a developmental pattern of a life cycle. A second assumption is that time reckoning can be based on events that are either predictable (e.g., acquisition integration follows the closing of the deal) or unpredictable (e.g., M&amp;As are not planned). A third assumption regards whether a study’s time constructs are proxies for other constructs of interests (such as equating time with trust or experience) or direct theoretical constructs and empirical measures (such as speed, pace, variability, sequence). The fourth assumption is that time can be either objective or subjective. An objective framing assumes time is homogeneous, uniform, and packaged in measurable units, while a subjective view assumes that the experience of time varies across individual decision makers or contexts.</p>
<p>The <italic>temporal reference point</italic> evaluation criterion refers to the time orientation of decision makers, that is, whether they anchor their decisions with a referent point in the past, present, or future (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr131-0149206311424942">Mosakowski &amp; Earley, 2000</xref>). While some studies adopt a past referent point and view acquisition and alliance decisions as path dependent, evolving and nested within a firm’s history (such as the “experience” and “learning” roles), others adopt a present perspective and focus on the status quo of an acquisition or alliance (such as the speed of integration or first movers in an acquisition wave). A study can adopt a combination approach, that is, a past–present, past–future, present–future, or past–present–future perspective.</p>
<p>The <italic>temporal study design</italic> evaluation criterion refers to how the studies are constructed with respect to time. Researchers can collect alliance or acquisition data within a specific period or longitudinally across different periods or track specific changes in the content and processes of alliances and acquisitions at different points in their history. Temporal study design, in our view, is an evaluation of how theoretical constructs are defined, of how the temporal constructs are empirically operationalized, and of the analytical techniques used to test hypotheses.</p>
<p>The <italic>single versus multiple M&amp;A and alliance initiatives</italic> evaluation criterion distinguishes studies based on whether acquisitions and alliances are conceptualized as a single strategic initiative (e.g., sequence of decision making within an alliance) or as multiple and serial repetitions (e.g., strategic momentum, variability, and sequences of acquisitions/alliances). Single alliance and acquisition initiatives usually focus on temporal constructs such as duration, speed, and learning, while multiple activities are related to constructs such as frequency, rhythm, and experience.</p>
<p>The temporal influence on <italic>organizational outcomes</italic> evaluation criterion examines various organizational consequences for a study’s temporal hypotheses. Organizational outcomes cover a wide range of indicators including accounting-based, subjective evaluations, learning, and organizational structures, to mention a few. This criterion can also be used to assess whether a study’s theoretical temporal role and temporal reference point are congruent with its empirical outcome measurement.</p>

<sec id="section5-0149206311424942">
<title>Coding Method</title>
<p>Each article was read by at least one of the authors and assigned to one of the temporal roles. An article could be classified into more than one temporal role based on its theory, constructs, and methods. The articles were then coded based on the six evaluation criteria. As noted in the previous section, for each criterion, there are several subcriteria that are not necessarily mutually exclusive. The subcriteria were identified based on prior time-related articles and on our reading of the 144 identified articles. For example, for the assumption of time criterion, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0149206311424942">Ancona, Okhuysen, and Perlow (2001)</xref> identified several different types of time including clock, cyclical, event, life cycle, and subjective time. They reflect different aspects of time. Since authors usually did not explicitly state their assumption of time, we inferred the classification based on a set of definitions we developed from our reading of the literature. Whenever there was a question regarding a specific coding, a second and sometimes third author read the study and judgment calls were made after a discussion. Our process involved a set of iterative steps with multiple review points and comparisons across the articles.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0149206311424942">3</xref></sup></p>

<title>“When” role</title>
<p>The major questions that the “when” role explores include the following: When should firms engage in alliances or acquisitions? Do first mover effects associated with partnering with other firms or acquiring targets produce economic value? If so, what are the key contingencies? What are the antecedents of entry timing? This stream of research suggests that “when” to make an alliance or acquisition is an important strategic decision that needs to be managed by alliance and acquisition managers. However, the scarcity of empirical studies (<italic>n</italic> = 7) in this role indicates that strategic scholars have paid limited attention to this line of inquiry. Theoretical arguments are largely built on the Bain/Mason industrial organization framework and more recently on organizational learning. The first mover advantage perspective derived from classic economics prescribes that managers need to move fast to ally with partners and acquire targets to preempt valuable and often limited-in-supply resources. This line of theoretical reasoning often draws on underlying mechanisms such as information asymmetry, switching costs, and preemption. For instance, using 20 years of data from the Securities Data Company database, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0149206311424942">Carow et al. (2004)</xref> found that the combined returns of acquirer and target firms are higher for early movers than for late movers within an acquisition wave. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-0149206311424942">Isobe, Makino, and Montgomery’s (2000)</xref> research in the emerging markets context indicated that early alliance moves positively affect JV performance. However, they found this relationship largely hinged on several internal and external factors, such as the strategic importance of an investment, parental control of a JV, and the availability of supporting local infrastructure.</p>
<p>A real option perspective of the “when” role focuses on the optimal timing of entry or its associated determinants. Related theoretical mechanisms include uncertainty reduction, opportunity for growth, and trade-offs between commitment and flexibility. Alliance and acquisition timing is usually found to be highly related to technological uncertainty, knowledge stocks of both acquirers and targets, and prior relationships with partners or targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr186-0149206311424942">Warner, Fairbank, &amp; Steensma, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Behavioral theorists tend to agree that first movers enjoy significant benefits in the form of preemption of critical resources. In this vein, they build on theories derived from first mover advantage research. However, the behavioral approach underscores the costs assumed by late movers. Specifically, late movers are motivated to enter into acquisitions based on bandwagon pressures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0149206311424942">Abrahamson &amp; Rosenkopf, 1993</xref>). Firms following a bandwagon approach make decisions based on social cues rather than comprehensive market information. Consequently, they often make less accurate decisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr122-0149206311424942">McNamara et al., 2008</xref>).</p>

Some of the relevant constructs include acquisition rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr105-0149206311424942">Laamanen &amp; Keil, 2008</xref>), pace of acquisitions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr134-0149206311424942">Nadolska &amp; Barkema, 2007</xref>), temporal distance between acquisitions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0149206311424942">Hayward, 2002</xref>), and repetitive momentum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0149206311424942">Amburgey &amp; Miner, 1992</xref>).</p>
<p>Two key questions have been examined. The first asks, what are the determinants of firms’ frequency of acquisition/alliance activity? The second question centers on the performance implications of acquisition/alliance frequency. Research findings have been inconsistent to date. In a study of U.S. public firms, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr105-0149206311424942">Laamanen and Keil (2008)</xref> found that a high acquisition rate negatively affected the acquirer’s performance. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0149206311424942">Hayward (2002)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr104-0149206311424942">Kusewitt (1985)</xref>, however, found that a firm’s acquisition pace should proceed at a moderate level to achieve superior performance.</p>
<p>The organizational learning perspective is the major theoretical lens adopted by scholars to understand the rationale for and outcomes of frequency. Essentially, a firm’s acquisition pace influences its development of an acquisition/alliance capability, that is, the ability to identify suitable acquisition targets, negotiate the deal, and manage the integration process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0149206311424942">Haspeslagh &amp; Jemison, 1991</xref>). The general argument supporting a negative relationship between acquisition pace and performance is that a high acquisition frequency does not provide managers sufficient time to hone their skills and make performance-based inferences based on prior acquisition experience. When the temporal interval between two acquisitions is very short, firms tend to suffer from time compression diseconomies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0149206311424942">Dierickx &amp; Cool, 1989</xref>). On the other hand, scholars who hypothesize an inverted <italic>U</italic>-shaped relationship between acquisition pace and performance question the value of making inferences from older experiences. Since the external environment changes and corporate managers relocate within and across firm boundaries, organizations as well as individuals may simply forget what they have learned in prior acquisitions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0149206311424942">Argote, Beckman, &amp; Epple, 1990</xref>), especially when the temporal distance between events is long or when the acquisition pace is low.</p>
<p>With respect to the antecedents of acquisition and alliance pace, scholars share a common assumption that prior experience influences the pace of subsequent acquisition and alliance initiatives. Organizational routines, experiential learning, and absorptive capability are the major theoretical mechanisms that underlie the relationship. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr134-0149206311424942">Nadolska and Barkema (2007)</xref>, for example, argue that acquisition experience generates experiential knowledge, which over time is institutionalized into organization routines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr118-0149206311424942">March, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr135-0149206311424942">Nelson &amp; Winter, 1982</xref>). The enhanced routines reduce the time required for initiating new acquisitions (including the identification, selection, and evaluation of targets) and postacquisition integration processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr112-0149206311424942">Levitt &amp; March, 1988</xref>). This increased efficiency allows companies to conduct more acquisition per year. Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0149206311424942">Al-Laham et al. (2008)</xref> posited that firms with more alliance experience tend to create a general capability of managing alliances through improved efficiency in partner selection and enhanced learning processes.</p>

<title>“How fast or what speed” role</title>
<p>Researchers adopting this role have mainly addressed how the speed of conducting various activities for a single acquisition affects performance. The notion of speed needs to be differentiated from pace as described in the frequency role. Pace involves multiple events over a specific period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr105-0149206311424942">Laamanen &amp; Keil, 2008</xref>). Speed, according to acquisition and alliance scholars, refers to a different concept. Specifically, speed refers to the duration of conducting postintegration processes or more generally the time it takes to conduct any acquisition/alliance process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0149206311424942">Homburg &amp; Bucerius, 2005</xref>). Therefore, speed in most cases has focused on a single acquisition/alliance, while pace requires multiple acquisition and alliance initiatives. We identified six articles in this role. Both marketing and management scholars have examined this topic, but with a very different focus. Marketing scholars approach the issue from a customer perspective. They suggest that a positive effect of speed of acquisition integration on market-related performance is due to the fact that quick implementation reduces uncertainty faced by customers regarding product offerings, pricing policy, and contact persons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0149206311424942">Homburg &amp; Bucerius, 2005</xref>). This relationship is found to be contingent on customer orientation, relatedness of the firm’s market positioning, relative size of the acquired firms, and market growth. Management scholars, on the other hand, tend to tackle the integration issue from a knowledge-based view where knowledge regarding acquisition integration is socially complex and tacit in nature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr149-0149206311424942">Ranft &amp; Lord, 2002</xref>). Therefore, a high speed of integration jeopardizes acquisition performance by generating knowledge barriers that prevent shared experience and knowledge transfer. The theoretical mechanisms include knowledge-based processes, synergy realization, and organizational fit.</p>
<p>Researchers have explored the antecedents and process of acquisition integration speed. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0149206311424942">Haspeslagh and Jemison (1991)</xref>, for example, found that different levels of postacquisition autonomy and strategic interdependency require different speeds of integration. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr163-0149206311424942">Schweizer (2005)</xref> proposed a hybrid postacquisition integration approach for synchronizing short- and long-term motivations that result in the integration of value chain activities at different speeds. For example, when pharmaceutical firms acquired biotechnology firms, they rapidly integrated supporting and downstream value chain activities while more slowly integrating R&amp;D activities. In a similar vein, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0149206311424942">Cording et al. (2008)</xref> studied the critical role that speed of integration played during internal reorganization.</p>

<title>“Experience” role</title>
<p>Compared to the prior three roles, the experience role has received significantly more attention (77 articles). As such, we discuss the role of acquisition and alliance experience separately and then examine commonalities. While there are a variety of topics related to acquisition experience, we focus on two important research streams. The first examines the relationship between acquisition experience and performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0149206311424942">Barkema &amp; Schijven, 2008a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr124-0149206311424942">Meschi &amp; Metais, 2006</xref>). This line of research mainly draws on learning curve effects and the organizational learning literature. Although empirical findings regarding the performance implications of acquisition experience has been mixed, including positive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0149206311424942">Fowler &amp; Schmidt, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0149206311424942">Haleblian, Kim, &amp; Rajagopalan, 2006</xref>), negative (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0149206311424942">Ellis, Reus, Lamont, &amp; Ranft, in press</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr104-0149206311424942">Kusewitt, 1985</xref>), <italic>U</italic>-shaped (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0149206311424942">Haleblian &amp; Finkelstein, 1999</xref>), and nonsignificant relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0149206311424942">Hayward, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr193-0149206311424942">Zollo &amp; Singh, 2004</xref>), the plurality of studies found a positive effect of acquisition experience on firm performance. As would be expected when there are mixed results, researchers have examined a variety of contingencies affecting the experience–performance relationship. Some of the important conditions include whether accumulated acquisition experience is similar or related (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0149206311424942">Hayward, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr181-0149206311424942">Vermeulen &amp; Barkema, 2001</xref>), whether managers who possess acquisition experience can effectively transfer knowledge from their experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0149206311424942">Hebert, Very, &amp; Beamish, 2005</xref>), whether a focal acquisition is conducted in an institutionally different environment from prior acquisition experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0149206311424942">Dikova, Sahib, &amp; Witteloostuijn, 2010</xref>), and whether corporate directors are willing to shape strategic decisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr120-0149206311424942">McDonald, Westphal, &amp; Graebner, 2008</xref>). There are few studies that explore the underlying mechanisms of the experience–performance relationship. For instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr141-0149206311424942">Pablo (1994)</xref> reasoned that managers with more acquisition experience are likely to seek unique solutions rather than following familiar procedures and criteria when making integration design decisions, which subsequently enhances acquisition performance.</p>
<p>The second stream of research centers on the relationship between acquisition experience and other non-financial-performance-related outcomes such as subsequent acquisitions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0149206311424942">Haleblian et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr183-0149206311424942">Villalonga &amp; McGahan, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr187-0149206311424942">Yang &amp; Hyland, 2006</xref>), overcommitment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0149206311424942">Haunschild, Davis-Blake, &amp; Fichman, 1994</xref>), and contingent payout (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr152-0149206311424942">Reuer, Shenkar, &amp; Ragozzino, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>The relationship between alliance experience and performance has been a central focus in the alliance literature. Prior studies have found the relationship to be positive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0149206311424942">Child &amp; Yan, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr110-0149206311424942">Lavie &amp; Miller, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr155-0149206311424942">Rothaermel &amp; Deeds, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr192-0149206311424942">Zollo, Reuer, &amp; Singh, 2002</xref>), nonsignificant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0149206311424942">Garcia-Canal, Valdes-Lianeza, &amp; Arino, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr123-0149206311424942">Merchant &amp; Schendel, 2000</xref>), and <italic>U</italic>-shaped (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr159-0149206311424942">Sampson, 2005</xref>). The organizational learning perspective has been the leading theoretical lens. A generally shared view is that firms’ accumulated experience in collaborative partnering contributes to a general capability involving the selection and evaluation of partners and the management of strategic alliance processes. Scholars are increasingly adopting a contingent framework. For example, scholars have found that the alliance experience–performance relationship is influenced by the nature of the alliance, that is, whether it is equity or nonequity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0149206311424942">Anand &amp; Khanna, 2000</xref>), location of the alliance, that is, domestic versus international (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0149206311424942">Barkema, Shenkar, Vermeulen, &amp; Bell, 1997</xref>), and whether experience is partner specific or general alliance experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0149206311424942">Gulati, Lavie, &amp; Singh, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0149206311424942">Hoang &amp; Rothaermel, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr192-0149206311424942">Zollo et al., 2002</xref>). When exploring contingent effects, scholars have leveraged other theories to complement the organizational learning perspective. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr192-0149206311424942">Zollo et al. (2002)</xref>, drawing on evolutionary economics, argued that repeated interaction with the same partners facilitates the development of interorganizational routines, or stable patterns of behavior aimed at facilitating interaction and cooperation across the two organizations.</p>
<p>A few scholars have studied the underlying mechanisms of the experience–performance relationship with the aim of explaining how alliance experience affects performance. While studies in this line of inquiry are rare, their focus on mediators is shedding new light on the experience–performance relationship. For instance, research has collectively found that alliance experience helps firms enhance their alliance capability and the creation of a dedicated alliance function, which coordinates and leverages learning to enhance performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0149206311424942">Heimeriks &amp; Duysters, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0149206311424942">Heimeriks, Duysters, &amp; Vanhaverbeke, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr93-0149206311424942">Kale, Dyer, &amp; Singh, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>While scholars have focused on accounting-related performance outcomes, they have also examined the likelihood of subsequent alliances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0149206311424942">Chung, Singh, &amp; Lee, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0149206311424942">Gulati, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr188-0149206311424942">Yeniyurt, Townsend, Cavusgil, &amp; Ghauri, 2009</xref>), partner selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr113-0149206311424942">Li, Eden, Hitt, &amp; Ireland, 2008</xref>), transaction mode (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0149206311424942">Guillen, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr154-0149206311424942">Robertson &amp; Gatignon, 1998</xref>), governance choice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr153-0149206311424942">Reuer et al., 2002</xref>), collaborative know-how (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr168-0149206311424942">Simonin, 1997</xref>), and knowledge transfer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr170-0149206311424942">Simonin, 1999b</xref>).</p>

<title>“Learning” role</title>
<p>We identified 97 articles focusing on the learning role. The majority of them examine alliances rather than acquisitions as the unit of analysis. This is somewhat surprising because acquisitions provide a platform through which acquirers and targets can learn from each other across various interdependent subactivities such as negotiations, due diligence, and postintegration processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0149206311424942">Barkema &amp; Schijven, 2008a</xref>). Alliance scholars conceptualize learning objectives, processes, and outcomes as a more central temporal construct in their stream of research than acquisition scholars.</p>
<p>Rather than emphasizing a direct relationship between alliance experience and performance, studies in the learning role category explore the process of learning and how to gain or acquire knowledge from alliance partners. Key research streams within this role ask the following questions: (a) What are the antecedents of learning or knowledge transfer among alliance partners? and (b) How does learning evolve within an alliance and across multiple alliances over time?</p>
<p>The stream of research focusing on the determinants of learning is quite rich, and the empirical findings are quite consistent. There are several factors that contribute to successful learning or knowledge transfer among alliance partners. These factors, which cut across different levels of analysis, include partner characteristics, interpartner attributes, organizational structure and process, nature of knowledge, and alliance characteristics. Partner characteristics such as absorptive capability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-0149206311424942">Inkpen, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-0149206311424942">Inkpen &amp; Pien, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr103-0149206311424942">Kumar &amp; Nti, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr106-0149206311424942">Lane &amp; Lubatkin, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr132-0149206311424942">Mowery, Oxley, &amp; Silverman, 1996</xref>), learning intent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr114-0149206311424942">Lin, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr144-0149206311424942">Pérez-Nordtvedt, Kedia, Datta, &amp; Rasheed, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr171-0149206311424942">Simonin, 2004</xref>), learning orientation (cooperative vs. competitive; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0149206311424942">Hamel, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr99-0149206311424942">Khanna et al., 1998</xref>), experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr169-0149206311424942">Simonin, 1999a</xref>), and protectiveness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr171-0149206311424942">Simonin, 2004</xref>) are significant predictors of whether knowledge can be effectively acquired from the other party. Successful knowledge transfer is also affected by interpartner attributes such as mutual trust (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-0149206311424942">Inkpen &amp; Currall, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr96-0149206311424942">Kale et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr136-0149206311424942">Nielsen &amp; Nielsen, 2009</xref>), degree of interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr108-0149206311424942">Larsson, Bengtsson, Henriksson, &amp; Sparks, 1998</xref>), relative knowledge bases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-0149206311424942">Inkpen, 2000</xref>), relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-0149206311424942">Inkpen &amp; Pien, 2006</xref>), asset cospecialization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0149206311424942">Dyer, 1996</xref>), and reciprocal commitment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr133-0149206311424942">Muthusamy &amp; White, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Mechanisms such as organizational structure, process, control, and learning significantly affect the effectiveness of knowledge transfer. For example, collaborative mechanisms in terms of embeddedness and involvement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0149206311424942">Hardy, Phillips, &amp; Lawrence, 2003</xref>), group-level learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-0149206311424942">Inkpen &amp; Crossan, 1995</xref>), and structural mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-0149206311424942">Inkpen &amp; Crossan, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr94-0149206311424942">Kale &amp; Singh, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr116-0149206311424942">Lyles &amp; Salk, 1996</xref>) are found to influence knowledge sharing, transfer, and new knowledge creation.</p>
<p>The nature of knowledge has been found to be an important and consistent determinant of learning and knowledge transfer. This line of research grounded in the knowledge-based view suggests that knowledge characteristics such as its content (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr158-0149206311424942">Sammarra &amp; Biggiero, 2008</xref>), tacitness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-0149206311424942">Inkpen &amp; Pien, 2006</xref>), complexity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr170-0149206311424942">Simonin, 1999b</xref>), stickiness, and causal ambiguity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0149206311424942">Inkpen, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr171-0149206311424942">Simonin, 2004</xref>) create barriers for effective learning in alliances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr136-0149206311424942">Nielsen &amp; Nielsen, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Effective learning is influenced by the characteristics of the alliance per se. For instance, the transfer of technological know-how is enhanced in equity joint ventures as compared to contractual alliances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr132-0149206311424942">Mowery et al., 1996</xref>). Learning effects are stronger in R&amp;D joint ventures than in other JV forms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0149206311424942">Anand &amp; Khanna, 2000</xref>). Link alliances where partners contribute different capabilities lead to higher levels of learning and capability acquisition than do scale alliance in which partners contribute similar capabilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0149206311424942">Dussauge, Garrette, &amp; Mitchell, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>The above-mentioned learning and knowledge transfer determinants are often examined in combination. They usually coexist within an alliance. For instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr144-0149206311424942">Pérez-Nordtvedt et al. (2008)</xref> found that recipient learning intent mediates the relationship between knowledge characteristics and knowledge transfer between cross-border alliance partners.</p>
<p>How learning evolves and unfolds over time is a second important area of inquiry in the learning role category. Scholars in this camp frame learning within and across strategic alliances as a dynamic and emergent process that contains cyclical feedback loops. The emphasis is on the trajectory and path of learning over an alliance’s history or life course. Evolutionary economics, coevolutionary dynamics, and organizational learning are the major theoretical lenses in this research stream. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0149206311424942">Doz (1996)</xref>, for example, illustrated that effective alliance learning proceeds through a sequence of learning, reevaluation, and readjustment cycles. The whole process can be understood from a stage and learning trajectory perspective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-0149206311424942">Inkpen, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-0149206311424942">Inkpen &amp; Pien, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr97-0149206311424942">Keil, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>The evolutionary process of learning approach suggests that learning does not move in one direction along a trajectory. Instead, loops, cycles, reactions, and tensions are the main themes for effective learning to take place. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0149206311424942">Arino and Torre’s (1998)</xref> case study on the interaction of two multinational firms shows that positive feedback loops are central to the evolutionary process.</p>
<p>Alliance learning can also be seen in the context of adaptation; that is, the learning strategy within an alliance coevolves with management’s intent for the alliance and the firm’s strategic, institutional, organizational, and competitive environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr102-0149206311424942">Koza &amp; Lewin, 1998</xref>). This coevolutionary view has been applied to learning across multiple alliances as well. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr138-0149206311424942">Oliver (2001)</xref>, alliance-based learning is vital to biotechnology firms in their formative stage, when learning is associated with exploration.</p>

<title>“Sequence” role</title>
<p>The notion of sequence is an emerging topic in alliance and acquisition research (we identified two articles). While studies in the learning and experience categories sometimes allude to sequence (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0149206311424942">Doz, 1996</xref>, views alliance learning as a sequence of learning, reevaluation, and readjustment cycles and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0149206311424942">Barkema &amp; Schijven, 2008b</xref>, conceptualize sequence as a dynamic acquisition cycle), our sequence role focuses specifically on studies that frame sequence as an ordered set of initiatives carried out across time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0149206311424942">Abbott, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr164-0149206311424942">Shi &amp; Iriyama, 2010</xref>). In other words, the key questions in this role are, what is a sequence, and how and why does the order of strategic initiatives matter? A historical view of sequential activity is useful for understanding and exploring these questions. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr166-0149206311424942">Shi and Prescott’s (2011)</xref> study is an example. Drawing on historical sociology, they conceptualize a sequence as an ordered set of alliance and acquisition choices over a firm’s history and empirically identified seven different sequence patterns. They also found that firm and performance attributes differ across the sequences and are contingent on a firm’s stage of development.</p>

<sec id="section14-0149206311424942">
<title>“Rhythm” role</title>
<p>While the frequency role examines temporal constructs such as acquisition pace/rate or temporal distance between two strategic initiatives, studies in the rhythm role focus on second-order temporal characteristics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr161-0149206311424942">Scherpereel, 2006</xref>). A second-order temporal characteristic has at least one of the two attributes: (a) it has one or more functions as an input or (b) it is an output of a function. Using mathematics as an analogy, the derivative in calculus is a second-order characteristics since it maps a function to another function. Rhythm is defined as variability in the frequency of activity over a specified period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0149206311424942">Ancona &amp; Chong, 1996</xref>). Both theoretical and empirical studies are rare (we found two articles). The social entrainment model is a theoretical lens that accommodates the notion of rhythm. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr173-0149206311424942">Standifer and Bluedorn (2006)</xref>, for example, argue that alliance partners manage a variety of activities within an alliance. These activities, according to their view, are rhythmic. Therefore, one important issue for managing alliances is how to synchronize the rhythmic activities between partners. For effective coordination, a firm must manage interconnected rhythmic activities either within or across alliances and acquisitions so as to maintain a consistent relationship with each other. Theoretically, effectively entraining the activities will lead to positive outcomes.</p>

<title>Inventory of Theories and Mechanisms for Acquisition and Alliance Temporal Roles</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0149206311424942">Hedstrom and Swedberg (1998)</xref> noted that researchers would benefit from the creation of an inventory of mechanisms for a particular research domain. In response to this call, we identified the mechanisms and phrases used to explain the proposed relationships among our set of studies’ constructs. We decided to use phrases and the actual mechanisms for two reasons. First, many studies were not explicit in their identification of mechanisms but rather implicitly discussed them in the theory or discussion sections. That is, researchers often provided a descriptive explanation of the relationships among a study’s constructs. Second, by cataloguing/inventorying the mechanisms by the theories they were coupled with, the mechanisms are placed in a context rather than identified in a generic sense. For example, the learning mechanism is a generic mechanism that is used in a variety of studies covering a wide range of topics. In contrast, by identifying the specific mechanisms used with a particular time role and theory, the inventory is context based. In this way, scholars can more easily identify the mechanism used in their area of research. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0149206311424942">Table 5</xref> summarizes the major theories, and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-0149206311424942">Table 6</xref> summarizes the mechanisms.</p>

The importance of learning increases with the difficulty in specifying the process or knowledge in question. Previous relevant learning eases the acquisition and application of new related knowledge. Prior experiences enhance learning of foreign market. Management learns via experience how to consolidate firms successfully. Domestic joint ventures allow firms to learn about partnering without having to simultaneously handle the vagaries of foreign settings.

The transfer of an organization’s experience from one event to a subsequent event plays a crucial role in determining the probability of acquisition completion. Prior acquisition experience moderates the effects of market complementarity on acquisition performance. Managers probably need experience and/or skills to make successful acquisitions. Experienced firms might be in a better position to evaluate potential targets, assess sellers’ claims, and reduce the incentives for misrepresentations. Firms that leverage their experience in cross-national alliances can avoid negative transfer effects and improve their performance. Experienced acquirers, looking beyond integration, design to integration implementation. Experience is only valuable if the lessons of this experience are internalized by the firm and drawn into specific know-how that can be used to guide future actions. Joint ventures help the firm shift to wholly owned operations as it accumulates experience over time. Controlling for the usual contractual costs and risks associated with joint venturing—dissipation of intangible assets and goal conflict between the partners—the potential benefits of joint ventures are expected to decrease as the company acquires experience in the foreign location.

The knowledge transfer for expatriation in cross-border acquisition is a intricate mechanism; MNEs with little international experience are likely to benefit considerably from enlarging knowledge pool by entering culturally distant countries through acquisitions. Firm’s prior experience with collaborative partners results in spillover effects that affect choices made at the portfolio level. More partners increase the scope of knowledge the firm can access and offer more solutions to specific problems. JV parents can acquire knowledge from their partner in emerging economies through overseeing and management involvement, both of which are related to experiential and vicarious learning.

Experience accumulation will likely exert a negative effect on performance outcomes unless organizations take specific steps to reduce the occurrence and the effects of superstitious learning. As a socially embedded economic entity in search of satisfactory solutions, a firm will tend to collect information from the external parties with which it regularly interacts.

<title>Temporal constructs</title>
<p>We identified 16 temporal constructs (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0149206311424942">Table 3</xref>) across the seven temporal roles. The most frequently examined constructs are “experience” (<italic>n</italic> = 70) and “learning from” (<italic>n</italic> = 67). Rhythm (<italic>n</italic> = 1) and variability (<italic>n</italic> = 1) are the least researched constructs. Some constructs refer to the same temporal role but were operationalized in different ways. For instance, acquisition pace and temporal distance between acquisitions are both constructs used to theorize about the frequency role. Acquisition pace was measured by the average number of acquisition that a firm undertook during specific period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr105-0149206311424942">Laamanen &amp; Keil, 2008</xref>), while temporal distance was measured by the mean number of days between prior acquisitions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0149206311424942">Hayward, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>The same construct (e.g., rate) can be measured in different ways and by different temporal units. For instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr105-0149206311424942">Laamanen and Keil (2008)</xref> measured acquisition rate by the number of acquisitions that a firm engaged in during the focal and preceding 2 years. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr104-0149206311424942">Kusewitt (1985)</xref> measured the same construct by the number of acquisitions per year. In another study, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0149206311424942">Al-Laham et al. (2008)</xref> measured alliance pace by the discrete probability of a firm initiating an alliance between <italic>t</italic> and <italic>t</italic> + Δ<italic>t</italic>, conditional on the history of the process up to time <italic>t</italic>.</p>
<p>Some constructs have been operationalized in the same way but refer to different constructs. Duration, for example, is a proxy for alliance capability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0149206311424942">Gulati, 1999</xref>) and longevity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0149206311424942">Barkema et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0149206311424942">Child &amp; Yan, 2003</xref>) in the experience role, while it is conceptualized as age of the alliance in the learning role (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0149206311424942">Dussauge et al., 2000</xref>). It is clear that there is limited consensus regarding definitions of temporal constructs and their operationalization.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section18-0149206311424942">
<title>Assumptions of time</title>
<p>Consistent with prior management studies on time, an overwhelming number (<italic>n</italic> = 140 out of 144) adopted a <italic>clock time</italic> assumption, that is, “clock time depicts the continuum as linear-infinitely divisible into objectives, quantifiable units such that the units are homogeneous, uniform, regular, precise, deterministic, and measurable” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0149206311424942">Ancona, Okhuysen, et al., 2001</xref>: 514). We found that most studies assume that the acquisition/alliance <italic>event is unpredictable</italic> (<italic>n</italic> = 143). For example, in acquisition research, scholars define acquisition returns based on periods before and after the announcement of one specific acquisition event. This event is unpredictable since the next acquisition, if it occurs, is not assumed to follow in a predictable order.</p>
<p>Almost all research (<italic>n</italic> = 142) adopted an <italic>objective</italic> time assumption, that is, time is based on some external metric such as past events or historical dates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr131-0149206311424942">Mosakowski &amp; Earley, 2000</xref>) rather than on subjective human interpretation. Viewing time as objective is related to clock and event time since both are defined objectively, based on either specific dates or clock-related events. An example of the subjective assumption of time is provided by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr173-0149206311424942">Standifer and Bluedorn’s (2006</xref>: 918) study of alliance management teams. As they state, “[A]lliance members recognize the subjective temporal interpretation of each organization, given that alliances are made up of at least two entities that are in most other aspects independent of each other.”</p>
<p>Most researchers have use time as a <italic>proxy</italic> for other constructs of interests (<italic>n</italic> = 108). For example, time is a proxy for experience and learning. It usually takes time to learn (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0149206311424942">Inkpen, 2008</xref>) and build mutual trust (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr96-0149206311424942">Kale et al., 2000</xref>) and reciprocal commitment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr133-0149206311424942">Muthusamy &amp; White, 2005</xref>). In the acquisition literature, acquisition experience is usually measured by the number of acquisitions conducted between a specific period (e.g., from the past up to the time of a focal acquisition). In this vein, time is incorporated as a general background condition (i.e., proxy) against which the number of acquisitions can be counted. Others have directly incorporated time (<italic>n</italic> = 18) into their theoretical constructs and empirical measures (such as speed and pace). For example, in measuring the pace of acquisitions, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0149206311424942">Hayward (2002)</xref> operationalized temporal distance (pace) by the mean number of days between prior acquisitions. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0149206311424942">Homburg and Bucerius (2006)</xref> measured speed of integration as the length of time needed to complete the integration. When time is directly incorporated in a construct and its measures, it becomes a potential source of competitive advantage that is subject to managerial control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0149206311424942">Ancona, Goodman, Lawrence, &amp; Tushman, 2001</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section19-0149206311424942">
<title>Temporal reference point</title>
<p>Temporal reference point refers to the time orientation of decision makers, that is, whether they anchor their decisions with a referent point in the past, present, or future (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr131-0149206311424942">Mosakowski &amp; Earley, 2000</xref>). A significant majority of articles adopt a “past and present” link (<italic>n</italic> = 116 out of 144). This is partially a reflection of the experience role where scholars prescribe that corporate managers who have conducted acquisition and alliance initiatives in the past tend to achieve better performance in their current acquisition and alliance activities. In studying the question of rhythm, scholars tend to explore how past patterns of acquisition activity affect the firm’s current position (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr105-0149206311424942">Laamanen &amp; Keil, 2008</xref>). Within the strategy domain, it is widely acknowledged that one of the primary goals of strategy is to achieve sustainable competitive advantage. Similarly, for acquisition and alliance researchers and corporate managers, the main purpose of gaining experience in acquisition and alliance activity is to make better informed decisions in the future. However, it is somewhat surprising that only 24 articles (17%) incorporated a future orientation into their theory, constructs, or methods. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0149206311424942">Amburgey and Miner (1992)</xref>, for example, developed the notion of repetitive momentum and argued that prior merger patterns reinforce future merger patterns. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr166-0149206311424942">Shi and Prescott (2011)</xref> adopted a past–present–future orientation and studied how patterns of firms’ acquisition and alliance histories affect firms’ existing resource accumulations and market expectations of future performance.</p>

<title>Temporal study design</title>
<p>We identified three broad temporal study designs, that is, cross-sectional, longitudinal, and longitudinal change. We found that most studies fall within the cross-sectional (<italic>n</italic> = 81 out of 144) or longitudinal categories (<italic>n</italic> = 35 out of 144). Cross-sectional designs allow researchers to collect data from a specific period and are used in both regression-based and case-based studies. For instance, to understand key factors that lead to knowledge sharing, transfer, and new knowledge creation, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0149206311424942">Hardy et al. (2003)</xref> collected multiple collaborative cases in one organization within a 2-week period. A longitudinal study design involves data collections across different periods. For example, in serial acquirer or alliance portfolio research, data are collected over several years or panels. A longitudinal design, therefore, is an approach that accommodates firm-by-year observations. We found 9 studies that adopted a longitudinal change design. These studies tracked the specific processes of alliance and acquisition activity at different points of time and focused on either the changes per se or the process of change over time. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0149206311424942">Arino and Torre (1998)</xref> traced the change patterns of interactions between two multinational firms with the objective of understanding how their learning processes evolved over time.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section21-0149206311424942">
<title>Single versus multiple M&amp;A and alliance initiatives</title>
<p>This criterion captures whether the studies are conducted based on a single activity or multiple or serial activities. Studies that focus on experience and sequence are examples of multiple strategic initiatives since they require repeated acquisitions or alliances to constitute a firm’s experience or sequence of these activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr166-0149206311424942">Shi &amp; Prescott, 2011</xref>). Studies that explore temporal construct such as rhythm involve either single or multiple initiatives. For instance, rhythm can be defined based on a series of activities within a single alliance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr173-0149206311424942">Standifer &amp; Bluedorn, 2006</xref>) or can be conceptualized as multiple acquisitions across a firm’s history of acquisition initiatives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr105-0149206311424942">Laamanen &amp; Keil, 2008</xref>). We found that a single alliance (<italic>n</italic> = 55) and multiple alliances (<italic>n</italic> = 44) are the two most researched areas. Many studies on learning focus on understanding how learning process unfolds within a single alliance. In contrast, the number of studies that employ either a single acquisition (<italic>n</italic> = 13) or multiple acquisitions (<italic>n</italic> = 29) are fewer. Given the fact that acquisition and alliance are two different yet complementary means of corporate strategy, there are surprisingly very few studies that consider both alliance and acquisition simultaneously (<italic>n</italic> = 6). This seems to be in contrast to business reality, where firms engage in acquisition and alliance initiatives simultaneously to address different resource or organizational needs.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section22-0149206311424942">
<title>Organizational outcomes</title>
<p>We identified 13 different forms of organizational outcomes. While alliance and acquisition researchers are interested in accounting or market-based performance outcomes at both the alliance/acquisition (<italic>n</italic> = 5) and firm (<italic>n</italic> = 30) levels of analysis, they are not the dominant class of outcomes across our set of studies. Learning-related outcomes associated with knowledge transfer (<italic>n</italic> = 28), learning processes (cooperative vs. competitive, integrative learning, imitation; <italic>n</italic> = 14), and organizational structure and decision processes (<italic>n</italic> = 29) are the most prevalent. Subjective measures of success were identified in 13 studies.</p>
<p>Whether an alliance is successful (in terms other than accounting or market-based performance) is an outcome we found in 16 articles studying the stability, reorganization, longevity, and the eventual takeover of an alliance. Predictions related to the probability of an alliance/acquisition event were found in 24 studies. We found 2 articles that examined outcomes at the project level (i.e., new product launch, project IPO). Finally, outcomes related to alliance and partner characteristics (e.g., contractual form, location of alliance, industry of alliance) were the dependent variable in 7 articles.</p>

We use the prototypical study description as a point of departure for our discussion of the state of knowledge and future research directions.</p>
<sec id="section24-0149206311424942">
<title>Active Time Management of M&amp;A and Alliance Initiatives</title>
<p>Whether, how, and for which acquisition and alliance activities managers actively manage time is open to debate. On one hand there is a generally accepted belief that the initiation of most acquisitions and alliances is opportunity driven or at least involves a significant reactive or unpredictable component. On the other hand, once an acquisition or alliance is consummated, managers proactively engage in the time management of implementation. This is an interesting observation since most acquisition and alliance temporal studies are not process based or implementation oriented or examine change longitudinally. While there is no inherent contradiction between the temporal management of initiatives and the opportunity-driven approach, we know little about whether firms temporally manage acquisition and alliance programs, how managers link time and resource allocation decisions, and the design of temporal-based coordinating mechanisms.</p>
<p>Given that most large firms have corporate development or alliance management programs unless they operate in an opportunity-driven manner, it would seem that temporal issues would be a topic of frequent discussion and analysis. For example, how do firms internally <italic>synchronize</italic> and coordinate multiple alliances and acquisitions given resource constraints, bounded rationality, temporal styles, and potentially conflicting objectives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0149206311424942">Butler, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr173-0149206311424942">Standifer &amp; Bluedorn, 2006</xref>)? Do firms develop an <italic>entrainment</italic> management capability where they can quickly identify and appropriately respond to the acquisition and alliance time orientation of competitors, governments, and other relevant stakeholders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr137-0149206311424942">Ofori-Dankwa &amp; Julian, 2001</xref>)? More fundamentally, studies of the role of time in M&amp;A and alliance decision-making processes would shed considerable light on how managers perceive and apply time as a source of competitive advantage.</p>
<p>Since M&amp;A and alliances initiatives are central to the growth and change of firms, they are central to the top management team and leadership literatures (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0149206311424942">Carpenter, Geletkanycz, &amp; Sanders, 2004</xref>), which should be more fully integrated with time-based research. For example, since significant components of acquisition/alliance–performance relationships are causally ambiguous, managers are likely to develop biases, faulty assumptions, and heuristics regarding the temporal management of M&amp;As and alliances. Yet we know little about this topic. A few other promising research directions include the following: What are the most effective ways to educate managers regarding a time-based management approach to acquisition and alliance initiatives? Are there particular leadership characteristics and attributes that are associated with a temporal perspective? How does CEO turnover affect a firm’s acquisition and alliance temporal strategy?</p>

<title>Direct Conceptualization and Measurement of Time Constructs</title>
<p>Data supporting the crafting of our prototypical study show that an overwhelming majority of our articles (75%) used proxies rather than conceptualizing time and its operationalizations directly. It’s time for time to take center stage. In other words, acquisition and alliance researchers have not anchored their research questions directly in the time-based literature. Rather, time has an epiphenomenal conceptualization, and as such time is often equated with the counting of events (number of alliances), and time constructs (such as experience) become proxies for other constructs (such as knowledge or trust). From a construct validity perspective, an epiphenomenal approach requires careful theorizing to ensure that there is a close link between the intended meaning of constructs and their operationalization. It is not clear that the leap of logic used in many studies is adequately established. For example, having multiple experiences in making acquisitions does not necessarily mean that substantive learning has occurred.</p>
<p>In this regard, we examined the references of our 144 articles as an indicator of the degree that the theoretical time-based literature is embedded in our sample. It is interesting and informative that only 2 articles cited at least one of the following management-oriented time-based theoretical articles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0149206311424942">Ancona, Goodman, Lawrence, &amp; Tushman, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0149206311424942">Ancona, Okhuysen, et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0149206311424942">Bluedorn &amp; Dernhardt, 1988</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0149206311424942">2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0149206311424942">Butler, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0149206311424942">Carlstein, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0149206311424942">George &amp; Jones, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr121-0149206311424942">McGrath &amp; Rotchford, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr131-0149206311424942">Mosakowski &amp; Earley, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr137-0149206311424942">Ofori-Dankwa &amp; Julian, 2001</xref>). We strongly recommend that the theoretical time-based literature be drawn on when conceptualizing M&amp;A and alliance temporal empirical studies. There is a significant opportunity for temporal theorizing in the M&amp;A and alliance streams of research.</p>
<p>Having identified a significant gap in the literature, there are several promising research directions for the direct conceptualization and measurement of time constructs. Directly studying time constructs such as speed, pace, rhythm, and sequence is important because they are subject to management control, and how they are managed can inform us as to their impact on organizational outcomes.</p>
<sec id="section26-0149206311424942">
<title>Research on cross-temporal roles</title>
<p>Whenever a researcher designs and collects data related to a particular temporal role, it creates an opportunity to explore research questions related to other temporal roles. For example, a study that measures the frequency of alliances is a direct measure of activity. Directly asking how frequency (activity) is related to performance might be an initial research question. However, depending on how the frequency data are collected, researchers could also examine questions related to speed of activity, temporal distance between activity, and pace of activity among others.</p>
<p>There is ample opportunity to conduct cross-role research. Taking the learning role as an example, many existing learning studies focus on how learning occurs within a specific alliance or how learning processes unfold over the history of an alliance. At most, a few studies examine how firms’ alliance experience affects learning mechanisms, that is, the way firms learn (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0149206311424942">Finkelstein &amp; Haleblian, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0149206311424942">Heimeriks et al., 2007</xref>) or learning effectiveness in the form of knowledge acquisition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-0149206311424942">Inkpen, 2000</xref>). In this respect, we use <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0149206311424942">Heimeriks et al.’s (2007)</xref> study as an example of how one can incorporate multiple temporal role categories. Heimeriks et al. found that firms with extensive alliance experience make relatively more use of institutionalized learning mechanisms. However, firms’ prior alliance experience is developed or accumulated in very different ways. Firm A might have initiated two alliances every year over the past 10 years, while Firm B conducted most of its alliances very recently. In other words, these two firms developed a portfolio of alliances based on different rhythms. In the case of Firm A, knowledge regarding alliance partners and how to manage alliances accumulated incrementally, and the institutionalization process would likely have taken time to refine, modify, and adjust, while in the case of Firm B, knowledge accumulated in a short period and the institutionalization process would likely have focused on major change rather than incremental refinements. Both institutionalization processes are well suited to distinctive external environment, Firm A for stable environments and Firm B for high-velocity environments. Only by looking at the interactions among the experience, learning, and rhythm roles can such a distinction be studied.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section27-0149206311424942">
<title>Direct measurement of temporal constructs</title>
<p>Our review revealed that the experience and learning roles are the most popular temporal topics. Yet most of the studies have not directly measured either construct (e.g., learning is equated with trust or reciprocal commitment). Part of the reason why proxies have been used is the use of archival data sources such as the SDC database. However, there is more to the story since one can use databases and measure constructs directly. For example, experience is a direct measure of activity or duration of involvement. When researchers equate activity proxies to learning or knowledge, the relationship is tenuous since managers and firms can have experience and not learn or learn without having experience.</p>
<p>Taking a lead from the learning role, researchers in the experience role might ask questions related to the antecedents and outcomes of alliance/acquisition activity or duration. The experience role would also benefit from increased use of surveys and case studies to better understand underlying experience processes and outcomes. For example, while we know that experience affects the pace of future acquisitions, we do not know why or how this finding exists. A common view is that experience enhances a firm’s acquisition routines, which reduces the time needed to initiate a new acquisition. If experience increases the acquisition pace, what types of routines are relevant to this enhancement? Existing literature tends to focus on the exploitive side of routines that help to identify and evaluate targets with little emphasis on the explorative side of routines to proactively search for novel types of acquisition targets.</p>

<sec id="section28-0149206311424942">
<title>Research on second-order temporal constructs</title>
<p>Since little research has focused on longitudinal change, we encourage researchers to direct attention to second-order temporal constructs, their antecedents, and their impact on firm performance. Second-order temporal constructs involve the complex nature of change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0149206311424942">Bartunek &amp; Moch, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr161-0149206311424942">Scherpereel, 2006</xref>). For instance, first-order temporal constructs include experience, frequency, speed, and pace, to name a few. The notions of variability and rhythm belong to the category of second-order temporal constructs. A firm’s rhythm or variability of alliance and acquisition develops over time. It is indeed emergent, dynamic, incremental, and embedded within a system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr148-0149206311424942">Quinn, 1980</xref>). For example, it is relatively easy to formulate a fast-paced acquisition strategy (given resource constraints) by simply increasing the number of acquisitions. However, developing an acquisition strategy that entails a semipredictable rhythmic pattern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr166-0149206311424942">Shi &amp; Prescott, 2011</xref>) is significantly more complex and socially ambiguous. A rhythm approach requires firms to accumulate knowledge regarding when to accelerate and when to slow down their acquisition initiatives. Firms also need to embrace the historical conditions that constrain or facilitate the emergence of a particular acquisition rhythm pattern. In other words, corporate managers who aim to develop an acquisition rhythm pattern not only need to know that time matters but also how and why time matters. While the development of such second-order temporal patterns is difficult and requires consistent managerial attention and resource commitment, once formed it becomes difficult for competitors to imitate.</p>
<p>The same notion might also apply to a single alliance. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr173-0149206311424942">Standifer and Bluedorn (2006)</xref> argued that alliance partners might develop a temporal rhythm within an alliance so that activities for each partner can be coordinated. In this sense, rhythm becomes a temporal coordination mechanism for the involved parties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0149206311424942">Ancona &amp; Chong, 1996</xref>) as well as other relevant parties (such as logistical teams). Developing such a rhythm requires alliance partners to engage in ongoing interaction so they have the ability to establish the “right” pace at the “right” time, which subsequently helps “proactive planning efforts and timely implementation of key activities” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr173-0149206311424942">Standifer &amp; Bluedorn, 2006</xref>: 916). Given that the process of achieving such a rhythm is usually conditional on collaborative history, interaction pattern, and the intertwining of subsystems, formulating such a rhythm can become a critical mechanism for sustaining a competitive edge over competitors.</p>

<title>Leverage a subjective time assumption</title>
<p>As with previous reviews of the time literature, we see value in adopting a subjective time assumption to complement the current objective view. Within our set of 144 articles, only 2 employed a subjective assumption. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0149206311424942">Das (1987)</xref>, among others, emphasizes that individuals differ in their experience of time. His empirical study revealed that decision makers who have a current time orientation prefer a shorter planning horizon than those who have a future time orientation. In other words, time is essentially in the eye of beholder and varies across individuals and contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0149206311424942">Durkheim, 1921/1965</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0149206311424942">Eliade, 1963</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0149206311424942">Hall, 1983</xref>). In addition to a future versus short-term time orientation, individuals also differ with respect to how they interpret experience, pace (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr127-0149206311424942">Mohammed &amp; Nadkarni, 2011</xref>), rhythm, and temporal fit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr167-0149206311424942">Shipp &amp; Jansen, 2011</xref>). For example, if two corporate managers each conducted 10 acquisitions over the past 5 years, the manager who has a fast-paced mind-set might perceive the 5 years of acquisition experience very differently from the one who has a slow-paced mind-set. Understanding and exploring such a difference based on a subjective view of time can shed new light on decision making for serial acquirers or the developers of alliance portfolios. An interesting extension might be to embrace the role of economy, geography, culture, and institutions in the temporal acquisition and alliance literature and explore how decision makers’ time orientations are shaped by their origins of birth, the cultural norms of countries or regions in which they gained managerial experience, and the institution where their firms were founded.</p>

<title>Framing M&amp;A and Alliance Temporal Research</title>
<p>Frames of reference for a field provide an organizing structure. We identify three frames that have the potential to significantly affect temporal research in the M&amp;A and alliance stream of research. While we do not claim these are the only frames, they are the result of our assessment of the literature.</p>
<p>We recommend scholars frame acquisitions and alliances as two interrelated rather than separate strategic initiatives.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0149206311424942">5</xref></sup> This combined approach has both theoretical and managerial implications for temporal research. For example, theoretically, different corporate initiatives have their own distinctive pace, cycles, and rhythm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0149206311424942">Ancona &amp; Chong, 1996</xref>). An important temporal question is whether firms should synchronize acquisitions and alliances along the temporal line given that managerial capacity is subject to time compression diseconomies. In this respect, what are the consequences of a (mis)synchronization of acquisition and alliance activity in terms of performance, capability building, and other outcomes? There are sound reasons to explore these questions. For instance, scholars agree that acquisitions and alliances have a high degree of interdependence. Knowledge from each type of activity can cross-fertilize, spill over to, or reinforce the value of the other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr192-0149206311424942">Zollo et al., 2002</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr184-0149206311424942">L. Wang and Zajac (2007)</xref> found that knowledge from prior alliances/acquisitions helps firms in future alliances/acquisitions. Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr191-0149206311424942">Zollo and Reuer (2010)</xref> argued that alliance capabilities and processes such as due diligence, partner selection, negotiation, and evaluation are quite similar to those of acquisitions. When synchronizing acquisitions and alliances, managers can apply their most recently acquired knowledge of one activity to inform the other.</p>
<p>Our second framing recommendation is that researchers assess and explicitly communicate their temporal research questions and designs with respect to the temporal roles and evaluation criteria summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0149206311424942">Table 3</xref>. The goal of recommending framing studies in terms of the temporal criteria is to achieve congruency between theory and empirics as well as establish boundary conditions and system states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0149206311424942">Dubin, 1978</xref>). We use <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0149206311424942">Al-Laham et al.’s (2008)</xref> study as an example. Their primary research question was to understand how alliance experience affects alliance capability, which further determines the frequency of subsequent alliance formation. In the article, an integrated past–present–future temporal reference point is implied. This is consistent with management scholars’ assertion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0149206311424942">Butler, 1995</xref>: 946) that “time, as we experience it in the present, can only have meaning in relation to our understanding of the past and our vision of the future.” This type of logic is well reflected in their study’s design where they trace 847 biotechnology alliances from 1973 to 1999 and their outcomes. Instead of using a frequency measure, they used a discrete probability measure, which, as they state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0149206311424942">Al-Laham et al., 2008</xref>: 351), “summarizes the information on the intervals between successive events . . . by <italic>looking ahead in time</italic> and given the <italic>history of the events</italic> the firm experienced so far.”</p>
<p>The above type of logic needs to be consistently followed by scholars when they engage in temporal research. For instance, if a researcher’s goal is to understand how the life cycle of firms’ acquisition and alliance activity affects their resource endowment and sustainable competitive advantage, a cyclic time assumption needs to be clearly articulated as well as a past–present–future temporal reference point. By doing so, relevant theories and methods can be identified to accommodate temporal subcriteria choices. For example, the resource-based view of strategy emphasizes the past and future while paying less attention to the present (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr131-0149206311424942">Mosakowski &amp; Earley, 2000</xref>). Therefore, a historical sociology perspective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0149206311424942">Abbott, 1998</xref>) that stresses how a current position is shaped, constrained, and facilitated by sequential activities over a historical period complements the resource-based view in understanding and exploring how the life course of strategic initiatives influences future initiatives and competitive advantage. This requires that relevant methodologies be debated and compared. For example, the resource-based view might focus on longitudinal change constructs and methods and outcome variables that are future oriented (such as market expectations). Similarly, historical sociology might pay more attention to the sequence of alliance and acquisition initiatives of firms over their life course. Sequence methodologies such as optimal matching techniques (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0149206311424942">Abbott, 1998</xref>) are one approach for generating patterns of acquisition and alliance trajectories and how they affect firms’ current and future strategic positions.</p>
<p>Our third recommended frame is a contextual time frame. When time is considered as a contextual background, it is essentially framed in terms of an era (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-0149206311424942">Johns, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr111-0149206311424942">Lenz &amp; Engledow, 1986</xref>). Within an era, “time affects the web of social and economic relationships that surround any aspect of organizational behavior” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-0149206311424942">Johns, 2006</xref>: 392). Thus, how an era affects the relationships among temporal constructs and M&amp;A and alliances initiatives warrants study. For example, the role of learning in alliances was relatively ignored until the late 1980s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0149206311424942">Hamel, 1991</xref>) and has become one of the most researched areas, as illustrated in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0149206311424942">Table 3</xref>. How M&amp;A and alliance initiatives are affected in an era of the rise of BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa) economies, which have different time orientations than those in North America and Europe, on which most research has been based, is an opportunity-rich research area. Regardless of the research question, applying historical methods as part of the analysis and interpretation of M&amp;A and alliances research would enrich our understanding of the role of time.</p>
<p>Our current era of M&amp;A and alliance research has focused on large public firms. Yet most M&amp;As and alliances are conducted in small private firms. One has to wonder how our knowledge of the temporal aspects of M&amp;A and alliance research would be supplemented or different if researchers had ready access to small private deals. While this may be a difficult research domain in which to collect data, it is likely to have a significant payoff. Our reference to the BRICS countries above is also relevant to this point in a slightly different way since many of the firms in these countries have strong ties or are owned by the government, meaning data are often unavailable or questionable. If the BRICS firms continue their global expansion, they will most likely be involved in increasing numbers of M&amp;A and alliances. How will they temporally manage these initiatives?</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Our overall conclusion is that it is an exciting time to be researching temporal questions in the M&amp;A and alliance arena since there is a rich research base and many important and interesting research questions need to be addressed. Our inventory of the theories and mechanisms used in M&amp;A and alliance temporal research is a resource that future researchers can leverage to explicitly incorporate temporal roles and evaluation criteria as part of their research design choices. Finally, we think that our approach can inform and apply to other streams of research in the fields of strategic management, organization theory, and organizational behavior.</p>

<label>1.</label><p>A growing body of research highlights issues such as hubris, empire building (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr130-0149206311424942">Morck, Shleifer, &amp; Vishny, 1990</xref>), and whacky incentives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr160-0149206311424942">Sanders &amp; Hambrick, 2007</xref>) as alternative explanations for engaging in mergers and acquisitions (M&amp;As) and alliances. While there is considerable merit to these arguments, we assume that M&amp;As and alliances are primarily initiated for the purpose of building, maintaining, and sustaining competitive advantage and secondarily driven by self-interested behavior on the part of managers. The two positions are not mutually exclusive. We thank a thoughtful reviewer for identifying these two positions.</p>
</fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn2-0149206311424942">
<label>2.</label><p>Pace and rate are often used interchangeably in the literature, For consistency, we use the term <italic>pace</italic>, except in those cases where the author(s) used the term <italic>rate</italic> in their original article.</p>
</fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn3-0149206311424942">
<label>3.</label><p>We devoted considerable time to identifying and discussing the criteria and their definitions. We each coded the same five randomly selected articles and then had extensive discussions to resolve any questions. Across the set of 144 articles, there were five occasions where there was a coding question that resulted in a disagreement among the authors. Discussions among the three authors resolved the disagreements.</p>
</fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn4-0149206311424942">
<label>4.</label><p>We developed the prototypical study using two approaches. First, we used the frequency counts from <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0149206311424942">Table 3</xref> to identify commonalities/patterns across the 144 studies. Second, we conducted various cluster analyses using the evaluation criteria for each study. The cluster analysis produced two clusters formed around the learning and experience roles. Our purpose is to summarize in one sentence the preponderance of the temporal-based literature rather than claim definitive empirical results.</p>
</fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn5-0149206311424942">
<label>5.</label><p>There is a rich research stream in the international business area that focuses on the role of acquisitions and alliances in international expansion, international entry, and entry modes. In many of these studies, acquisitions and alliances are comingled in their samples. Therefore, they did not fit our criterion of being able to separately identify results relating to acquisitions from those relating to alliances. We do think that the international expansion literature warrants a review. We thank an anonymous reviewer for bringing this point to our attention.</p>
