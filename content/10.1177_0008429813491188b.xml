<p>Students and teachers of gnosticism have up until now been at a disadvantage in lacking a really solid, introductory textbook. This lack is all the more serious because of gnosticism’s complex position and presentation. In the ancient world it often was, and at times in the modern world it has been, treated with derision and polemics; on the other hand, many of its defenders in the modern world have taken it up in an uncritical, ahistorical or insufficiently contextualized way. (The gnostics themselves might not have objected to this, but we as scholars certainly do!) Denzey’s book focuses on the extant primary sources and uses those sources as a means to understand the range of ideas that fall under the gnostic umbrella. With an ease and clarity that comes from having taught about gnosticism for many years, she presents a nuanced but comprehensible take on the material, delivered in very readable prose.</p>
<p>Denzey does especially good work in using the Nag Hammadi texts to expose readers to a wide range of Christian and related literature of late antiquity. She sheds light on a range of issues that often arise in early Christian writing, including the importance of claims to apostolic authority, canonicity, and the function of ritual. By her exposing the literary and religious contexts within which these writings were transmitted, students are not only given a fuller understanding of the Nag Hammadi writings, but are also encouraged to see them simply as early Christian literature, freeing them from the “gnostic ghetto,” as she also works to do, for instance, in her discussion of Valentinianism in its second-century Roman Christian context.</p>
<p>Her book is broken down into twenty chapters. The first four are preliminary, introducing the Nag Hammadi collection, the debates over the meaning of gnosticism, and the Roman empire and the position of Christianity in the second century, the period in which scholars believe that most of the extant gnostic writings were composed. Additionally, chapter 6 also gives background information on Valentinianism. The rest of the chapters focus on specific texts from the Nag Hammadi collection, dealing with them, for example, in terms of their doctrinal features, their genres, or their social positioning. Thus we find chapters dealing with Valentinian gospels, apocalyptic literature, the presence of Hermetic literature in a predominantly Christian collection, works that portray the divine in feminine terms, and so on. Each chapter ends with questions for students to consider, a list of key terms, and sources for further reading.</p>
<p>One of the most difficult issues to navigate in teaching about gnosticism is the eternal question of the meaning of “g/Gnosticism,” especially when the contrast between scholarly, heresiological, and popular usage of the term or reference to the ideas is taken into account. The expectations that students will likely bring into the classroom, whether based on readings of New Age literature, the novels of Philip K. Dick, viewings of <italic>The Matrix</italic>, or warnings of conservative religious groups, often do not correspond very well to the scholarly debates over gnosticism. Denzey does good work in first of all laying out a “lowest common denominator” definition of gnosticism, cleverly drawing on a scene from <italic>The Matrix</italic> to do so, and then following that up by introducing students to some of the different definitions and the issues surrounding these definitions.</p>
<p>Denzey’s work is based on the Nag Hammadi collection. As is proper, Denzey focuses on the writings found in these thirteen codices, which represent our largest primary source collection of gnostic documents, uncontaminated as far as we can tell by the interpolations and polemics of heresiologists. However, in reading through her book I felt that this fourth-century Egyptian collection of Coptic texts and its context were insufficiently discussed, being used more as a means of gaining access to the sometimes hypothetical second-century Greek texts that are assumed to lie behind the extant works than as a collection and a source of information in its own right. Time permitting, instructors will want to incorporate more discussion of the fourth-century Egyptian religious context of this collection and encourage the students to see it as a point in the gnostic “trajectory” that is as fascinating as any of the hypothetical second-century points. Although the Nag Hammadi collection itself tells us precious little about its collectors, there is material from other sources—especially monastic, Hermetic, and Manichaean sources—that can flesh things out for us and our students.</p>
<p>Overall, this book is highly recommended. It clearly and gracefully fills a long-standing gap in the field.</p>
