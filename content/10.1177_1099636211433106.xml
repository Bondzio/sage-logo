<p>The damage mechanisms in sandwich plates with polymer foam cores are investigated. There has been a long-standing controversy on what is the weakest element of sandwich plates, the skin-core bonding or the foam core. Under four-point bending of a sandwich plate, we found that in all cases cracks are nucleated inside the polymer foam core as monitored by a high-speed camera. Several separated small cracks develop in the core; then the small cracks are connected and form the main crack that propagates through the core. We complemented the optical recording by the acoustic emission study which provides an additional insight in the fracture process. In addition, the influence of sub-zero temperature of the ultimate load of each material is examined at discrete values of sub-zero temperature. The results revealed that both materials become increasingly brittle with decreasing temperature.</p>

<sec id="sec1-1099636211433106" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>In recent years, sandwich plates with so-called construction foam cores have become a common element of engineering structures. Foam materials exist either in the form of metal-based materials or polymer-based materials, or hybrid-based materials. Metal foams are relatively new with outstanding mechanical and physical properties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1099636211433106">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1099636211433106">2</xref>]. Metal foams are porous materials with unique combinations of thermal, mechanical, acoustic, and electrical properties desirable in many engineering applications. Examples of metal foam materials include aluminum foam, titanium foam and lead foam. Open-cell foams made by replication techniques are well suited to control foam uniformity and other parameters such as cell shape, cell size and relative density [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1099636211433106">3</xref>]. Examples of polymer-based materials include polyurethane (PU), polymethacrylimide (PMI), expanded polystyrene (EPS) foam and polyetherimide (PEI). Hybrid-based material foams include bioactive glass–polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), phenolic foams reinforced with glass and rubber, and nanoclay-reinforced hybrid syntactic foams. The present work deals with sandwich plates with polymer foam core and thus a brief assessment of results pertaining to polymer foam behavior under different types of loading is presented in this section.</p>
<p>There are different types of damage mechanisms in composite materials under stress loading. Among these are fiber or second-phase failure, delamination, matrix cracking and debonding of phases. Among the effective tools used in monitoring the development of material damage is the acoustic emission (AE) technique. The AE offers a tool for detecting damage, such as cracking, as it occurs on or in a structure. In order to gain meaningful information from AE analyses, the damage must be localized. Drouillard and Hamstad [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1099636211433106">4</xref>] and Hamstad [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1099636211433106">5</xref>] provided an assessment of detecting the damage occurrences in composites using the technique of AE. This technique is based on monitoring the stress waves generated by rapid local redistributions of stress associated with many damage mechanisms.</p>
<p>Compact tension specimens of rigid PU foam were tested in fatigue by Noble [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1099636211433106">6</xref>]. Crack growth was monitored using AE. During the load cycle, the AE activity was decomposed into four regions: the crack faces “un-sticking,” fracture events at or close to peak load, a period of zero AE just after peak load, and AE associated with crack closure lower down the unloading part of the cycle. The fracture was found to increase rapidly with crack length. Microcrazing in the struts of flexible PU foams was observed during compressive deformation and observed directly in the scanning electron microscope [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1099636211433106">7</xref>]. Attributed to this phenomenon was the decrease in stress at maximum compression and the intensity of AE during compressive cycling. The higher content of styrene–acrylonitrile copolymer in these foams resulted in higher modulus, more severe microcrazing, an increase in AE activity and a decrease in the stress at maximum compression as cycling progressed. Charca et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1099636211433106">8</xref>] conducted quasi-static and flexural fatigue tests on PU foam-core sandwich composites monitored in-situ with the AE sensors. Their results revealed that core shear and tearing were the predominant failure mechanisms that lead to eventual catastrophic failure. The foam-core sandwich composite lifetime underwent substantial reduction as a function of increasing stress level according to the S–N curve. Flexural fatigue endurance was beyond a 500,000 cycle arbitrarily established cutoff below 60% of the ultimate static load.</p>
<p>Foam-core composites with different types of skin architectures were considered by Vaidya et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1099636211433106">9</xref>]. Plain weave, satin weave and hybridized skins utilizing non-woven carbon mats were cured with PMI foam cores. The failure modes of the various foam-core composites at the skin, skin-to-core interface and the core under three-point loading were assessed in light of AE testing parameters and rapid vibration-based elastic moduli measurements. In situ AE and posttest microscopic analysis of quasi-static and flexural fatigue testing of sandwich composites conducted by Shafiq and Quispitupa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1099636211433106">10</xref>] indicated core damage to be the predominant failure activity, while fiber rupture served as a precursor to catastrophic failure. The study revealed that multiple crack initiation sites were observed under fatigue-loading conditions in the vicinity of the notch tip. Both modes I and II cracking were observed in the core and along the interface between the core and the face sheets. Damage assessment of foam-core sandwich composite panels due to slamming water was studied by Charca and Shafiq [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1099636211433106">11</xref>] as a function of slamming energy (161–779 J) and deadrise angle (0–45°). They found that higher slamming energy and lower deadrise angle resulted in greater damage to the material. Catastrophic failure was observed to occur beyond a threshold strain of 0.0035 mm/mm. Core shear along the interface with the face-sheets and local buckling of the face-sheet and resin fragmentation were observed to be the dominant modes of failure under slamming.</p>
<p>Deschanel et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1099636211433106">12</xref>] reported tensile failure experiments on PU foams by imposing a constant strain rate. For heterogeneous materials, the failure does not occur suddenly and can develop as a multistep process through a succession of microcracks that end at pores. The acoustic energy and the waiting times between acoustic events follow power-law distributions. This remains true, while the foam density is varied. Tensile tests at different temperatures (from room temperature down to −65°C) were performed by Deschanel et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1099636211433106">12</xref>] on PU foams of relative density 0.58. It was found that the foam becomes increasingly brittle with decreasing temperature. The Young’s modulus was found to increase as the temperature decreases, likewise the maximum stress which almost doubles between room temperature and −65°C. It was reported that the plastic plateau disappears with decreasing temperature, and that the failure strain is less important as the material becomes more brittle. The behavior in AE at room temperature and at −10°C was found almost identical, where acoustic activity begins late when the material is already in the plastic plateau stage and a divergence of the number of AE events occurs at the end. On the contrary, for the tensile tests at −30°C and −65°C, the AE activity was found to start at the very beginning, indicating the early occurrence of damage. The number of events rises gradually as the load increases.</p>
<p>Related to the present study is the work of Soni et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1099636211433106">13</xref>] who examined the bending behavior of foam-cored sandwich beams having carbon/epoxy skin and glass/epoxy skin, from room temperature to −60°C. They were unable to identify the actual progression of material failure due to the lack of high-speed imaging capabilities. With more focus on the mechanism of failure, this deficiency has been rectified in the present study, and more detailed AE testing is performed. The failure mechanisms mentioned above can occur at numerous locations throughout a composite beginning at very low stress levels. Gibson [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1099636211433106">14</xref>] in his simplified analysis of core shear failure in foam-cored sandwich beams noted that, ordinarily, the core would shear from the midplane, but local stress concentrations near bearing points could move the initiation point away from the mid-plane.</p>
<p>The main objective of the present work is to resolve a long-standing controversy: What is the weakest element of sandwich plates with polymer foam core, the skin-core bonding or the foam core? The problem is that the cracks, developed in the sandwich, go through both the core and the skin-core bonding. If the loading rate is low (0.002 inch/s), like in fatigue experiments, then it was observed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1099636211433106">13</xref>] that cracks are nucleated inside the core. If the loading rate is higher (0.005 inch/s), then it becomes unclear where the crack started: The cracks propagate so fast that it is hard to detect the place where the crack was nucleated, in the core or in the skin-bonding area. We study the fracture process in four-point bending of a sandwich plate with PMI foam core and two types of skin, unidirectional carbon-fiber/epoxy and woven glass-fiber/epoxy. The tests are conducted at room and sub-zero temperatures to determine the influence of temperature on the failure mode. To observe the nucleation process, we use a high-speed camera. We complemented the optical recording by the AE study, which provides an additional insight in the fracture process. In addition, we examined the influence of sub-zero temperature of the ultimate load of each material at discrete values of sub-zero temperature.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec2-1099636211433106"><title>Test specimens and equipment</title>
<p>Two test specimens of different sandwich materials are used. Both specimens have the same core material, which is PMI, Rohacell 71 Industrial Grade (IG), foam. This material is homogeneous and isotropic and has 100% closed cells. The core of the first specimen is bounded by two skins made of unidirectional-lay T300/A534 graphite fibers. The skins of the second are made of woven glass fibers of the type 3-ply 7781 style E-glass fiber/epoxy fabric laminate with weave pattern of 8 Harness Satin (HS) of which the warp and fill yarns running at 0° and 90° with the length, respectively. The dimensions of each specimen are 8 inches (203 mm) long, 1 inch (25.4 mm) wide and 0.556 inch (14.1 mm) thick. The core thickness is 0.5 inch (12.7 mm) thick, while each skin has a thickness of 0.028 inch (0.7 mm).</p>
<p>Static four-point bending tests are conducted following the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) standard C 393-00 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1099636211433106">15</xref>] to check for possible core shear failure under static loading. The tests are performed using an EnduraTec servopneumatic testing machine, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1099636211433106">Figure 1</xref>. Seven geometrically identical beams of each specimen are tested to establish repeatability. The rollers are positioned symmetrically 40 mm apart, leaving 41.5 mm overhang at each end. Support and loading rollers are of 0.315 inches (8 mm) diameter to avoid local indentation failure. Tests are conducted with displacement control at a crosshead speed of 0.005 inch/s (0.127 mm/s) until failure. The EnduraTec Win-Test software is used to control the applied load to preserve the prescribed crosshead speed.

<p>Miniature Physical Acoustics Co. (PAC) pico-AE piezoelectric sensors are utilized to gather AE data synchronously acquired with mechanical load–deflection data as static four-point bending tests are carried out on the beams at room temperature (22°C). The AE data acquisition and control unit is a DisP-4 four-channel Physical Acoustics AE-Win system. The results for the two materials are discussed next.</p></sec>

<p>Since AE is the transient release of elastic waves, both AE energy and its amplitude have been primarily adopted to represent the in-structure damage state during loading and unloading. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1099636211433106">Figure 2(a)</xref> and (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1099636211433106">c</xref>) show these parameters in one-to-one correspondence to the load–deflection diagram and AE release suggests more details of the damage process. The load–deflection diagram shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1099636211433106">Figure 2(a)</xref> reveals that an initial elastic deformation region “a-c” is followed by a yielding point “c.” The load–deflection curve experiences a non-monotonic trend during which the load reaches its peak value at point “d,” then the deflection increases substantially over the plateau region “d-g,” which spans a significant part of the beam deformation. At “g,” the beam experiences a major crack manifested by a major load drop. It is difficult to identify the instant at which the AE emanates from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1099636211433106">Figure 2(a)</xref>, and for this reason, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1099636211433106">Figure 2(b)</xref> is generated for a stretched small time interval (from 0 to 0.1 s). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1099636211433106">Figure 2(b)</xref> reveals that below a threshold value of the applied load (very close to point “a”) and over a very short period of time from 0 to 0.025 s there is no AE detected.
<fig id="fig2-1099636211433106" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p>Time evolution of (a) acoustic emission (AE) energy and load–deflection plot for carbon sandwich beam, (b) AE energy vs time magnification over 0.1 s and (c) AE amplitude–time record of the carbon fiber sandwich beam.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1099636211433106-fig2.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>Some notable points in the test response have been marked by letters “a, b, … , g.” Point “a” is the first with AE amplitude value above the set threshold (45 dB AE), “b” is the point above which the AE begins to increase, and over the region “cd” the AE energy increases monotonically, until it experiences a slight drop up to point “g,” where a significant AE energy release is detected accompanied by the occurrence of a major crack. Point “f” represents a typical instance within the plastic zone. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1099636211433106">Figure 2(c)</xref> displays the AE amplitude-time record and shows similar characteristics as the energy plot, and can equally well be used for comparison with the load curve.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1099636211433106">Figure 3</xref> shows the waveform of AE during the occurrence of the load-drop, point “g” in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1099636211433106">Figure 2(a)</xref>. The characteristic of the “burst” type of emission is evident. Burst emissions are symptomatic of cracks, and the prominent ones, as revealed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1099636211433106">Figure 3</xref>, signify large cracks. This is consistent with the physical observation shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1099636211433106">Figure 2(a)</xref>.

<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1099636211433106">Figure 4</xref> shows the distribution of peak frequency for the carbon sandwich test, based on the AE-Win software which uses the fast fourier transform. The peak frequency is an important parameter for characterizing the types of failure. It is seen that there are two bands of frequencies over the entire test duration. The first is the low-frequency region in the neighborhood of 200 KHz, which characterizes one type of foam core crack. The second is close to 1250 KHz, which signifies another type of damage belonging to some fiber failure of the skin, which is not visually observed. In the beginning of loading, there are clusters of frequencies between these two frequency bands. It appears that the initiation of micro-cracks is manifested by clusters of frequency points in the early duration of the test (over the period approximately 0–25 s). Similar types of failure tend to be grouped together at the same frequency or frequency band. The low-frequency band is modified as time progresses, mainly toward the lower fraction of the band, showing how these relatively<?twb?> very low-frequency events come to dominate. Now, low-frequency events (having high amplitudes) signify cracks, and high-frequency events (having high amplitudes) signify skin fiber damages and breaks.

<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1099636211433106">Figure 5</xref> is a three-dimensional plot of the evolution of frequency and amplitude of AE. It shows the progression of damage in the tested carbon sandwich sample. The initial combination of frequency levels (and thus corresponding to different types of failure) is evident. The gradual dominance of the low-frequency events occurs early, beyond about 20 s. The low-frequency associated with high-amplitude signifies large cracks toward the end. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1099636211433106">Figure 6</xref> shows the distribution of locations and energy levels of the AE events recorded in the damage region. The occurrence of significantly higher stresses in this region rather than in that between the loading rollers is reflected in the color coding of the energy levels.

<sec id="sec4-1099636211433106"><title>Glass fiber sandwich</title>
<p>The load–deflection plot combined with the AE energy time evolution for the glass sandwich beam is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-1099636211433106">Figure 7(a)</xref>. Comparing with the load–deflection curve of the carbon sandwich shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1099636211433106">Figure 2(a)</xref> reveals that the peak load occurs at a higher deflection than that of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1099636211433106">Figure 2(a)</xref>. The peak load for the glass sandwich (about 175 lb) is lower than that of the carbon sandwich (about 203 lb). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-1099636211433106">Figure 7(b)</xref> displays the evolution of AE amplitude. The load and time at which AE is detected is significantly higher than those of the carbon sandwich beam. In other words, the material appears to be not as acoustically active as the carbon sandwich. In fact, the AE amplitude plot is easier to use here in comparing data with the load–deflection curve. Also, on account of the differences in material behavior of the two specimens, there is no exact one-to-one correspondence in the milestone posts “a” to “g” utilized for the carbon sandwich.

<p>The peak frequency plot for the glass sandwich material in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-1099636211433106">Figure 9</xref> shows more continuity in the medium frequency range than the one for the carbon sandwich once AE starts. The test truly progresses to catastrophic failure more quickly than that of the carbon sandwich. The low-frequency band is also densely populated and is rich in the low-amplitude events that show large-scale cracking. The peak frequency attained by damage events is also lower than that of the carbon sandwich, being only about two-thirds (approximately 800–1200 kHz). It appears that any large strains or microdamage in the glass fibers, or associated microdamage events respond at lower frequencies in the glass material case than for the carbon sandwich. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-1099636211433106">Figure 10</xref> shows a three-dimensional plot of the evolution of AE frequency and amplitude for the glass sandwich. It shows the major crack signal at low frequency and high amplitude.

Comparing with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1099636211433106">Figure 6</xref>, it is seen that there are fewer and lower intensity emissions in the glass-fiber skin Rohacell-core (GFRC) sample than in the carbon-fiber skin Rohacell-core (CFRC) sample. This shows that the CFRC sample tends to be harder and less ductile than the GFRC counterpart.

<sec id="sec5-1099636211433106"><title>Damage evolution imaging</title>
<p>In-situ surface observations are often used to examine damage processes for an interpretation of the underlying mechanisms. Real-time damage detection using high-speed photography provides a detailed sequence of damage development and its original initiation. High-speed imaging is an important tool in a wide variety of scientific research applications. Imaging requirements such as frame rate, exposure time, number of images in a sequence, image resolution and quality, tricolor versus monochromatic images and so on, depend on the application. In common usage, the term “high-speed camera” is used for cameras capable of capturing image sequences, as well as for single shot cameras. A single shot high-speed camera is a camera capable of capturing a high-speed image (i.e., an image with a very short exposure time) that appears to freeze the motion of a moving object. The speed of such a camera simply refers to the inverse of the exposure time. On the other hand, high-speed cameras are capable of capturing a sequence of high-speed images with very short inter-frame separation. The speed, or frame rate, of such a camera refers to the inverse of the inter-frame time, while it is naturally understood that, for all practical purposes, the exposure time is less than, or at most equal to, the inter-frame time. A variety of techniques can be used to overcome this limitation on the maximum framing rates imposed by the readout time. One of these techniques relies on reducing the size of the image to be read out (i.e., the pixel resolution), in order to reduce the readout time and therefore increase the frame rate.</p>
<p>The damage development and its location are monitored by a Phantom v7.3 camera supported by Phantom 640 software and 61,000 frames per second are selected. The Phantom v12.1 was also later used, at a speed of 100,000 fps. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12-1099636211433106">Figure 12(a)</xref> includes a set of slides showing the initiation and development of the crack. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12-1099636211433106">Figure 12(b)</xref> shows magnifications of two slides, one in the early stage of crack initiation (in the form of invisible microcracks) and the second is in the nearly developed stage of crack, which appears as a discontinuous line of crack at about 45°.

However, the skin showed some indentation without crack. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13-1099636211433106">Figure 13</xref> shows selected magnified slides generated from the Phantom v12.1 camera at a speed of 100,000 fps.

<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig16-1099636211433106">Figure 16</xref> shows the dependence of the ultimate load on temperature over the range (–60°C to +20°C). It is seen that there is a trend of the effect of temperature on the ultimate load, which reveals increased hardness, and tendency to be more brittle as the temperature decreases for both types of material tested, namely CFRC and GFRC. It is noteworthy to refer to the work of Kallarikal [16] who tested graphite/epoxy laminates of different architectures. It was pointed out that the fabric (woven) architecture specimens resisted the deterioration in fracture toughness better than the unidirectional ones. Since the skins here are, respectively, of woven glass fiber/epoxy and unidirectional graphite/epoxy, it is possible that apart from other causes, this difference in architecture is contributing to the difference in sub-zero temperature behavior.

<p>The damage development of foam-cored carbon fiber and glass fiber sandwich beam specimens has been examined experimentally with the purpose of identifying the location and weak region. The experimental investigation utilized AE and high-speed imaging to monitor the damage evolution during four-point bending tests. For the two specimens of sandwich beams made of CFRC and GFRC, it has been found that there are significant differences in the damage characteristics of the two specimens under four-point bending tests. For example, the load–deflection curve of the CFRC beams exhibited almost constant loading over a large value of deflection after the yield point. The AE energy and its amplitude were significantly populated just after the CFRC beam is loaded, while it took a significant value of load for the GFRC beam to generate AE. Both specimens were damaged from the core at one side of the support rollers at an angle close to 45°, while the two sides of skin did not exhibit any visible damage except a trace of indentation and invisible fiber damage.</p></sec>
