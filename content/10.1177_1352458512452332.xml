<p>Dear Sir</p>
<p>A meta-analysis of the seasonality of multiple sclerosis (MS) exacerbations showed that relapse occurred more frequently in spring and summer.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1352458512452332">1</xref></sup> However, the seasonality of MS relapse has been rarely reported from regions other than Western countries. Moreover, few studies have addressed the seasonality of neuromyelitis optica (NMO) relapse. To investigate the seasonality of MS/NMO relapse in Japan, medical records documenting relapse onset and initial hospital visits during relapse were collected from consecutive patients with relapsing–remitting MS or relapsing NMO diagnosed according to the revised diagnostic criteria.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1352458512452332">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1352458512452332">3</xref></sup> Records documenting the hospital visits of patients with other neurological disorders (ONDs) including Parkinsonian syndrome, motor neuron diseases, and cerebrovascular diseases were also collected as control. All patients were evaluated at the neurology outpatient clinic at Chiba University Hospital between October 2004 and September 2011. Our hospital is the only regional center specializing in MS/NMO; thus, we believe that all regional MS/NMO patients experiencing a relapse have visited our hospital during the study period. We compared seasonal variations of MS/NMO exacerbations and those of ONDs. Seasons were defined as spring (April–June), summer (July–September), fall (October–December), and winter (January–March). Significant differences and deviation in hospital visit rates of MS/NMO patients and those of controls were evaluated monthly using the Fisher’s exact test and Walter–Elwood test, respectively.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1352458512452332">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>There were 295 MS exacerbations (54 males and 241 females), 131 NMO exacerbations (3 males and 128 females), and 117,829 visits for ONDs (54,950 males and 62,879 females) over the study period. Comparison of total visits for MS/NMO exacerbations with those for ONDs according to seasons revealed a significant peak in MS exacerbation in summer (MS: 95 in summer versus 200 in other seasons; ONDs: 30,133 in summer versus 87,696 in other seasons; <italic>p</italic> = 0.011) and a nadir in winter (MS: 56 in winter versus 239 in other seasons; ONDs: 29,377 in winter versus 88,452 in other seasons; <italic>p</italic> = 0.018). In analysis by gender, a similar significant seasonal difference existed between visits for MS exacerbations and those for ONDs in females but not in males. No significant seasonal difference (total and by gender) in NMO exacerbations existed. In monthly analysis, no significant seasonal difference (total and by gender) existed between visits for MS/NMO exacerbations and control visits (Fisher’s exact test), and no significant effect of seasonality on MS/NMO exacerbations was observed (Walter–Elwood test). However, seasonal deviations with an excess of exacerbations in August and a nadir in March was observed in female MS patients (<italic>p</italic> = 0.054).</p>
<p>We examined the relationship between seasonal distribution of MS relapse and publicly available meteorological and viral infection data from Chiba city. Mean, maximum and minimum daily temperatures, relative humidity, and vapor pressure as well as coxsackievirus and enterovirus infection rates showed similar seasonal variations, with peak in summer and nadir in winter. Other factors including UV radiation and mumps virus infections showed a different pattern.</p>
<p>In conclusion, seasonal variations in exacerbations were observed for MS but not for NMO in Japan.</p>
