<abstract>
<p>Laws against party-hopping are relatively common in the southern hemisphere. This is true even among Commonwealth countries, despite some disapproval of such laws expressed in the Commonwealth’s Latimer House Principles on the Three Branches of Government. This paper reviews anti-defection laws in the southern hemisphere as well as the use of other methods of discouraging no-confidence votes. It focuses particularly on the experience in the Pacific Islands region, where reforms ostensibly aimed at strengthening political parties have often masked attempts by governments to insulate themselves from political challenge.</p>

<p>In 2000, Papua New Guinea (PNG) embarked on an ambitious effort to construct a party system by legislative means. Reformists had become frustrated by regular side-switching among MPs, frequent ‘no-confidence’ motions and political instability during prime ministerial elections.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0032318712466758">1</xref>
</sup> The new Organic Law on the Integrity of Political Parties and Candidates (OLIPPAC)<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0032318712466758">2</xref>
</sup> aimed to regularize the process of post-election government formation, establish a political party registration system, initiate public funding of political parties, and tie MPs more firmly to those political parties. On the basis of the new law, once they had chosen sides in a prime ministerial election, MPs were collectively bound to stick with their favoured leader in parliamentary votes on three critical issues – the budget, any constitutional amendment and a vote of confidence. In theory, party-affiliated MPs could still switch allegiance, but only in unison and in accordance with a party resolution. This latter provision ultimately fell foul of PNG’s Supreme Court, which ruled in mid 2010 that key elements of OLIPPAC violated the ‘freedom of speech, debate and proceedings’ provisions in the 1975 constitution.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0032318712466758">3</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the court concluded that ‘the operation of the bulk of the OLIPPAC provisions were not affected by this decision and remained in force’. The associated apparatus for party registration and state funding of parties, its rather ineffective provisions for encouraging parties to field women candidates and its provisions guaranteeing the largest party the first opportunity to form a post-election government remained in place. After the general elections of June−July 2012, this last provision assisted the People’s National Congress (PNC), with 27 MPs in a parliament of 111 seats, to secure the selection of party leader Peter O’Neill as prime minister. Separate rules preventing no-confidence motions immediately after prime ministerial elections meant that his government was likely to survive for at least 18 months.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0032318712466758">4</xref>
</sup>  </p>
<p>As at all previous elections since independence in 1975, no single party obtained an overall majority after the 2012 election. Although Peter O’Neill’s party had less than a quarter of the overall seats, the rest of the field was highly divided – 20 other parties obtained at least one seat, and the second-largest party had only 12 seats. PNG has a weakly institutionalized and highly fluid party system, with MPs often willing to switch sides in return for offers of ministerial portfolios, other lucrative appointments or cash.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0032318712466758">5</xref>
</sup> So-called ‘rubber band’ or ‘yo-yo’ politicians often hold the balance of power, enabling them to determine the outcome of the frequent no-confidence votes in parliament. At prime ministerial elections between 1975 and 2002, party affiliations were often promptly discarded as factions jockeyed for advantage. The key players in these contests are the modern urban counterparts of the traditional Melanesian ‘big man’, sometimes contrasted with the politicians that emerge in less competitive hereditary Polynesian ‘chiefly’ systems.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0032318712466758">6</xref>
</sup> Although the Supreme Court’s 2010 decision reopened the door to mid-term side-switching, the still intact provisions surrounding PNG’s prime ministerial elections have ensured that official party affiliations are now highly politically significant at least for the process of government formation.</p>
<p>This paper reviews laws against party-hopping or defection in the southern hemisphere, and other methods for discouraging no-confidence votes. It focuses particularly on the experience in the Pacific Islands region, but also on some of the approaches in other parts of the world. It is not intended to be a comprehensive survey, but rather to place PNG’s experiences in a comparative context, and to reflect on how reformers in PNG might draw from the experiences of other countries as they consider how to react to the July 2010 Supreme Court decision.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0032318712466758">7</xref>
</sup> In PNG, urban reformists remain strongly focused on efforts to create party systems through legislation and are often reluctant to scrutinize potential negative side-effects.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0032318712466758">8</xref>
</sup>  </p>
<p>The government that had initiated OLIPPAC failed to secure re-election at the 2002 elections. Instead, Sir Michael Somare formed an administration that was to endure a full five-year parliamentary term and beyond. As is usual in Papua New Guinea, Somare’s 2002−7 government saw repeated shifts in the composition of the governing coalition. Some MPs did switch sides during those years and thus potentially became vulnerable to legal action in accordance with OLIPPAC’s key provisions, initially through a reference by the Speaker to the newly formed Office of the Registrar of Political Parties, and then through the deliberations of the Ombudsman’s Commission, with the ultimate sanction being the forfeit of their seats.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0032318712466758">9</xref>
</sup> However, none of these MPs lost their seats in 2002−7.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0032318712466758">10</xref>
</sup> Although the law was regularly invoked as setting limits on the opposition’s ability to rally support behind a no-confidence challenge, cases were not pursued against those who breached OLIPPAC. Despite the presence of anti-defection laws, the Somare government resorted to familiar devices from the pre-OLIPPAC era – such as long adjournments of parliament – to avoid no-confidence challenges, rather than relying on OLIPPAC to prevent efforts to dislodge the government.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0032318712466758">11</xref>
</sup> Hanging over the operation of OLIPPAC were doubts about whether the law was consistent with the PNG constitution, which were confirmed by the Supreme Court’s ruling in mid 2010.</p>
<p>In its July 2010 judgement, PNG’s Supreme Court found little evidence of laws against party switching in Commonwealth countries. The judgement mentioned some African ‘disqualification provisions’ for those crossing the floor to join the ruling party or vice versa, but it also found that:
<disp-quote>
<p>Nowhere in any literature and standing orders that we have had access to, is there a provision which compels an MP as to how he shall debate and vote on any matter before parliament. Nowhere is there any such provision that invalidates a vote by an MP against his party’s position.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0032318712466758">12</xref>
</sup>
</p>
</disp-quote>
The Supreme Court also recorded that:
<disp-quote>
<p>Our limited research shows none of the Commonwealth countries with a Westminster system of government have similar laws [to OLIPPAC]. We are also unable to locate any case law from any of those countries that supports restrictions or prohibitions placed on a member’s performance of his representative duties and functions in parliament.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0032318712466758">13</xref>
</sup>
</p>
</disp-quote>
Legal provisions regulating the workings of political parties and, more narrowly, laws prohibiting floor-crossing are fairly common, even in Commonwealth countries that use single-member district electoral systems. Usually, these handle party disloyalty indirectly, threatening disloyal MPs with the loss of their seats, rather than directly by seeking to control MPs’ voting choices within parliament. The PNG experience accords with the international experience of anti-party-hopping legislation in some respects, but not in others. In other parts of the world, courts have not upheld laws against party defection for one reason or another. Laws against party-hopping have frequently had unforeseen consequences, including sustaining in office unpopular administrations that would otherwise collapse. In other countries, party schisms, splits and mergers have been used to subvert anti-defection laws, and permit some kinds of floor-crossing.</p>
<p>First, at the more general level, state regulation of political parties by law has become increasingly common. A survey by Karvonen, for example, found 39 such laws globally in 2003.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0032318712466758">14</xref>
</sup> Party laws include provisions covering party finances, bans on ethnic, racist or terrorist linkages, and bans on party organization in workplaces (mostly in the former communist states of Eastern Europe).<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0032318712466758">15</xref>
</sup> Most of these laws entail provisions covering party registration processes. Many of the party laws identified in Karvonen’s survey were laws that play some role in <italic>restricting</italic> parties. No attention was paid to laws aimed at <italic>encouraging</italic> the emergence of political parties, as was the case with the PNG legislation.</p>
<p>Laws with the objective of tightening party discipline often intend to achieve this via party defection or party-hopping rules, as in PNG. Such rules can operate directly, where MPs are forbidden from voting against party resolutions, or indirectly, where resignation or expulsion from a party entails the loss of parliamentary seats. There have been several surveys of the international usage of laws against party-switching. Kenneth Janda’s survey (2009) identifies 40 countries with laws against party defections, and differentiated these using a classification of ‘older’ and ‘newer’ democracies, semi-democracies and non-democracies.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0032318712466758">16</xref>
</sup> The questionable classifications of Fiji and PNG as ‘semi-democracies’ and Pakistan, Thailand and the Democratic Republic of Congo as ‘non-democracies’ follow Freedom House (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0032318712466758">Table 1</xref>).</p>

<p>Janda’s list excludes two countries that briefly adopted anti-defection laws, but which have since dropped them – New Zealand and South Africa; and one might add PNG since the 2010 Supreme Court decision. Such laws are common in proportional representation (PR) systems, particularly closed-list PR or mixed member proportional (MMP) systems (Janda finds 17 such countries). The logic of this is evident in the New Zealand case, where shortly after the shift from a first-past-the-post (FPTP) to an MMP system,<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0032318712466758">17</xref>
</sup> an anti-defection law was introduced to prevent MPs from ‘distorting proportionality’ by switching allegiance.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0032318712466758">18</xref>
</sup> A similar reasoning is discernible in Lesotho, where under an MMP system only those MPs elected via the list component are constrained by anti-defection laws, not those elected as constituency representatives.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-0032318712466758">19</xref>
</sup> On the other hand, countries that use an FPTP or a preferential voting system in single-member districts might seem less likely to adopt laws prohibiting floor-crossing. In single-member district-based voting systems, MPs are often elected on the basis of personal political support. Disloyalty to the political party, under such electoral systems, might appear a lesser offence than defying the party whip under systems where an individual has been elected primarily because of his or her position on a party slate (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0032318712466758">Table 2</xref>).</p>

<p>Given the greater logic of anti-party defection rules under PR systems, it is perhaps surprising that a substantial number of the countries listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0032318712466758">Table 1</xref> are Commonwealth countries with Westminster systems and FPTP electoral laws – including India. More than half of the countries with anti-defection laws (22) were members of the Commonwealth, excluding Fiji (currently suspended from the Commonwealth, and with the constitution abrogated in April 2009) and Zimbabwe (which withdrew from the Commonwealth in 2003). <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0032318712466758">Table 2</xref> distinguishes countries using anti-defection laws by electoral system type, and shows that 14 FPTP-using states have adopted such devices. Papua New Guinea has used the Australian-style alternative vote system since 2002, known locally as ‘limited preferential voting’ because three preferences need to be indicated in order to lodge a valid ballot. Between 1977 and 2002, the country used an FPTP system. Both systems entail single-member districts.</p>
<p>Despite this widespread usage of party-hopping laws in Commonwealth jurisdictions, the Commonwealth itself frowns upon such devices. The June 1998 ‘Latimer House Principles’ specified that ‘the expulsion of members from parliament as a penalty for leaving their parties (floor-crossing) should be viewed as a possible infringement of members’ independence’, although it concluded that ‘anti-defection measures may be necessary in some jurisdictions to deal with corrupt practices’. Exactly what these ‘corrupt practices’ were, however, was not elaborated upon. The 1998 version concluded that ‘the cessation of membership of a political party of itself should not lead to loss of a member’s seat’.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-0032318712466758">20</xref>
</sup> The 2003 version agreed in Abuja, Nigeria, qualified this on the grounds that ‘there remains a controversy about the balance to be struck between anti-floor-crossing measures as a barrier to corruption and a potential threat to the independence of MPs’.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-0032318712466758">21</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Implicitly, anti-defection measures are only tolerable if they do not entail a loss of parliamentary seats, even though rules that fall short of this often fail to work as a disincentive. Even without anti-defection legislation, conviction for corruption usually leads to the forfeit of parliamentary seats if the prison term is long. In any case, MP side-switching does not necessarily occur in direct response to overt bribery. The motives are usually opaque and identifying incentives is difficult. In India or the Solomon Islands, backbenchers frequently switch allegiance in search of ministerial portfolios, anticipating that these will be offered in the wake of a change in government. Locally, the motives of those ‘yo-yo’ politicians may be popularly described as ‘corruption’, but the MPs themselves will often publicly legitimize such actions by claiming that they were not elected to sit on the opposition benches, but rather to become part of government. In contexts where political parties are not differentiated by ideological stances, but comprise highly personalized parliamentary factions, the ambition to join the government is not necessarily ‘corrupt’. In such contexts, anti-defection legislation targeted at ‘corruption’ would potentially require courts to become involved in difficult judgements as regards MPs’ motives in joining new parties or splitting from old ones.</p>
<p>Anti-defection laws have often worked in unexpected ways. One 2003 survey concluded that, leaving aside a few as yet untested exceptions (including PNG), such legislation was ‘problematic at best and unworkable at worst’.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-0032318712466758">22</xref>
</sup> Many countries which have a reputation for frequent side-switching – such as France, Italy, Brazil and Russia – have not adopted anti-defection laws.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-0032318712466758">23</xref>
</sup> After a period of rapid governmental change, and frequent no-confidence votes under the Fourth Republic, for example, France opted instead for a new constitution, with a powerful president elected on a seven-year term. Indeed, presidential systems serve to diminish the political significance of party side-switching. By contrast, changing allegiances in parliamentary systems potentially entail shifts in government leadership. Studies of volatility and the extent of party institutionalization have paid insufficient attention to the repercussions of this critical difference between presidential and parliamentary systems.</p>
<p>Three countries which have adopted anti-defection laws to deal with side-switching are South Africa, India and New Zealand.</p>
<sec id="section1-0032318712466758">
<title>South Africa</title>
<p>In South Africa, the dominant African National Congress (ANC) introduced an electoral system and anti-party defection laws that both, potentially, ran contrary to its own party interests. Under an FPTP system, the ANC would have had a clean sweep in most areas, whereas usage of a closed-list PR system gave opposition parties a substantial share of the seats. The interim 1993 constitution contained an anti-defection clause that was retained in the final 1996 constitution, pending ordinary legislation needing a two-thirds majority. However, the ANC was the major beneficiary of floor-crossing switches, so although the law strengthened the grip of the party leaders over elected representatives, it also deprived the ANC of additional support. In 2002 a law was passed allowing floor-crossing only in specified periods,<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-0032318712466758">24</xref>
</sup> but the constitutionality of the law was challenged, and although upheld by the courts, this was on the basis of transitional constitutional arrangements and was ruled to have lapsed after 2004.<sup>

<sec id="section2-0032318712466758">
<title>India</title>
<p>India’s anti-defection laws were adopted in the wake of a period of rampant floor-crossing. Close to 2000 members of the Lok Sabha and of state-level governments defected during 1967−71, often with the objective of acquiring ministerial portfolios.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-0032318712466758">26</xref>
</sup> The use of money to entice defectors and lock-ups (bordering on kidnapping and physical confinement), aimed at holding fractious coalitions in remote or protected places to avoid poaching by rival camps, were not infrequent.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn27-0032318712466758">27</xref>
</sup> An initial 1973 effort to ban party-hopping lapsed in 1977.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn28-0032318712466758">28</xref>
</sup> In 1985, the government of Rajiv Gandhi introduced an amendment to the Indian constitution providing that a member of the Lok Sabha or States or Union Territories would be disqualified for giving up party membership or for failing to vote along party lines without consent. This applied both to party members and to independents subsequently joining political parties, but not to those participating in collective splits where breakaway groups formed a third or more of the party or where the breakaway group merged with another party.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn29-0032318712466758">29</xref>
</sup> Decisions on disqualification were made by the Speaker, and were originally intended to be non-justiciable, although this last provision was declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court in 1992.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn30-0032318712466758">30</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Despite these efforts to halt party-hopping, the number of group defections increased after 1985.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn31-0032318712466758">31</xref>
</sup> One effect of the law was to encourage ‘further fragmentation of the party system’.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn32-0032318712466758">32</xref>
</sup> This is despite the fact that political parties remain critical to electoral success in India, and independents fare poorly.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn33-0032318712466758">33</xref>
</sup> As in PNG, the failure of the anti-defection laws has been blamed on partisan decisions by the parliament’s speaker, rather than the law itself.<sup>

<title>New Zealand</title>
<p>In New Zealand, a 1997 Electoral (Party Registration) Bill sought to tie MPs to political parties, but this was rejected by the Electoral Law Committee. The case in favour rested on the 1996 electoral system change and the introduction of an MMP) system to replace the former FPTP system. Under MMP, it was argued, the key principle was to retain close proportionality between party vote shares and party seat shares. To allow party defections would potentially disturb that newly achieved proportionality. In 2001, a similar bill was debated, but this time enacted as the Electoral (Integrity) Amendment Act (2001). This included a ‘sunset clause’ and thus expired a year later. In 2005, as part of Labour’s coalition agreement with New Zealand First, another party-hopping prevention bill was introduced, but the bill was not passed owing to a lack of numbers. In New Zealand, laws against MPs switching sides tended to delay the inevitable political realignments, and political opinion turned against their continued usage.<sup>

</p>
<p>Within the Pacific Islands region, four countries have attempted to deal with side-switching by MPs, or frequent no-confidence votes, through legislation: Solomon Islands, Fiji, Samoa and, in a very different way, Kiribati.  </p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0032318712466758">
<title>Solomon Islands</title>
<p>The Solomon Islands’ experience merits consideration because it is geographically close to Papua New Guinea, and because there are some political similarities between the two settings. Both countries have weak states with overwhelmingly rural populations. In both, political attention is frequently focused on the ‘big man’ system of politics, high incumbent turnover, frequent floor-crossing and associated votes of no confidence. The PNG experiment with OLIPPAC was an important influence in the Solomon Islands ahead of the Derek Sikua government launching two bills aimed at promoting political parties: the Political Parties (Registration and Administration) Bill 2009 (no 25), and the Constitution (Political Parties Amendment) Bill 2009 (no 24). These became the flagship proposals of the Sikua government ahead of the 2010 elections. Unlike the PNG laws, the intention was not to regulate MPs’ movements on the floor of parliament, but rather to control in detail the method of the initial formation of government. Whereas the PNG legislation simply gives the largest party the first chance to form a government, the Solomon Islands’ proposed legislation offered four alternatives, each entailing different combinations of parties, coalitions and independents. More importantly, the Solomon Islands’ proposed legislation provided that, in the event of a successful vote of no confidence, a new prime minister would be elected not by parliament as a whole, but by the government caucus. In PNG under OLIPPAC, at least in theory, parties aligned with the government could switch sides if they did so in accordance with a collective party decision.</p>
<p>The crucial Solomon Islands constitutional amendment bill, however, failed to secure the required two-thirds majority. Dr Sikua accused some of his own ministers of sabotaging the reform, and sacked them ahead of the pre-election dissolution of parliament. For the August 2010 election, several key ministers in the Sikua government – including Steve Abana and Matthew Wale – aligned themselves with the Democratic Party, which after the election claimed the largest number of seats and thus a moral right to form a government. However, those ministers who – according to Dr Sikua − had sabotaged the Constitution (Political Parties Amendment) Bill 2009, including Gordon Darcy Lilo and Snyder Rini, joined the opposition camp and successfully backed Danny Philip as the new prime minister. The opposition, led by Steve Abana, attempted to oust Danny Philip’s government in a no-confidence vote in early 2011, an action that would have been illegal under the legislation they had so earnestly pushed for in early 2009. However, Danny Philip managed to delay the sitting of parliament, giving him sufficient time to seduce wavering MPs into shifting back across the floor. Partly as a result, schisms emerged on the opposition side, and in March 2011 several of the former Democratic Party stalwarts themselves eventually crossed the floor to join Danny Philip’s government – including party leader Steve Abana. In November 2011, Danny Philip resigned to avoid an impending no-confidence challenge, but his government remained largely intact under the new leadership of Gordon Darcy Lilo.</p>
<p>The Solomon Islands’ experience indicates the dangers of laws aimed at restricting no-confidence votes. Often it is the reformist camp that most earnestly pursues such laws, firmly believing that rules that favour political parties will work in their favour. Greater ideological coherence, at least amongst the party leaders, is thought likely to translate into more robust party discipline, and make the reformists better disposed to gain advantage under the new institutional framework. Both Sir Mekere Morauta’s government in PNG in 2000−2 and Derek Sikua’s government in the Solomon Islands during 2009−10 harboured such views. In both cases, these predictions proved false, and it was other more flexible groups that proved able to come together and secure the larger numbers in contests for the prime ministerial portfolio.</p>

<title>Fiji</title>
<p>Restrictions on party-hopping played a significant role in the events leading up to Fiji’s coup of 19 May 2000. That coup overthrew the Mahendra Chaudhry-led government, Fiji’s first ever to be led by a politician of Indian descent, after only a year in office. During this year in government by the Fiji Labour Party (FLP) , Chaudhry faced a rebellion amongst his coalition partners, but because his party had a 37-seat majority in the 71-member parliament, the rebels were unable to dislodge him via a no-confidence vote. Chaudhry also faced a rebellion within FLP ranks, particularly from ethnic Fijian FLP members such as deputy prime minister Dr Tupeni Baba. Yet Dr Baba and other FLP rebels were unable to cross the floor because Fiji’s 1997 constitution made switching sides illegal (or, more precisely, it provided that MPs expelled by a party should lose their seats, and any MP who backed a no-confidence vote would almost certainly have been expelled by Chaudhry). That legislation may have strengthened political parties and/or party leaders in Fiji, but it also introduced rigidities into Fiji’s political set-up that prevented constitutional regime change, and thus may have indirectly encouraged the coup of May 2000.</p>
<p>After the 2000 coup, Fiji was restored to constitutional rule by court action, and an election was held in 2001 under the 1997 constitution. Dr Baba led a breakaway party, called the New Labour Unity Party (NLUP), that secured two seats in parliament. One of the NLUP MPs joined the new government, and the other joined the opposition. The courts were required to deliberate on which of the MPs had followed the party line and which had not, but concluded that this was impossible to establish because neither faction had conducted its deliberations in accordance with clear party rules.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn36-0032318712466758">36</xref>
</sup> That experience highlighted the difficulties entailed in regulation by the courts of internal party procedure.</p>
<p>Had it not been for Frank Bainimarama’s military coup in December 2006, Fiji’s party laws might have again proved highly influential. Shortly before that coup, FLP leader Mahendra Chaudhry expelled several members of his party, including two who were ministers in a short-lived May−December 2006 power-sharing cabinet led by Laisenia Qarase. If military action had not ousted the Qarase government in December 2006, it is likely that Chaudhry’s disciplinary actions within his own party would have destroyed the power-sharing cabinet. It is also likely that the courts would again have been called on to deliberate on internal party matters.</p>

<title>Samoa</title>
<p>Samoa is the one country in the Pacific Islands region to have achieved long-term ‘stability’ as defined by continuity of government. The Human Rights Protection Party (HRPP) has remained in office (with one brief exception) for nearly 30 years. The HRPP has used the advantages of incumbency to secure re-election, often attracting independents and opposition members to cross the floor after elections. Laws to extend the suffrage, to expand the parliamentary term to five years and to appoint ministerial ‘under-secretaries’ have been devised to cement party dominance over the institutions of state. In the process, Samoa has been accused of adopting ‘authoritarian’ or ‘undemocratic’ laws.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn37-0032318712466758">37</xref>
</sup> In early 2009, the Speaker of the Samoan parliament ruled that members of parliament who had formed the opposition Tautua Samoa Party had breached parliamentary rules. The Supreme Court rejected this, and the MPs were reinstated. The government reacted by amending the Electoral Act to introduce anti-party-hopping laws which make it illegal for MPs to change their party status after an election. Another amendment to Samoa’s Electoral Act required eligible candidates to obtain a signature from the <italic>Pulenu’u</italic> (village mayor or clerk) confirming that they had provided satisfactory services to the village community. This was used ahead of the 2011 polls to disqualify two candidates from the opposition Tautua Party.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn38-0032318712466758">38</xref>
</sup> This experience indicates that − despite the often noted differences between allegedly fluid, unstable and highly competitive ‘Melanesian’ styles of politics and hierarchical and stable ‘Polynesian’ methods of parliamentary conduct − the law has been used to handle similar kinds of issues in Samoa, although with greater success.<sup>

<sec id="section7-0032318712466758">
<title>Kiribati</title>
<p>At independence, Kiribati chose a quite different method of handling no-confidence votes and fluid MP allegiances. The country adopted a presidential system, but of a unique type. In Kiribati, as is usual in presidential systems, the Beretitenti (president) is elected by a popular vote. The three unusual features are that, first, the parliament controls nominations for the presidential election (which helps to ensure that the president has substantial support amongst the majority within the parliament). Second, the cabinet is drawn from the parliament (more usually a characteristic of Westminster systems than presidential systems). Third, the president can be ousted by a no-confidence vote in parliament, but – and here is the crucial distinction – when a president is ousted by a no-confidence vote, this leads to a general dissolution of parliament.</p>
<p>How has Kiribati fared under that hybrid presidential−Westminster system? The country has faced three successful no-confidence votes since independence in 1979. In 1982, the country’s first president Ieremai Tabai was toppled after he turned a seemingly minor controversy into an issue of confidence.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn40-0032318712466758">40</xref>
</sup> Following a dissolution and general election, Tabai proved able to win a nationwide presidential election, and to serve a second term. He reached his three-term limit in 1991, and thus could not stand again for the presidential elections. The vice-president, Teatao Teannaki, became president, but he fell after a controversy over a motion which he stamped as an issue of confidence. Kiribati’s second successful no-confidence vote again triggered a dissolution and a new election, when the opposition, led by Teburoro Tito, secured office (1994−2003). After the 2002 general election, Tito was unable to secure a working majority, leading to a third successful no-confidence vote and to fresh elections in 2003.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn41-0032318712466758">41</xref>
</sup> Having reached his three-term limit, Tito was unable to contest again, and the opposition candidate – Anote Tong – won the presidential election. Kiribati’s peculiar hybrid presidential arrangements have thus not prohibited no-confidence challenges, but the country has been far less troubled by frivolous efforts to dislodge governments by opportunist MPs seeking ministerial advantage than close neighbours like Tuvalu and Nauru. The I-Kiribati system, although it entails many elections,<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn42-0032318712466758">42</xref>
</sup> has considerable domestic support, both amongst the government and opposition factions.</p>
<p>In Papua New Guinea, many agree that making a no-confidence vote entail the dissolution of parliament (as in Kiribati) would prevent unnecessary no-confidence votes. The evidence for this is that, under PNG’s 1975 constitution, no-confidence votes in the fifth year of a parliamentary term <italic>do</italic> entail an early election.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn43-0032318712466758">43</xref>
</sup> In response to that strong disincentive, there never has been a no-confidence vote in the 12 months before a general election, successful or unsuccessful. Those who oppose the introduction of Kiribati-style provisions in PNG argue that MPs would be reluctant to <italic>ever</italic> mount such challenges if the cost of success was the forfeit of their parliamentary seats. Since over half of all MPs usually lose their seats at each election, PNG politicians would be reluctant ever to challenge the prime minister. This may be so, but the intention of OLIPPAC was to restrict the likelihood of no-confidence motions, with the objective of ‘stabilising’ government. The provision that enabled collective side-switching in accordance with collective party resolutions was intended to leave open the ‘safety valve’ of a principled no-confidence vote. Yet as India’s extensive use of collective breakaways after the 1985 reform indicates, permitting this method of shifting allegiances is no guarantee against frivolous no-confidence motions. The alternative ‘no confidence entails dissolution’ reform makes parliamentary efforts to dislodge governments unlikely except in circumstances where there is a groundswell of popular dissatisfaction with government. Those are arguably the precise circumstances in which one would want to leave open the option of a change in government generated by a no-confidence vote.   </p>
<p>There are few signs that anti-defection laws have served unambiguously to strengthen political parties. In the Indian case, party splits and floor-crossing changed to conform to the law. In Papua New Guinea, the law was implemented only to a limited degree, and no MPs lost their seats for violating its provisions. In New Zealand, such laws largely delayed the inevitable realignments. Anti-defection laws were difficult for the courts to enforce, as seen in the Fiji case. Where administered by non-justiciable actions on the part of the Speaker, there was no guarantee of impartiality as in India (before the Supreme Court ruled this unconstitutional). In practice, anti-defection laws have often been used primarily to strengthen governing parties rather than political parties in general. Where they do not strengthen the governing party, they have been ultimately abandoned (as in South Africa). In both Samoa and Papua New Guinea, anti-defection laws have been one tool among many to protect governments against challenge. They may have strengthened the position of incumbent parties, such as Samoa’s Human Rights Protection Party or Somare’s National Alliance in PNG, but they have served to weaken the opposition parties.</p>

Usually, as in New Zealand and Germany, voters have two votes – one for a constituency representative and the other for a political party.

<p>Chief Justice Timoci Tuivaga criticized ‘the rather slapdash approach taken to the purposed disciplinary action to which the plaintiff was subjected’, referring to the purported expulsion of Kenneth Zinck, the NLUP MP who had joined the government: ‘the fundamental error of the party as I see it was its failure to follow the rule of law governing disciplinary matters within the party. In these circumstances the conclusion is irresistible that the party was not legally vested with any powers to lawfully expel the plaintiff from the party … the purported expulsion of the plaintiff from the party was ultra vires and therefore unlawful’. <italic>Kenneth Zinck</italic> v. <italic>New Labour Unity Party, Ratu Meli Vesikula, Tomasi Tokalauvere and Lorraini Tulele</italic>, High Court at Suva, action number HBC 424J2001S, 18 December 2001.</p>
