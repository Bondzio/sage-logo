<p>As a busy practitioner, it can be difficult to keep up with current research and practice methodologies related to diabetes education and even more challenging to determine which to put into practice.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>A number of resources exist that summarize the content that is out there, including position statements, white papers, practice advisories, literature reviews, and practice guidelines and standards. There are no hard-and-fast rules defining and distinguishing these different types of documents—and not all sources of information are equally grounded in the evidence. So, it is helpful to understand the differences between these formats, when they should be consulted, and when diabetes educators should put recommendations into practice.</p>
<p>Here is a quick reference guide to the types of practice documents that are available to help you provide evidence-based care and education to your patients.</p>
<sec id="section1-2325160312471937">
<title>Position Statements</title>
<p>Position statements are documents that present an organization’s stance on a particular issue. They customarily include background information, research, and discussions to help the reader understand the rationale behind the declared position. Position statements are generally peer-reviewed before publishing and may be developed by professional organizations or a multidisciplinary group of professionals.</p>
<p>AADE regularly issues position statements that cover topics of importance to the specialty of diabetes education, as well as current developments in the field and emerging treatment methods and models. AADE’s existing position statements are reviewed every 3 years and updated as needed. If you are interested in topics such as the management of children with diabetes or the roles that a community health worker can fill in your practice, look to our position statements. You’ll find background information and the rationale for the position taken on these and other topics, which you can use to inform your own opinion.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-2325160312471937">
<title>White Papers</title>
<p>White papers are reports or documents used to educate, identify problems and issues, and provide possible solutions. While they are commonly used in government and business-to-business marketing, they come in a variety of forms—and not all of them are unbiased. The source of the ideas promulgated needs to be considered when evaluating the strength of the information presented. White papers issued by major health care organizations and professional associations can, however, be a helpful start for understanding a topic.</p>
<p>AADE’s white papers are often issued after a panel of experts, a committee, or a research collaboration has been convened to examine a particular issue. They present the results, conclusions, and recommendations from the group. For instance, a white paper titled “Insulin Pump Therapy: Best Practices in Choosing and Using Infusion Devices” was published after a multidisciplinary panel of experts convened to discuss best practices in the management of infusion devices for continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII), also called insulin pump therapy.</p>
<p>The paper reported on the discussion and presented the panel’s views on infusion set selection, set usage, patient training and education, troubleshooting, special populations, and the role of the diabetes educator in achieving successful outcomes with insulin pump therapy. Other examples include white papers on best practices in insulin injection therapy and the need for an instrument to measure behavior change in diabetes self-management education.</p>

<sec id="section3-2325160312471937">
<title>Practice Advisories</title>
<p>A practice advisory is a public statement that provides background information and guidance on a practice-related topic.</p>
<p>AADE’s practice advisories are issued in response to a health care policy change or development. The purpose is to advise professionals on how the change or development may affect them.</p>
<p>Advisories are generally short and informative. For example, when the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services decided to cover Intensive Behavioral Counseling for Obesity for eligible Medicare beneficiaries, AADE issued a practice advisory clearly stating what would be covered and how it would affect diabetes educators.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-2325160312471937">
<title>Literature Reviews</title>
<p>A literature review is often undertaken in response to a specific research question. Once a question or issue has been identified, a thorough search and analysis of the available literature and research related to that topic is conducted. This information is usually summarized in a report from which the authors can draw insights and conclusions. Literature reviews state what is known about the designated topic, and they also identify gaps in the research as well as the strengths and weaknesses of current published works.</p>
<p>Systematic literature reviews are more comprehensive and structured in nature than general reviews. They provide a rigorous evaluation of the available information from a predetermined range of sources. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses statement (www.prisma-statement. org) outlines the requirements for this type of document.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-2325160312471937">
<title>Practice Guidelines and Standards</title>
<p>Practice guidelines are specific, professionally agreed upon recommendations for medical practice used within health care organizations to standardize the practice to achieve consistent quality outcomes. Practice guidelines may be instituted when triggered by specific clinical indicators. Practice guidelines outline the most current and relevant data concerning the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment for a particular clinical specialty.</p>
<p>Practice guidelines and standards are not a new concept, and diabetes educators have been designing their programs around them and consulting the treatment recommendations for decades. They reflect the established, accepted wisdom of years of research. <italic>The National Standards for Diabetes Self-Management Education and Support, AADE Guidelines for the Practice of Diabetes Self-Management Education and Training</italic>, and the <italic>Scope of Practice, Standards of Practice, and Standards of Professional Performance for Diabetes Educators</italic> (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.diabeteseducator.org/practicedocuments">www.diabeteseducator.org/practicedocuments</ext-link>) should be the first resources consulted when examining or researching a practice-related issue.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-2325160312471937">
<title>Assessing and Accessing Valid Information</title>
<p>With the overwhelming amount of diabetes research and emerging technology available, it’s important to note that not all information out there is valid, useful, or accurate. When determining whether a source provides evidence-based information, be sure to verify the authority or expertise of the author or the issuing organization and ensure that the material is accurate and free from bias. Also, note the date of the source material to be sure it is up to date and is the most current version of the document.</p>
<p>High-quality, evidence-based practice documents that summarize and analyze current diabetes research and evidence are regularly issued from reputable diabetes-related organizations and government agencies and programs. These practice documents can be an asset for diabetes educators, saving you time and effort and allowing you to make informed, evidence-based practice decisions.</p>
<p>Keep up with the current research in your field by:</p>
<list id="list1-2325160312471937" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>utilizing the resources offered by your professional associations—participate in discussion forums, register for webinars, join Communities of Interest, and network with your colleagues at a Local Networking Group meeting or the Annual Meeting;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>actively reading diabetes-related practice documents such as position statements, white papers, and practice advisories, practice guidelines, and literature reviews;</p></list-item>
