<abstract>
<p>The effect of ante-mortem hypoxia on the physicochemical and functional properties of raw and cooked white shrimp was studied. Hue angle was greater (<italic>p</italic> ≤ 0.05) for stressed raw shrimp compared to control (greener color); whereas a lower angle was detected for cooked stressed shrimp (redder/orange coloration). In addition, hue angle increased (<italic>p</italic> ≤ 0.05) over the ice storage period for control and stressed shrimp (raw and/or cooked). Muscle hardness and shear force showed no differences when comparing control and stressed shrimp (raw and/or cooked). However, during ice storage, shear force increased (<italic>p</italic> ≤ 0.05) by 22% and 9% for control and stressed raw shrimp, respectively; in contrast, shear force and muscle hardness decreased for cooked shrimp (<italic>p</italic> ≤ 0.05). Control showed more (<italic>p</italic> ≤ 0.05) elasticity than stressed cooked shrimp. Stressed raw shrimp showed a water holding capacity 10.8% lower (<italic>p</italic> ≤ 0.05) than control. However, during the storage, water holding capacity increased (<italic>p</italic> ≤ 0.05) reaching similar values to control after day 4. Muscle protein solubility of stressed shrimp was 31% lower than control; however, no differences (<italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.05) were observed after the second day. The thermal stability of myosin (<italic>T</italic><sub>max</sub>) showed differences (<italic>p</italic> ≤ 0.05) among control and stressed shrimp, whereas no differences for Δ<italic>H</italic> were observed. Results showed the influence of ante-mortem hypoxia on the physicochemical and functional properties of white shrimp muscle.</p>

<sec id="sec1-1082013212452386" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Shrimp continues to be the most important commodity traded in value terms, accounting for 15.4% of the total value and generated the highest value (US$9 billion) of internationally traded fish products in 2008 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1082013212452386">FAO, 2010</xref>; Martínez-Porchas and Martínez-Córdova, 2012). Mexican shrimp culture grew around 17% in only 2 years and is expected a maintained growth during the next 10 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1082013212452386">Martínez-Córdova et al., 2009</xref>). However, during shrimp culture cycle, the organisms are exposed to unpredictable and highly variable environmental changes (e.g. temperature, pH, salinity, dissolved oxygen, metabolites, etc.), which in some cases could be stressors for shrimp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1082013212452386">Alpuche et al., 2005</xref>), causing, in some cases, a considerable economic losses due to the increased mortality and decreased growth rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1082013212452386">Jiang et al., 2009</xref>). Hypoxia is one of the most common causes of stress for farm-raised shrimp; in addition, large fluctuations in dissolved oxygen are common in the estuarine environments inhabited by shrimp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1082013212452386">Ibarra et al., 2007</xref>). As stressor, hypoxia is known to affect growth, nutritional status, metabolism and bioenergetics of penaeid shrimp; in consequence, the organism activates alternative metabolic pathways, such as anaerobic glycolysis, to cope with the increased energy demand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1082013212452386">Guadagnoli and Reiber, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1082013212452386">Mercier et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1082013212452386">Mugnier and Soyez, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>The response of crustaceans to hypoxia has been well studied from behavioral, physiological, metabolic and molecular perspectives. In addition, huge economic losses have been associated with hypoxia, due to the increased mortality and decreased growth rate in shrimp exposed to low oxygen levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1082013212452386">Brown-Peterson et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1082013212452386">Jiang et al., 2009</xref>). However, there is yet no available information regarding the effect of ante-mortem hypoxia on the physicochemical and functional properties of white shrimp. Changes promoted by ante-mortem hypoxia combined with changes occurring during storage (ice and frozen) could have negative implications on the acceptance of shrimp by consumers. These changes can be evaluated by monitoring parameters, such as color, water holding capacity (WHC), texture profile analysis (TPA), protein solubility and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The last one has been an important tool for evaluating the acto-myosin thermal stability of muscle proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1082013212452386">Tseng et al., 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>Considering the above information, the aim of this research was to evaluate the effect of ante-mortem hypoxia on the physicochemical and functional properties of white shrimp (<italic>Litopenaeus vannamei</italic>) muscle during storage on ice.</p>

<sec id="sec2-1082013212452386" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title>
<sec id="sec3-1082013212452386"><title>Bioassay</title>
<p>Shrimp were obtained from a commercial farm located at Guaymas, Sonora. Live shrimp were transported to the laboratory and randomly distributed into two plastic tanks (200 shrimp/tank 2000 L). The organisms in inter-molt stage and weighing approximately 15 g were allowed to acclimate to laboratory conditions for 2 days. Thereafter, one group (tank 1) was stressed by hypoxia (0.5 mg/mL dissolved oxygen) for 5 h, whereas the second (control) group was maintained under normoxia (5.0 mg/mL). Water parameters were maintained at the following optimal conditions during the experiment: 35% of salinity, a pH of 6.8–7.0 and a temperature of 28 ℃. Both groups were harvested simulating the farm harvesting conditions. Shrimp were placed on coolers within alternate layers of ice–shrimp–ice and transported to the Seafood Laboratory at CIAD in Hermosillo, Sonora, where the cephalothoraxes were removed by hand. The abdominal portions of shrimp at pre-rigor stage (control and stressed) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1082013212452386">Díaz-Tenorio et al., 2007</xref>) were put inside plastic bags, then placed on coolers (ice–shrimp–ice) and stored at 0–2 ℃ for 21 days. During storage, eight samples from both lots were analyzed at days 1, 4, 6, 9, 12, 16 and 21.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-1082013212452386"><title>Preparation of samples for analyses</title>
<p>Shrimp samples were haphazardly selected in each sampling day, one bag of stressed shrimp and one bag of control shrimp were analyzed; 10 shrimp from each bag (control and stressed) were removed to be cooked; whereas the rest of shrimp were considered as raw samples. All shrimp samples (raw and cooked) were analyzed. Color, shear force, water holding capacity (WHC), solubility and protein denaturation (DSC) were measured for raw shrimp only; while for cooked shrimp, texture profile analysis (TPA), shear force and color were monitored. First and second somites of shrimp were used for shear force and TPA analyses whereas the third somite was used for WHC. The rest of the abdomen was homogenized; the muscle homogenates were immediately analyzed for solubility and DSC.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-1082013212452386"><title>Color</title>
<p>Color was measured on control and stressed shrimp (raw and cooked), using a Konica-Minolta CR-400 Tristimulus colorimeter (Konica Minolta Sensing, Inc., Tokyo, Japan). Color coordinates were used to measure the degree of lightness (<italic>L</italic>), redness-greenness (+<italic>a</italic>/−<italic>a</italic>), and yellowness-blueness (+<italic>b</italic>/−<italic>b</italic>). At least, three measurements per shrimp were done to eight shrimps. For better integration and interpretation of ‘<italic>a</italic>’ and ‘<italic>b</italic>’ values, hue angles (Θ) and total color differences (Δ<italic>E</italic>) were calculated using the following equation

</sec>
<sec id="sec6-1082013212452386"><title>Shear force</title>
<p>Shear force was measured for raw and cooked shrimp by a Texture Lab Pro texturometer (Food Technology, Corp., Sterling, VA, USA) using a Warner-Bratzler shear attached to the 500 N load cell. To mimic human bite, the shrimp abdomen was cut transversally between the first and second somite (preliminary studies were done to select the better somite for this experiment); the cross-head speed was 10 cm/min. The maximum peak (maximum force) was recorded as the maximum force required to shear the muscle sample. Eight shrimp were used for each treatment.</p>
<p>The maximum force for cooked shrimp was measured; for this trial, shrimp were cooked in boiling water for 2 min. Cooked shrimp were cooled immediately on water with ice and finally peeled.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec7-1082013212452386"><title>Water holding capacity</title>
<p>WHC was measured by centrifugation. Excess water was dried using a paper towel. Each segment was weighed (<italic>W<sub>i</sub></italic>) and placed in a centrifuge tube; the samples were then centrifuged at 28,000 × g and 4 ℃ for 20 min. After centrifugation, samples were removed with tweezers and dried with paper towel before the final weight (<italic>W<sub>f</sub></italic>) was recorded. The WHC was expressed as grams of water held per gram of protein present in the sample, using the following equation

<sec id="sec8-1082013212452386"><title>Protein solubility</title>
<p>Total soluble proteins from fresh and thawed shrimp muscle were evaluated using the methods of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1082013212452386">Hsu and Ko (2001)</xref>, with slight modifications. A 1 : 19 ratio of minced shrimp muscle to phosphate buffer, <italic>I</italic> = 0.65 (8 mM NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 12 mM Na<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub>, 0.6M NaCl, pH 7.0) was used. The shrimp/buffer mixture was homogenized at 13,000 r/min for 1 min using a model TR-10 Tissumizer machine (Tekmar, Co., Cincinnati, OH, USA). The homogenate was centrifuged at 20,400 × g and 4 ℃ for 15 min. The supernatant obtained after centrifugation was subjected to evaluation of the total protein solubility using the Biuret method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1082013212452386">Gornall et al., 1949</xref>). Finally, the protein solubility was expressed as grams of protein per gram of muscle.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec9-1082013212452386"><title>Thermal transitions of muscle proteins</title>
<p>DSC was performed to measure the thermal stability of shrimp muscle proteins. A differential scanning calorimeter (DSC7 Perkin Elmer de Mexico, S.A., Monterrey, and México) was calibrated for temperature and baseline using indium as the standard. Previously minced and weighed muscle samples (50 mg) were placed into iron pans and hermetically sealed. An empty sealed pan was used as reference. The samples were scanned from 10 ℃ to 90 ℃ at a heating rate of 5 ℃/min. The enthalpy change (Δ<italic>H</italic>) for the major thermal transitions was determined by measuring the area above the transition curve, with a straight baseline constructed from the start to the end of the exotherms. The temperature at the maximum heat flow (<italic>T</italic><sub>max</sub>) and the enthalpy change (Δ<italic>H</italic>) were recorded.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec10-1082013212452386"><title>Texture profile analysis</title>
<p>Texture profile analysis was performed using a Texture Lab Pro Texturometer (Food Technology, Corp.) with a load cell of 500 N, according to the technique described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1082013212452386">Veland and Torrissen (1999)</xref>. Cooked muscles were transversely compressed at 1 cm using the first segment. Double compression at 75% and normal stress at 1 mm/s crosshead velocity were used. Results were analyzed with the Texture Expert program for windows calculating hardness, elasticity and cohesiveness.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec11-1082013212452386"><title>Statistical analyses</title>
<p>Data were analyzed by performing ANOVA and adjusted to a General Linear Model (GLM) using the statistical software package NCSS 2007. A post hoc Tukey test was used when significant differences were detected (<italic>p</italic> ≤ 0.05).</p>

<sec id="sec13-1082013212452386"><title>Color</title>
<p>Hue angle in stressed raw shrimp was greater (<italic>p</italic> ≤ 0.05) than that from control raw shrimp (towards a bluer color); such response could be attributed to the release of different metabolites promoted by hypoxia, which in combination with storage, increased the hue angle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1082013212452386">Figure 1</xref>). The hue angle increased (<italic>p</italic> ≤ 0.05) throughout the ice storage for both, control and stressed shrimp.
<fig id="fig1-1082013212452386" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Hue angle of raw and cooked shrimp stored on ice.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1082013212452386-fig1.tif"/>
</fig></p>
<p>Control cooked shrimp displayed a greater (<italic>p</italic> ≤ 0.05) hue angle than stressed cooked shrimp (towards more orange colorations). In addition, the hue angle increased (<italic>p</italic> ≤ 0.05) during ice storage for both, control and stressed cooked shrimp (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1082013212452386">Figure 1</xref>). The hue angle increment indicated changes in color, from reddish/orange to red/less orange. Such effect could cause less acceptability of shrimp stored in ice by the consumer due to the less appealing appearance. The decrease of reddish color is also confirmed by the ‘<italic>a</italic>’ and ‘<italic>b</italic>’ values, both indicators tended to red at the beginning of storage, but decreased with time, achieving an orange-like color.</p>
<p>Regarding red color achieved after cooking, such response could be attributed to the presence of carotenoids. Herein, α-crustacyanin is the mayor blue protein complex contained in the carapace of shrimp; for instance, bluish color of shrimp is determined by the bond of the carotenoid astaxathin to crustacyanin, but when this protein complex is exposed to elevated temperatures, the complex is denaturalized and carotenoids are released, turning shrimp muscle to a reddish color.</p>
<p>Stressed shrimp turned into a bluish color before being stressed; as explained above, crustacyanin is responsible for the blue color; therefore, considering that up-regulations of crustacyanin-C1 subunit have been observed in crustaceans exposed to hypoxia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1082013212452386">Jiang et al., 2009</xref>), the blue color of stressed shrimp could be strongly related to such biochemical process.</p>
<p>A useful parameter of the tristimulus colorimetry is the calculation of the total color difference (Δ<italic>E</italic>) comparing the initial day of storage (day 0) with the subsequent days. Results showed a higher Δ<italic>E</italic> value for control raw shrimp compared to stressed raw shrimp (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1082013212452386">Figure 2</xref>), which suggests that changes in color were greater in control raw shrimp. However, Δ<italic>E</italic> increased over time for both control and stressed raw shrimp during storage; in particular, greater changes were observed after day 9. These results demonstrate changes in color occurring during ice storage.
<fig id="fig2-1082013212452386" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p>Total color difference (Δ<italic>E</italic>) of raw and cooked shrimp stored on ice.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1082013212452386-fig2.tif"/>
</fig></p>
<p>Regarding Δ<italic>E</italic> for cooked shrimp, increases over time were also observed for stressed and control shrimp, and the increases intensified from ninth day. However, no significant differences were observed among stressed and control shrimp (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1082013212452386">Figure 2</xref>).</p>
<p>Shrimp raw color is an important characteristic, considering that consumers use such attribute to select or discard fresh shrimp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1082013212452386">Erickson et al., 2007</xref>; Parisenti et al., 2010). Several studies have evaluated the effect of different factors on the color properties of white shrimp (raw or cooked); for instance, the effect of heating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1082013212452386">Benjakul et al., 2008</xref>), the effect of dietary products (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1082013212452386">Parisenti et al., 2011</xref>), etc. Additionally, the effect of storage on the sensory attributes for fresh and frozen commercial white shrimp has been documented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1082013212452386">Erickson et al., 2007</xref>); this study demonstrated that raw shrimp tend to turn into brown color after storage, whereas cooked shrimp exhibit a diminution in the intensity of their red/orange color. The above information suggests that red-like color is associated with freshness and product quality. Surprisingly, there is no information available concerning the effect of stress (hypoxia) on the white shrimp color. However, the effect of stress and storage temperature on the color of farmed cod (<italic>Gadus morhua L</italic>.) was reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1082013212452386">Helge Stien et al. (2005)</xref>; they found that changes in color were more pronounced at higher level of stress.

<sec id="sec14-1082013212452386"><title>Shear force</title>
<p>The maximum shear force value was used as an indicator of the degree of toughness of shrimp. Shear force showed no significant differences among control and stressed shrimp (raw and cooked); however, shear force increased (<italic>p</italic> ≤ 0.05) for raw shrimp (control and stressed) and decreased (<italic>p</italic> ≤ 0.05) for cooked shrimp (control and stressed) during ice storage (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1082013212452386">Table 1</xref>). The increase of shear force over time in shrimp storage on ice is in agreement with findings reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1082013212452386">Nunak and Schleining (2011)</xref> for the same family of shrimp. Changes in shear force for this study occurred after 4 days of storing for both shrimp (control and stressed) suggest from a texture perspective that shrimp should not kept on ice more than 4 days; in the case of cooked shrimp, the lower shear force could be attributed to a protein denaturalization, probably caused by the cooking process and the ice storage. It is generally accepted that the major components in muscle that can affect meat tenderness are muscle fibers and connective tissues. Therefore, heat denaturation of the myofibrillar proteins and shrinkage of collagen experienced in the early stages of heat treatment result in a tightening and stiffening of the structure. The softening during prolonged cooking is caused by the conversion of the collagen to gelatin and dissociation of muscle proteins. Some authors have reported that the cooking time, temperature and their combination affect the textural properties of food (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1082013212452386">Erdoğdu and Balaban 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1082013212452386">Nunak and Schleining, 2011</xref>). For this study, the cooking time used (2 min) was similar to that used for the local industry, in order to avoid loss of water from the muscle.

<sec id="sec15-1082013212452386"><title>Texture profile analysis</title>
<p>TPA was performed in cooked shrimp. Hardness tended to be higher in stressed shrimp; however, no significant differences were detected compared to control. Both shrimp muscles exhibited a decrease in hardness over time, indicating that shrimp muscle becomes softer and less force is required to compress and deform it. Muscle hardness decreased by 12.6% and 22.6% for control and stressed cooked shrimp during ice storage comparing day 1 vs 21 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1082013212452386">Figure 3(a)</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1082013212452386">Erickson et al. (2008)</xref> reported that, during storage, the texture became soft due to the protein degradation. For this study, although no significant differences were detected comparing control vs stressed shrimp, the hardness of the stressed organisms decreased by 10% compared to the control during the storage on ice.
<fig id="fig3-1082013212452386" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p>Texture profile analysis (TPA) of shrimp stored on ice: (a) hardness; (b) elasticity; (c) cohesiveness.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1082013212452386-fig3.tif"/>
</fig></p>
<p>Greater elasticity was measured for control shrimp compared to stressed ones. Elasticity of control shrimp increased over time until 16th day, but decreased at day 21st. The same increase was observed for stressed shrimp, but only at fourth day of storage, from that point and after, decreases in elasticity were observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1082013212452386">Figure 3(b)</xref>).</p>
<p>Cohesiveness, defined as the deformation capacity of any muscle before breaking, showed to be higher in control shrimp compared to stressed shrimp; however, no significant differences (<italic>p</italic> ≥ 0.05) were assessed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1082013212452386">Figure 3(c)</xref>).</p>
<p>During storage, stressed shrimp showed their maximum peaks of elasticity and cohesiveness at an earlier time than control shrimp, indicating that texture profile of these muscles were negatively affected by stress and could be deformed faster than control shrimp. For instance, myofiber–myofiber attachments determine the texture profile of marine meat products; considering that stress could cause myofiber detachments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1082013212452386">Taylor et al., 2006</xref>), it is possible that such detachments occurred in muscle of stressed shrimp, causing a subsequent decrease in hardness, elasticity and cohesiveness. In addition, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1082013212452386">Avila-Villa et al. (2012)</xref> reported decreases in the same TPA parameters of stress-disease shrimp, compared to healthy shrimp; they associated the decrease of the TPA to myofiber–myofiber detachments.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec16-1082013212452386"><title>WHC and protein solubility</title>
<p>WHC was lower in the muscle of stressed raw shrimp compared to control raw shrimp at first and second days of storage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1082013212452386">Figure 4(a)</xref>); however, no significant differences were detected during the rest of the trial, which suggests that the ice storage process used for this study (21 days) did not affect the WHC of control and stressed shrimp. It is possible that modifications occurred in the structural properties of proteins caused by stress were reversible changes. Perhaps, modifications caused by the hypoxia promoted the folding and unfolding of proteins (tertiary and secondary structure) to reach its most stable configuration. It is possible that during the first 4 days of ice storage, the hydrophobic amino acids were exposed to the exterior of the protein causing lesser WHC on stressed shrimp than on the control; while after 4 days of ice storage, the ice storage and the hypoxia caused molecular protein changes exposing their hydrophilic amino acids to the exterior of the protein and thus increasing the WHC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1082013212452386">Xiong, 1997</xref>).

</fig></p>
<p>Protein solubility registered in muscle of stressed raw shrimp was 31% lower than control raw shrimp (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1082013212452386">Figure 4(b)</xref>). However, differences were detected only at first day of storage. As mentioned above, such response could be attributed to the reversible modifications of protein caused by stress. No effect of storage time was observed on any of the treatments, which exhibited a constant protein solubility (∼0.1 g prot·g/muscle) during the trial.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec17-1082013212452386"><title>Thermal transitions of muscle proteins</title>
<p>Proteins can undergo unfolding caused by destabilizing forces, which increase with temperature fluctuation. Temperature fluctuation generally occurs during storage and/or transportation; these fluctuations can lead to deterioration of the final quality of the product (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1082013212452386">Benjakul and Bauer, 2000</xref>). The energy absorbed by proteins during thermal denaturation was measured by DSC. The thermal stability (<italic>T</italic><sub>max</sub> and Δ<italic>H</italic>) of shrimp muscle proteins, control and treated samples (hypoxia), stored on ice are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1082013212452386">Table 2</xref>. Peak I corresponds to myosin; significant differences among control and stressed raw shrimp were detected, indicating that the stress probably increase the thermal resistance of myosin on day 1. Moreover, combined to the previous, thermal stability of myosin increased (<italic>p</italic> ≤ 0.05) comparing days 1 to 21 (control and stressed). The <italic>T</italic><sub>max</sub> increment probably can be attributed to a rearrangement of water molecules around the protein molecules, producing a slight increase in hydrophobic interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1082013212452386">Medina-Vivanco et al., 2004</xref>), thus, needing more energy for the unfolding of the protein during the DSC analysis. In addition, a statistical interaction among treatments (control and stressed) and the storage was found, indicating that, although <italic>T</italic><sub>max</sub> increased for control and stressed shrimp during the storage, the mechanism that caused the <italic>T</italic><sub>max</sub> increment could be probably different. Regarding to Δ<italic>H</italic> values, no significant differences among treatments were observed, which indicates that the energy needed to denaturalize myosin was similar for both shrimp samples (stressed and non-stressed).

<p>The study provided evidence that, although the stressed raw shrimp presented greater hue angle than control, resulting in more attractive orange color when cooked, the ante-mortem hypoxia had a negative effect on the WHC, protein solubility, myofibrillar proteins thermal stability and muscle texture of the shrimp. Thus, results showed the influence of ante-mortem hypoxia on the physicochemical and functional properties of white shrimp muscle. Further studies could investigate the effect of stress on the composition, microbiological and post-mortem quality of muscle to suggest a better handling process during the harvest of the product.</p>
