<abstract>
<p>Based on a theoretical model developed by Schlechty, this case study focuses on a small high school, located on a college campus and designed to address the educational needs of gifted 9th- through 12th-grade students. Eight teachers who taught 9th- and 12th-grade classes and their 60 students were observed. Each teacher was observed during six unannounced observational visits focusing on the characteristics of the learning environments in these unique classroom settings. The authors share insights gained from this case study that can help teachers as they develop learning environments in more traditional classroom settings.</p>

<body>
<p>The popular movie <italic>Waiting for Superman</italic> suggests that many public schools lack learning environments that provide all students the support they need to become successful learners. Developing an appropriate learning environment is a critical factor in the successful instruction of gifted students. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0162353212459256">Hennessey (2004)</xref> noted that close attention must be paid to creating appropriate learning environments if student motivation, creativity, and special talents are to be augmented. Furthermore, Hennessey argued that giftedness can be nurtured if the appropriate interactions take place between the learners and their environments. The research described in this article is a case study of a unique high school where teachers and students have created a very strong, supportive school climate. The researchers believe that several important factors isolated in this case study can be applied to the development of learning environments that encourage gifted and talented students to become actively involved in their education, think critically and creatively, and interact freely and responsibly with peers and teachers.</p>
<p>The development of a gifted high school classroom into a quality learning environment for gifted students, whether homogeneously or heterogeneously grouped, is a complex process. All teachers are called on to become leaders who provide learning opportunities that keep students engaged while encouraging all learners to become self-motivated, independent thinkers. The role of teachers (in such a classroom) is to create climates where teaching is not simply dispensing information; rather, it should involve directing student learning and providing feedback as students become actively engaged as a group of learners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0162353212459256">Hunt, Wiseman, &amp; Touzel, 2009</xref>). Therefore, instructional practices should stress constructivist models emphasizing such techniques as concept mapping, the promotion of higher level thinking, and teaching students to reflect on their own ideas through metacognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0162353212459256">Novak, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0162353212459256">Wenglinsky, 2004</xref>). This certainly is not meant to suggest that direct instruction should not take place, but it does suggest that the climate of the classroom, especially one populated by gifted students, should not be characterized by continuous lecture, drill, and note taking.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, classroom environments can be characterized by student and teacher interactions that hinder the development of creativity and the motivation to learn (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0162353212459256">Baugous &amp; Bendery, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0162353212459256">Hennessey &amp; Amabile, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0162353212459256">Ratcliff et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0162353212459256">Rimm-Kaufman, La Paro, Downer, &amp; Pianta, 2005</xref>). The concern over the difficulty of developing quality learning environments leads one to ask an important question: What would high school learning environments be like if there were no behavior management issues and passing basic tests was not a problem? That is to ask, if teachers were presented with an ideal situation, could we expect to find that classroom climates would be highly supportive learning environments? To gain insights concerning quality learning environments, the current case study examines the learning environment of one gifted education site that has had a consistent history of academic excellence.</p>

<title>Methodological Assumptions</title>
<p>The methodological assumptions on which this research is based are derived from educational sociology; specifically, the early work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0162353212459256">Schlechty (1976)</xref> who defined the classroom as a small group society where teachers lead students in the accomplishments of educational goals. There is a historical foundation for this type of research that recognizes the importance of studying the group dynamics of classrooms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0162353212459256">Eisner, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0162353212459256">Jackson, 1968</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0162353212459256">Lortie, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0162353212459256">Schlechty, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0162353212459256">Waller, 1961</xref>). In one of his last Phi Delta Kappan articles, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0162353212459256">Bracey (2009b)</xref> noted the importance of doing educational research focusing on the way teachers and students interact and how teachers structure learning environments to promote these interactions. Recently, there has been considerable interest in the observational studies of the classroom climate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0162353212459256">Bracey, 2009a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0162353212459256">Pianta, 2006</xref>).</p>

<title>Variables Under Study</title>
<p>For this case study, quantitative data were collected focusing on the climate of the selected classrooms. Researchers collected observational data on the following: (a) classroom instructional interactions between teachers and their students, (b) classroom management interactions between teachers and their students, (c) the amount of student time-on-task, (d) types and the number of direct and indirect instructional methodologies being used, (e) instructional group sizes being used, and (f) the number and level of teacher questions.</p>
<sec id="section3-0162353212459256">
<title>Instructional and Behavioral Interactions</title>
<p>Classroom interaction is a complex construct that has a great impact on the climate of the teaching/learning environment. The work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0162353212459256">R. S. Newman (2000)</xref> as well as that of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0162353212459256">Nelson-LeGall and Resnick (1998)</xref> suggests that emotions, motivations, and perceptions are interconnected as they impact both instruction and classroom management interactions. The way in which teachers and students communicate during instructional tasks and during classroom management episodes needs to be examined if the complexity and the quality of the social climate of a classroom are to be fully understood. This understanding can lead to more developmentally supportive school environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0162353212459256">Pianta, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>There appears to be a clear connection between the type and amount of teacherâstudent interactions and student development. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0162353212459256">Brophy (2004)</xref>, in a summary of research, concluded that studentsâ developmental outcomes improved when teacherâstudent interactions were characterized by warmth, sensitivity, and emotional support in the context of structure, teacher modeling, and direct instruction. Clearly, on-task interactions (verbal communications related solely to the content under study) between teachers and their students, and among individual students have been found to characterize the classroom climates of effective teachers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0162353212459256">Waxman &amp; Huang, 1997</xref>).</p>
<p>Noninstructional interactions have also been found to be related to effective and ineffective teaching/learning environments. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0162353212459256">Rimm-Kaufman et al. (2005)</xref> reported that high classroom quality was most consistently related to a low number of management problem interactions and that students were more likely to comply with teacher directives in structured, teacher-directed settings.</p>
<p>In a study of middle school classrooms, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0162353212459256">Abidin and Kmetz (1997)</xref> found that teachers interacted in a significantly different way with students who were behaviorally challenging as compared with those behaving in a more acceptable manner. The researchers reported that teachers had fewer positive interactions with behaviorally challenging students and avoided contact with behaviorally challenging students when stress levels increased. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0162353212459256">Schlechty (1976)</xref> referred to this avoidance of interaction (when a student challenges and threatens teacher control of the classroom) as <italic>retreating</italic>. In an earlier study of middle-level students, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0162353212459256">Hunt (1975)</xref> suggested that in a school where ability grouping was used, there were more behaviorally challenging student interactions in classrooms with the lower-ability-grouped students and, consequently, more teacher retreating behaviors. Research findings of Hunt and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0162353212459256">Veldman and Sanford (1984)</xref> question the ability of teachers to use the same instructional techniques consistently with lower ability students that they successfully use with high-ability students.</p>
<p>Student-to-student interactions, when characterized by engagement in the learning task, have been found to be positively related to student achievement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0162353212459256">Rimm-Kaufman et al., 2005</xref>). In an extensive study of gifted programs, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0162353212459256">Rogers (2007)</xref> reported that significant academic achievement occurs when gifted students are grouped with and encouraged to interact with like-ability or like-performing peers.</p>

<sec id="section4-0162353212459256">
<title>Time-On-Task</title>
<p>An optimum learning environment is typically characterized as a classroom where students and teachers are working on specific learning tasks; that is to say, teachers who created positive classroom climates minimized the time that students exhibited off-task behaviors. By reducing behavior management problems, the teachers increased the amount of time students were on task; as students and teachers spent less time on management problems, more time was dedicated to learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0162353212459256">Baugous &amp; Bendery, 2000</xref>). As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0162353212459256">Clough, Smasal, and Clough (1994)</xref> reported, behavior problems attracted the attention of all members in the teaching/learning environment. These interruptions took time away from instruction and made it more difficult to get students back on task.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0162353212459256">Prater (1992)</xref> suggested that teachers should create a classroom climate where they spend as little time as possible correcting studentsâ behavior problems by using preventive strategies to decrease unwanted student behavior, while positively impacting learning by increasing student time-on-task. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0162353212459256">Wakefield (2004)</xref> concluded that an important step for the teacher to take to increase time-on-task is to modify the curriculum to ensure that students see it as relevant to their lives. In addition, researchers have found that the type of task assigned by the teacher impacted the amount of time students exhibited on-task behavior. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0162353212459256">McCurdy, Skinner, Grantham, and Hindman (2001)</xref> reported that making assignments brief and fast paced increased time-on-task behavior. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0162353212459256">Moore, Anderson, and Kumar (2005)</xref> noted that breaking assignments into briefer segments increased student time-on-task behavior.</p>
<p>Some researchers reported that higher level thought activities increased time-on-task behavior. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0162353212459256">Amato-Zech, Off, and Doepke (2006)</xref> reported that critical thinking tasks were related to higher student on-task behavior, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0162353212459256">Gillies (2006)</xref> suggested that giving students ample time to reflect on answers increased on-task behavior.</p>
<p>Cooperative learning strategies also seem to affect student time-on-task positively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0162353212459256">Baugous &amp; Bendery, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0162353212459256">Pate-Clevenger, Dusing, Houck, &amp; Zuber, 2008</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0162353212459256">Gupta (2004)</xref> reported that true cooperative learning groups had a positive impact on student engagement. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0162353212459256">Mueller and Fleming (2001)</xref> suggested that the increase in student engagement in cooperative learning groups was a result, in part, of the fact that cooperative learning allowed students to have fun while learning.</p>
<p>Studies of the effects of praising students who are exhibiting on-task behavior provided mixed results. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0162353212459256">Rathvon (1990)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0162353212459256">Rosenberg, Sindelar, and Stedt (1985)</xref> reported that teacher praise and other verbal encouragement helped to decrease off-task behavior. However, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0162353212459256">Amato-Zech et al. (2006)</xref> found that encouraging statements had no effect on student on-task behavior.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0162353212459256">
<title>Instructional Methodology</title>
<p>It has become widely accepted that active student learning paired with indirect teaching methods is associated with higher student achievement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0162353212459256">Barron &amp; Darling-Hammond, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0162353212459256">Richards, 2005</xref>). For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0162353212459256">F. M. Newman, Marks, and Gamoran (1995)</xref>, in a study of 2,100 students, discovered a robust positive relationship between student achievement and the use of indirect teaching methods that encourage critical thinking, problem solving, and communicating results. Significantly, the academic gains associated with the use of indirect teaching methods were found regardless of studentsâ race, gender, or previous achievement. The research focusing on the best practice for teaching gifted students supports this position. Teachers of gifted students are encouraged to use metacognitive strategies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0162353212459256">Van Tassel-Baska, Avery, Little, &amp; Hughes, 2000</xref>), higher level thinking strategies in content areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0162353212459256">Elder &amp; Paul, 2003</xref>), and experiences that relate to the interests of gifted students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0162353212459256">Rogers, 2007</xref>). Unfortunately, some teachers of gifted students may not choose to implement indirect strategies because of the belief that teachers need to transmit knowledge so that students are better prepared for college and standardized testing requirements. In addition, many high school teachers may not receive the necessary training to successfully use these strategies. In a study of 2,167 North Carolina high school teachers, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0162353212459256">Jenkins, Queen, and Algozzine (2001)</xref> found that 58% of teachers reported they had received extensive training in direct instruction/lecture while less than 20% reported any training in indirect methods such as cooperative learning (23%), discovery learning (17%), or the use of peer tutoring (15%).</p>
<p>It is important to note that additional studies have indicated that cooperative learning groups have positive effects on student achievement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0162353212459256">Peterson &amp; Miller, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0162353212459256">Vaughan, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0162353212459256">Yu, 2000</xref>). A characteristic of cooperative learning methods that has been related positively to student achievement is task-related student-to-student interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0162353212459256">Slavin, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0162353212459256">Slavin, Hurley, &amp; Chamberlain, 2003</xref>); however, a similar pattern for enhanced achievement through cooperative learning has not been established for gifted learners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0162353212459256">Robinson, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0162353212459256">Rogers, 2002</xref>). Although there are few studies that have supported the use of cooperative learning with gifted students, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0162353212459256">Neber, Finsterwald, and Urban (2001)</xref> suggested that cooperative learning has the potential for improving instruction in gifted classes and concluded that additional empirical research is needed to gain more insight related to the possible advantages of using cooperative learning with gifted students.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0162353212459256">
<title>Group Size</title>
<p>Instructional group size is yet another area of focus when discussing classroom climate and is directly related to the use of instructional strategies. To meet the instructional needs of all students in a classroom, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0162353212459256">Hunt et al. (2009)</xref> suggested the use of a variety of flexible grouping strategies. They suggested introducing the lesson with whole-group discussion to be followed by a variety of small group and paired experiences. These authors stressed the importance of the need to be flexible when assigning and reassigning students to various groups. Group membership may change based on content and assessment of student learning.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0162353212459256">Slavin et al. (2003)</xref> made a case for the positive relationship between the use of small, cooperative learning groups and student achievement. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0162353212459256">Wilkinson and Fung (2002)</xref> reported, in the results of their meta-analyses of grouping research, there was a small, yet meaningful, advantage to using small instructional grouping as compared with whole-class instruction primarily stemming from improved student-to-student interactions.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0162353212459256">Rogers (2002)</xref> reported that gifted students preferred independent study and independent projects above all other forms of instructional delivery when compared with regular learners. At the secondary level, gifted students were found to improve in achievement and motivation for learning while working independently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0162353212459256">Callahan &amp; Smith, 1990</xref>). However, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0162353212459256">Rogers (2007)</xref> noted, being gifted and motivated to do independent projects does not guarantee that gifted students will have success. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0162353212459256">Slavin (1995)</xref> reported that individualization, which allows students to work at their own pace and levels of difficulty, did solve some of the problems associated with providing appropriate instruction; however, individualization could create serious management problems and deprive students of needed direct instruction. Although earlier meta-analyses found that individualization generally did not have positive effects on student achievement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0162353212459256">Hartley, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0162353212459256">Horak, 1981</xref>), a form of individualization incorporating the use of cooperative learning groups was found to be associated with increases in mathematics achievement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0162353212459256">Slavin, Leavey, &amp; Madden, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0162353212459256">Slavin, Madden, &amp; Leavey, 1984</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0162353212459256">
<title>Questioning</title>
<p>The teacherâs use of questioning is associated with direct and indirect teaching techniques and instructional grouping. When studying teacher questioning, researchers observed the frequency and type of the questions asked. In their classic research, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0162353212459256">Gallagher and Aschner (1963)</xref> developed the following categories for questions: cognitive memory, convergent thinking, divergent thinking, evaluative, and routine. The first four categories correspond to the model for the structure of the intellect developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0162353212459256">Guilford (1959)</xref>; these categories form a hierarchy of questions from those whose answer typically requires low-level thinking (cognitive memory questions and convergent thinking questions) to high levels of thinking (divergent thinking questions and evaluative thinking questions). Routine questions are those that tend to be noninstructional in nature. For example, âIs there a glare on the board?â</p>
<p>As long ago as 1912, it was reported that 80% of a teacherâs day is spent asking questions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0162353212459256">Stevens, 1912</xref>). However, research focusing on the relationship between the cognitive level of teachersâ questions and student achievement has produced contradictory findings. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0162353212459256">Rosenshine (1971)</xref> reported a positive relationship between questioning and student achievement. Yet, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0162353212459256">Wilen (1991)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0162353212459256">Arends (1994)</xref> found no difference between high-level and low-level questions as related to student achievement. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0162353212459256">Brophy and Good (1986)</xref> summarized research on classroom questioning strategies and concluded that higher level questions were not significantly better than lower level questions; however, when teaching complex cognitive content, teachers should try to ask questions that have more than one correct answer (by definition either divergent thinking or evaluative thinking questions).</p>
<p>As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0162353212459256">Cotton (1990)</xref> reported, asking questions frequently during instruction was positively related to learning facts, although frequently asking questions did not increase the learning of more complex material. This finding was significant because <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0162353212459256">Wilen (1991)</xref> also noted that teachers asked primarily low-level questions, yet high-level questions tended to encourage students to think critically especially when they were asked to explain, clarify, or support their responses. Critical thinking is a key component of gifted instruction. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0162353212459256">Shaunessy (2000)</xref> noted that the use of higher level questions is an important strategy when instructing gifted students. Many educators have proposed that the use of high-level questions leads to a growth in studentâs critical and creative thinking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0162353212459256">Daniels, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0162353212459256">Feldhusen, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0162353212459256">Gallagher, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0162353212459256">Schwartz &amp; Millar, 1996</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0162353212459256">Van Tassel-Baska and Stambaugh (2005)</xref> suggested that the ability to pose high-level questions is a relevant teaching skill needed to become a successful teacher of gifted students.</p>
<p>The purpose of this case study is to describe the learning environment of a public high school for students identified as outstanding learners (i.e., highly motivated with a history of high achievement on standardized tests and grade point average [GPA]).

<sec id="section9-0162353212459256">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>The school being studied is a public school; however, it is located on a university campus. During their 4 years of high school, the students take courses in English, mathematics, science, and social studies. In addition, the students earn additional credits by attending regular undergraduate college courses along with undergraduate students enrolled at the university. The participants in this study included (a) the eight teachers who taught in the 9th- and 12th-grade classes and (b) their students in this unique high school setting. Three of the eight teachers taught only in the 12th grade and four taught only in the 9th grade; one teacher taught 9th- and 12th-grade classes. In the 9th grade, the content areas observed were English, mathematics, science, social studies, and life skills seminar. In the 12th grade, the content areas observed were mathematics, social studies, and science. The teacher who taught 9th- and 12th-grade classes was a science teacher. Of the four teachers who were observed only in the 9th grade, all were Caucasian; two were males and two were females. Of the three teachers who were observed only in the 12th grade, all were Caucasian; two were females and one was male. The teacher who was observed in both grades was a Caucasian male. As the school is part of a South Carolina school district, teachers apply for announced openings in the same manner that teachers apply for openings at all other district schools. The prospective teachers are interviewed and go through the standard process to be hired. The principal noted in an interview that candidates must be certified to teach Advanced Placement classes or receive the certification within 1 year after taking the position.</p>
<p>There were a total of 42 students enrolled in the 9th grade and 18 enrolled in the 12th grade. In all, 26 of the 9th-grade students were female; of this number, 23 were Caucasian, 2 were African American, and 1 was categorized as Other. Of the 16 males in the 9th grade, 14 were Caucasian and 2 were Hispanic. In total, 11 of the 12th-grade students were female; all of whom were Caucasian. Of the 7 males in the 12th grade, 6 were Caucasian and 1 was categorized as Other.</p>
<p>Students are admitted to the school through a rigorous selection process. First, a student must complete a formal application similar to the one used at the collegiate level with letters and recommendations. In a typical year, approximately 160 freshmen will apply for 50 openings. The files are first screened by the principal and one other faculty member, and scored using a rubric looking at PSAT or Explore scores, other standardized test scores, grades, application letter, behavior records, and attendance records. As the students will be enrolled in some university coursework, the PSAT/Explore category is most heavily weighted. Those students who are still viable candidates after the first screening (around half of the original applicants) will be invited to take part in a second round of the admission process. In this second phase, students must be interviewed by the principal and one faculty member, write an essay, take a mathematics test, and submit teacher recommendations for review. Again, a rubric is used with the interview score (which is an average of each interviewerâs individual score) having the most weight.</p>
<p>The students in the current senior class have performed very well; for example, nine of them were national merit finalists, four of them have scored an 800 on one section of the SAT with an average score of 2,039 for the entire class. In addition, these seniors have been offered scholarship awards totaling US$4,853,465. As a total student body, the students attending this school have a 98% pass rate on Advance Placement Examinations (the national average is 57%), and they carry a 3.743 GPA in all college coursework.</p>

<sec id="section10-0162353212459256">
<title>Procedures and Operational Definitions</title>
<p>Data were collected using observational methods. All observations were unannounced and scheduled randomly to ensure that teachers did not know when the researchers were coming to their classrooms and that teachers were seen during all appropriate classes. All teachers were observed 6 times for 40 min per observation; therefore, each teacher was observed for a total of 240 min (4 hr). The teacher who taught at both grade levels was observed 3 times (120 min) at each grade level. The observations were completed over a 3-month period of time. Two researchers took part in data collection during each observation. The first researcher collected data related to teacher and student interactions as well as student time-on-task behavior. The second researcher simultaneously collected data related to the number and types of instructional strategies being used, instructional group size being used, and the number and level of teacher questions being used.</p>
<p>The first observer recorded teacher and student interactions that were either instructionally related or behavior management related. The operational definitions for these behaviors were adapted from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0162353212459256">Schlechty (1976)</xref>. Teacher instructional behavior, as defined in this study, includes teachers giving out information, asking questions, and answering student questions; these interactions were recorded as <italic>teacher task behavior</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0162353212459256">Ratcliff et al., 2010</xref>). Behavior management interaction includes asking students to change their behavior (<italic>teacher normative behavior</italic>), punishing or threatening to punish students to coerce them into changing their behavior (<italic>teacher coercive behavior)</italic>, rewarding students for exhibiting desired behavior (<italic>teacher remunerative behavior</italic>), and ignoring students who are in violation of stated behavior rules or expectations (<italic>teacher retreating behavior</italic>). It should be noted that in previous research, teacher coercion and teacher retreating behaviors have been found to be inversely correlated to teacher task behavior and student on-task behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0162353212459256">Ratcliff et al., 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Student instructional interaction, as defined in this study, included students answering content-related questions posed by the teacher or fellow students, asking content-related questions directed to the teacher or fellow students, or making appropriate content-related comments within the flow of the lesson; these interactions were recorded as <italic>student task behavior</italic>. Student behavior related to classroom management, as defined in this study, included students complying with a teacher request to change their behavior (<italic>student conformity</italic>) and overtly disregarding state school and teacher conduct rules and request (<italic>student rebellion</italic>).</p>
<p>Finally, the designated researcher completed five time-on-task scans during every 40-min observation. The classroom was scanned from right to left noting the number of students who were off-task. Students were considered on task unless it was obvious to the observer that they were not attending to or involved in an appropriate learning experience. Time-on-task was recorded as a fraction designating the number of students who were off-task over the total number of students who were present during each scan.</p>
<p>The second observer recorded the types and levels of teacher questions asked, the types and duration of instructional groupings used, and the types and duration of instructional methods used. The instructional grouping designations were <italic>whole class, small groups</italic>, and <italic>individualized</italic>. The types of methodology were categorized as either direct instruction or indirect instruction and then subcategorized under those headings as found in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0162353212459256">Hunt et al. (2009)</xref>. Drill, lecture, modeling, brainstorming, and teacher-led discussions were all listed as examples of direct instruction; learning centers, cooperative learning, inquiry, independent projects, and laboratory techniques (i.e., students working in groups and manipulating items or equipment with teacher guidance) were listed as examples of indirect instruction.</p>
<p>As noted, the second observer also collected data related to the type and number of teacher questions asked during instruction. Using the previously discussed classifications developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0162353212459256">Gallagher and Aschner (1963)</xref>, each teacher question was coded as low level (cognitive memory or convergent) or high level (divergent or evaluative). Typically, a question that has only one expected correct answer is going to be low level. High-level questions are characterized by having multiple answers that can be considered acceptable.</p>
<p>Data were collected by university faculty members who are former classroom teachers and have been teaching and supervising field experiences in teacher education programs for a minimum of 5 years. Data collectors were trained in a half-day workshop during which they carefully reviewed and discussed operational definitions and codes. In a public school setting prior to actual data collection, the researchers were in agreement on more than 97% of all data coded (279 independent pieces of data) during a 40-min observation that provided strong interrater reliability. The field data were recorded and transferred to data sheets for quantitative analysis.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>Data were analyzed to provide answers to the original research questions. The answers to these research questions provide us with information that can be used to paint a picture of life, for teachers and their students, in a school designed to provide an optimal learning environment. The resulting information does not necessarily suggest that all schools should be like the special school under study. However, it may provide needed information to help high school educators modify existing learning environments to provide optimal learning for their students.</p>
<sec id="section12-0162353212459256">
<title>How Teachers Interact With Students</title>
<p>The learning environments observed in this study were characterized by large amounts of teacher task interactions. During 32% of the observations, teachers exhibited from 201 to 250 teacher task interactions; during 8% of the observations, teachers exhibited more than 300 teacher task interactions. Simply put, teachers were giving out verbal information, asking questions, and answering studentsâ questions much of the time. On an average, teachers in this study interacted with their students instructionally more than 189 times during each 40-min observational session.</p>
<p>An even more dramatic finding was that teachers rarely had the need to use behavior management interactions during the observations. On an average, teachers used 1.9 teacher normative interactions during each 40-min observation; during those same 40-min observations, teachers exhibited teacher coercion, teacher remunerative control, and teacher retreating behavior an average of 0 times (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0162353212459256">Table 1</xref>). This is to say, the teachers were actively and vocally involved in instruction and rarely had to correct student behavior during these observations.</p>

<title>How Students Interact With Teachers</title>
<p>The learning environments observed in this study were also characterized by large amounts of student task interactions. During 22% of the observations, students exhibited from 151 to 250 student task interactions, and during 13% of the observations, students exhibited more than 250 student task interactions. Students were discussing content, asking questions to their teachers or fellow students, or answering questions posed by their teachers or fellow students during much of the instructional period. On average, students in this study interacted instructionally 136 times during each 40-min observational session. The average number of students was 12.38 with a range of 8 to 23 students per class (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0162353212459256">Table 2</xref>).</p>
<p>As would be expected in an environment where teachers rarely had to use behavior management interactions, students almost never exhibited unwanted behaviors. On average, there were only 0.2 examples of student rebellion observed during each observation. These data indicate that the learning environment in this unique setting was characterized by teachers and their students verbally interacting with one another almost continuously.</p>

<title>Teachers Use of Instructional Methodology</title>
<p>The teachers in this study used seven different instructional methodologies during the observation sessions; four were direct strategiesâlecture, drill, modeling, and teacher-led discussionâand three were indirect strategiesâcooperative learning, independent projects, and laboratories. The teachers in this study predominantly used direct instruction. Drill, teacher-led discussion, and modeling were the methods most commonly observed. Lecture, the least frequently used type of direct instruction, was observed more frequently than cooperative learning and independent projects combined. The instructional methodologies observed during this study are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0162353212459256">Table 3</xref>. Although teachers allowed students to become involved in the learning environment, this involvement occurred through participation in teacher-directed learning experiences.</p>

<title>Student On-Task Behavior</title>
<p>Although there were many student task interactions observed, it is very important to determine the percentage of students involved in on-task behavior. The overall average for each scan conducted during the 40-min observations indicated that 97% of the students were found to be on task. Due to the fact that there were almost no behavior management interactions observed in the learning environment, it would be expected that high rates of student on-task behavior would be observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0162353212459256">Ratcliff et al., 2010</xref>). It is clear that teachers were actively teaching and students were actively involved in learning in the classrooms observed.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section16-0162353212459256">
<title>Questioning</title>
<p>On average, teachers in this study asked their students 34.4 instructional questions in each 40-min observation or 0.86 questions every minute. Of the questions asked, on average, 25.11 were coded as low level and 8.94 were coded as high level. Further analysis indicated that the students were asking an average of 12.3 questions per session, which means that, on average, the learning environments were characterized by more than one question being asked per minute. Obviously, the climate of the classrooms was characterized by rather fast-paced interactions taking place among and between the students and their teachers.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section17-0162353212459256">
<title>Instructional Grouping</title>
<p>For the majority of time (87% of the observational sessions), the teachers in this study used whole-group instruction. Individual instruction was coded during 6% of the observational sessions and small group instruction was coded during 7% of the sessions.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The classroom environments in this case study had some consistent characteristics that clearly separated them from nongifted classrooms these researchers have studied in the past and was obviously a case unlike most public high schools across our country. The intent of this study was to examine carefully this unique high school setting to describe the learning environment, not to suggest that this environment is best for all.</p>
<p>The data analysis allowed for the formation of a clear description of the climate of this unique high school. In this school, researchers found classrooms where students were typically arranged in a whole-group structure with teachers using predominately drill, teacher-led discussion, modeling, and lecture (i.e., direct instruction). Almost all interactions between teachers and their students were instructional by nature; there were very few instances of unwanted student behavior during the observational sessions. As a result, teachers rarely had a reason to manage student behavior or retreat. The climate was characterized by a large number of questions asked by teachers and students during the average observational session; this tended to lead to fast-paced verbal interactions between teachers and students and among the students. A fast-paced learning environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0162353212459256">McCurdy et al., 2001</xref>), free of behavior management interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0162353212459256">Clough et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0162353212459256">Ratcliff et al., 2010</xref>), is an ideal climate for high student on-task behavior; as a result, the observed student time-on-task was exceptionally high in this study.</p>
<p>The findings related to instruction are of special interest to educators of gifted students. First, the teachers asked many questions, but these questions were predominantly lower level (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0162353212459256">Table 4</xref>). It should be noted that 73% of all teacher questions asked were lower level that typically required brief student responses. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0162353212459256">Gallagher (1985)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0162353212459256">Shaunessy (2000)</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0162353212459256">Van Tassel-Baska and Stambaugh (2005)</xref> expressed the importance of using high-level questions when teaching gifted students. The findings from this study support <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0162353212459256">Gallagher (1985)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0162353212459256">Shaunessy (2000)</xref> who stressed that as important as the use of high-level questions is, most teachers are not using a large proportion of high-level questions. In fact, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0162353212459256">Parker (1989)</xref> noted that most teacher questions are factual, convergent thinking questions.</p>

<p>Second, teachers and students were consistently on task, but the instruction tended to be direct in whole-group settings, not differentiated. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0162353212459256">Bracken, Van Tassel-Baska, Feng, and Brown (2006)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0162353212459256">Van Tassel-Baska, Zuo, Avery, and Little (2002)</xref> suggested that differentiated materials and instruction lead to academic growth for gifted and nongifted students. Although the researchers found that the teachers in this case study used primarily whole-group instruction, small group and individualized methods were also used. Direct instructional methods including modeling, teacher-led discussion, lecture, and drill were most often relied on during instruction. However, some indirect methods were used such as student presentations, cooperative learning, and laboratories (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0162353212459256">Table 3</xref>).</p>
<p>Finally, the pace of the instruction tended to be fast; for example, teachersâ use of 34.4 questions every 40 min (0.86 questions per minute) maintained a fast instructional pace. Regardless of methods used or group size, a rapid pace characterized by questions and responses may have helped to keep students engaged and on task. This finding supports earlier research that suggested that gifted students experience optimal learning when material is presented in a fast-paced fashion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0162353212459256">Bartkovitch &amp; Meszynski, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0162353212459256">Rogers, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0162353212459256">Stanley &amp; Stanley, 1986</xref>) in math and science, while <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0162353212459256">Van Tassel-Baska (1987)</xref> reported similar findings for foreign language instruction. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0162353212459256">Rogers (2007)</xref> noted, this fast-paced learning works best in like-performing groups (like the ones found in this case study) or individually.</p>
<p>These findings should be of interest to teachers of gifted students because they address key points that have been emphasized in the literature. As noted, the importance of asking high-level cognitive questions, using differentiated instruction, and maintaining a fast pace of instruction has been stressed by leaders in the field of gifted and talented education. The students in this study progressed well and had high scores on standardized examinations; however, 87% of the questions asked by the teachers were at a lower cognitive level, and direct instruction was the predominant method used. When examining factors such as types of instruction and levels of teacher questions in classrooms where all students are high achievers, test scores may not be a good measure because these highly capable students are apt to perform well regardless of the instructional methodologies used. Perhaps, educators need to look more closely at qualitative factors, such as the way students are encouraged to respond to the high-level questions asked, not just the number of high-level questions that teachers might ask during instruction.</p>
<p>An implication of this study is that high-ability students respond to classroom environments that are active and engaging, despite the use of whole-class grouping, direct instruction, and low-level questions. These students performed well in quickly paced, stimulating environments where the teachers mentally engaged (interacted) with students through direct instruction. Cooperative learning, student presentations, and lab work certainly have their place in most classroom settings; however, the findings in the present study suggested that these students responded favorably to teacher-centered instructional methods that were deliberative, enticing, and demanding. Such environments are also likely to be those in which teachers only rarely have to use remunerative or coercive management strategies as defined by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0162353212459256">Schlechty (1976)</xref>.</p>
<p>Although this case study was in a setting that might be considered ideal for teaching, it is important to consider how the observed teacher behaviors and studentâteacher interactions can be generalized to foster positive learning environments in traditional high school classrooms. Students were engaged throughout each class and often worked together to solve problems. A further implication of this study is that active and well-managed classrooms, where time is not wasted addressing unwanted student behavior, may promote student on-task behavior. As noted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0162353212459256">Wilkinson and Fung (2002)</xref>, interactions between both students and teachers, and among students, are important variables when studying learning environments.</p>
<p>As the researchers observed these classrooms, it became obvious that these high school teachers asked primarily low-level questions; however, the students asked many higher level questions to their teachers and fellow students. The teachers clearly encouraged such questions by thoughtfully responding without annoyance. In fact, teachers took the opportunity to model thoughtful responses that illustrated how educated people think and find answers to questions that require reflection. Much of the research that has been completed on classroom questioning has focused on teacher questions. The authors believe that further research should be conducted to investigate the number and level of questions being asked by students in gifted and nongifted classrooms. In addition, more research should be conducted to determine how teachers can best encourage students to ask high-level cognitive questions. Hopefully, a better understanding of the number and/or proportion of high-level teacher and student questions needed to foster critical and evaluative thinking would evolve from such research.</p>
