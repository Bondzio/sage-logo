<abstract>
<p>This is the first study to provide national estimates of pediatric door-related injuries in the United States. Data from the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System were analyzed for patients ≤17 years who were treated in US emergency departments for a door-related injury from 1999 through 2008. An estimated 1 392 451 US children ≤17 years received emergency treatment for door-related injuries, which averages approximately 1 injury every 4 minutes in the United States. Both the frequency and rate of injury increased significantly. Boys accounted for 55.4% of injuries, and 41.6% of children were ≤4 years. The most common mechanism of injury was a “pinch in the door” (54.8%) or an “impact to the door” (42.0%). Patients admitted to the hospital were most frequently treated for amputations (32.0%) or lacerations (25.2%). The frequency of injuries associated with glass doors increased significantly with increasing age, in contrast to injuries from other types of doors.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>More than 3 million nonfatal unintentional injuries occur among children younger than 15 years old in the home annually. Doors are an important source of injury and disability, especially among young children and especially in the home.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0009922811423308">1</xref></sup> Door-related injuries include pinch injuries to fingers, impact injuries from collisions with doors, and lacerations from broken glass. These injuries can result in cutaneous wounds, fractures, dislocations, damage to tendons and nerves, fingernail avulsions, and amputations. Entrapping a finger in a closing door can result in a unique phalanx fracture pattern.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0009922811423308">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0009922811423308">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>Most studies that have examined door-related injuries are from countries outside of the United States and are usually limited to retrospective analysis of cases from single-hospital emergency departments (EDs).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0009922811423308">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0009922811423308">14</xref></sup> Previous studies have generally included door-related injuries as part of a larger study focused on injuries to a specific body region (usually hand or finger injuries),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0009922811423308">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0009922811423308">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0009922811423308">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0009922811423308">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0009922811423308">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0009922811423308">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0009922811423308">18</xref></sup> the pinching mechanism of injury,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0009922811423308">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0009922811423308">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0009922811423308">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0009922811423308">20</xref></sup>or the clinical management of injuries (primarily phalanx fractures).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0009922811423308">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0009922811423308">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0009922811423308">21</xref></sup> Glass door–related injuries have been discussed as part of architectural glass-related injury articles but not as a separate topic. According to these articles, glass door–related injuries are frequent and usually the most severe injuries associated with architectural glass.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0009922811423308">22</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0009922811423308">24</xref></sup> To our knowledge, this study is the first to evaluate the epidemiology of door-related injuries to children treated in US EDs using a nationally representative sample.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0009922811423308" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>Injuries treated in US hospital EDs that are associated with consumer products or recreational and sport activities are monitored by the US Consumer Product Safety Commission through the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System (NEISS).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0009922811423308">25</xref></sup> The NEISS receives data from a network of approximately 100 hospitals that represent a stratified probability sample of 6100 hospitals in the United States that have a 24-hour ED with at least 6 beds. Weights can be applied to NEISS data to provide national estimates of these injuries. The database includes information about the patient’s age, gender, race, injury diagnosis, injured body region, products involved, disposition from the ED, location at the time of injury, and a brief narrative describing the incident.</p>
<p>For this study, NEISS data for 1999 through 2008 were obtained from the US Consumer Product Safety Commission regarding door-related injuries: “doors not specified” code 1892 (this code combines 1827, 1845, 1849, 1858, 1879, 1880 codes for the years before 2003) and “doors with glass panels” code 1893 (combines 1823, 1825, 1882, 1883 codes for the years before 2003). Each case narrative was examined to determine whether the case met our inclusion criteria. Garage doors and car doors were excluded from the study. Injuries that involved only door hardware or components, such as the door frame, jam, knob, latch, stop, hinge, doorway, sliding-door track, or any other object attached to the door, were excluded. However, any pinch-related injury of a body part that involved the door closing against any other surface or object, such as a door frame, wall, floor, or another door, was included in the study. Cases in which the door or glass door panel was broken prior to the injury event, fell on the patient, or was not positioned and/or used in the usual intended way were excluded from the analysis. For example, cases in which the child was injured while climbing or jumping on an unhinged door that was lying against the wall or ground were excluded. Cases in which the patient was holding an object or had something in his or her mouth or ears at the time of the incident that caused the injury were also eliminated. “Door hardware” (code 1820) and “door jam” (code 1878) cases were also reviewed, and cases were included if they met inclusion criteria.</p>
<p>Patients were grouped agewise into 0- to 4-, 5- to 9-, 10- to 14-, and 15- to 17-year-old categories. Injured body regions were grouped into 8 categories: (1) head/neck, including the ear, mouth, and face; (2) upper extremity, including elbow, wrist, lower arm and upper arm; (3) hands; (4) fingers; (5) trunk, including the pubic region, shoulder, and upper and lower trunk; (6) lower extremity, including the ankle, knee, foot, and lower and upper leg; (7) toe; and (8) other body region, which includes injuries to &gt;25% of the body. Injury diagnosis was categorized as follows: (1) soft-tissue injuries, including contusions, abrasions, crush injuries, hematomas, and strains or sprains; (2) lacerations, including punctures; (3) amputations, including avulsions; (4) head injuries, including concussions and internal injuries to the head region; (5) fractures; and (6) other injuries, which includes dermatitis/conjunctivitis, internal organ injuries (for all body regions except the head), dental injuries, hemorrhages, poisonings, dislocations, burns not specified, thermal burns, foreign bodies, and the NEISS “other” category.</p>
<p>The disposition variable was grouped into (1) admitted to hospital, which includes treated and admitted for hospitalization within the same facility, treated and transferred to another hospital, treated and transferred for hospitalization, and held for observation &lt;24 hours; and (2) released from hospital, which includes treated and released, examined and released without treatment, left without being seen, and left against medical advice. Location where the injury occurred was categorized as (1) home, which includes mobile home, apartment/condo, and farm/ranch; and (2) not home, which includes street or highway, other public property, industrial place, school, and place of recreation or sport. A new variable was created from the product codes that distinguished glass doors from other types of doors, such as metal, plastic, wood, or other material. An additional variable was created from the case narratives to categorize the mechanism of injury. These categories were (1) impact by or to door, (2) pinch in door, and (3) mechanism not specified in the narrative. Careful attention was given to the prepositions <italic>in</italic> and <italic>on</italic> in the case narrative descriptions. For example, cases in which a body part was “slammed” or “smashed” <italic>in</italic> a door were categorized as pinch injuries, and cases in which a body part was “slammed” or “jammed” <italic>on</italic> a door were categorized as impact injuries.</p>
<p>The statistical software used to analyze data included SPSS for Windows 17.0 (SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL), EpiInfo 6.04d (USD, Stone Mountain, GA), SAS 9.1 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC), and SUDAAN 10 (Research Triangle Institute, Research Triangle Park, NC). Door-related injury rates per 100 000 US children ≤17 years were calculated using US Census Bureau intercensal data for each study year, except 2008, for which data were unavailable.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0009922811423308">26</xref></sup> Statistical evaluation included linear regression, χ<sup>2</sup> analysis with Yates’ correction, and computation of injury proportion ratios (IPRs) with corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs). The method for calculation of IPRs for population subgroups is identical to that for calculation of relative risks. Statistical significance for all tests was determined using α = .05. All data reported in this article are national estimates. This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of The Research Institute at Nationwide Children’s Hospital.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>There were an estimated 1 392 451 door-related injuries from 1999 through 2008, averaging 139 245 injuries per year (95% CI = 136 423 -142 267). Both the frequency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0009922811423308">Figure 1</xref>; slope = 3450.96, <italic>P</italic> = .020) and rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0009922811423308">Figure 2</xref>; slope = 0.05, <italic>P</italic> = .027) of door-related injuries increased significantly during the study period. There was an 18.1% increase in the number of door-related injuries from 1999 (n = 121 814) to 2008 (n = 143 909). Children ≤4 years old accounted for 41.6% of all door-related injuries (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0009922811423308">Figure 3</xref>), and boys predominated (55.4%). Information on the location of injury was missing for 20.1% of cases. Among records for which information on the location of injury was available, the majority (79.9%) of door-related injuries occurred at home. Most patients (99.1%) experiencing door-related injuries were treated and released from the hospital.</p>

<p>Only 7.4% of all door-related injuries involved glass doors; however, patients with injuries involving glass doors were twice as likely to be admitted to the hospital compared with patients injured by other types of doors (IPR = 2.03; 95% CI = 1.46, 2.83). Regression analyses showed that the frequency of injuries involving glass doors increased with increasing age (slope = 192.99; <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001), whereas the frequency of injuries involving other types of doors decreased with increasing age (slope = −4462.94; <italic>P</italic> = .004).</p>
<p>The mechanism of injury could not be identified from the case narrative in 3.2% of cases. Among cases with a known mechanism of injury, pinch (54.8%) and impact to or with a door (42.0%) were the leading mechanisms. Children ≤4 years old were more likely to have a pinch injury compared with children 5 to 17 years of age (IPR = 1.25; 95% CI = 1.20-1.30). Impact injuries were more likely to occur with glass doors than with other types of doors (IPR = 2.10; 95% CI = 2.03-2.18), whereas other types of doors posed a greater risk for pinch injuries than glass doors (IPR = 3.81; 95% CI = 3.11-4.68). A pinch injury was 7.08 times (95% CI = 5.69-8.80) more likely to result in an amputation than an impact injury.</p>
<p>More than three quarters (78.6%) of all pinch injuries were to the finger, representing 43.1% of the total number of door-related injuries. Of the estimated 600 054 finger injuries caused by pinches, 48.2% were soft-tissue injuries, 20.3% lacerations, 16.4% fractures, and 11.3% amputations. Approximately 6960 patients with finger injuries caused by pinches were admitted to the hospital. This accounted for 56.5% of all hospital admissions for door-related injuries.</p>
<p>The body regions most frequently injured were fingers (47.6%) and the head/neck (24.6%; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0009922811423308">Figure 4</xref>). Fingers, when compared with other body regions, were more likely to sustain an amputation (IPR = 4.62; 95% CI = 4.03-5.31) or a fracture (IPR = 2.43; 95% CI = 2.23-2.63). Injuries to the head/neck region were more than twice as likely to be lacerations when compared with injuries to other body regions (IPR = 2.43; 95% CI = 2.28-2.58). More than half (54.6%) of children ≤4 years old sustained finger injuries.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Almost 1.4 million children were treated in hospital EDs in the United States from 1999 through 2008 for door-related injuries, which averages approximately 1 injury every 4 minutes. The increasing rate and frequency of these injuries indicate that increased prevention efforts are needed. Children ≤4 years of age made up the largest percentage (41.6%) of patients sustaining door-related injuries and were more likely to have a pinch injury and to sustain amputations or head injuries than older children. The frequency of door-related injuries involving nonglass doors was greater for younger children. However, the frequency of door-related injuries involving glass doors was greater for older children. The different injury patterns between the age groups may be explained in part by developmental characteristics: the probing nature of toddlers and the risk-taking behavior of adolescents. Cases of adolescents and adults punching glass while under the influence of alcohol are well described in the literature.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0009922811423308">27</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0009922811423308">29</xref></sup> Although we do not have data indicating alcohol use/nonuse among the adolescents in this study, this is one possible explanation for this trend and should be further explored.</p>
<p>Similar to previous studies,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0009922811423308">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0009922811423308">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0009922811423308">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0009922811423308">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0009922811423308">30</xref></sup> the most common mechanism of injury in our study was pinching. The majority of pinch injuries were to the fingers, which was the most frequently injured body region overall. Fingers are small, fragile, and often the first means that a young child uses to explore his or her surroundings. Fingers injured by pinching most often sustained soft-tissue injuries, followed by lacerations, fractures, and amputations. According to previous studies, the majority of pediatric amputations involve doors and fingers of young children; consequently, door-associated pinch prevention would eliminate most finger amputations among children.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0009922811423308">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0009922811423308">16</xref></sup> More than 90% of patients in this study were treated and released from the ED. Of those who were admitted to the hospital, more than half were patients with finger injuries caused by pinches, and almost one third of patients admitted were treated for amputations. Ljungberg et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0009922811423308">8</xref></sup> reported that among all hand injuries, fingertip pinch injuries had a low median cost but accounted for the single largest source of total hand and forearm injury health care costs because of their frequency.</p>
<p>Injuries caused by impact with a door accounted for 42% of all door-related injuries. Impact to or with the door resulted most frequently in lacerations to the head. In our study, impact injuries were twice as likely to occur in association with glass doors as with other door types. Despite the relatively small number of glass door–related injuries (7.4%), these injuries pose serious risk for lacerations and hospital admission, and they follow a unique injury pattern with regard to the at-risk population and mechanism of injury. Our study, like previous studies,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0009922811423308">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0009922811423308">31</xref></sup> found that the frequency of injuries related to glass doors increased with increasing age. This may be because, as children grow, they gain the weight and strength necessary to break the glass, and they also adopt more risk-taking behaviors.</p>
<p>Glass door–related injuries are a unique subset of door-related injuries. They can be very expensive to treat, often requiring extensive surgery and rehabilitation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0009922811423308">22</xref></sup> and have resulted in fatalities.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0009922811423308">23</xref></sup> Many glass door panel designs currently found in homes make use of ordinary annealed glass that, when broken, shatters into numerous sharp pieces that are capable of causing serious lacerations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0009922811423308">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0009922811423308">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0009922811423308">22</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0009922811423308">24</xref></sup> This is in contrast to glazed safety glass, which breaks into small harmless fragments, or laminated glass, which is more difficult to break and, if broken, does not typically shatter into pieces but remains bonded, reducing the risk of injury.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0009922811423308">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>Adult supervision of young children when in close proximity to doors may prevent many injuries. However, in a study of pediatric door-related injuries to the arm, forearm, or fingers, an adult was present three fourths of the time.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0009922811423308">11</xref></sup> Other studies have reported that in more than one third of cases, another child, an adult, or the wind closed the door on the patient’s fingers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0009922811423308">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0009922811423308">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0009922811423308">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0009922811423308">32</xref></sup> Therefore, we cannot rely solely on parental supervision or behavior change among children to prevent these injuries.</p>
<p>Passive prevention measures are essential to protect against door-related injuries. Passive forms of prevention do not require users to change behavior or take action but, instead, involve changes to make the environment safer, such as through product modification. This type of automatic protection is more effective in preventing injury than active forms of prevention, such as constant vigilance by parents or other caregivers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0009922811423308">33</xref></sup> We could not find any published studies exploring the idea that door edges and even their surface and weight could be designed to be blunter, softer, and safer. We urge the creation of engineering solutions and standards to soften sharp door edges, which also incorporate strategies to prevent door-related pinch and glass injuries.</p>
<p>In agreement with previous studies examining injuries to the forearm, hand, and fingers,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0009922811423308">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0009922811423308">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0009922811423308">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0009922811423308">15</xref></sup> this study found that most door-related injuries occurred at home. Child care center standards from the National Resource Center for Health and Safety in Child Care and the General Service Administration’s Child Care Center Design Guide both state the need for the use of door hinge protection to prevent pinching,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0009922811423308">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0009922811423308">35</xref></sup> but this need extends beyond child care centers. One option for preventing pinches is a “pinch-free” door that has a rubber seal between the closing surfaces that prevents injury and complies with building regulations, such as fire resistance.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0009922811423308">15</xref></sup> Door hinge guards, which cover the gap between the door and frame and eliminate the risk of pinching a body part in the hinge side of the door, are also available. To prevent pinching on the latch side, there are several devices that stop doors from slamming shut, such as magnetic catches, latches, rubber door stoppers, or foam guards that clip over the edge of the door. Even simple techniques, such as putting a towel over the top of the door, can be effective.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0009922811423308">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0009922811423308">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>In homes with glass doors, placing a warning, marking, or decorative static cling on large glass areas may prevent someone from walking into the door unintentionally but would not prevent glass door–related injuries caused by aggressive or risky behavior.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0009922811423308">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0009922811423308">36</xref></sup> Glass doors are not a safe option for installation at the bottom of staircases, and homeowners should ensure that ordinary annealed glass doors are replaced with safer options such as laminated or glazed safety glass to prevent laceration injuries.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0009922811423308">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0009922811423308">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0009922811423308">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0009922811423308">31</xref></sup></p>
<p>This study has several limitations. The true incidence of door-related injuries is underestimated by this study because not all children with door-related injuries are treated in hospital EDs. Some are treated in other types of medical facilities or may not seek treatment at all. Therefore, the door-related injuries reported in this study may also not be representative of all injuries associated with doors. The frequency and rate of pediatric door-related injuries treated in US EDs increased over the study period; however, it was not possible to determine the cause. The increase may be a result of the greater exposure of children to doors, an increase in the hazardousness of the doors themselves, or a change in ED care-seeking behavior of parents of children with these injuries. We were also unable to determine the severity of the injury beyond using the proxy of hospital admission status. Additionally, intentionality was not possible to consistently identify from case narratives in this study. There were cases in which children intentionally punched doors, including glass doors, in a moment of rage or while trying to get inside a room or house. We were also unable to identify the side of a door (hinge vs latch side) where a pinch injury occurred because of insufficient detail in case narratives. However, some finger injury studies have found that the hinge side of a door was the most common site of pinching.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0009922811423308">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0009922811423308">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0009922811423308">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0009922811423308">30</xref></sup> This study also likely underestimates the number of glass door–related injuries because the type of door was not consistently documented in case narratives.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>To our knowledge, this study is the first to evaluate the epidemiology of door-related injuries to children treated in US EDs using a nationally representative sample. Door-related injuries are common among children, especially among boys and children ≤4 years of age. Both the frequency and rate of injury increased significantly during the 10-year study period, which underscores the need for increased prevention efforts.</p>
