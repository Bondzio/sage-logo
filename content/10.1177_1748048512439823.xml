<abstract>
<p>Terms such as liquid, dynamic and fluid news have been used to illustrate and emphasize the ever-changing, user-influenced and border-crossing nature of contemporary online news. However, although often used, what such terms actually denote often remains unspecified, and no existing studies have tried to propose a way to measure and analyse the impact of liquidity’s potential on authentic online news. The three-fold purpose of this exploratory study is therefore to move towards a clearer understanding of liquid news and to propose and explore a method of empirically measuring online news’s liquidity.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>News had already become available both online and digitally 10 years ago in many countries, yet the term <italic>online news </italic>says very little about the difference between online news now and then. Earlier empirical studies of online news reported on non-interactive media outlets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1748048512439823">Schultz, 1999</xref>), a shovelware logic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1748048512439823">Boczkowski, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1748048512439823">Scott, 2005</xref>), absence of multimedia storytelling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1748048512439823">Colson and Heinderyckx, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1748048512439823">O’Sullivan, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1748048512439823">Quandt, 2008</xref>) and the lack of hyperlinks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1748048512439823">Dimitrova et al., 2005</xref>). These studies from different parts of the world indicated that the digital media’s potential was far from being realized, as online news was presented mostly in the same manner as in traditional newspapers, only doing so online. The scenario, however, has changed, with media outlets having begun to embrace the characteristics of the digital medium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1748048512439823">Domingo et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1748048512439823">Karlsson and Strömbäck, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1748048512439823">Tremayne et al., 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Although online news has different characteristics than analogue news, initially as a potential but recently also in practice, how the totality of these characteristics should be described and understood remains incompletely established. In addressing this shortcoming <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1748048512439823">Deuze (2008a</xref>) referred to online news as <italic>liquid</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1748048512439823">Pavlik (2001</xref>) and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1748048512439823">Tremayne et al. (2007</xref>) as <italic>dynamic</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1748048512439823">Deuze (2008a</xref>), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1748048512439823">Lowrey (2006</xref>), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1748048512439823">Pavlik (2001</xref>) and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1748048512439823">Singer (2008b</xref>) as <italic>fluid</italic> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1748048512439823">Matheson (2004</xref>) as <italic>knowledge-as-process</italic>. These different terms all describe what is basically the same phenomenon, news as an unpredictable continuous process, while leaving what that phenomenon is mostly unspecified. The lack of clarity and coherence in explaining a phenomenon that is essential to understanding contemporary journalism is problematic, as it can lead to misunderstandings with respect to what it is and consequently how it should be investigated. Generally speaking, studies addressing the concept of liquid-fluid-dynamic news refer to it more often than they attempt to explain it properly, and none have explored it empirically. Liquid news poses a challenge for any scholar around the globe who seeks to study it and so far there is little guidance provided.</p>
<p>This exploratory study’s three-fold purpose is, therefore, first to move towards a clearer understanding of liquid news (restricted to the manifest content as it appears to the reader), second, to propose a method to measure dimensions of online news’s liquidity, and, third, to test this method empirically. As various studies have used varying terminology to describe the phenomenon and using a single term improves clarity, this study employs the term <italic>liquid news</italic>, as it connects and resonates well with broader social theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1748048512439823">Bauman, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1748048512439823">Deuze, 2008a</xref>).</p>

<title>Considering the liquidity of online news</title>
<p>Most of the studies addressing the liquid and dynamic nature of online news content have done so only broadly without making any conspicuous attempt to provide details about it. While this can certainly assure accuracy, the lack of detail with respect to liquid news makes it a difficult phenomenon to investigate empirically. Other studies have managed to be somewhat more specific and have connected the concept of liquid news and associated terms with established facets of online news (interactivity, immediacy, multimodality and hyperlinks), although without explicitly defining or explaining what liquid news is.</p>
<p>Many studies have connected news liquidity with interactivity and the medium’s participatory potential. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1748048512439823">Engebrektsen (2006</xref>: 13) referred to this as being a ‘user-controlled, dynamic and dialogic form of journalism’. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1748048512439823">Lowrey (2006</xref>: 487) contrasted online news media with traditional journalism by noting that they allow a ‘fluid stream of information and commentary’, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1748048512439823">Rosenberry (2005</xref>: 63) predicted that journalism in cyberspace has the potential to be much more ‘fluid and interactive’. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1748048512439823">Singer (2006</xref>: 268) referred to online news as an ‘open, participatory, fluid medium’, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1748048512439823">Deuze (2008a</xref>: 860) predicted that ‘media content will be increasingly determined by the interactions between users and producers’. All these studies have viewed interactivity, generally understood as user participation in the production of news, to be a vital component of online news’s liquidity. User participation therefore connotes liquidity, as it is a continuous exchange between producers and consumers, consequently blurring the traditional roles of active producers and passive consumers.</p>
<p>Furthermore, research has associated news liquidity with the immediacy dimension of online news, which <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1748048512439823">Deuze (2008a</xref>: 861) called ‘continuous edits’, or has called for news content to be more liquid and dynamic in order to meet putative audience expectations for receiving news ‘in real time’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1748048512439823">Pavlik, 2001</xref>: 21). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1748048512439823">Tremayne et al. (2007</xref>: 826) connected such immediacy with another feature of digital media known as multimedia storytelling, referring to manifestations of dynamic news as ‘changes [that] include the addition or subtraction of stories, the alteration of headlines, the changing or addition of photos, and other multimedia elements’. A central idea that links immediacy with liquidity is that online news changes continuously and unpredictably, creating erratic streams of information. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1748048512439823">Deuze (2008b</xref>) also noted a strong link between multimodality and liquidity, as such previously separated forms of expression as text, audio, moving image, maps and graphics can now coexist in a single medium, thus obscuring the boundaries between different media formats and their distinct modalities.</p>
<p>Hyperlinks constitute another factor that has been linked with online news’s liquidity. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1748048512439823">Matheson (2004</xref>: 458) illustrated the differences between the burgeoning knowledge-as-process journalism and traditional knowledge-as-product journalism as ‘journalism of linking rather than pinning things down’. Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1748048512439823">Singer (2008b</xref>: 73) contrasted traditional with liquid journalism by connecting hyperlinking with immediacy and user participation, noting that journalists’ ‘stories are part of a fluid, seamless, participatory, and inextricably interconnected media world, and ongoing development of those stories is a collective and ultimately uncontrollable process’. Consequently, hyperlinks provide the users with possibilities to navigate freely, although within an already made structure, from story to story, from a news site to an external site and back again, in that process blurring previously separated entities.</p>
<p>These explorations of online news’s liquidity together highlight its currently ever-changing, participatory, multimodal, mosaic and interconnected nature. Superficially, this conclusion seems to be obvious, as <italic>online news</italic> has long implied immediacy, interactivity, multimodality and hyperlinks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1748048512439823">Beyers, 2006</xref>). Online news can indeed encompass the components of liquidity, but for a long time realized few of them, and was for the most part simply traditional news published online.</p>
<p>However, as research has progressed and begun to find growing signs of immediacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1748048512439823">Karlsson and Strömbäck, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1748048512439823">Kutz and Herring, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1748048512439823">Salaverría, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1748048512439823">Tremayne et al., 2007</xref>), user participation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1748048512439823">Bivens, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1748048512439823">Bruns, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1748048512439823">Deuze et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1748048512439823">Domingo et al., 2008</xref>), multimodality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1748048512439823">Greer and Mensing, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1748048512439823">Tremayne et al., 2007</xref>) and hyperlinks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1748048512439823">Tremayne, 2006</xref>), it has sought to grasp and label this phenomenon, which has gone beyond and become qualitatively different from previous online news. Combined, these four (sub)characteristics form a fifth imperative meta-characteristic, liquidity, which is more than the sum of its parts but cannot be understood or measured without any of them.</p>
<p>Liquid news can therefore be defined as an erratic, continuous, participatory, multimodal and interconnected process that is producing content according to journalistic principles. This involves liquid news stories being published in different drafts, created in cooperation with users, told in multiple modalities, having hyperlinks to different sources, documents and organizations and essentially consisting of ever-changing and unruly processes that, in theory, never find a truly finite form. This is radically different from traditional modes of news production, in which the publishing rhythm has been pre-planned and is predictable, consumers have played a small, if any, part in news production, newspapers have been limited to tell stories in text and photos and news stories have had clearly defined beginnings and endings with a linear progression between them.</p>
<p>Studies that have addressed how contemporary online news differs from traditional news and how it has come to realize its potential, albeit slowly, have effectively been mapping the becoming of liquid news. This process has been far from inevitable and liquidity is currently far from being fully realized. It is therefore essential to design an appropriate methodological approach for any study that intends to ascertain how liquid the news actually is.</p>

<title>Measuring the liquidity of online news</title>
<p>This section begins with an overview of how the existing literature has studied liquid news and its sub-characteristics. It then proposes eight <italic>variables</italic>, linked to the four sub-characteristics, for measuring liquidity empirically, and concludes with a detailed description of a proposed methodology for actually capturing news websites’ content and a rationale for this study’s unit of analysis.</p>
<p>Existing studies have addressed different elements of liquid news separately under such labels as participatory journalism, convergence and high-speed journalism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1748048512439823">Domingo et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1748048512439823">Greer and Mensing, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1748048512439823">Salaverría, 2005</xref>). This has shed some light on journalism’s transition from solid to liquid form from various perspectives without examining liquid news as a whole.</p>
<p>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1748048512439823">Schudson (1996</xref>) argued that hard evidence, or even hypotheses, about how online technology affects the news is limited, indicating weakness in the literature then available. Although research has progressed since then, few studies have investigated the actual content of online news stories, concentrating instead on whether various features of liquidity are available at all on the news websites examined in studies of content analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1748048512439823">Beyers, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1748048512439823">Domingo et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1748048512439823">Hasan and Hashim, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1748048512439823">Hermida and Thurman, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1748048512439823">Zamith, 2008</xref>), and on attitudes towards them in studies based on interviews and surveys of journalists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1748048512439823">O’Sullivan and Heinonen, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1748048512439823">Quandt et al., 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Research has studied the realization of digital news’s potential for crossing a minimum threshold of liquidity and has suggested that there are possible effects on various journalistic processes. This, however, has provided a basis for assumptions with respect to impact rather than directly addressing the tangible impact on online news content.</p>
<p>Most studies that have tried to address the various aspects of liquid news have also been limited in scope by concentrating solely on issues involving its immediacy, tracking changes and updates in news (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1748048512439823">Karlsson and Strömbäck, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1748048512439823">Kausky and Widholm, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1748048512439823">Kutz and Herring, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1748048512439823">Tremayne et al., 2007</xref>). Other than such studies that have chiefly addressed immediacy, the main problem with the bulk of the literature is that it does not treat liquid news methodologically as a multi-component<italic> process</italic>. It has instead mostly measured the occurrence of different features of liquid news at single points in time without addressing how they affect online news content in real-time settings. The existing literature has recognized the immediacy of breaking-news banners but not that immediacy’s effect on content. It explains how online media can expand stories as they unfold with hyperlinks and various multimedia features but not whether they really do unfold. It describes the participatory features available to users without reporting whether these influence news stories.</p>
<p>Almost no empirical research, therefore, has investigated how the components of liquid news shape online news stories as they unfold. This means that investigating how all aspects of liquidity become continuously manifest in the content of online news requires a method designed specifically for this purpose.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1748048512439823">
<title>Proposing variables to examine news liquidity</title>
<p>The literature’s findings with respect to liquid news indicate that any methodological approach must incorporate the dimensions of user participation, immediacy, multimedia and hyperlinks. Furthermore, as liquid news is a process rather than a product, any content analysis of it must consist of multiple points of analysis over time.</p>
<p>Clearly, although liquid news’s different features are connected, dividing them into smaller, more researchable entities in order to make them measurable seems likely to be a useful approach. This section therefore addresses some suggestions for using theoretically grounded variables to achieve that measurability. Other variables are likely and should be included in full-scale studies, but since this is an exploratory study its variables are limited in number, although they do cover all of liquidity’s four sub-characteristics (immediacy, interactivity, multimodality and hyperlinks).</p>
<p>Addressing liquid news as a process makes it advisable to determine the number of different versions that a news website publishes of those news stories analysed, and this is the first variable this article addresses. News websites tend to produce online news in different, more-or-less complete drafts rather than as discrete pieces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1748048512439823">Deuze, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1748048512439823">Hall, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1748048512439823">Karlsson and Strömbäck, 2010</xref>). Discovering whether they have produced different versions of their news stories is a key issue in determining if any liquidity at all is present or if they have merely mimicked the traditional publishing rhythm. This variable therefore relates to the overall changing nature of online news by seeking to find if individual news stories change at all, and if so how many updates the sites produce. Of course, online news stories can be considered to have a new version every time a comment is posted or a reply to a poll is added – here the versions only refer to the journalistically produced content actually published.</p>
<p>Journalism has the objective of telling the truth more than other forms of communication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1748048512439823">Kovach and Rosenstiehl, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1748048512439823">Zelizer, 2004</xref>). Misleading or inaccurate news therefore creates serious problems with respect to journalistic trustworthiness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1748048512439823">Hayes et al., 2007</xref>). It is, furthermore, problematic whether the immediacy of online news affects the overall accuracy of news in general (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1748048512439823">Kopper et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1748048512439823">Kovach and Rosenstiehl, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1748048512439823">Scott, 2005</xref>), the chief arguments involving speed and accuracy being that they are frequently incompatible and that online news has the ability to rework or delete incorrect stories or facts swiftly and without notice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1748048512439823">Avilés et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1748048512439823">Colson and Heinderyckx, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1748048512439823">Deuze and Yeshua, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1748048512439823">Klinenberg, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1748048512439823">Quandt, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>It is therefore important to investigate whether online news stories have an accuracy problem related to immediacy, which is the second variable this article addresses. It is, however, difficult to determine information’s accuracy without first-hand experience. When news appears in drafts it increases the probability of changes in the way events are portrayed. Such changes do not necessarily mean that it was inaccurate or has become more accurate, however, but it is possible to measure whether key components in a news story have changed over time in such a way that one statement contradicts another, suggesting that at least one of the versions has a problem with accuracy.</p>
<p>This study therefore employs as key components the basic journalistic questions of what, who, how, when, where and why (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1748048512439823">Kovach and Rosenstiel, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1748048512439823">Singer, 2008a</xref>). If the answers to these questions change in the same news story over time so that the answer to one question contradicts another, it is reasonable to interpret this as the news story having an accuracy problem. A hypothetical example of this might be that one version of a news story reports that a car hit a little girl and a later version that the same car hit a policeman. If the car did indeed hit only one person at least one of the versions has an accuracy problem.</p>
<p>Another sub-characteristic of liquid news is interactivity, and more specifically user participation in news production. Online news websites encourage users to contribute with on-the-spot footage and eyewitness accounts of accidents, terror attacks and other graphic events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1748048512439823">Hermida and Thurman, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1748048512439823">Pantti and Bakker, 2009</xref>). This study’s third variable is therefore whether the encouragement of user collaboration is present on the sites, actively recruiting users to co-produce news stories.</p>
<p>News websites also invite users to participate by commenting on news in various ways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1748048512439823">Domingo et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1748048512439823">Hermida and Thurman, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1748048512439823">Örnebring, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1748048512439823">Pantti and Bakker, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1748048512439823">Singer and Ashman, 2009</xref>). Rather than actively inviting users to participate in the gathering and editing steps of news production, this involves their expressing opinions about news stories on the site after they have been published. Considering the digital media’s reprogrammable nature and concerns about the quality of user input with respect to legal issues, it seems appropriate to investigate whether online news media remove such user contributions as well as add them to their sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1748048512439823">Bolter, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1748048512439823">Manovich, 2001</xref>). This study therefore also measures the variable of what forms of user communication news websites add, remove, or both to discover information about users’ commenting role during different phases in the unfolding of news stories. However, neither of these two variables measures whether user participation has any impact on the actual content of news stories; which suggests also measuring a variable with respect to whether the sites publish user collaborations or communications in the news or as news.</p>
<p>As news in an online environment should be considered to be composed of drafts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1748048512439823">Deuze, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1748048512439823">Hall, 2001</xref>), it is reasonable to expect that the first version of most news stories will consist of just one or two sentences. Such early drafts are then likely to be extended over time in text and modality and to come to include hyperlinks. Images, video, audio and other modes of multimedia storytelling may also be added or subtracted, consequently changing the items’ appearance. This study therefore measures liquid news’s multimodal sub-characteristic through the variables of pictures added, removed, or both and multimedia modes added, removed, or both to assess this process.</p>
<p>Also with respect to the draft nature of online news, news websites can include hyperlinks, remove them, or both to connect or disconnect their stories to or from other news stories on their sites, external sources, or original documents, constantly altering the narrative as the settings in which their news stories are presented and understood continuously change. This study’s eighth and final variable measures the extent to which news websites include hyperlinks, remove them, or both. Taken together, these eight variables represent the four sub-characteristics that form liquid news, and more importantly have been designed to address online news as a process rather than as a static product.</p>

<title>Background and methodology</title>
<p>As noted earlier, this study’s three objectives are to help clarify the nature of liquid news by focusing on the manifest content of online news as it appears to the reader, to propose a method for measuring the dimensions of online news’ liquidity and to explore this method empirically. The preceding sections have addressed the first two of these objectives. It now remains for this study to explore the proposed method empirically. While the news industry is changing all over the world and liquid news is an international issue it has been and will be studied in specific time/space settings where its implementation may vary. Here Sweden provides an appropriate venue for exploring and testing if the method is viable. Sweden, along with other Scandinavian countries that were early adopters of the internet, has a high level of internet penetration and consequently a potentially large domestic market for online news (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1748048512439823">Deuze et al., 2007</xref>). Furthermore, both its online producers and consumers have considerable technological experience, which suggests that the liquidity of its online news may have a more significant impact than in most other countries, which makes it an interesting case. Thus, the Swedish case seems to provide the methodology with a good stress test.</p>
<p>The Swedish news websites Aftonbladet.se, Dn.se (<italic>Dagens</italic> <italic>Nyheter</italic>), Expressen.se and SvD.se (<italic>Svenska</italic> <italic>Dagbladet</italic>) will be used as test bed. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1748048512439823">Table 1</xref> presents an overview of these sites, which were the first Swedish news providers to develop internet journalism. They have the leading national newspapers as their parent organizations and reach a large proportion of the Swedish population.</p>

<p>Traditional news content has had a beginning and an end and has been limited in time and space. Undertaking a content analysis of online news is difficult, as digital media’s elusive nature contradicts the concept of content itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1748048512439823">Deuze, 2008a</xref>). No consistent or universally accepted methodologies for studying liquid news exist, as it is a slippery subject that poses enormous challenges for scholars studying the content of online news (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1748048512439823">Deuze, 2008a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1748048512439823">Karlsson and Strömbäck, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1748048512439823">Kopper et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1748048512439823">McMillan, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1748048512439823">Shoemaker and Vos, 2009</xref>). Although these difficulties are well known, no solutions have yet appeared (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1748048512439823">Riffe et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1748048512439823">Stevens, 2004</xref>). The principal problem is that liquid news changes erratically and therefore poses a challenge to traditional content analysis, which treats content as definite. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1748048512439823">Shoemaker and Vos (2009</xref>: 132) described the core issue by noting that:<disp-quote>
<p>We need better ways of studying change, which is the most interesting and challenging aspect of online media – they instantly change as the news environment changes. But studying such change over time is complicated; continuous variables change continuously across time.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>In order to address these issues, studies employing content analysis have utilized and advocated the grounded theory approach and case studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1748048512439823">Kopper et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1748048512439823">Kutz and Herring, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1748048512439823">Matheson, 2004</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1748048512439823">Karlsson and Strömbäck (2010</xref>) investigated several possible approaches for investigating the liquidity of online news and proposed monitoring a limited number of news stories in order to follow the development of an online news story and the interplay between producers and users.</p>
<p>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1748048512439823">Shoemaker and Vos (2009</xref>) contended that the most important entity to study is the news item, as it is the standard unit of production and a vital part of any study addressing gate-keeping processes. Although significant change is occurring in their distribution, who produces them and where one news story ends and another begins, it can still be argued that individual news stories are relevant starting points as units of analysis, as they are phenomena that news websites have actually published (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1748048512439823">Shoemaker and Vos, 2009</xref>). News stories, therefore, are the smallest distinctive units on news websites that are subject to editorial decisions. This exploratory study of news liquidity therefore focuses on a selection of 15 online news stories that were closely tracked and collected from the four news sites between October and December 2008.</p>
<p>Since liquid news is an ongoing process, it is indeed important to monitor its progress closely. I manually monitored selected news stories that three or four of the news sites simultaneously published every 10 minutes and downloaded them using WinHTTrack software, screen grabs, or both every time the news stories changed. I monitored each news item continuously until it had not been updated for three hours, and revisited them at 17.00 and 23.00 on the same day and at 09.00 the following day to find if the sites had made any additional changes to them.</p>
<p>I chose the top stories on the front page as the unit of analysis, as the front page is the window where news organizations place their most important stories and is also the most likely place for successfully monitoring ongoing updates of news stories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1748048512439823">Bucy, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1748048512439823">Tremayne et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1748048512439823">Van der Wurff, 2005</xref>). This procedure created a database of different versions of the same news stories, which could then be inspected using the eight variables outlined above.</p>
<p>Because news on the internet has no natural beginning or end, this study delimited news stories as entities graphically separated from other entities on the front page, or a news website’s first layer, following the approach of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1748048512439823">McMillan et al. (2008</xref>). I analysed the content, the second layer, of each lead article’s hyperlink on the basis of all variables, including the accuracy problems variable, and analysed all the other entries in each news item on the basis of the other seven variables.</p>

<p>
<italic>Note:</italic> Each column shows whether each of the 15 news items showed signs of each of the liquidity variables on each of the sites.</p>

</table-wrap-foot>
</table-wrap>
<p>
<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1748048512439823">Table 2</xref>’s first variable, the number of versions of the news stories, clearly shows that it was common for these sites to present more than one version of the news story, which indicates at least some liquidity. The table then shows that the variable of accuracy problems appeared frequently in all four sites. None of the sites, however, ever informed their users that fundamental changes had occurred in how they told a news story.</p>
<p>The variable of user collaboration being encouraged was a common feature in the study. For instance, three of the sites encouraged people to send in pictures, movies, or information for the story about the storming of an airplane in Cologne. With respect to the variable of whether the sites add and remove user communications, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1748048512439823">Table 2</xref> confirms previous studies’ findings that users do participate in online news (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1748048512439823">Bivens, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1748048512439823">Deuze et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1748048512439823">Domingo et al., 2008</xref>), but also shows that user participation is not necessarily present when news stories first surface. This indicates that journalists initiate news stories and the sites invite users to contribute later.</p>
<p>Still, various forms of user participation take place over time, and the sites let their users influence some of the context in which they present news stories by way of polls, chats, comments, or blog links, which involve posting links to their blogs next to news stories. This study found that sites removed opportunities for user communication in two cases; Aftonbladet.se removed the possibility for users to publish comments and links to their blogs with respect to the story about the storming of an airplane in Cologne and DN.se removed the possibility to post blog links next to the Rödeby trial story. Neither site mentioned that they had done this or explained why, which leaves their reasons for doing so unclear. These examples do show that they are not hesitant to remove opportunities for user participation that they judge to be inappropriate. This leads to the conclusion that user participation can be present in the middle but not at the beginning or the end of the life cycle of online news stories.</p>
<p>The table then shows that this study found two cases in which the variable of whether the sites publish user collaborations, communications, or both in the news, as news, or both occurred. Expressen.se published a photo taken by a user at the crime scene involved in the female homicide story (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1748048512439823">Figure 2</xref>) and Aftonbladet.se let a reader comment by a headline on the front page for the story about Sandvik giving layoff notices to 1500 workers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1748048512439823">Figure 3</xref>). This indicates that some sites embed different forms of user participation into news stories and incorporate them into the frameworks in which they present the news.</p>
<p>What these three participatory variables together indicate is that various forms of user participation played important roles, although those roles varied considerably over time and with different news stories. Sometimes no user participation appeared and at other times it was absent from early versions but became part of the news production process in later ones. The sites occasionally actively sought user collaboration in producing actual news content, but more commonly limited users to making remarks about news stories.</p>
<p>This study found one instance of the variable of whether the sites added or removed pictures. In its coverage of the Rödeby trial, DN.se first added a photograph of a reconstruction of the murder scene to its news item, and then removed it in a later version. With respect to the variable of whether the sites added or removed such multimedia applications as web-TV, audio, interactive maps and graphics to or from news stories this study found no instances of any of them removing such features, but they all added them. Finally, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1748048512439823">Table 2</xref> shows that over time the sites frequently exhibited the variable of including hyperlinks from their news stories to other pieces of information the sites’ producers deemed relevant. This study found no removal of hyperlinks, however.</p>

<sec id="section7-1748048512439823">
<title>Three illustrations of the liquidity of news</title>
<p>This section presents examples illuminating how the different characteristics of liquidity working in conjunction appeared on the websites. The first example, from Expressen.se, concerns the story about explosions in Malaga, Spain (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1748048512439823">Figure 1</xref>). It first reported that two ‘explosions’ had occurred in Malaga and that no additional information was available. This news item was, however, posted next to one about commandos storming an airplane at Cologne airport to prevent a terrorist attack, thereby associating these reported explosions with a terrorist attack. Thirty minutes later the story had transformed the explosions into ‘bangs’, supposedly caused by an airplane breaking the sound barrier. The second version emphasized the absence of signs of a terrorist attack. The site dropped this item from the front page an hour later.</p>

</fig>
<p>The example in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1748048512439823">Figure 1</xref> illustrates the variable involving accuracy problems because the ‘what’ and ‘why’ differ substantially between versions, which move from describing explosions possibly from a terrorist attack to bangs possibly caused by a supersonic aircraft. This example shows how news websites tweak news stories in real time, thereby relating to liquid news’s immediacy dimension. It should be noted further that the site’s producers did nothing to call attention to this tweaking.</p>
<p>The next example involves the female homicide story on 2 October 2008. It also comes from Expressen.se (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1748048512439823">Figure 2</xref>).</p>
<p>
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1748048512439823">Figure 2</xref> illustrates the variables involving the encouragement of user collaboration and the publishing of user collaboration in the news. This news item grew quickly, and only 20 minutes after its initial publication at 10.40 on 2 October 2008 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1748048512439823">Figure 2</xref>, top image), Expressen.se had both issued a call for reader information and received a photograph from the murder scene that a user had taken (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1748048512439823">Figure 2</xref>, bottom image). Such calls for information are relatively common in the study, although they do not always or even frequently yield information that receives publication. This example demonstrates both the immediacy aspect of liquid news, as the site continuously updated it as more information became available, and its participatory dimension by enlisting what was traditionally a passive audience to contribute to the ongoing reportage.</p>
<p>This study’s final example illustrates Aftonbladet.se’s coverage of the Swedish corporation Sandvik’s announcement that it intended to lay off more than 1000 employees worldwide, but mostly in Sweden’s Sandviken municipality (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1748048512439823">Figure 3</xref>).</p>
<p>This news item first appeared at 09.10 on 20 November 2008 with a headline, a short statement about the Sandvik corporation announcing that it would lay off many employees and a call for affected readers to get in contact with Aftonbladet.se about their experiences (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1748048512439823">Figure 3</xref>, top screenshot). The story grew in size as it developed, and one hour after the item initially appeared it had expanded to include three hyperlinks to related material, a picture, a poll and the yellow balloon indicating that user comments have been added. Furthermore, although its initial framework had been that Sandvik had announced that it would lay off more than 1000 people worldwide, after one hour the site had slightly reframed it to focus on the 900 layoffs in the small Swedish municipality of Sandviken (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1748048512439823">Figure 3</xref>, middle screenshot). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1748048512439823">Figure 3</xref>’s bottom screenshot is of the item’s seventh and final version at 23.00. By then the site had added four additional hyperlinks, several new pictures and a web-TV section. It had also removed the first picture and inserted it in the original lead article in the second layer. It had also elevated a user comment predicting disaster into a headline and encouraged and directed users to engage in a discussion about the event. Many of the entries have yellow balloons indicating that user comments have been posted. What started as a headline with a few sentences and a call for user contributions evolved during the day to become an item with another angle, multiple entries, pictures, video and various forms of user contributions, all of which stress the liquidity of the news on this site. In total this news item provides examples of all eight variables but the accuracy problem variable.</p>
<p>Taken together, these three examples, containing all eight variables, highlight how liquid news appears to users as it is continuously published. More importantly, they demonstrate that online news is a work-in-progress and changes significantly during a short time span as well as seeking and incorporating user contributions.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>This study has found that the variables indicating liquid news are, with a few reservations, regularly present on all four of the websites studied. All the news events that constituted this explorative study’s cases showed evidence of liquidity on at least one of the sites and most cases showed several signs of liquidity on more than one of them. For instance, on Aftonbladet.se the case involving Sandvik giving layoff notices to 1500 employees involved all four of the liquidity components of immediacy, user participation, multimodality and hyperlinks. Most importantly, this was also an ongoing process in which the news item became more liquid over time.</p>
<p>Liquid news starts with a few words and can, although not necessarily, later be complemented with pictures, videos, or hyperlinks to other internal or external stories. It can increase in volume or adjust previous statements without leaving a trace. It facilitates various aspects of user participation that can affect news stories’ contexts and contents. Users and content analysts consequently find themselves exposed to different versions of news stories that can differ substantially in terms of their quality, the information available, the modalities used and opportunities for user contributions without the sites upon which these appear informing anyone that these changes have occurred. The variables this study has examined clearly indicate that online news stories should indeed be considered to be liquid, dynamic, or fluid not only in theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1748048512439823">Deuze, 2006, 2008a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1748048512439823">Lowrey, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1748048512439823">Matheson, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1748048512439823">Pavlik, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1748048512439823">Singer, 2008b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1748048512439823">Treymayne et al., 2007</xref>), but also notably in practice, at least in the Swedish context.</p>
<p>This study has also emphasized that liquid news must be studied on its own evasive terms rather than on those of print-biased journalistic research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1748048512439823">Deuze, 2008b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1748048512439823">Mitchelstein and Boczkowski, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1748048512439823">Shoemaker and Vos, 2009</xref>). However, it is painfully clear, as previous studies have found (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1748048512439823">Deuze, 2008a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1748048512439823">Karlsson and Strömbäck, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1748048512439823">McMillan, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1748048512439823">Shoemaker and Vos, 2009</xref>), that this is a demanding task, as any study involving content analysis of online news has to deal with its continuous, capricious, participatory, multimodal and interconnected processes, which pose a challenge to the essence of the word <italic>published</italic>.</p>
<p>As the evolution of liquid news continues, and possibly picks up pace, researchers around the world are increasingly challenged to find a workable solution to a methodological problem that they simply <italic>have</italic> to take up. This study provides an initial but, it is to be hoped, important step in the direction of addressing liquid news on its own terms. In general the study has suggested and explored a methodology for investigating some of the aspects of liquid news, and it has offered specific tools. It provides, for instance, a methodological instrument to study under what circumstances user contributions are deleted. In theory liquid news stories are never finished and could be tweaked forever. However, it is unlikely that this is the case in practice. The method provides a technique for tracking the life cycle of news stories – how long they are under construction. Also, it would be possible to see if the life cycle is marked by different phases of production concerning journalistically wrought content, user involvement, hyperlinking and more. Furthermore, it makes possible to study both accuracy in the news and to what extent corrective policies are exercised.</p>
<p>Much work remains, however, as this study used but a few variables to measure the phenomenon. Further studies need to examine other variables such as alterations in the use of sources, changing authorship, the extent to which news websites make their continuous news processes transparent as news stories change, convergence with other information outlets, such as YouTube videos ending up as news on news websites, and the framing and reframing of news stories. Additionally, as this study only includes breaking news, it would be useful to see if these patterns translate to other news genres and kinds of journalism. Moreover, this study utilizes a rather limited number of points of monitoring and a minimum 10 minutes interval between them. Further studies, especially if they seek to study the full life cycle, might want to consider both shorter intervals between downloads, and longer monitoring periods. Another immense challenge is to produce a method for quantifying online news’s liquidity in order to make it empirically investigable beyond the scope of pilot studies and case studies. Should such a method be developed, it would provide valuable opportunities to measure how news organizations from different traditions employ liquid news.</p>
<p>This study’s results indicate clearly that the liquidity of online news is researchable and that it materializes on news websites in a rich variety of ways. As this has been an exploratory study in a Swedish setting seeking to develop a method, it has provided virtually no possibility for generalization. The variables it has analysed, furthermore, do not concern the news stories themselves or different news genres, but such variables can be easily adapted to the research questions posed. Despite these limitations, this study’s findings are sufficiently interesting to encourage further research on the topic, including comparative studies, to augment the understanding of how the impact of the liquidity of online news varies in different cultural settings. What this study does provide is a methodological tool that helps to pursue that research.</p>
<p>Research addressing the production and presentation of news in an online environment needs to progress beyond simply stating that it provides opportunities for user participation, sightings of breaking news banners, extensive hyperlinking, or the use of web-TV on news websites. These observations are indeed relevant, but they carry the underlying assumption that they have consequences for news content, journalists and news consumers alike, and are consequently building blocks for a new and different kind of liquid journalism.</p>
<p>Journalism research needs to shift its analytical focus from potentialities to what actually affects the news as a whole. This study’s findings reveal both liquid news’s normative implications for journalism and methodological issues with respect to analysing it. Researchers, society and journalists have been accustomed to mass media that publish news characterized by pre-planned windows of distribution, clearly separated content entities, a journalist-centred mode of production and predictable modalities. Although this study’s objectives did not include analysing the consequences of liquidity on such factors as trustworthiness and journalistic roles and norms, it seems reasonable to suggest that the liquidity of news is indeed likely to have repercussions on such phenomena as the organization of journalistic work, the journalistic profession and the editorial integrity of newsrooms. This transition seems overwhelmingly likely to be challenging for researchers, journalists and society at large.</p>
