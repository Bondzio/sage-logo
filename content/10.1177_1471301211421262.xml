<abstract>
<p>This paper looks at the ambiguous journey travelled by family, mainly spouse, carers in Scotland is based on 37 interviews which formed part of a larger study exploring the subjective experience of 20 individuals with dementia. The majority of the interviews were conducted with the carer alone, others with the relative with dementia (RWD) present and some as joint interviews. The carers are found to be recognizing many manifestations of loss in the loved one and, simultaneously in their carer role, striving to maintain continuity of that person through compensatory actions and the provision of a supportive care environment. These experiences are located along a trajectory of continuity and loss. This article provides further insight into the caregiving relationship in dementia and the complexities of maintaining that relationship in the shifting ground of a progressive illness.</p>

<sec id="sec1-1471301211421262" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Providing care for a relative with dementia is a well-documented activity. Much has been written about the physical, psychological, emotional and practical costs, balanced to some extent by what is known about the rewards of providing such care. A recent UK report on the prevalence, economic cost and research funding of dementia confirmed that informal carers annually provide 1.5 billion hours of unpaid care, valued at £12 billion. This represents approximately half the estimated ‘economic burden’ of providing care to the UK's over 800,000 citizens with dementia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1471301211421262">Alzheimer's Research Trust, 2010</xref>). Policy initiatives over the last decade reflect the centrality of informal care in contemporary care delivery with a range of approaches designed to shore up this largely informal care provision, which nonetheless maintains much of what is loosely termed community care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1471301211421262">Fear &amp; Boddy, 2009</xref>). Looking after a close relative with dementia has been described as an ‘unremitting task’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1471301211421262">Schulz, Williamson, Morycz, &amp; Biegel, 1992</xref>). Furthermore it has become a politicized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1471301211421262">Bond, 1992</xref>) and ambiguous task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1471301211421262">Gillies, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1471301211421262">Manthorpe, 1999</xref>), rotating on an axis of care provider/recipient role-transference and, at times, confusion. Increasingly the carer's situation is thought to be a unique ‘configuration’ of contextual influences which require a complex and individualized response from supporting services (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1471301211421262">Nolan, Lundh, Grant, &amp; Keady, 2003</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1471301211421262">Hellstrom, Nolan, and Lund (2007)</xref>, in relation to spouse carer dyads, identify a ‘nurturative relational context’ where the considerable contribution of both partners to maintaining the relationship and coping with the condition of dementia is explored.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-1471301211421262" sec-type="methods"><title>Method</title>
<p>The current study examines the experiences of 20 carers of relatives with dementia and forms part of a wider study exploring the subjective experience of dementia. Face-to-face interviews were conducted with identified family carers of 20 individuals who had received a clinical diagnosis of dementia. The carers comprised 15 spouses (5 husbands, 10 wives), 4 daughters and 1 son all but two of whom were co-resident with their relative. A number of these carers each provided a series of interviews. On occasion the relative with dementia was present during the carer interview(s) and was the main focus of the interview with the carer providing reassurance and back-up; in addition, a number of the interviews were jointly conducted with the carer and their relative. In total, 37 of the 53 interviews in the larger study yielded data related to the carer's experience. Participants were recruited to the study through service providers and, as a service-derived cohort, necessarily omitted participants not known toservices perhaps by being more mildly affected or where carers had not yet sought professional support.</p>
<p>The study employed sound recording (where possible), transcribing and analysis using a line-by-line coding scheme derivative of a grounded theory tradition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1471301211421262">Charmaz, 2000</xref>), looking for meanings which may be built on ‘processes, actions, assumptions and consequences’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1471301211421262">Ryan&amp; Bernard, 2000</xref>, p. 769). The codes generated in the first instance were thematic codes in response to the ideas expressed by the participants and dictated to some extent by the interview schedule, where pre-determined themes were to be explored, such as the impact of memory decline. Patterns of codes were then formed into groupings, or clusters which <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1471301211421262">Miles and Huberman (1994)</xref> describe as ‘explanatory or inferential codes, ones that identify an emergent theme, configuration or explanation [and which] pull together a lot of material into more meaningful and parsimonious units of analysis’ (p. 69). While the methodology for analysing the carers’ data was identical to that of their relatives, the carer interviews did not demand the same level of line-by-line scrutiny as those generated by their relatives with dementia. Rather, their accounts were generally more coherent, with longer sections ofdialogue and in many respects it proved easier to attach meaning to their accounts. The emergent themes were plotted along a trajectory which represents the range of experiences described in their interviews.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec3-1471301211421262"><title>Nature and extent of the caregiving role</title>
<p>For these carers, taking on a caring role was not a conscious decision but, as would be expected, and particularly with a spouse carer, was a continuation of a long-term, established relationship, one where the level of dependency had grown but also shifted progressively. The transition from spouse or child to carer can be subtle and is usually neither planned nor adequately anticipated, if indeed the shift is acknowledged at all. For the majority of these carers their task of caring was a substantial commitment, typically reflected in co-residency and being undertaken at an age when their own health and social needs were increasing. Where this was not the case, the dependent relative required routine visits several times a day as well as unscheduled support at unpredictable times. In the two cases where carers had become co-resident after a period of caring for their parent in their own home, both carers reported that they had substantially underestimated the extent of their parent's difficulties.</p>
<p>The level of dependency was such that all of the carers believed they were unable to leave their relative alone for any length of time and only one carer felt confident about leaving her husband<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1471301211421262">1</xref></sup> for more than a few hours, which allowed her to pursue a hobby. For some carers, the apparent increasing lethargy of their relative and subsequent lack of activity was advantageous by ensuring they were unlikely to move when left for short spells, although the carer's presence within the household seemed to be a pre-requisite for this state of contentment. For a number of the carer dyads popular social activities such as eating out, entertaining friends and visiting were no longer considered possible because of the dependant's perceived inappropriate behaviour, which, particularly when eating, had become embarrassing to their carer as in this husband's account.
<disp-quote>
<p>‘God, you can’t take her no place now. Even when she takes her meal, I’ve got to watch her. She slitters all over the place and then I put a dish towel round her.’</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Some of the individuals with dementia had limited their own activities because of a growing dislike of crowds and an inability to converse spontaneously resulting in limited opportunities for them and/or their carer to socialise. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1471301211421262">Brittain, Corner, Robinson, and Bond (2010)</xref> have usefully examined the multiple disadvantages faced by individuals with dementia in relation to social, physical and environmental constraints and identify the need for further research into how individuals might regain independence.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-1471301211421262"><title>Communication</title>
<p>Underlying the carer–relative relationship is the issue of communication which is increasingly challenged through the course of the disease. This is not related simply to language difficulty asdemonstrated by forgetfulness and word-finding problems, or difficulties arising from impaired memory which might lead to confusion. Communication can break down when existing relationship boundaries and characteristics become changed, for example when customary behaviour is replaced by something else, perhaps more bizarre, which renders the carer confused and afraid through misunderstanding. It is necessary to acknowledge the impression such an impact makes during day-to-day contact between the carer and the person being cared for. In this study difficulties with communication were reported by nearly all of the carers and affected the quantity and quality of day-to-day conversation including:
<list id="list1-1471301211421262" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>increasing withdrawal such as seemingly having less to say or a reluctance to instigate conversation;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>repetition of questions leading to repeated reminders by carer;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>inability to find answers leading to repeated ‘testing’ by carer;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>getting things wrong leading to repeated correction by carer;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>inability to remember names of family and seen as insensitive and perplexing;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>interpreting behaviour change as indicative of personality change;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>behaviour that seemed to imply increasing lethargy such as diminished interest in personal care and in reading and watching TV;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>selfish behaviour based on apparent lack of interest in the welfare of others;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>illogical behaviour and conversation, perplexing to carer;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>disturbed behaviour and language, distressing to carer.</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>Whilst some of this interpretation could be due to a lack of knowledge and understanding about the extent of the relative's control over their dementia, the stresses in communication also suggest an inability within the carers to ‘give up’ and, in contrast, to seek to control for themselves where the relative has lost this ability, for example in repeatedly trying to correct when a ‘wrong’ answer is offered.</p>
<p>Day-to-day interaction reinforces the processes of identity-building throughout the life cycle, and where a person's social circle is all but limited to interaction with one carer, as in this study, the carer dyad will, to all intents and purposes, provide the principal if not sole source for social interaction, the social environment of the person with dementia. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1471301211421262">Schwartz (1999)</xref> argues that ‘the size of your world affects your identity as much as what you do in it’ (p.167) and if one accepts the concept of a <italic>shrinking</italic> world in dementia where life's opportunities become more limited, the importance of interaction in providing the <italic>context of care</italic> is crucial. The pattern of communication underpinned the relationship dynamics at work and provided the lens for examining the carer's journey through their relative's dementia.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-1471301211421262"><title>Continuity and loss: understanding their relative's dementia</title>
<p>The carers in this study sought reasons for the <italic>event</italic> of dementia which had so affected their lives in a variety of sources, which we examine in the following.</p>
<sec id="sec6-1471301211421262"><title>Trauma</title>
<p>These typically related to specific incidents or circumstances, which provided a reason and rendered the chaos rational by drawing on the known and familiar. It was helpful therefore to relate the onset of dementia to a clearly identifiable and comprehensible traumatic or unsettling event such as giving up work, an emergency operation, a move of house, a bad fall, a heart attack or the death of a child. For all of the carers who proffered such an explanation, however, as many still floundered in a sea of doubt and uncertainty, searching for an acceptable explanation, as articulated by this wife's account:
<disp-quote>
<p>‘I have often tried to remember back. I can remember when we used to have these friends, he stopped taking part in the conversation, that was the first indication, that the rest of us would be talking and he wouldn’t contribute. The only thing he would say was could he have another drink, that was his only contribution to the conversation. Gradually from then he became very withdrawn, and he stopped reading the papers. He stopped listening to the radio programme which we always used to listen to, and he stopped talking to me. So, just complete … he just had nothing to say. And he stopped taking interest in any speaking programme on the TV. He couldn’t grasp them but he still liked the sport and the nature programmes. I couldn’t actually specify the date or pinpoint a date.’</p>
</disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec7-1471301211421262"><title>Normal ageing versus pathology</title>
<p>Growing old was not routinely offered by these carers as a rationale, except in the early stages where symptoms had been misinterpreted as the ageing process. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1471301211421262">Murray and Boyd (2009)</xref> found in their US study that where this was the case, it obviously delayed diagnosis and concomitant access to support services. Significantly more common in these accounts, however, was a rooting of the problem in pathology, seeking a <italic>medical</italic> explanation which many of the carers felt able to provide, such as
<disp-quote>
<p>‘She’s got that. she had a scan about three years ago or something and she’s got that Alzheimer’s’</p>
</disp-quote>
and
<disp-quote>
<p>‘And Dr L checked him out and said, no, he doesn’t have the disease, it’s just hardening of the arteries. That’s what’s wrong with him. But the Day Hospital’s done wonders for him because he had an infection in the groin. He had a bad hernia. They fixed that. There was something wrong with his legs, they fixed that and oh, he’s fine.’</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This daughter provides a complicated if not untypical account of her mother's first difficulties with memory:
<disp-quote>
<p>‘It really turned out in hospital was when it all started. When she went into hospital. So whether this back pain was something that she thought, … was worried about … Yeah it was something with her brain. Some of the cells, to do with the cells.’</p>
</disp-quote>
With the benefit of objectivity it is tempting to label the vagueness of these accounts as misattribution based on lack of understanding. This, of course, is a dangerous and unjustifiable stance, assuming as it does that adequate information was made available in the first place, and in a form which was both understandable and emotionally acceptable. Second, it pre-supposes the ability in carers, wracked with doubt and fear about what they were witnessing to <italic>hear</italic> the information they were given, usually in the absence of any supportive follow-up. Where carers were able to assimilate important causal information, itprovided some degree of much needed explanation, if devoid of reassurance and hope. The following wife's account is a useful illustration of this. She had used her husband's twocollapses at work and subsequent follow-up heart investigation as an opportunity to raise with the attendant doctors her recurring, niggling doubts about her husband's memory:
<disp-quote>
<p>‘We had a wee chat and I don’t know what made me ask but I mentioned about his memory problem because even at that time we would be coming and if he asked me once, he asked he half a dozen times on the way what we were having for our dinner. And just wee things like that, a lot of wee things like that. And so I asked the doctor if there was any possibility if he was in the early stages of Alzheimer’s. It was only articles that I had read and I. … there had been one or two things on the television and I felt well, I don’t know … ’</p>
</disp-quote>
This early tentative attempt at finding some explanation had led nowhere. Months later, once her husband had been attending the memory clinic for some time she was advised of and had accepted, with some relief and resignation, the <italic>medical</italic> explanation of her husband's forgetfulness, increasing lethargy and withdrawal:
<disp-quote>
<p>‘When we went to the memory clinic he was coming out of what they described as an undetected depressive illness and he was terribly depressed so that, coupled with his memory gradually failing, he wasn’t himself, I mean he wasn’t the man that I knew and to me Alzheimer’s is not one big thing, it’s a lot of little things in day to day living. You know I have to remind him to have a bath, and to change.’</p>
</disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec8-1471301211421262"><title>Comparing</title>
<p>Another form of searching for an explanation came through finding similarity of experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1471301211421262">Wills, 1981</xref>) through comparing with others. Equally important, and more common in the present study was comparing favourably over others, the concept of downward comparison whose function is thought to be to enhance one's own feelings of well-being (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1471301211421262">Wills, 1981</xref>). This daughter's account of her mother's retained abilities and dignity is typical:
<disp-quote>
<p>‘She looks great. And there she is, she’s got up from her bed and she’s put on her skirt and she’s put on her cardigan and found her specs and come through. I mean she doesn’t need that kind of help. I know there’s a lot of other ones and they need help all the time. And she can go to the toilet when she needs.’</p>
</disp-quote>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1471301211421262">Askham (1995)</xref> examined the range of reasons behind informal carers' understanding of their relative's dementia and identified nine categories of explanation, including similar examples to those presented above, such as equating it with something familiar and finding a medical understanding. She then projected these explanations around a normal/abnormal axis, forexample illness versus health, blessing versus a tragedy. Askham offers, among the justifications for these explanations, first one which reflects and reinforces the carer's relationship with their relative. For instance in this study, a clear carer/dependent dyad can be identified, particularly where a parent is being looked after. Second, Askham identifies an explanation which fits with how the person with dementia chooses to present him/herself, which would relate in this study, for example, to where co-dependency minimizes the impact of the dementia.</p>

<sec id="sec9-1471301211421262"><title>Continuity and loss: managing the experience</title>
<sec id="sec10-1471301211421262"><title>Normalizing through minimizing</title>
<p>A clear pattern emerged in the data where carers sought to play down or minimize the extent of their relative's difficulties in what appears to be an attempt to find continuity, or deny erosion of the previous ‘self ’. This wife's account demonstrates that in the face of rapidly diminishing abilities, her husband continued in his role of partner and companion, somewhat discounting his already significant difficulties with his memory:
<disp-quote>
<p>‘No, don’t get me wrong. I mean we still enjoy each other’s company. We can still talk to each other. I mean sometimes he forgets what I tell him and, I mean, as far as the shopping and any of the wee things that he used to do, I mean they are unimportant really and I feel, you know, if they got a drug that kept him like this, I reckon I could cope.’</p>
</disp-quote>
Other carers shielded their relative's behaviour from the critical gaze of others, particularly extended family members, or played down the extent of difficulties thus:
<disp-quote>
<p>‘But he’s not too bad you know. Just sometimes he’s terrible in the morning and at night. and sitting, he doesn’t like the television much unless, you know, he can’t follow it, sometimes he can’t follow it.’</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1471301211421262">Carpentier, Ducharme, Kergoat, and Bergman (2008)</xref> describe how their respondents did not seek help in the early stages of their caregiving role either through not feeling the need or through feeling capable of dealing with the situations they were presented with. However, they also argue that the reasons may be more complex ‘in which are interwoven objective barriers, personal choices, group positioning, and justifications associated with the social role of subjective factors' (p. 335).</p>
<p>Common to all of the carer accounts were frequent examples of how activities with or for their relative were reduced to as simple a state as possible, minimizing the risk of failure and resulting mutual distress.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec11-1471301211421262"><title>Compensating</title>
<p>Caring for a relative with dementia appears to elicit a response from carers to try to compensate for their relative's growing cognitive impairment. By so doing they attempt to preserve their relative's identity, to facilitate their continuation as the <italic>same person</italic>, for as long as possible and often in the face of increasing signs to the contrary, ‘when the person with Alzheimer's symptoms had gone beyond the negotiated boundaries of identity attributes’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1471301211421262">Orona, 1990</xref>, p. 1252). They seek to hang on to what is ‘knowable’, that is, recognisable and familiar. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1471301211421262">Fontana and Smith (1989)</xref> offer a number of explanations about why this might be so, including devotion and loyalty, convenience, or merely an attempt to avoid embarrassment. They describe how carers ‘fill the gaps' in order to keep up appearances while the self of the affected individual gradually unravels. This phenomenon has also been explored by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1471301211421262">Orona (1990)</xref> where she identified carers ‘working both sides of the relationship’ (p. 1255) once reciprocity had been lost, and in the much earlier study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1471301211421262">Edgerton (1967)</xref> where his participants (albeit who had a learning disability and not dementia), were aided in a similar way by <italic>benefactors</italic> compensating for the gaps in their abilities.</p>
<p>Where carers were present in joint interviews with their relative, or who were present but did not participate simultaneously, there were many examples of the carer compensating for their relative's inability to answer the question competently. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1471301211421262">Crisp (1999)</xref> would argue that this compensatory behaviour is indicative of a dynamic two-way partnership whereby the carers seek to recognize and value the contribution of their relative and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1471301211421262">Morris (2004)</xref> suggests this is a carer's protective shield against increasing awareness of communication skills being lost. During these joint interviews, however, the carers would typically ask their relative to think harder, or try again to reach an ‘accurate’ answer (e.g. <italic>‘Come on now, use your mind’</italic> - wife). The following extract from an interview with a respondent with dementia and her daughter illustrates the intervention as well as the respondent's reliance on her daughter as a memory prompt, and a source of reassurance, as she compensates for her mother's lack of recall:
<disp-quote>
<p><bold>Interviewer</bold>: ‘So, is there anything in your day to day situation that makes you particularly unhappy?’</p>
<p><bold>RWD</bold>: ‘I don’t think so. Do you think so, J?’</p>
<p><bold>Daughter</bold>: ‘Well sometimes you worry about your back being sore, you know you mention it quite a lot’</p>
<p><bold>RWD</bold>: ‘Aye … Aye’</p>
<p><bold>Daughter</bold>: ‘But I don’t think you are really, particularly … . What about when you go out and you don’t know where you are?’</p>
<p><bold>RWD</bold>: ‘Aye’</p>
</disp-quote>
Later in the interview the daughter feels she has to compensate for her mother's lack of conversation by filling in for what she <italic>could</italic> have recounted.
<disp-quote>
<p><bold>Daughter</bold>: ‘Well she could have told you a lot more about Edinburgh. She does remember a lot more, and a lot more about Shetland. But again, she does need prompting’</p>
</disp-quote>
Later again she tries to stimulate her mother's memory to demonstrate how well it can function but has to concede its limitations on this particular occasion.
<disp-quote>
<p><bold>Daughter</bold>: ‘You lived … what was the name of the big estate where you lived, where the big housewas?’</p>
<p><bold>RWD</bold>: ‘Oh I’ve forgotten’</p>
<p><bold>Daughter</bold>: ‘You’ve told me before’</p>
<p><bold>RWD</bold>: ‘Aye’</p>
</disp-quote>
The respondent finally admits she cannot recall the detail her daughter is seeking by saying it is ‘too far away’ and was ‘too long ago’.</p>
<p>This was a pattern repeated in all of the joint interviews where carers participated alongside their relative, a reflection of what seemed to be a desire to help their relative find a correct answer, to show them in their best light and, in order to satisfy this desire to compensate for inability, repeatedly to test them in the hope that the appropriate memory will resurface, as summarized by a daughter in the simple statement, ‘I keep hoping’<italic>.</italic> The impact of this compensatory behaviour on the morale of the carer is difficult to determine but significantly perhaps, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1471301211421262">Levesque et al. (1995)</xref> found that this ‘rational’ management of the relative's dementia was associated with negative feelings about the caring role (cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1471301211421262">Parker, 1998</xref>) as well as loss of control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1471301211421262">Orrell &amp; Bebbington, 1995</xref>).</p>
<p>For some carers in the present study, however, it was impossible consistently to separate the effects of disease from the presented behaviour and the frustration would spill over in their accounts.
<disp-quote>

The centrality of the carer in dementia care has been explored in terms of identity maintenance or preservation from the perspective of the caring environment provided. Most vociferous in this area is <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1471301211421262">Kitwood (1997)</xref> who further elaborated his ‘malignant social psychology’ if care givers are unable or unwilling to provide a nurturing environment. He argued that carers are at times incapable of facing the bleakness of the future they see emerging in the fate of their dependants, and resort to providing care which effectively dehumanizes that individual. His range of 17 such ‘offences' can be, arguably, a bewildering challenge to a hard-pressed carer, ifconfronted, for example, with the exacting charge of being ‘treacherous’ through perhaps trying to coax a reluctant relative by means of a seemingly innocent white lie. While Kitwood's analysis possibly relates more to formal or institutional forms of care, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1471301211421262">Crisp (1999)</xref> supports his view and summarizes this as: ‘A major impediment to the survival of “personhood” in someone with dementia is the prevalence of highly negative and stigmatizing attitudes towards this condition. These attitudes influence caregiving practices, which in turn adversely affect the person in care and, indeed, may worsen the dementia’ (p. 95). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1471301211421262">Sweeting and Gilhooly's (1997)</xref> reworking of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1471301211421262">Sweeting's (1991)</xref> ‘social death’ identifies the phenomenon where carers remove the status of a living person from their relative and attribute them with a ‘social death’, when they are no longer recognizable as the previous self. They argue that this is a consequence of the unique coalescence in dementia of a lengthy fatal disease, old age and the resulting loss of the recognisable characteristics which previously created personhood. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1471301211421262">Davis (2004</xref>, cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1471301211421262">Innes, 2009</xref>) however challenges Kitwood's adherence to this principal, arguing that to do so prevents ‘the initiation of agrieving process' where carers ‘no longer recognize the spark of their former relationships … ’ (p. 60).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1471301211421262">Sabat and Harré (1992)</xref> build on the theme of the centrality of carer in helping the affected individual maintain a sense of identity. They suggest that self-awareness can persist far into the end stage of the disease and that where this falters it is a consequence of misinterpretation of behaviour by others, and a failure to convey acceptance, <italic>a given self</italic>, to the person with dementia. If the self in dementia can be lost, they argue, the primary cause is likely to be the way in which others view and treat the individual. The challenge for carers is to resist the pressure to define their relative purely in terms of the illness and to thus <italic>position</italic> them as helpless and incompetent.</p>

<sec id="sec12-1471301211421262"><title>Continuity and loss: identifying continuity</title>
<p>Those sub-themes examined above were contextualized within the carers’ accounts and relate to their attempts to decipher and articulate, across a range of experiences, the extent to which their relative retained or had lost identifiable aspects of their former ‘selves’. The range of perceived loss found expression across the trajectory with minimal change noted by some, where abundant evidence was offered of continuity of self, to almost complete loss of former identity manifested by transformation into an ‘other’ as described in the following.</p>
<sec id="sec13-1471301211421262"><title>Evidence of continuity</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1471301211421262">Murray and Livingston (1998)</xref> in a qualitative analysis of interviews with spouses caring for a partner with a mental health problem, predominately dementia, reported that while perceived changes in the affected spouse's behaviour caused distress, those carers best able to cope were those who perceived continuity in the relationship, which seemed to lead to more tolerance and better adjustment to the changing demands of caring.</p>
<p>In the present study carers were asked about what had changed about their relative and what remained of their former, pre-morbid ‘self ’. The responses revealed a wide range of opinion along the theme of continuity or loss of self, sometimes contradictory as in the statements below from a husband:
<disp-quote>
<p>‘She is very strange with other people. She was always like that’</p>
<p>‘Oh she’s a different person altogether’</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>A daughter was able to be quite specific about particular aspects of her mother's personality which were intact.
<disp-quote>
<p>‘Her humour is still there. She has this sense of humour, she really does. And is quite spontaneous at times if the music’s on and she’ll come across to me and we’ll have a wee waltz round the living room or a tango. We usually tango down the lobby because it’s a long lobby. Or if it’s country dancing she’ll have a wee bit pas deux bas and a wee turn, but just a wee bit. She used to do that at home, you know, when everybody was there’</p>
</disp-quote>
However, later, in the face of growing evidence of change, she offers contradictory information about her mother's lack of spontaneity which is a source of considerable frustration and sadness to her:
<disp-quote>
<p>‘Yes but there’s so little [of her] and it’s going. And I would rather remember her well and able to give a pithy answer back to the things that you’ve said, rather than have her … ’</p>
<p>‘Her life is finished really. Her quality of life is not there’</p>
</disp-quote>
and yet again, further contradiction,
<disp-quote>
<p>‘You see I don’t want to let go of the idea that my Mum can still do everything, although I know she can’t do it. But I still want her to be able to do it. I still want her to be able to go and make a cup of tea, and I know she can’t. Quite sad seeing her going. From the outside looking at her she looks superb’</p>
<p>‘… peculiar, it must be awful, I mean you can’t contemplate what it’s like. She won’t remember having lunch. I mean how would you like it that you can’t remember what you did this morning? You are only now, this instant, now. And you just don’t know’</p>
</disp-quote>
Another daughter similarly sought to reassure about those aspects of her mother which were still intact:
<disp-quote>
<p>‘Even when she’s watching television game programmes, she can come away with the answers. Oh yes, she’s quite intelligent you know. It’s just the memory. She’s quite intelligent if she can just remember at the time, you know’</p>
<p>‘She is really the boss … Yes, always ready to do something to help people She still has that’</p>
</disp-quote>
A son maintained that his mother, now living in a residential home, was still fussy about her appearance, interested in seeing her sister, enjoyed walking and going out for coffee. He observed that she remained a very kind individual.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec14-1471301211421262"><title>Continuity of a difficult self</title>
<p>Continuity of less favourable aspects of personality were identified and were the source of tension and carer dismay, exacerbating problems by compounding an already difficult relationship as was the case in a number of the carers’ accounts, such as this wife's:
<disp-quote>
<p>‘Well he never showed affection. We moved around a lot … and I was left with all these removals, you know. He never thought about it. I remember we were in a furnished house waiting for a house being built and I remember finishing in floods of tears because I was going around looking for bed and breakfast. He said, “Oh you just like it when things are on top of you”. That was the type of person he was’</p>
</disp-quote>
and now,
<disp-quote>
<p>‘Never asks how I’m feeling. You can get resentful, and he doesn’t even … quite uncaring isn’tit?’</p>
</disp-quote>
Another wife regretted the silences she now endured in her husband's presence which she interpreted as a sign of his indifference towards her and therefore a deterioration in her previously healthy and rewarding relationship with him, as illustrated thus:
<disp-quote>
<p>‘The little bit of wit occasionally comes through, … but I don’t bring it out’</p>
</disp-quote>
A wife talked about her husband's continuing fierce temper, his arrogance and his dislike of socializing, behaviour which had soured her marriage many years earlier. Little had changed in this respect, although, in addition, he was now less concerned with his personal hygiene and somewhat obsessed with money and his cigarette supply. His earlier success as a breadwinner and provider for the family, which was what had saved the marriage, had long since ceased and the tension within the household was obvious in both their accounts. The respondent with dementia's self-assessment seems to reflect those attributes which his wife and daughter had described:
<disp-quote>
<p><bold>RWD</bold>: ‘Oh Yes. She’s [wife] patient with me, I’ll tell you’</p>
<p><bold>Interviewer</bold>: ‘Do you think you need patience?’</p>
<p><bold>RWD</bold>: ‘I can be nasty at times’</p>
</disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec15-1471301211421262"><title>Continuity of intimacy</title>
<p>Intimacy was mentioned by three of the carers, all spouses, in the context of fleeting but highly valued glimpses of a former closeness, for example the wife who described how her increasingly withdrawn husband had unexpectedly turned to her in bed one night and said, ‘I still love you and wouldn't put anyone in your place’<italic>.</italic> She talked of being both surprised and delighted but had responded to him by joking that probably no-one would accept her place. A husband talked of how he and his wife still knew how to ‘court’ and enjoy a kiss and cuddle now and then. Another husband described similar experiences:
<disp-quote>
<p>‘Sometimes she’s not too bad. She says “Can I sit beside you?” and she cuddles in to you just for a while. Just hugs into you then all of a sudden she goes off, she says, “I’d better go now”’</p>
</disp-quote>
Although cited by a minority of the carers, these were significant comments in that they reflect a perception of continuity from the carers, seeing their spouses as partners still, or even occasionally, and an ability to sustain or return to a relationship not primarily dictated by dependence/support, but one of mutual pleasure and respect.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec16-1471301211421262"><title>Co-dependence as continuity</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1471301211421262">Hellstrom et al. (2007)</xref> identify characteristics which help give meaning to the ‘dynamics of couplehood’ in dementia and demonstrate how couplehood was sustained, involvement of both parties maintained and the relationship moved on over time. This phenomenon was clearly apparent in the current study where interactions between respondents in the interview occasionally revealed a co-dependence. For example, one couple where on a number of occasions the husband, in spite of his Alzheimer's disease, acted as prompt for hiswife's (suspect) memory, reminding her to go out shopping, and urging her to relate details of a recent competition win. On two occasions he was able to correct his wife's accounts:
<disp-quote>
<p><bold>Wife</bold>: ‘Not many men like shopping, but he likes shopping’</p>
<p><bold>RWD</bold>: ‘To certain shops!’</p>
</disp-quote>
and again when his wife was describing a friend who now used a wheelchair
<disp-quote>
<p><bold>Wife</bold>: ‘She has no legs’</p>
<p><bold>RWD</bold>: ‘Well she has legs, but no feet’</p>
<p><bold>Wife</bold>: ‘That’s right’</p>
</disp-quote>
The husband also talked expansively about his wife's life abroad and her career as a ballet dancer and teacher, basking in her glory and asking me to examine her tiny feet. He also quipped in an obviously well-rehearsed joke:
<disp-quote>
<p>‘She was a ballet teacher. I hate to say it but she was a bally nuisance as well’</p>
</disp-quote>
There was similar light-hearted banter in the dialogue between a number of other couples and dyads, indicating the importance of humour within these relationships and how it coulddiffuse difficult situations. One couple jointly described the gradual shift in their relationship:
<disp-quote>
<p><bold>Husband</bold>: ‘Oh we are still partners’</p>
<p><bold>RWD</bold>: ‘We can’t be equal because there are so many things that I wouldn’t risk trying to do now, in case I could do damage maybe, if I started something and couldn’t finish it’</p>
</disp-quote>
and where the wife, in spite of her advancing Alzheimer's disease, confirmed that her husband's growing confidence and expertise as her carer was due largely to her guidance and teaching, particularly in how to cook and do the laundry. It was mutually important to define her increasing difficulties with memory and perception in physical terms, particularly a risk of falling, and thus reduce her activities in certain spheres where her husband could become increasingly proficient.</p>
<p>One husband saw his wife's position as sick and helpless as a familiar one in that he had nursed her through a serious illness earlier in their marriage. He had found a source of satisfaction in his success in this ‘nursing’ role and could trace this competence to earlier childhood training from his own mother who taught him to be practical around the house. He had invested both emotionally and practically in her disability, a familiar role she fulfilled without difficulty and which served to mask, to the satisfaction of both of them, the deterioration linked to her dementia. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1471301211421262">Sabat and Harré (1992)</xref> identify a similar co-dependence where the person with dementia might fulfil an important function, such as her role as invalid, in maintaining her husband's sense of fulfilment as her effective carer: ‘In addition the sufferer may also engage in adaptive practices to sustain his or her presented selves so as to conform to or satisfy the needs of the caregiver’ (p. 448).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec17-1471301211421262"><title>Reciprocity</title>
<p>Reciprocity as a theme was examined in the original study with evidence offered of the dementia participant's <italic>agency</italic>, manifested through an ability to acknowledge and relate to the interviewer. During one interview during which a daughter was present, she would maintain her role as ‘mother’, anxiously seeking assurance that her daughter was warm enough and enquiring if she was in need of a cup of tea.</p>
<p>Here reciprocity relates to simple give and take. Chesla et al. (cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1471301211421262">Hellstrom et al., 2007</xref>) identified three types of caregiving relationships, the first of which ‘continuous' reflects that described here ‘whereby the carers still defined themselves as being <italic>in relation</italic> with the person with dementia, saw them reciprocating and helping to define the world of the carer in a positive ways’ (p. 385).</p>
<p>Feeling that the person being cared for appreciates the carer's efforts is a further aspect of the relationship identified as important in helping carers to cope, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1471301211421262">Parker, 1998</xref>, p. 127) and thus when these carers express sadness at the loss of this kind of reciprocity as a form of appreciation, the impact must be assumed to be negative. Carers typically bemoaned the fact that reciprocity had been lost, such as this husband's statement:
<disp-quote>
<p>‘I have to iron all her clothes. Not long ago she did that herself but she just doesn’t iron or nothing. The only thing she’ll make is a cup of tea if she’s hungry. She goes in and she makes it for herself. Well, when I make tea I make it for everybody’</p>
</disp-quote>
and another husband,
<disp-quote>
<p>‘She doesn’t give an inch. She doesn’t help you’</p>
</disp-quote>
a daughter who rationalizes her mother's lack of reciprocity through forgetting she lives in her daughter's home:
<disp-quote>
<p>‘She doesn’t offer to set the table. She doesn’t offer to do the dishes’</p>
</disp-quote>
this wife denying her husband's generosity with his cigarettes:
<disp-quote>
<p>‘No! Not him. He wouldn’t give me one’</p>
</disp-quote>
and this wife's observation about her husband's self-centredness:
<disp-quote>
<p>‘It all boils down to what’s suiting him now’</p>
</disp-quote></p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="sec18-1471301211421262"><title>Continuity and loss: losing, loss and caring in despair</title>
<p>There is considerable evidence to support a view of the general despair or despondency with which some of the carers in this study talk of the situation in which they find themselves. They present a picture of managing their caring tasks with varying degrees of success, some hanging on to the remnants of what is familiar in their relative, some resigned to their growing loss, one or two resorting to the abuse of alcohol to get them through the growing ordeal and others constructing their predicament in such as way as to alter or even dehumanize the person for whom they provide daily care:
<disp-quote>
<p>‘It is an illness because actually that’s not him. His whole personality has changed. Better a dead sorrow than a live one. I wish he would just die of his heart condition. He should go first’</p>
</disp-quote>
This same carer had ceased to recognize her husband as his former ‘self ’ saying of him:
<disp-quote>
<p>‘I feel I’ve got a kid now. Got to do everything for him. He’s not the same person. I mean we used to have our wee arguments, now and again, I mean. Now we have arguments because he won’t getup … ’</p>
</disp-quote>
this is in stark contrast to the smart, dapper man she now grieved for, who would never eat breakfast until he was washed, fully dressed and shaved of a morning.</p>
<p>She describes trying to cope by cutting herself off from the emotional torment, but is only partially successful as her feelings of concern and affection for her husband are clearly continuing:
<disp-quote>
<p>‘Well you get very hurt about it but then I say, “it’s your husband”, and you’ve just got to shut yourself off, and just get on with it. Sitting feeling sorry for yourself doesn’t do any good because Iwouldn’t be any good to him. I’m not saying I don’t shed a tear now and again but I always think “this is it”, and shut myself off … Your feelings are still there but you feel so sorry. At times you feel, “why him, why has it happened to him?”’</p>
</disp-quote>
Similarly a daughter talked of her mother having ‘gone’:
<disp-quote>
<p>‘That’s not my mother any more. That’s another pleasant wee woman who looks like her who Ilook after’</p>
</disp-quote>
This distancing, to some extent, helped these carers to come to terms with the perceived loss of most of which had been recognizable in their relatives. The despair of some carers found stark expression:
<disp-quote>
<p>‘I can’t even cope with it, it’s terrible. Sometimes I wish I had some bloody tablets and could put me to sleep’</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<sec id="sec19-1471301211421262"><title>Lost attributes</title>
<p>Perhaps the clearest manifestation of perceived lack of continuity from the carers is their use of the past tense when talking about their relative, signalling an end of being, and as that part of the person's life as over. Such an account comes from a wife describing her husband as he was when they first married, late in life, some 16 years earlier:
<disp-quote>
<p>‘He was very adamant in those days. He knew what he wanted to do. He was very lively, he was a very bustly man. He used to nearly run everywhere rather than walk. He was very witty. He used to write poems. He was always going to write a book. He was a pleasure to be with, and even when we came here twelve years ago we used to have a whale of a time … He was just so. he had an acute mind. He was good fun to be with and was always a gentleman, you know the sort who would open doors for you, call you darling and he used to, when I was out at work after we were married, he would do the ironing. He would have a meal ready when I got back, He used to make the Irish breads’</p>
</disp-quote>
in contrast to how she perceived him now
<disp-quote>
<p>‘And I think about this quite often. He is an old man who stoops, who can’t walk or can hardly walk, who is nearly completely deaf, who cannot communicate to me at all. A complete stranger. A complete stranger. Nearly a complete stranger to me. He asks to have the TV put on and I’m ready to talk and chat and he sits and is lost to me all day long. And then that appears to me to be depressing and that rubs off on him’</p>
</disp-quote>
Another wife similarly noted changes:
<disp-quote>
<p>‘No no … he’s really … he’s changed. Changed a lot since … ’</p>
</disp-quote>
while another commented that her relationship with her husband, in spite of her perception of his continuity as her partner, now reminded her of looking after her younger brother when she was 14 and her mother was very ill.</p>
<p>A husband described how his wife continued to smoke and thereby continued to be chastised about her habit, a continuation of his and his son's relationship with her that had not altered. He also recognized her determination to present herself as the conscientious and capable homemaker she had been all her married life.
<disp-quote>
<p>‘It’s hard to say. She still makes out she’s awful particular, you know. She’s always got to say in the morning; “I’ll hoover all this place up” … she doesn’t look at it. She’s got in her mind she could do it, but she’ll not do it now’</p>
</disp-quote>
At the other end of the trajectory, a daughter described her mother as being ‘removed’ and treated as a ‘non-person’ when she watched people who saw her in the village street no longer acknowledging her, let alone stopping to chat to her. She also described her mother's attempt to cover up a toileting accident in bed by saying ‘that wasn't me. That was the other old woman who sleeps with me did this', and while acknowledging this as her mother's futile attempt to disguise her shame, related it to her own bout of depression when she felt ‘other-worldly’ as if she was apart from what was happening and could watch herself walking about and doing things, as if the body belonged to someone else, as an outsider looking in. She described this astwo halves of self, looking at one's self from elsewhere and how it was a difficult job to ‘hold on to yourself’. Her mother frequently talked about wanting to ‘be away’, to die.</p>

</sec>
<sec id="sec20-1471301211421262"><title>The language of loss and losing</title>
<p>These carers used a language which colourfully reflected the sense of losing and loss they were experiencing. Some of these have been highlighted in context in the quotations in the text, but presented collectively their impact is powerful and moving. The following terms drawn from the carers’ accounts illustrate this point: <italic>stranger, lost, going, different, finished, shrinking, away.</italic> These are emotive terms and their expression, in the context of describing a loved close relative, amply reflects the extent of the emotional cost of watching dementia rob them of this person.

<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1471301211421262">Gubrium (1987)</xref> examines carers’ adjustment to their relatives’ dementia and draws attention to the similarity to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1471301211421262">Kubler-Ross’ (1969)</xref> five-stage model of dying, comprising denial, anger, bargaining, depression and acceptance. Reaction to these stages can be traced in Wilson's (cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1471301211421262">Keady, 1996</xref>, p. 281) description of carers’ experiences of dementia, namely noticing, discounting and normalizing, suspecting, searching for explanations, recasting, taking it on, going through it and turning it over. There are obvious parallels in the experiences of this group of carers and while bereavement triggers certain responses, the differences highlight the ultimate dilemma of caring for a relative with dementia. Loss is insidious and what is dying is the personality and not the body, leaving the carer emotionally bereaved but physically burdened and thus caught in a complex emotional conflict. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1471301211421262">Matthew (1999)</xref> found her male spouse carers were thus experiencing an ‘ambiguous’ loss which complicated the grieving process.</p>
<p>The continuum of emotional reaction captured in the trajectory identifies stages from initially acknowledging change, finding meaning for those changes, coping initially by resisting then by gradually giving in to the inevitable and withdrawing emotionally in an effort to lessen the impact. The illness journey for these carers is increasingly perplexing in that they are eventually denied the traditional rewards that might render their caregiving more tolerable. Undermining their role further, the capacity of their relative in acknowledging their caregiving efforts diminishes as the caring task increases, such that resentments surface in spite of attempts to attribute such ‘selfishness’ to the disease. How they then interpret their caring role is constantly challenged in terms of what it is achieving, when there is less evidence that it might be a shared objective. There is less opportunity to confirm whether they both seek the same things when communication has all but eased. Efforts to stimulate and entertain theirrelative while simultaneously offering the carer a break seem to be received with indifference. Ultimately maximum caregiving effort is required when minimal evidence of the former recognizable loved one remains, and this ambiguity is manifestly agonizing for these carers.</p>

<sec id="sec21-1471301211421262" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1471301211421262">Carpentier et al. (2008)</xref> state that, no doubt for fiscal as well as altruistic interests, ‘the pathways followed by caregivers of persons with Alzheimer's Disease are coming under increasing scientific scrutiny … ’ (pp. 334-335), while <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1471301211421262">Doherty, Benbow, Craig, and Smith (2009)</xref> remind us that an illness journey has ‘no A–Z or road atlas’ (p. 503). What then can be deduced about the pathway or journey from these carers’ accounts? Their contributions offer us an insight into the kind of environment or context they provide which colours and influences their interaction with their relative either through enhancement or by potentially damaging emotional responses. The picture emerging is one of contradiction and inconsistency, akin to riding on a roller coaster of conflicting emotion and is certainly ‘iterative rather than linear’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1471301211421262">Hellstrom et al., 2007</xref>). The carers appear to seek meaning in sources as varied as the manifestations of the disease they are observing and experiencing in their own right. These carers are confused about what has happened to their relative, what the medical terminology means, and why it should have happened to their family member. Their reasoning is muddled, as, in the absence of any coherent information which they may or may not have absorbed, they seek explanation in something familiar and comprehensible. They struggle with the loss they are experiencing and the disintegration they are witnessing and seek to manage these experiences in a variety of ways and with varying degrees of success. Their struggle is essentially a personal one, unsupported (as they are in this study) by extended family who significantly share the caring activities.</p>
<p>The impact of this context of care on the person with dementia is more difficult both to identify and analyse and it is necessary to return to the guidance offered by those few theorists who have sought to explore the effect of the social environment of dementia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1471301211421262">Kitwood, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1471301211421262">Sabat &amp; Harré, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1471301211421262">Scholl &amp; Sabat, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Making assumptions about any influential properties of the care environment, extrapolated from the content of the carers’ verbal accounts, is but one attempt at gauging the potential for carers to maintain or otherwise a sense of self in the relative they care for. The evidence presented here suggests that carers attempt for as long as possible to recognize and sustain continuity in their relative but in the face of mounting evidence to the contrary, they manage their growing loss by gradual objectification and emotional withdrawal which, at best, is only partially achieved. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1471301211421262">Hellstrom et al. (2007)</xref> describe how ‘most carers invest considerable efforts in sustaining the self-esteem and sense of agency of the person with dementia even if their actual contribution to the relationship diminishes over time’ (p. 384).</p>
<p>Here, the carers’ losses remain ambiguous (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1471301211421262">Dupuis, 2002</xref>), as the physical manifestation of their relative outlives other recognizable aspects. The ambiguity renders their progression along the continuum of care as haphazard and continuously resisted by hopes of a recovery or at best signs of some recaptured ability in their relative.</p>

<sec id="sec22-1471301211421262"><title>Implications for support services</title>
<p>The complexity of the caregiving situation cannot be disputed nor, arguably, can the uniqueness of how that situation is experienced. Those charged with supporting the caregiving environment are required to address complex needs with effective solutions. Acknowledging the experience as a shared journey, albeit non-linear, and subject to the vagaries of the unpredictable illness progression, demands supports which are flexible and responsive. Tailored services which can be adapted to changing need often challenge the care provision models most commonly experienced in contemporary contexts whereby a best fit solution most often passes for effective care. Eligibility criteria, inflexible work patterns and limitations on the activities of formal caregivers are typical impediments to effective support. Similarly a slow and gradual slide into a caregiving role might effectively deter potential caregivers from seeking help when working with their relative to maintain a spousal or parental relationship in the face of increasing evidence that the balance of care has changed. Support providers must acknowledge the journey travelled by carers and how its twists and turns will generate new and different support needs, harnessing retained abilities for as longs as possible but providing, when required, the resources for carers to come to terms with the limitations of their own caregiving abilities.</p>
