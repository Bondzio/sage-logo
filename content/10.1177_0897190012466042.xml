      <p>Serving as the Guest Editor for this issue of the <italic>Journal of Pharmacy Practice</italic> has allowed me to work with practitioners from different areas of clinical expertise with a common focus on pulmonary disease. Pulmonary disease is any disease or disorder causing improper lung function. The main types of pulmonary disease include airway, lung tissue, vascular, or a combination. Airway diseases affect the flow of oxygen and other gases into and out of the lungs. Lung tissue disease involves the structure of the lung resulting in inflammation and an inability of the lungs to fully expand. Disorders involving circulation within the lungs are due to clotting, scarring, or inflammation affecting the ability of the lungs to take up oxygen and exchange with carbon dioxide.</p>
      <p>Lung transplantation has become a treatment option in patients with end-stage lung disease. The most common etiologies include chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), and pulmonary fibrosis. The article authored by Drs Thompson, Flynn, and Clifford provides an overview of the pharmacotherapy of lung transplantation and complications that may occur following the transplant. Transplant is a treatment option in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients that have a forced expiratory volume in 1 second of less than 30% predicted. The CF pharmacotherapy is primarily due to lung and digestive system disorders. Drs Braga and Almgren review alternative CF treatment options in their article. The article authored by myself and Dr Staijch evaluates combination treatment options in PAH and its effect on morbidity, mortality, and delaying transplantation.</p>
      <p>Education of the patient with pulmonary disease regarding appropriate use of devices is important in ensuring effective drug delivery. The article authored by Drs Thurmon, Jervis, and Mrs Schwartz describes the training of pharmacy students to educate on appropriate device use by utilizing an asthma patient case.</p>
      <p>The authors of the articles within this issue worked toward providing the reader with a current and comprehensive review of topics related to pulmonary diseases. I would personally like to thank all of the authors, and my consulting editor Dr Andrea McKeever, for all of their hard work in preparing this edition.</p>
