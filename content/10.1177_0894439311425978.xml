<abstract>
<p>With Mowen’s Meta-theoretic Model of Motivation (3M Model) as a theoretical framework, this article examines the hierarchical trait predictors and consequence of one’s perceived ability to modify self-presentation on Facebook (Facebook self-presentation). The study identifies several hierarchical routes to Facebook self-presentation (e.g., agreeableness, need to belong, online public self-consciousness, Facebook self-presentation, or conscientiousness self-efficacy, Internet self-efficacy, Facebook self-presentation). Facebook self-presentation is also significantly correlated with its outcome variable of Facebook intensity. Theoretical implications are provided.</p>

<p>It is important to study the use of digital media among young adults, as individual media preferences in the digital age (along with friendships, romantic relationships, and ideology) have played a significant role in adolescent development and identity formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0894439311425978">Pempek, Yermolayeva, &amp; Calvert, 2009</xref>). As one of the most used digital applications in recent years, social networking site (SNS) represents a forum in which individual media preferences, friendship, romantic relationships, and ideology can converge and be displayed at the same time. Unlike early online public communities that were structured by topics or interests, SNSs are structured with an individual user at the center of his or her own community (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0894439311425978">Boyd &amp; Ellison, 2007</xref>). SNSs allow young adults to create profiles and conduct activities that reflect their emerging identities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0894439311425978">Pempek et al., 2009</xref>). SNSs are popular means of communicating personalities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0894439311425978">Krämer &amp; Winter, 2008</xref>), which can be expressed through various backgrounds, graphics, music, and videos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0894439311425978">Lewis &amp; George, 2008</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0894439311425978">Buffardi and Campbell (2008)</xref> found that personality factors are somewhat accurately expressed by webpage owners through personal webpage content and appropriately inferred by website viewers. Despite the perceived role of personality in the construction of personal webpages (e.g., SNSs), researchers have just started to examine the relationship between personality traits and specific forms of self-presentation over SNSs (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0894439311425978">Krämer &amp; Winter, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Basic and abstract personality types (e.g., Big Five factors) have not been very successful in predicting human behaviors directly. Due to the weak relationships found between basic personality traits and behavior, consumer researchers have since the 1970s turned away from broad theories of personality to more narrowly defined traits (e.g., compulsive consumption; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0894439311425978">Mowen, 2000</xref>). Proposing a Meta-theoretic Model of Motivation (3M Model), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0894439311425978">Mowen (2000)</xref> argued that personality traits at both abstract and concrete levels combine to form a motivational network that influences behavior. The 3M Model has been proven to account for high levels of variance in consumer behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0894439311425978">Mowen, 2000</xref>). Dozens of applications of 3M Model have been published since 2000.</p>
<p>With Mowen’s 3M Model as a theoretical framework, this study aims to develop and test a hierarchical model that explores the trait antecedents and consequence of perceived ability to modify self-presentation on Facebook, one of the most popular social media tools in the United States. Facebook even surpassed Google to become the most visited U.S. website for the week ending March 13, 2010 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0894439311425978">Dougherty, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>The article is structured as follows. First, it provides an overview of research background on SNS self-presentation and 3M Model of motivation and personality. Then it develops a series of hypotheses. Methods and findings are discussed next. The article concludes with a summary of findings as well as theoretical implications.</p>

<title>SNS Self-Presentation</title>
<p>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0894439311425978">Boyd and Ellison (2007</xref>, p.2) defined social networking SNSs as web-based services that allow users “to (1) construct a public or semi-public profile within a bounded system, (2) articulate a list of other users with whom they share a connection, and (3) view and traverse their list of connections and those made by others within the system.” SNSs offer their users many self-presentation opportunities. They can use personal webpages to select attractive photos or provide self-promoting descriptions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0894439311425978">Buffardi &amp; Campbell, 2008</xref>). SNSs users can manage their self-presentations more strategically than in face-to-face situations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0894439311425978">Ellison, Heino, &amp; Gibbs, 2006</xref>). SNS users have more control over their self-presentational behaviors than in face-to-face communications, as they have the opportunity to think about what aspects of their personalities should be presented or which photos convey their best images. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0894439311425978">Walther, Slovacek, and Tidwell (2001)</xref> used the term “hyperpersonal” to label computer-mediated communication (CMC) relationships that can be more intimate than traditional offline relationships. According to their perspective, CMC users can benefit from selective self-presentation and asynchronous communication. Through selective self-presentation, CMC users are able to make and sustain a positive impression by editing the breadth and depth of their self-disclosure to conform to the cyber image they want to project. As an asynchronous channel of communication, CMC users can plan, contemplate, and edit their comments more than is possible in spontaneous and simultaneous face-to-face conversations. Compared to other CMC environments like instant messaging, SNSs encourage more open, one-to-many communication (Antheunis, Valkenburg, &amp; Peter, 2009).</p>

<title>Correlates of SNS use and Self-Presentation</title>
<p>Research has just begun to examine the antecedents and consequences of SNS use, as well as the trait predictors of SNS self-presentation. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0894439311425978">Ellison, Steinfield, and Lampe (2007)</xref> identified a positive relationship between the use of Facebook and bridging/bonding social capital. A positive relationship was also found between the use of an internal SNS (within International Business Machines [IBM]) and social capital (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0894439311425978">Steinfield, DiMicco, Ellison, &amp; Lampe, 2009</xref>). On the other hand, individual differences have an impact on SNS behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0894439311425978">Kim &amp; Yun, 2007</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0894439311425978">Kwon and Wen (2010)</xref> found that perceived encouragement and perceived orientation (SNS as a human relationship-oriented service or as a task-oriented service) were significant determinants of the actual use of social network services. Internet self-efficacy, need to belong, and collective self-esteem had positive effects on attitudes toward SNS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0894439311425978">Gangadharbatla, 2008</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0894439311425978">Krämer and Winter (2008)</xref> investigated the relationship between self-reported (offline) personality traits and (online) self-presentation in social networking profiles. They found that self-efficacy with regard to impression management was strongly related to the number of virtual friends, the level of profile detail, and the style of personal photo. They also identified a slight influence from extroversion.</p>
<p>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0894439311425978">Ross et al. (2009)</xref> noted that personality defined by the Five-Factor approach may be too broad to understand specific Internet behaviors. Other more specific personality characteristics (e.g., public self-consciousness) may be more useful in predicting Facebook activities. Based on Mowen’s 3M Model of motivation and personality, this study develops a hierarchical model that examines how a combination of basic and specific personality traits helps explain users' perceived ability to modify self-presentation on Facebook. An outcome variable of Facebook self-presentation, Facebook intensity, is also explored in the model. The following section presents an overview of Mowen’s 3M Model.</p>

<sec id="section4-0894439311425978">
<title>The 3M Model of Motivation and Personality</title>
<p>Integrating work from control theory, evolutionary psychology, hierarchical personality models, and the Big-Five model of personality, Mowen's 3M Model holds that traits at more abstract and cross-situational levels influence traits at more specific and context-specific levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0894439311425978">Mowen, 2000</xref>). The model covers four hierarchical levels of personality traits: elemental traits, compound traits, situational traits, and surface traits (from the most abstract to the most concrete). Resulting from genetics and individuals' early learning histories, elemental traits represent basic personality dimensions, which include the Big-Five personality traits (neuroticism or emotional instability, introversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, and openness to experience), need for arousal, need for material resources, and need for protecting and enhancing body resources. Elemental traits act as self-schemas and provide abstract values for guiding behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0894439311425978">Mowen, 2000</xref>). Compound traits, derived from the effects of elemental traits, culture and subcultures, are cross-situational in nature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0894439311425978">Mowen, Park, &amp; Zablah, 2007</xref>). Examples of compound traits include need for learning (or need for cognition) and self-efficacy. As the enduring dispositions to behave within a general situational context, situational traits are influenced by both elemental and compound traits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0894439311425978">Mowen, 2000</xref>). Examples of situational traits include sports interest and health motivation. Surface traits represent enduring dispositions to act in specific behavioral contexts. They result from the effects of elemental, compound, situational traits, and context-specific environments. Sports participation and healthy diet lifestyles are examples of surface traits. In a 3M diagram for healthy diet lifestyle, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0894439311425978">Mowen (2000)</xref> found that conscientiousness (an elemental trait) positively affected self-efficacy (a compound trait), which was a positive predictor of health motivation (a situational trait), which had a positive impact on healthy diet (a surface trait).</p>
<p>Compared to the elemental traits, compound traits provide more direct guidance for task selection and completion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0894439311425978">Mowen, 2000</xref>). While situational traits may be described as representing cells in a person by situation matrix, surface traits occur as a result of person, by situation, by product–category interactions. For example, the surface trait of coupon proneness (proneness to use coupons) results from the interactions among individual consumers, the purchase situation, and the product category of coupons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0894439311425978">Mowen, 2000</xref>). The 3M Model is a partial mediation model, as elemental traits can directly influence surface traits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0894439311425978">Mowen et al., 2007</xref>). As a useful framework for examining hierarchical trait relationships, the model has been applied to various consumer behavior contexts, such as superstition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0894439311425978">Mowen &amp; Carlson, 2003</xref>), job resourcefulness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0894439311425978">Licata, Mowen, Harris, &amp; Brown, 2003</xref>), volunteer behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0894439311425978">Mowen &amp; Sujan, 2005</xref>), aggressive and distracted driving (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0894439311425978">Bone &amp; Mowen, 2006</xref>), traveling behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0894439311425978">Scott &amp; Mowen, 2007</xref>), online shopping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0894439311425978">Bosnjak, Galesic, &amp; Tuten, 2007</xref>), word-of-mouth communications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0894439311425978">Mowen et al., 2007</xref>), credit card misuse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0894439311425978">Pirog &amp; Roberts, 2007</xref>), gambling behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0894439311425978">Mowen, Fang, &amp; Scott, 2009</xref>), visual product aesthetics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0894439311425978">Mowen, Fang, &amp; Scott, 2010</xref>), and online impulsive buying (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0894439311425978">Sun &amp; Wu, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Based on the trait variables outlined by Mowen in his 3M Model (2000) and on our review of other literature (see the next section for details), we decided to include in our hierarchical model nine variables as trait predictors of perceived ability to modify self-presentation on Facebook. To be specific, three elemental traits (out of Mowen’s original eight) serve as the exogenous variables (agreeableness, conscientiousness, and introversion) in our model. Our compound traits include self-efficacy, need to belong, and dispositional trust, as they are cross-situational and represent the enduring dispositions to set goals and complete tasks. Our situational traits include online public self-consciousness, institution-based trust in Internet, and Internet self-efficacy, as they represent dispositions to act within the general online context. Surface traits are category-specific dispositions to act with regard to a specific product category or narrow domain of behavior. Perceived ability to modify self-presentation on Facebook is entered as our surface trait (endogenous variable), as it is specific to the domain of Facebook use. Facebook intensity is the outcome variable, representing the behavioral consequence of perceived ability to modify self-presentation on Facebook. This study uses Facebook as an SNS example, as the site has been consistently identified as the most popular SNS among college students (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0894439311425978">Hargittai, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0894439311425978">Peluchette &amp; Karl, 2008</xref>).</p>

<title>Online public self-consciousness</title>
<p>Public self-consciousness is defined by a general awareness of the self as a social object that has an effect on others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0894439311425978">Fenigstein, Scheier, &amp; Buss, 1975</xref>). According to symbolic interactionism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0894439311425978">Mead, 1934</xref>), self is composed of “I” (private self) and “me” (public self). “Me” is the image of self seen through the looking glass of other's reactions. It is the organized community within the individual (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0894439311425978">Griffin, 2009</xref>). Social networking is about the “me” part, as it reveals the self embedded in a peer group, as known to and represented by others, rather than the private ‘I’ known best by oneself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0894439311425978">Livingstone, 2008</xref>). The public display of connections (with others) is a crucial component of SNSs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0894439311425978">Boyd &amp; Ellison, 2007</xref>). SNSs enable users to articulate and make visible their social networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0894439311425978">Boyd &amp; Ellison, 2007</xref>) and help young people construct socially approvable identities. In other words, it is expected that SNSs provide online users with an opportunity and ability to present and manage their public selves, especially for those who are keenly aware of their public images online. Thus, we develop the following hypothesis:<list list-type="simple">
<list-item>
<p>
<italic>Hypothesis 1</italic>: Online public self-consciousness is positively related to perceived ability to modify self-presentation on Facebook.</p>

</sec>
<sec id="section8-0894439311425978">
<title>Institution-based trust in Internet</title>
<p>Institution-based trust in Internet refers to Internet users' belief that the Internet environment possesses the necessary structures (e.g., legal protections, technological safeguards) to assure its safety, security, and trustworthiness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0894439311425978">McKnight, Choudhury, &amp; Kacmar, 2002</xref>). Among Facebook users, their level of trust in Internet as a safe, secure, and trustworthy institution may vary. It is expected that the more a Facebook user trusts the Internet (i.e., the Internet environment), the more he or she will trust Internet applications like Facebook, and the more they will feel capable of managing their private information on Facebook. So we hypothesize:<list list-type="simple">
<list-item>
<p>
<italic>Hypothesis 2</italic>: Institution-based trust in Internet is positively related to perceived ability to modify self-presentation on Facebook.</p>
</list-item>

</sec>
<sec id="section9-0894439311425978">
<title>Online self-efficacy</title>
<p>If one’s institution-based trust in Internet may be one determinant of perceived ability to modify SNS self-presentation, then online self-efficacy (one’s perceived ability to use and manage the Internet technologies) can be another. Conceptually similar to perceived ease of use of Internet, Internet self-efficacy is about one’s confidence in operating the computer hardware and mediated web software, which includes SNSs like Facebook. Internet self-efficacy has a positive effect on attitudes toward SNSs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0894439311425978">Gangadharbatla, 2008</xref>). Thus, we hypothesize:<list list-type="simple">

<title>Need to belong</title>
<p>SNSs provide affordances that allow users to create and maintain a network of heterogeneous connections—a significant component of bridging social capital (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0894439311425978">Steinfield et al., 2009</xref>). SNSs are “networked publics” that support sociability, the same way as unmediated public spaces do (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0894439311425978">Boyd, 2008</xref>). People need social stimulation to develop their public self-concept and self-consciousness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0894439311425978">Griffin, 2009</xref>). It is anticipated that a higher need to belong will lead to a higher public self-consciousness. Hence the hypothesis:<list list-type="simple">

<title>Disposition to trust</title>
<p>Within the nomological framework of 3M Model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0894439311425978">Mowen, 2000</xref>), we expect that one’s innate disposition to trust interpersonally, as a cross-situational and abstract compound trait, would have an impact on one’s overall trust in Internet, a concrete situational trait that acts as the enduring disposition to behave within the general situational context of Internet. Thus we hypothesize:<list list-type="simple">
<list-item>
<p>
<italic>Hypothesis 5</italic>: Dispositional trust is positively related to institution-based trust in Internet.</p>
</list-item>
</list>
</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-0894439311425978">
<title>Self-efficacy</title>
<p>As one of the original compound traits outlined by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0894439311425978">Mowen (2000)</xref> in his 3M Model, self-efficacy is defined as an optimistic belief about one’s own abilities and a feeling of competence and effectiveness with regard to completing a certain task (Bandura,1997). Internet self-efficacy is a situational trait, as it is a type of self-efficacy in the general situational context of Internet and is about one’s perceived ability to perform on the Internet. These two concepts are expected to be related to each other within the hierarchical structure of the 3M framework. So we hypothesize the following:<list list-type="simple">

<title>Agreeableness</title>
<p>People high in agreeableness consider themselves kind, sympathetic, and tenderhearted. We expect that those who are higher in agreeableness would have a higher need to get along with others.

<title>Conscientiousness</title>
<p>Conscientiousness represents a need to maintain order, precision, and accuracy in completing tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0894439311425978">Mowen, 2000</xref>). It reflects the degree to which an individual</p>

Conscientiousness is positively related to self-efficacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0894439311425978">Mowen, 2000</xref>). For SNS users, we expect that those with higher conscientiousness would have a higher sense of control over their SNS self-presentations.

They found that extroverted members tended to present themselves in a less restrained manner as they chose less conservative pictures of themselves. Compared to introverted users, extroverted users engage in more elaborate online self-presentations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0894439311425978">Marcus, Machilek, &amp; Schütz, 2006</xref>). On the other hand, extroverted people tend to be more likely to focus on the outside world, to be socially outgoing, and more careless and quick to change views. Extroversion is expected to lead to a higher disposition to trust (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0894439311425978">Tan &amp; Sutherland, 2004</xref>). As introversion and extroversion lie on the same introversion–extroversion dimension, we hypothesize the following:<list list-type="simple">

<title>Sample and Procedure</title>
<p>The data for this study were collected from a convenience sample of 254 college students from northern New England and Southern California. Students got extra course credits for participating in this online survey through surveymonkey.com. Participants were asked to complete questions on one survey page before they were able to move on to the next. They needed to reach the very last page to enter their ID information to earn extra credits. The average age for our participants was 22, with a range of 18–44 and standard deviation of 2.89; 88% of the respondents were 25 years old or below and 73% were female; 57.1% were Caucasian Americans, with 11.8% Asian Americans and 9.8% Hispanic Americans and 0.4% Native Americans. Our sample of college students can be justified as SNS users fit the demographics of college students aged 18 to 30 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0894439311425978">Gangadharbatla, 2008</xref>)</p>

<title>Measures, Reliability, and Validity</title>
<p>All the items used for the study were taken from established scales or adapted from existing scales to the online and/or SNS context. The three elemental traits and one of compound traits (self-efficacy) were taken from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0894439311425978">Mowen (2000)</xref>. Each of the above four scales was measured on a 9-point scale, anchored by 1 (<italic>never</italic>) and 9 (<italic>always</italic>). The need to belong scale was taken from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0894439311425978">Leary, Kelly, Cottrell, and Schreindorfer (2005)</xref>. The scale for online public self-consciousness was adapted from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0894439311425978">Fenigstein, Scheier, and Buss (1975)</xref>. Both the scale for disposition to trust and the scale for institution-based trust in Internet were taken from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0894439311425978">McKnight, Choudhury, and Kacmar (2002)</xref>. The scale for online self-efficacy was taken from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0894439311425978">Eastin and LaRose (2000)</xref>. The scale for ability to modify self-presentation on Facebook was adapted from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0894439311425978">Lennox and Wolfe (1984)</xref>. Finally, we borrowed the Facebook intensity scale from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0894439311425978">Ellison et al. (2007)</xref>. For almost each of the above seven scales, we identified and retained 4 items with the highest factor loadings (except for Internet self-efficacy with 5 items). For both conceptual and pragmatic reasons, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0894439311425978">Mowen and Voss (2008)</xref> suggested that short scales with four to eight items be used in a 3M Model. All the above seven scales were measured on a 7-point scale (1 = <italic>strongly disagree</italic> and 7 = <italic>strongly agree</italic>), except for the online public self-consciousness scale, which was measured on a 5-point scale (1 = <italic>strongly disagree</italic> and 5 = <italic>strongly agree</italic>).

<p>Before a structural model was run with Amos 4, we developed two measurement models via confirmatory factor analyses. Theoretically related constructs were grouped together to ensure acceptable estimate-to-observation ratios (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0894439311425978">Bentler &amp; Chou, 1987</xref>). The first model (Model 1) includes agreeableness, conscientiousness, introversion, need to belong, disposition to trust, and self-efficacy. The second model covers online public self-consciousness, institution-based trust in Internet, Internet self-efficacy, perceived ability to modify self-presentation on Facebook and Facebook intensity. The fit indices for both models were acceptable (Model 1: χ<sup>2</sup> = 410.00, degrees of freedom = 194, Tucker-Lewis Index [TLI] =.93, Comparative Fit Index [CFI] =.94, root mean square error of approximation [RMESA] = .07; Model 2: χ<sup>2</sup> = 374.85, degrees of freedom= 179, TLI =.94, CFI =.95, RMESA = .07). To estimate each construct’s internal consistency, composite reliability (CR) and average variance extracted (AVE) were calculated for each construct. The results found each CR greater than 0.7, and each AVE greater than 0.5, providing good support for each construct’s internal consistency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0894439311425978">Hair, Anderson, Tatham, &amp; Black, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0894439311425978">Tables 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0894439311425978">2</xref>). Convergent validity for each construct was also demonstrated, as all relevant items loaded significantly on their respective constructs (<italic>p</italic> &lt;.01; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0894439311425978">Tables 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0894439311425978">2</xref>). In support of the discriminant validity of each construct, the square root of the AVE for each construct was compared to and found to exceed every correlation coefficient for each possible pair of latent constructs (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0894439311425978">Tables 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0894439311425978">4</xref> ).

Next, we ran an alternative model, a full mediation model in which paths were created from elemental traits to compound traits, from compound traits to situational traits, and from situational traits to surface trait. The fit statistics for the model were acceptable (χ<sup>2</sup> = 1423.88, degrees of freedom = 846, TLI =.92, CFI =.92, RMESA = .06). A chi-square difference test revealed that the partial mediation model (the initial model) provided a relatively better fit than the full mediation model (χ<sup>2</sup> difference = 6.71, degree of difference = 3, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .10). In addition, the original model explained 16% of the variance in perceived ability to modify self-presentation, while the alternative model explained 13% of the variance.

<title>Discussion and Implications</title>
<p>Despite the perceived impact of SNSs, there is a lack of understanding of the motivations behind the social network usage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0894439311425978">Boyd &amp; Ellison, 2007</xref>). Research on the psychological process of using social media is still in its infancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0894439311425978">Kwon &amp; Wen, 2010</xref>). While research on Facebook is starting to emerge, a focus on the motives for using Facebook is not yet well documented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0894439311425978">Zywica &amp; Danowski, 2008</xref>). This study is an attempt to fill in the void by exploring the hierarchical trait predictors of Facebook self-presentation.</p>
<p>The study identified several hierarchical routes to Facebook self-presentation, such as from agreeableness to need to belong, to online public self-consciousness and then to Facebook self-presentation; from extrovertedness (or agreeableness) to disposition to trust, to institution-based trust in Internet, and then to Facebook self-presentation; or from conscientiousness to self-efficacy, to Internet self-efficacy and then to Facebook self-presentation. These routes suggested that one’s perceived ability to modify Facebook self-presentation can be driven by three motivating forces (compound traits): the need to socialize with others (i.e., need to belong), the trusting intention of others (i.e., disposition to trust), and the perceived self-control (i.e., self-efficacy). In other words, these three factors affect Facebook self-presentation through the following situational traits that are more specific to the online context: public self-consciousness online, institution-based trust in Internet, and Internet self-efficacy. Also in our model, the three elemental traits (agreeableness, extrovertedness, and conscientiousness) served as the underlying psychological antecedents of the traits at lower levels, such as conscientiousness for self-efficacy, and agreeableness for disposition to trust and perceived ability to modify Facebook presentation.</p>
<p>Introversion was not found to have a significantly negative relationship with perceived ability to modify self-presentation. This finding seems to suggest that the relationship can go both ways. On one hand, some introverted individuals may be just as unwilling to manage their public identity online as they do in the offline context. On the other hand, some shy persons may be more attracted to the social relationships mediated through SNSs, as these relationships demand less social stress associated with face-to-face interactions. Emboldened by the Internet technologies, those who are introverted may feel less inhibited about self disclosure in the online environment. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0894439311425978">Marcus, Machilek, and Schütz (2006)</xref> found average website owner slightly less extroverted. It is possible that both extroverted and introverted try to make strategic self-presentations online—for different reasons. Those who are extroverted may try to enhance their popularity, while those introverted users may want to look popular on SNSs. Conscientiousness was also not significantly related to perceived ability to modify Facebook self-presentation. Instead, the trait’s most immediate situational counterpart, Internet self-efficacy, was found to be related to this perceived ability. Overall, our results showed that more specific or concrete personality traits were better predictors of Facebook self-presentation than more basic or abstract personality traits. For example, Facebook self-presentation was directly influenced by three compound traits (public self-consciousness online, institution-based trust in Internet, and Internet self-efficacy) and only one elemental trait (agreeableness).</p>
<p>This article contributes to the literature in two significant ways. First, it demonstrated through a hierarchical trait model, that the more concrete a personality trait is (e.g., Internet self-efficacy as opposed to self-efficacy), the better it can help explain Facebook self-presentation. Second, it provided empirical evidence to support that a multiple-level personality perspective is valid in understanding of the use of SNSs.</p>
<sec id="section25-0894439311425978">
<title>Future Research and Limitations</title>
<p>Unlike previous studies that adopt a more abstract personality approach to studying self-presentation online (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0894439311425978">Krämer &amp; Winter, 2008</xref>), the 3M hierarchical model we adopted allows for a concurrent measurement of both abstract and concrete measures of personality traits in the Facebook context (e.g., self-presentation on Facebook and Facebook intensity). While our personality model only accounted for 16% of the variance in perceived ability to modify self-presentation, it offers a starting point for future research to explore other necessary elements in the model, such as narcissism, as the trait predicted more self-promoting content in several aspects of the social networking webpages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0894439311425978">Buffardi &amp; Campbell, 2008</xref>). As this is a study of personality traits (which are assumed to stay relatively invariant throughout one’s life time), future research can test whether our results can be replicated among SNS users of other age categories, for example, those middle aged ones (in their 40 s and 50 s) who represent a fast growing group of SNS users.</p>
<p>Besides personality factors, social influences can also affect SNS self-presentation. Past research found that students were more likely to have a private profile if their friends and roommates had them, and that women were more likely to have private profiles than were men (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0894439311425978">Lewis, Kaufman, &amp; Christakis, 2008</xref>). The membership of certain online communities mirrors people’s social networks in their everyday lives. Online actions and interactions cannot be seen as independent of existing offline identities. Rather, constraints on one’s everyday life are reflected in online behavior, thereby limiting the extent to which students from different backgrounds may interact with students not like themselves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0894439311425978">Hargittai, 2007</xref>). Life changes can be another factor determining why participants change their Facebook profiles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0894439311425978">Zywica &amp; Danowski, 2008</xref>). Future research may also look at social factors that affect perceived ability to modify self-presentation over SNSs.</p>
<p>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0894439311425978">Pempek, Yermolayeva, and Calvert (2009)</xref> found considerable lurking or observing, rather than considerable interactive experiences on Facebook. How this passive or even voyeuristic behavior is affected by personality traits and how this behavior affects young adults' development of their social self is another interesting topic that deserves further investigation. While SNS might not increase the number of strong ties that people have, the SNS technology supports the formation and maintenance of weak ties, increasing the bridging social capital of its users (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0894439311425978">Donath &amp; Boyd, 2004</xref>). Future research can also investigate the effect of the bridging social capital formed over SNS on the self-presentation and development of public identity among young people. It will be interesting to find out how the enlarged community of others (as the looking glass self) over SNS helps contribute to the self-presentation and identity development of the young generation who grows up in the Facebook age.</p>
<p>One limitation of this study is that our investigation of SNS self-presentation is restricted to the Facebook context. Previous research indicated that the use of Facebook is qualitatively different from that of MySpace, and these uses in turn are different from the uses of other sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0894439311425978">Hargittai, 2007</xref>). Facebook is somewhat different from other SNSs as it demonstrates an offline-to-online trend (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0894439311425978">Ross et al., 2009</xref>). How our findings can be generalized to other SNSs is a question that needs future investigation. Future research can also look at a more concrete outcome measure than Facebook intensity, such as a measure of frequency and nature of Facebook use. Finally, as this is a fully correlation study that tests hypotheses through hierarchical modeling, readers should use caution in interpreting the effects from one trait to the other.</p>
<p>In conclusion, this study adopted Mowen’s 3M Model as a hierarchical framework and tested the hierarchical trait predictors and consequence of perceived ability to modify self-presentation on Facebook. The 3M Model provided a nomological motivational-personality framework on how various constructs interrelate to explain Facebook self-presentation and use. Our results indicated that Facebook presentation is a function of group orientation, trusting intentions and self-control. The findings contribute to the literature of motivations behind SNS use and carry implications for future researchers in this emerging line of research.</p>
