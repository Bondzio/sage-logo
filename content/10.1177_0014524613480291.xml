<title>The centurion’s servant’s brother’s tale</title>
<p>We were only eleven when the slave traders abducted us. Came and snatched us as we were playing in the fields, back home in Ethiopia. My twin brother and me, like as two peas in a pod we were; even our parents sometimes got us muddled up. The slave traders were delighted with us; black slaves were highly valued in the slave markets of the Roman world. Something of a status symbol, you see, out of the ordinary, and especially us Ethiopians, with our jet-black skin; we would grow up tall and handsome and very strong, with a reputation for obedience and loyalty. And to have bagged the pair of us; like a perfectly matched pair of horses, we would command a premium when we were eventually auctioned off. So they looked after us well- we were valuable merchandise.</p>
<p>After changing hands several times, we were finally auctioned off in Alexandria, where an army officer called Marcus Cornelius Flaccus bought us for a high price. He was fascinated by the way we kept jabbering away to each other in our native tongue. “Right pair of little chatterboxes, aren’t you?” he said. “I think I’ll call you Loquax – the name means “chatterbox” - but as I can’t tell you apart, you can be Chatterbox One and you can be Chatterbox Two. And when I call your name, you both come running, right? And when I tell you to do something, you do it. Instantly. Understood?”</p>
<p>Well, for slaves, we had really struck lucky with Marcus Cornelius. He looked after us well, gave us enough to eat, saw that we were taught enough Greek to understand orders, only beat us sparingly when we had got something wrong. When his leave in Egypt was over, he took us back to where he was stationed in Galilee. Although this district was nominally under the jurisdiction of a puppet king called Herod, the Roman government found it politic to keep a small garrison there, just to keep an eye on things. And Cornelius was centurion in charge of this small force, unobtrusively stationed near an obscure little town called Capernaum.</p>
<p>He had really made himself at home there, become interested in the local religion, on visiting terms with the clergy and other Jewish dignitaries, even paid out of his own pocket for them to build a meeting place for their religious observances.</p>
<p>Our master the centurion was a generous man. And, in spite of the harsh duties he was sometimes called on to perform as a Roman officer, he was a kind man. And he was a man entirely without regard for the barriers that many put up to shut out their fellow human beings; barriers of race or class or skin colour. He was good friends with Jews and Greeks and Romans, and especially a good friend to us, his Ethiopian slaves.</p>
<p>Because he soon came to see my brother and me not just as expensive merchandise that must be kept in tip-top condition, but almost as a father relates to his sons. He wasn’t married, you see, middle ranking Roman army officers didn’t marry- wives and families would only distract a man in authority and under authority.</p>
<p>So when my brother got that terrible fever, and looked like dying, our master’s distress wasn’t just because he was about to lose valuable property. It was almost like that of a father in danger of losing his son.</p>
<p>Of course, we had all heard of the preacher and wonder-worker Jesus. He had made Capernaum his base, and my brother and I had even seen him at a distance, as people crowded round him asking him to heal their sick friends and relations.</p>
<p>So when my master’s Jewish friends suggested that they should ask Jesus to come and do what he could for my brother, my master agreed at once, and sent me with them.</p>
<p>Well, what happened next you’ve just heard in your Gospel reading.</p>
<p>How the kindness and generosity of my master was just a mirror of the kindness and generosity of Jesus, who, after a full day’s preaching to his Jewish compatriots, set off at once to help an officer of the hated occupying force and his young black slave.</p>
<p>How Jesus was taken by surprise by my master’s faith, by his belief that this Jewish preacher could and would help a dying foreign slave. Being a man under authority himself, and one used to exercising his own authority over his soldiers and over his slaves (as my brother and I had felt on our backsides more than once), Cornelius realised that Jesus did not need to come to my brother’s bedside in order to heal him. That’s worth remembering, when you pray for someone. They don’t need to know Jesus or believe in him themselves. Jesus’ authority is absolute, his power without limits, and distance or lack of knowledge doesn’t affect that.</p>
<p>Jesus was impressed. This foreigner, he told his people, this Gentile, this Roman officer, has more faith than the lot of you.</p>
<p>You heard too of my dear master’s humility, how he had an instinctive awareness of the goodness and holiness of Jesus, and so felt himself to be unworthy to receive him under his roof. I mean, you might have thought that a wandering Jewish preacher would feel highly privileged to be invited to the house of the Roman officer in command of the local garrison. And yet here was the Roman officer feeling himself unworthy to receive such a guest.</p>
<p>I understand that you use my master’s words when you are about to receive the Lord Jesus in Holy Communion. “Lord, I am not worthy to receive you”, you say, don’t you, “but only say the word and my soul shall be healed.” And that is a good and appropriate thing to remind yourselves of. We are none of us worthy to receive him, but in his kindness and generosity he heals us and gives himself to us all the same, even if our souls are far away from him.</p>
<p>Authority and power, exercised with kindness, generosity, humility and faith. In these ways our master reflected the character of Jesus, even though at that stage he did not know him.</p>
<p>Well, a couple of years after this incident, our master received a new posting. A kind of promotion, I suppose it was. The new job was in the capital city, Jerusalem, and it was a far cry from the easy-going, almost comfortable, posting up in Galilee. There was a lot of rebelliousness and political unrest in the city, with various Jewish rabble rousers trying to stir up the people against Roman rule. There was plenty of work for the occupying forces, trying to keep the lid on it all. And keeping the lid on involved carrying out tasks very much against the taste of my good master Marcus Cornelius. Acts of cruelty, mass executions, were ordered, and the soldiers of the occupying force were required to carry them out.</p>
<p>Our master’s personal distaste for such cruelty didn’t come into it. He was a man under authority; he carried out orders from above, and saw to it that the soldiers under his command did the same.</p>
<p>And so it came about that he was called upon to oversee the execution of that same Jesus who had healed his slave, my brother. And when the torture was over, he stood beneath the Cross and said: “Surely this man was the son of a god.”</p>
<p>After the execution there were rumours about; that Jesus was still alive, that perhaps he hadn’t really died on the Cross.</p>
<p>“That can’t be!” said my master. “I am a man under authority, and so are my soldiers. We are professionals. I even ordered one of them to stab him in the side with his spear, and saw it happen with my own eyes. There can be no doubt that he was well and truly dead, though it fills me with dread to think that we have murdered the son of a god.”</p>
<p>A year or so later, Cornelius was posted to the city of Caesarea on the coast. And after one of Jesus’ followers, a former fisherman called Peter, had received an extraordinary vision, indicating to him that Gentiles as well as Jews could be received into the band of Jesus–followers, Cornelius was baptised, and we with him, as was the custom in those days. When his time came to retire from the army and settle down as a veteran and take a wife, his parting gift to us was our manumission. In a special ceremony we were released from slavery and became freedmen.</p>
<p>We settled in Jerusalem, earning our living as waiters at rich people’s banquets. A matching pair of skilled waiters was considered very prestigious, so there was plenty of demand for our services. And we joined the ever-growing group of Jesus-followers who met regularly for prayer and on the first day of every week for the breaking of bread.</p>
<p>Eventually we were chosen to accompany the Apostle Matthew on a missionary journey to the country of our birth, where we were instrumental in founding the most ancient church in the world.</p>
<p>But that’s another story.</p>
