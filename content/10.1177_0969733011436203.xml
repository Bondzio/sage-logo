<abstract>
<p>The aim of this study is to assess the knowledge, attitudes and experiences of Spanish nurses in relation to euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide. In an online questionnaire completed by 390 nurses from Andalusia, 59.1% adequately identified a euthanasia situation and 64.1% a situation involving physician-assisted suicide. Around 69% were aware that both practices were illegal in Spain, while 21.4% had received requests for euthanasia and a further 7.8% for assisted suicide. A total of 22.6% believed that cases of euthanasia had occurred in Spain and 11.4% believed the same for assisted suicide. There was greater support (70%) for legalisation of euthanasia than for assisted suicide (65%), combined with a greater predisposition towards carrying out euthanasia (54%), if it were to be legalised, than participating in assisted suicide (47.3%). Nurses in Andalusia should be offered more education about issues pertaining to the end of life, and extensive research into this area should be undertaken.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>As is happening in other countries, Spanish society is currently engaged in a process of debate and investigation regarding the nature and limits of end-of-life (EOL) decisions and the so-called right to die with dignity.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0969733011436203">1</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0969733011436203"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0969733011436203">3</xref>
</sup> Although the debate on the ways in which people can and should die is as old as humanity itself, it is clear that in technologically advanced societies, this debate has taken on a new dimension, one that was unimaginable just 10 years ago.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0969733011436203">4</xref>
</sup> For example, there is now open discussion on whether or not a ‘dignified death’ should be spoken of as a ‘right’, maybe even a third-generation human right. The debate is yet more intense, however, on the specific aspects of this presumed right.</p>
<p>There is unanimous support for the idea that one of these aspects should necessarily be the right to receive high-quality palliative care,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0969733011436203">5</xref>
</sup> and there also seems to be a certain amount of consensus – albeit not in every country – over the right to make advance directives or living wills.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0969733011436203">6</xref>
</sup> Another aspect that appears to have universal approval is the need to avoid ‘extraordinary’, ‘disproportionate’ or ‘futile’ treatments that simply prolong the suffering of those who are dying, that is, so-called therapeutic obstinacy or dysthanasia. As a result, today the four central and unshakeable tenets of a so-called dignified death are palliative care, refusal of treatment, advance directives and the limitation of treatment (withdrawal/withholding). There is an enormous amount of controversy, however, regarding another potential tenet: specifically, recognition of the access to freely choose the moment and form of one’s death and to demand the assistance and collaboration of others, particularly health-care professionals, in bringing this about. This is the debate over whether a ‘dignified death’ should include the possibility to request euthanasia or physician-assisted suicide (PAS).<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0969733011436203">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0969733011436203">8</xref>
</sup> ‘Euthanasia’ refers to the direct administration of a lethal agent to a patient by another party (a doctor) with a merciful intent after patients’ explicit informed request. ‘PAS’ refers to a patient’s wilful and intentional ending of his or her own life with the assistance of a physician. Both these concepts automatically spark off an impassioned debate over the hypothetical duty – above all, the duty of health-care professionals and systems – to recognise the aforementioned possibility and, of course, over the legal implications. There is also a great deal of concern over the adequate mechanisms for ensuring an adequate response to the specific nature and limitations of this option and thereby prevent abuse of it. Moreover, the debate also impacts on the internal coherence of the health-care professions, on the objectives that shape the activities of professionals in the sector and the ethical implications therein, including the possibility of exercising a conscientious objection. Naturally, some of the most active contributions to this debate stem from a religious standpoint; however, it has also cut straight to the heart of philosophical, anthropological, sociological, legal and political issues.</p>
<p>This polemic has been heightened in recent years due to the public debate over real cases in which specific patients – or their families – have asked health-care professionals, judges and politicians for ‘a right to die with dignity’ in a number of different ways. In the United States, the periodic emergence of such situations has been a constant since the 1970s.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0969733011436203">9</xref>
</sup> However, the current debate on the subject in Europe originated more recently, at the beginning of the 1990s, sparked by the legalisation of euthanasia in the Netherlands and later spreading throughout the continent.</p>
<p>Although in Spain the ethical and legal consideration of the various ways to ‘die with dignity’ can be traced back to the first years of the 20th century, in reality the issue did not enter into open public debate until the 1990s, as it did in the rest of the European countries.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0969733011436203">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0969733011436203">11</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Research on euthanasia and PAS has mainly concentrated on physicians,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0969733011436203">12</xref>
</sup> due to the nature of their roles and responsibilities; however, the specificity of nursing expertise and their experiences in providing EOL care means that nurses play a major role in caring for dying patients and dealing with requests to hasten death. While nurses can make a significant contribution to the quality of care by providing professional assistance and counselling for patients, families, physicians and fellow nurses, even in countries where PAS is penalised,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0969733011436203">13</xref>
</sup> and despite the involvement of the nursing profession at an international level in euthanasia,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0969733011436203">14</xref>
</sup> little is known about their attitudes, knowledge and experiences in this area.</p>
<p>A certain amount of empirical research has been conducted into nurses’ experiences of and attitudes towards euthanasia and PAS in countries such as the Netherlands<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0969733011436203">15</xref>
</sup> and Belgium,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0969733011436203">16</xref>
</sup> where euthanasia has been decriminalised under certain conditions of due care since 2002. Studies have also been conducted in the United States,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0969733011436203">17</xref>
</sup> where some states allow PAS under certain, legally regulated conditions, and in countries where no legislation on euthanasia or PAS exists, such as Croatia,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0969733011436203">18</xref>
</sup> Finland<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0969733011436203">19</xref>
</sup> and Poland.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0969733011436203">20</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>The empirical literature on the subject reveals a lack of consensus among nurses on euthanasia in general and their involvement in the process in particular.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0969733011436203">21</xref>
</sup> Their feelings are extremely complex and the descriptions given of personal conflict, moral uncertainty, frustration, fear, secrecy and guilt would seem to reflect a convoluted array of personal and professional values alongside a range of social, religious and legal considerations.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0969733011436203">22</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>In Spain, although some research has been conducted in relation to nurses in Andalusia and EOL decisions,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0969733011436203">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0969733011436203">24</xref>
</sup> no empirical studies have been made of nurses and euthanasia or PAS. None of the reviews of the literature<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0969733011436203">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0969733011436203">3</xref>
</sup> on these latter practices include studies involving nurses in Spain.</p>
<p>Further evidence of the importance being given in Spain to EOL-related issues is the passing into law of regulations on the care of terminally ill patients. Andalusia was the first to approve such regulations.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0969733011436203">25</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>The debate over euthanasia and PAS and the analysis of the role of nurses in issues related to EOL and the right to die continues worldwide.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0969733011436203">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0969733011436203">27</xref>
</sup> The current situation in Spain indicates the need of this study, in which the objectives are to explore the knowledge, opinions and experiences of nurses in Andalusia in relation to euthanasia and PAS.</p>

<title>Study design and participants</title>
<sec id="section3-0969733011436203">
<title>Design of the study</title>
<p>The design of this study is a descriptive, cross-sectional study conducted through the use of an online, self-completed questionnaire.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0969733011436203">
<title>Setting</title>
<p>The Andalusian health-care system.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0969733011436203">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>The participants of this study were nursing professionals who work at primary and specialist health-care centres in the Andalusian health-care system and belong to the various scientific associations: ‘Andalusian Association of Community Nursing’, ‘Association of Hospital Nurses in Andalucia’ and ‘Spanish Society of Emergency Nursing’.</p>
<p>No form of sampling was carried out in order to conduct this study; the results include all the professionals who agreed to complete the questionnaire and who met the study profile.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0969733011436203">
<title>Measurement</title>
<p>The results of this study correspond to the responses on euthanasia and PAS given in a broader questionnaire that contained a total of 35 questions. These questions were related to socio-demographic information such as age, gender, profession, province, field and level of care given, in addition to the knowledge, attitudes and experiences of nursing professionals with regard to EOL decisions. The questionnaire was completed online and consisted of questions with multiple-answer, Likert-type response scales ranging from values of 0 to 7. The design of the questionnaire and its approval via examination by a panel of experts (two psychologists, four physicians, four nurses and two social workers specialised in EOL issues), further examination by an independent body (five physicians and five nurses working with terminal patients) and a pretest with four nurses from palliative care, four in intensive care, four in primary care and three home care nurses, ensured that it was valid. Specifically, it included scenarios involving descriptions of both the aforementioned practices, to which participants had to respond. The questionnaire can be found in <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-0969733011436203">Appendix 1</xref>.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0969733011436203">
<title>Data collection</title>
<p>Once contact had been made with the nursing associations, the objectives of the study were explained and the collaboration of their members was requested. Each association forwarded the questionnaire and accompanying information to its members, thereby preventing at all times the research team from accessing confidential information regarding the association members, including e-mail addresses.</p>
<p>The accompanying information contained an explanation of the project and a link providing direct access to the questionnaire. The ‘Survey Monkey’ web-based tool for creating online surveys was used to create the questionnaire: this also guaranteed the confidentiality of the data obtained by maintaining it in a secure, private account.</p>
<p>Once the e-mail had been forwarded to the nurses, all they had to do to complete the questionnaire was to click on the link and they were taken directly to the questionnaire. The application used to create the questionnaire also guaranteed the anonymity of the data supplied.</p>
<p>The data were collected throughout May 2010; a total of three reminders were sent out, one every 2 weeks. The use of Survey Monkey to design the questionnaire made it possible to limit the number of questionnaires completed on each computer to one, as once the questionnaire was completed the computer’s IP address was blocked and it became impossible to complete another.</p>
<p>Once the time period allotted for completion of the questionnaires had ended, an additional short questionnaire was sent out to those who had not responded to the original questionnaire, asking them to give their reasons for not having done so.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0969733011436203">
<title>Data analysis</title>
<p>The SPSS 15.0 program was used to analyse the questionnaire results. A descriptive analysis was made by calculating the mean, standard deviation (SD), maximum and minimum values of the socio-demographic variables, along with the absolute and relative frequencies of the responses. The results were compared on the basis of gender and age range (under 45 years and 45 years and older), while Pearson’s chi-square or Fisher’s exact tests were used to determine whether the variables were related: if the significance level p exceeded a value of 0.05, there were no statistically significant differences between the variables in question.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0969733011436203">
<title>Ethical considerations</title>
<p>This study was evaluated and approved by the Research Committee of the Andalusian School of Public Health in Granada. All participants were informed of the study’s objectives. Their consent was sought to participate in the study, and guarantees were given of the confidentiality and anonymity of the data provided.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0969733011436203">
<title>Results</title>
<p>The total number of the Associations’ members was 1428. From them, 390 questionnaires were received, so the response rate was 27.3%. There were 123 men (31.9%) and 263 women (68.1%). The mean age was 46.18 years (SD, 7.6 years; range, 22–69 years). The sample was divided into two groups: the under 45 years (n = 144; 37.6%) and those aged 45 years and older (n = 239; 62.4%). The number of respondents working in the field of primary care totalled 227 (59.4%), while 120 (31.4%) worked in hospital care and 8 (2.1%) in both primary and specialised care. A total of 379 worked in the public sector (97.4%), 6 (1.5%) in the private sector and 2 (0.5%) in private hospitals that are affiliated to the public sector. A further 2 (0.5%) respondents stated that they worked in both the public and private sectors. The number who had cared for at least one terminal patient in the last year was 307 (78.7%), while 127 (32.6%) had cared for more than 10 terminal patients in the same period. Finally, 24 nurses (6.2%) had registered their own Advance Directive.</p>
<p>Once the deadline for collecting the questionnaire data had passed, an additional short questionnaire was sent to those who had not responded to the first one, asking them why they had not responded. In total, 63 nurses completed this second questionnaire: 17 (26.9%) were men and 45 (71.4%) were women. Of these 63 respondents, 19 (30.2%) said that they did not respond due to a lack of time, 5 (7.9%) said that they thought the questionnaire was too long and 3 (4.8%) said that they did not believe the data provided would have really been kept anonymous.</p>

In total, 59.1% (n = 230) respondents correctly identified euthanasia practices, while 68.5% (n = 267) were aware that euthanasia is a criminal offence in Spain. Awareness of the legal status of this practice was influenced by gender, with more male nurses (80.49%) aware that it was a criminal offence in Spain than female nurses (63.84%); p = 0.001. In total, 21.4% of respondents had received at least one request for euthanasia from a patient or their relatives; in gender terms, male nurses received more requests than women and the difference between the two figures is statistically significant: 31.3% compared to 16.2% with p = 0.001.</p>

<title>Results of the questionnaire</title>
<p>In general, the respondents’ levels of knowledge regarding euthanasia and PAS need to be improved. Although over half of the nurses correctly identified the intervention described in the case of the question as euthanasia or PAS, it should be noted that a high proportion (35%–40%) failed to do so. Nor was the legality or otherwise of such practices particularly well understood by nurses in Andalusia, with 30% of nurses unaware that euthanasia and PAS are criminal offences in Spain.</p>
<p>Data from other countries also indicates that not all nurses have an adequate knowledge of issues related to euthanasia or PAS. In Turkey, for example, a study conducted with 206 nurses revealed that just 54.85% were able to identify the practice of euthanasia and a mere 13.6% were able to identify the practice of PAS.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0969733011436203">28</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>More interesting were the opinions in relation to this practice. The opinion of the participant nurses is divided over the issue of helping patients to die (euthanasia and PAS). Half of the respondents believed that seriously ill patients should have the right to receive help from health-care professionals to end their life, if they had made repeated requests to that effect. Moreover, three out of four nurses would support the decriminalisation of euthanasia in Spain, while over half indicated their willingness to perform this practice if it were decriminalised. There was less support for decriminalisation of PAS, although over half of nurses in Andalusia said they would support it and almost 50% said they would perform it.</p>
<p>These opinions are very much at odds with the equivalent percentages for other countries. In Turkey, nearly two-thirds (65.3%) of the nurses questioned agreed that individuals should have the right to make decisions regarding their own death, and 52.9% said that euthanasia should be legalised.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0969733011436203">29</xref>
</sup> But only 15% of Turkish nurses would be willing to perform euthanasia. In the Netherlands, a study of 1509 nurses showed that less than half (45%) would be willing to serve on committees that reviewed cases of euthanasia and PAS.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0969733011436203">30</xref>
</sup> In countries such as Israel, a high degree of support for euthanasia was also found among critical-care nurses (50%–67%), with the exact degree of support dependent on whether the nurse had got to know the patient or, conversely, whether he or she had had a significant amount of contact with the patient in the intensive-care unit.<sup>

</sup> The greatest levels of support for euthanasia were found in countries such as Belgium, where it is already decriminalised. A survey of 3327 nurses revealed that 92% believed giving lethal doses of drugs to patients that had explicitly requested them was acceptable for terminally ill patients who were suffering extreme levels of uncontrollable pain or other distress.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0969733011436203">32</xref>
</sup> Andalusian nurses seem to situate themselves in a middle ground between the two extremes. While, as is the case in Turkey and Israel, the practice of euthanasia is illegal in Andalusia, nurses here appear to lean towards a position that is progressively more in favour of its practice, despite not reaching the levels of explicit support that it receives in countries such as Belgium. This may be an indication of a progressive change of opinion with regard to this subject within Spanish society at a general level, a change to which health-care professionals, including nurses, are not indifferent. It should be pointed out that a study conducted on the Spanish general public in 2009 revealed that 63.3% were completely in favour of decriminalising euthanasia.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0969733011436203">28</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Something similar might be said of the different attitude held by surveyed nurses regarding PAS, which receives less support than euthanasia. The same tendency has been observed in other European countries such as France.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0969733011436203">33</xref>
</sup> Furthermore, in the aforementioned study of the general public only 49.7% of the citizens were in favour of decriminalising PAS. However, the ultimate reasons as to why there is more support among certain groups in Spain for decriminalising euthanasia than there is for PAS have yet to be clarified. Opinions may be influenced by religious issues, or the fear of bringing about one’s own death, or the paternalistic context that, in spite of the current economic crisis, continues to characterise the Spanish health-care system. Undoubtedly, these are the questions that warrant future investigation.</p>
<p>However, our study not only allows us to identify aspects relating to the knowledge and attitudes of Andalusian nurses with regard to euthanasia and PAS but also their actual experiences in these areas. Receiving requests to help hasten a patient’s death are not uncommon experiences for health-care professionals.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0969733011436203">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0969733011436203">35</xref>
</sup> Although euthanasia and PAS are both illegal in Spain, a certain number of patients have nonetheless requested that nurses perform these practices. The results of this study show that approximately 20% of nurses admitted they had received at least one request for euthanasia on the part of a patient or their relatives, although the number of nurses who had received requests for PAS was much lower, not even reaching 8%. In countries such as Greece, the amount of requests of this type received by nurses was demonstrably lower. A prospective cross-sectional survey of 250 nurses revealed that just 3.6% of participants had received a direct request from a terminally ill cancer patient to end his or her life. Moreover, just 3.6% had received a direct request from a terminally ill cancer patient for drugs to be prescribed or given by a nurse or physician with the specific intention of hastening the patient’s death.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0969733011436203">36</xref>
</sup> In Turkey,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0969733011436203">29</xref>
</sup> requests for euthanasia have been studied within the context of different medical departments. The highest percentage (26.6%) of Turkish nurses who had received more than one request for euthanasia worked in intensive-care units, while the lowest percentage (7.9%) was for those working in paediatric departments.</p>
<p>The main difference in terms of gender is that male nurses received statistically both more euthanasia and more PAS requests than female nurses. The reasons that can explain these data are not yet known. In the future, it would be interesting to deeply study the requests of euthanasia and PAS from a gender perspective.</p>
<p>The differences between the experiences of the Andalusian nurses who participated in this study and the experience of other neighbouring countries once again might suggest that Spain is immersed in a slow process of cultural change with regard to euthanasia and assisted suicide, which also affects nursing. Thus, it is necessary to train nurses to confront these requests in a manner that is both ethically and legally correct.</p>
<p>Indeed, this process of cultural change is perhaps evident in the fact that one out of four nurses believes that euthanasia has been performed in Andalusia during the last 5 years, and that 11.4% believe the same for PAS. This might show that although such practices are illegal, they may not be performed as sporadically as may have been thought. However, while this study provides an initial glance at what may be happening in Andalusia, more in-depth research is required in order to reveal a more complete picture. The research should also address issues such as the way in which these practices are carried out and the personal and professional tension that requests for, and the practice of, hastening the death of patients may bring about in health-care professionals.</p>
<p>It should also be remembered that Spain is not an isolated case in this area. A study conducted of nurses in Istanbul revealed that over half of nurses (57.1%) believed that euthanasia has been performed in secret, despite the fact that it is illegal in Turkey. Other studies have included data obtained from professionals who admit to having performed euthanasia or PAS illegally.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0969733011436203">37</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Half of the nurses who completed our questionnaire (n = 195) were of the opinion that seriously ill patients who receive high-quality palliative care do not request help to die, while 35.6% (n = 110) disagreed with this statement. A survey of 589 nurses in Belgium working in the field of palliative care demonstrated that the majority believed that many requests for euthanasia stopped once the patient began to receive the benefits of high-quality palliative care.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0969733011436203">38</xref>
</sup> Although this issue remains unclear, it could well be the case that, as certain studies have indicated,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0969733011436203">39</xref>
</sup> a number of the patients who requested euthanasia did so as a result of inadequate pain control or insufficient psychological, social or spiritual care; therefore, once appropriate palliative care was guaranteed, these patients would have changed their minds. Of course, it would be unacceptable to perform euthanasia or PAS without having first offered the patient other options and palliative care of the highest quality; however, it should be remembered that acute, treatment-resistant symptoms and unbearable suffering that cannot be controlled, even through the use of excellent palliative care, are not uncommon experiences. Therefore, although they are naturally of vital importance, it would not appear as though palliative care is the answer to every EOL-related problem, nor would it seem that every patient who requests euthanasia or PAS does so as the result of a lack of adequate palliative care.<sup>

<title>Limitations of the study</title>
<p>Mention should be made of certain methodological limitations that arose when this study was being conducted. The questionnaire results may have been affected by certain conditions such as social-desirability bias, central tendencies or learning/proximity bias. To minimise their effects, an effort was made to word the questions as neutrally as possible and to make it clear from the outset that there were no correct or incorrect answers. The questionnaire was structured, and particular attention was paid to the design, order, comprehensibility and response categories of the questions, and it was also subjected to a content evaluation and a pilot study.</p>
<p>Although there are certain problems related to Internet-based questionnaires, the advantages of this method far outweigh the disadvantages. The process of completing questionnaires of this type is more interactive, more attractive and provides greater flexibility of response, in addition to more honest responses.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0969733011436203">41</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>It should also be noted that for reasons of anonymity and confidentiality, it was not possible to record the exact number of nurses that actually had access to the questionnaire. It is then necessary to take into account that maybe some of the nurses did not open the e-mail with the survey or did not receive the e-mail. The condition of confidentiality did not allow for comparison of the characteristics of the respondents and non-respondents; specifically, the profiles of the members of the scientific associations involved in the study were not provided. Nor did the methodology utilised allow for the extrapolation of the results out to the entire nursing profession. Nonetheless, responses were received from almost 400 nurses and comprise a most valuable source of information.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The high percentage of nurses who were unable to adequately identify a situation involving euthanasia or PAS indicates that nurses in Andalusia should be offered more in-depth education in the area of EOL, including associated terminology and the legal status of euthanasia and PAS in Spain. The differences in the opinions expressed by the nurses in relation to the concept of assisted dying highlight the necessity of continuing the debate, while the role of nurses in caring for patients means it is essential that their perspectives on EOL decisions be taken into consideration. The discoveries made in this investigation have provided greater insight into the knowledge, attitudes and experiences of nurses, while simultaneously demonstrating the need to conduct more extensive research into this area. Other methodologies may help to conduct further investigation into some of the results detailed in this study and to look deeper into a number of different issues, such as the role of nurses in the practices in question, the characteristics of requests to hasten death and the ways in which nurses manage these requests.</p>
