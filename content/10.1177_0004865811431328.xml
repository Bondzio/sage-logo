<abstract>
<p>This paper examines the critical issue of public confidence in sentencing, and presents findings from Phase I of an Australia-wide sentencing and public confidence project. Phase I comprised a nationally representative telephone survey of 6005 participants. The majority of respondents expressed high levels of punitiveness and were dissatisfied with sentences imposed by the courts. Despite this, many were strongly supportive of the use of alternatives to imprisonment for a range of offences. These nuanced views raise questions regarding the efficacy of gauging public opinion using opinion poll style questions; indeed the expected outcome from this first phase of the four phase sentencing and public confidence project. The following phases of this project, reported on elsewhere, examined the effects of various interventions on the robustness and nature of these views initially expressed in a standard ‘top of the head’ opinion poll.</p>

<body>
<p>A critical issue in criminology is public confidence and opinions about sentencing. Public opinion in this area matters for a number of reasons. The first reason is that many stages of the criminal justice process are reliant on the support and confidence of the public (e.g. see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0004865811431328">Roberts, 2007</xref>). The Prosecution are typically reliant on reports by victims and witnesses, and the court process itself requires co-operation from various participants including complainants, witnesses and jurors. A second reason is that public opinion can be influential in relation to actual sentencing decisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0004865811431328">Mackenzie, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0004865811431328">Gleeson, 2004</xref>). A third reason is that public opinion has emerged as a strong driver of sentencing policy in many jurisdictions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0004865811431328">Frost, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0004865811431328">Roberts, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0004865811431328">Wood, 2009</xref>). In fact, a number of countries have devised strategies to incorporate public opinion in sentencing policy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0004865811431328">Indermaur, 2008</xref>). In addition, research has indicated that attitudes relating to punishment and the criminal justice system have a strong bearing on the willingness of citizens to obey the law (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0004865811431328">Robinson and Darley, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0004865811431328">Tyler, 2006a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0004865811431328">2006b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0004865811431328">Tyler and Darley, 2000</xref>). Clearly then, public opinion has far reaching consequences for not only the criminal justice system but also for society as a whole.</p>
<p>This article examines public confidence in the courts and sentencing, as well as attitudes towards punishment and justice. There is a paucity of comprehensive research on public opinion in this area at a national level in Australia. A recent review of this Australian research is provided by Roberts, Spiranovic and Indermaur (2011) and thus only a brief summary is provided here. There have been a number of recent State-based surveys that have examined attitudes towards sentencing and punishment (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0004865811431328">Department of Justice Victoria, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0004865811431328">Jones and Weatherburn, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0004865811431328">Jones et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0004865811431328">Lovegrove, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0004865811431328">Warner et al., 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0004865811431328">2011</xref>). In contrast, the most comprehensive and up-to-date data at a national level is collected through the biennial Australian Survey of Social Attitudes (AuSSA) which was first conducted in 2003 and now includes a small but relevant section on attitudes towards the criminal justice system (e.g. see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0004865811431328">Indermaur and Roberts, 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0004865811431328">2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0004865811431328">Roberts and Indermaur, 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0004865811431328">2009</xref>).</p>
<p>However, there are some methodological issues that limit the reliability and validity of AuSSA’s findings concerning the views of the Australian public regarding sentencing and punishment. One overarching issue is the low response rates that have been obtained for AuSSA (ranging from 39% to 42% for the three different versions of the 2007 survey; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0004865811431328">Roberts and Indermaur, 2009</xref>), which clearly limits the extent to which the results may be generalised to the Australian population as a whole. In addition, a relatively small number of items have been used to assess attitudes towards crime and justice, and these items are only included in two of the three versions of the 2007 AuSSA, which limits the sample size for these items. The items that have been included do not specifically assess the critical issue of confidence in sentencing but rather focus on confidence in the courts with respect to upholding victim and defendant rights, as well as timeliness and fairness of court procedures. Furthermore, single generalised statements were used to assess attitudes towards punishment; these statements do not take into consideration different types of offences nor do they provide respondents with information regarding different options and choices. Clearly then, further research employing an improved methodology is desirable to reliably and comprehensively explore public confidence in sentencing and attitudes towards punishment.</p>
<sec id="sec1-0004865811431328"><title>The present study</title>
<p>This paper reports on findings from an Australia-wide sentencing and public confidence project, which, in its entirety will generate much needed quantitative as well as qualitative data on the critical issue of public confidence in sentencing through a multi-phased research design. The objectives of this project as a whole were as follows:
<list id="list1-0004865811431328" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>To comprehensively measure the levels of public confidence in the way in which judges and magistrates sentence offenders in Australian courts;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>To analyse the socio-demographic, cultural, cognitive and attitudinal predictors (e.g. knowledge and beliefs about crime and sentencing, fear of crime) relevant to ‘public confidence’;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>To assess the malleability of confidence levels as a measure of likely public tolerance and support for the development of reform initiatives;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>To analyse and examine the stability of punitive attitudes over time; and</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>To apply small group methodology to assess ways in which public opinion can be ascertained in a form that can be utilised to inform sentencing practice.</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>As outlined in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0004865811431328">Figure 1</xref>, the sentencing and public confidence project consisted of four phases. Phase I involved a nationally representative telephone survey of public perceptions of sentencing that was completed in April 2009. Phase I was followed by random allocation of participants indicating a willingness to participate further to either one of two interventions, or a control group. The interventions aimed to elicit well-considered judgments and decisions from the general public on the following important issues: purposes of sentencing, mandatory imprisonment, and alternatives to imprisonment. The interventions comprised either a further telephone survey (Phase II) or a small discussion group (‘People's Jury') (Phase III). Immediately following the interventions, respondents were presented with a questionnaire on the key dependent variables (i.e. confidence in sentencing, punitiveness, and acceptance of alternatives to imprisonment) measured in Phase I. A final follow-up telephone survey was completed in May 2010, approximately six months after the intervention phases, to compare the control group with the intervention groups and determine the durability of any changes in attitude measured during the intervention phases.
<fig id="fig1-0004865811431328" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Illustration of the four phases of the national research project ‘Sentencing and public confidence’.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0004865811431328-fig1.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>The focus of the present paper is on the Phase I survey. The Phase I survey utilised a broad range of items and was based on a large sample of Australians (N = 6005) from all States and Territories. This paper will specifically provide a comprehensive response to the following two broad research questions:
<list id="list2-0004865811431328" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>How confident is the Australian public in the courts and sentencing?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>What are the views of the Australian public towards sentencing and punishment?</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>As noted previously, national data on these two broad and important research questions is lacking. Most of the research in relation to public confidence and sentencing has been carried out in the United Kingdom, America and Canada (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0004865811431328">Roberts et al., 2003</xref>), and the findings of this project will serve as a vital comparison with these jurisdictions. In addition, through providing reliable baseline data for Australia, this research offers a useful platform for further investigation in Australia. In particular, future research on gauging public attitudes can build on these results in the quest to find improved ways of measuring informed public opinion. Furthermore, this baseline data will allow future studies to gauge the impact of strategies designed to improve public confidence in sentencing.</p>

<p>A stratified random sample of 6005 participants (400 from The Australian Capital Territory, 800 from each of Victoria,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0004865811431328">1</xref></sup> New South Wales, South Australia and Tasmania, 801 from Queensland, 802 from each of Western Australia and the Northern Territory) aged 18 years or older participated in this study. A sample size of 800 per jurisdiction (except ACT due to size) was selected to enable State/Territory estimates with an accuracy level of + or – 3 per cent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0004865811431328">ABS, 1999</xref>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0004865811431328">Table 1</xref> presents the key demographic characteristics of this sample as well as comparative data on the Australian population. The majority of the sample was female, with a mean age of 53 years and a mean of 13 years of education. The majority resided in metropolitan regions and self-identified as middle income.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0004865811431328">2</xref></sup> It is clear that the sample is comparable to the Australian population in terms of gender and education. However, this sample was ultimately comparatively older than the Australian population and those living in metropolitan regions are over-represented.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0004865811431328">3</xref></sup> To ensure representativeness of the findings, data were weighted by age, gender and State/Territory population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0004865811431328">ABS, 2008b</xref>) to produce national estimates.</p>

<p>There were a number of items measuring the key constructs of interest in the research. In relation to the first research question (confidence in the courts and sentencing), there were seven items measuring confidence in sentencing, and three items gauging perceptions of the extent to which the courts treat people in an egalitarian manner. In terms of the second research question (attitudes towards punishment), there were seven items specifically measuring punitive attitudes, five measuring willingness to accept alternatives to prison, three relating to the view that sentences imposed by the courts should reflect public opinion and five gauging views on leniency in sentencing.</p>

<sec id="sec5-0004865811431328" sec-type="methods"><title>Procedure</title>
<p>The sample was drawn from a random selection of Electronic White Pages (EWP) entries stratified by State and Territory. The interviews were conducted from December 2008 through to April 2009 using Computer Assisted Telephone Interviewing (CATI).

The majority of Australians appeared to have little confidence in the courts; on five of the seven items, the majority of ratings were negative. However, the level of confidence varied depending on which aspect of the courts was being examined. For instance, 59 per cent of respondents indicated that they were fairly/very confident in the courts and legal system generally (item 1.5). In contrast, only 25 per cent agreed with the proposition ‘… that judges are in touch with what ordinary people think’ (item 20). In addition, respondents provided mostly negative ratings in relation to sentencing decisions made by the courts (items 14, 21 and 22); but in contrast tended to agree (57%) ‘… that judges impose an appropriate sentence most of the time’ (item 15).

<sec id="sec7-0004865811431328" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title>
<p>As highlighted in the introduction, a critical issue is public confidence in sentencing and attitudes towards punishment, as public opinion in this area has far-reaching consequences for the criminal justice system and society as a whole. A notable shortcoming in the literature has been the paucity of comprehensive and national research on public confidence in sentencing and attitudes towards punishment in Australia. This research has addressed this gap by exploring public confidence in the courts and sentencing, as well as attitudes towards punishment based on findings from the Phase I survey of the Australia-wide sentencing and public confidence project.
<disp-quote>
<p>Research Question One: How confident is the Australian public in the courts and sentencing?</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>The present study has provided reliable estimates of the levels of confidence in the courts and sentencing in Australia. The views of the public in terms of confidence in the courts and sentencing were relatively nuanced as they varied considerably between items. The majority of respondents provided unfavourable ratings with regard to confidence in sentencing as it appeared they were dissatisfied with the appropriateness and effectiveness of punishments meted out by the courts. They also expressed doubts as to whether judges are in touch with the views of the general public.</p>
<p>With respect to views on the egalitarian nature of the courts, the majority of respondents agreed that the courts treat people with dignity and respect. However, respondents were close to equally divided with respect to whether the courts listen carefully to people and whether the courts were sensitive to the concerns of the average person.</p>
<p>Favourable views were obtained in terms of confidence in the courts and the legal system in general, and in the appropriateness of sentences imposed by judges most of the time. The qualifier terms such as ‘in general’ and ‘most of the time’ used in these latter items may have ameliorated the tendency of respondents to answer questions with violent and extreme examples in mind (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0004865811431328">Doob and Roberts, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0004865811431328">Indermaur, 1987</xref>).</p>
<p>It is problematic to compare levels of confidence across jurisdictions due to differences in the types of questions asked. There is a well-documented ‘evaporation effect’ in confidence across the different branches of the criminal justice system such that confidence levels are higher for the police than they are for the courts or the prison system (e.g. see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0004865811431328">Indermaur and Roberts, 2009</xref>: 2). The present study specifically examined confidence in sentencing and the courts’ capacity to treat people in an egalitarian fashion, whereas previous research in Canada has examined confidence in the justice system more broadly (e.g. see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0004865811431328">Roberts, 2007</xref>). The present findings cannot be directly compared with previous research in Australia either, as items from AuSSA have examined confidence with respect to victim and defendant rights as well as efficiency and fairness (e.g. see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0004865811431328">Indermaur and Roberts, 2009</xref>). Although inter-jurisdictional comparisons are inappropriate, it may reasonably be assumed that confidence levels in Australia are low on average given that the majority of Australians provided negative ratings in terms of confidence in sentencing.
<disp-quote>
<p>Research Question Two: What are the views of the Australian public towards punishment?</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Respondents demonstrated relatively high levels of punitiveness. In particular, two-thirds agreed that ‘People who break the law should be given stiffer sentences’. This same question was asked of respondents to the 2007 AuSSA and 71 per cent of respondents agreed with this statement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0004865811431328">Roberts and Indermaur, 2009</xref>). A third of respondents (36%) supported the use of the death penalty as the punishment for murder. This figure is comparable to the 43.5% obtained in the 2007 AuSSA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0004865811431328">Roberts and Indermaur, 2009</xref>). Roberts and Indermaur noted that support for the death penalty has declined in Australia since 1993. The present results suggest that this trend has continued.</p>
<p>Over half (59%) of the respondents in the present study were of the view that sentences in general were too lenient. However, the current survey also asked respondents for their views regarding leniency based on offence type given previous research has indicated that respondents are often thinking of a violent offence when stating that sentences are too lenient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0004865811431328">Doob and Roberts, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0004865811431328">Indermaur, 1987</xref>). In the present study, perceptions of leniency in sentencing were higher for violent crimes, compared with non-violent crimes. This is consistent with findings from other Australian studies. For instance, in the Tasmanian Jury Study 73 per cent of respondents were of the view that sentencing was too lenient for violent offences whereas 54 per cent held this view for drug offences and 54 per cent for property offences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0004865811431328">Warner et al., 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Many researchers have highlighted the key role that public opinion plays in the formulation of sentencing laws and practices (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0004865811431328">Frost, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0004865811431328">Roberts, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0004865811431328">Wood, 2009</xref>). Indeed in the present study, almost two-thirds (64%) of respondents agreed that judges should reflect public opinion when sentencing offenders. This question is taken from AuSSA surveys with similar results: in 2003 63 per cent of respondents agreed that judges should reflect public opinion when sentencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0004865811431328">Indermaur and Roberts, 2005</xref>), and in 2007, 58 per cent agreed to the slightly differently wording that ‘when sentencing criminals, judges should reflect the views of the public’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0004865811431328">Roberts and Indermaur, 2009</xref>). This finding lends credence to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0004865811431328">Tyler’s (2006a</xref>: 392) proposal that, ‘Widespread legitimacy will exist only when the perspectives of everyday members are enshrined in institutions and in the actions of authorities’. Some judges and magistrates would agree on the need to take into consideration the views of the public at sentencing or at least community expectations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0004865811431328">Gleeson, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0004865811431328">Mackenzie, 2005</xref>). Primarily however, public opinion has a more direct impact on sentencing policy and the legislature, rather than directly on the judicial process.</p>
<p>The key question is how we ought to gauge public opinion. As Chief Justice Murray Gleeson of the High Court of Australia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0004865811431328">Gleeson, 2004</xref>) has noted, it is unclear for instance what methodologies should be used to gauge public opinion, whose views should be taken on board, and whether uninformed opinions should be given as much weight as informed opinions. These are all highly contentious issues of debate in the public opinion field.</p>
<p>The present findings confirm that the Australian public lacks confidence in sentencing, is dissatisfied with the quantum of penalties and believes that harsher sentencing is needed. This is of substantial concern as confidence in the criminal justice system is essential to its effective functioning (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0004865811431328">Roberts, 2007</xref>). However, the present findings also suggest that public opinion is significantly nuanced. Alongside the expressed desire for harsher penalties, there was widespread support for the use of alternatives to imprisonment for young, mentally ill and non-violent offenders. Previous research (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0004865811431328">Doob, 2000</xref>) has shown that respondents are less punitive and appear to be open to alternatives to imprisonment when presented with a specified alternative.</p>
<p>It appears then that public opinion in this area is more diverse and complex than simple opinion polls would suggest. Through incorporating a greater variety of items to gauge public opinion, the present research has offered a more comprehensive picture than AuSSA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0004865811431328">Roberts and Indermaur, 2009</xref>) on the views of the Australian public towards sentencing and punishment. The public appeared to be relatively punitive when their views were measured using generalised statements such as those adopted in AuSSA. In contrast, the public appeared to be willing to support less punitive sentences when they were asked to consider alternatives to imprisonment. Inconsistencies in public opinion regarding criminal justice issues have been well documented and it has been argued that the methodology employed to gauge public opinion as well as the type and depth of information provided has a strong bearing on the results obtained (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0004865811431328">Allen, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0004865811431328">Casey and Mohr, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0004865811431328">De Kaiser et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0004865811431328">Hough and Roberts, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0004865811431328">Hutton, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>The nuanced opinions expressed by so many Australians in the present study highlights the problematic nature of gauging public opinion using top-of-the-head style opinion polls. Notable scholars in the field (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0004865811431328">Green, 2006</xref>) have discussed at length what is meant by ‘public opinion’ and whether it is wise to rely on public opinion per se as opposed to informed public judgment. It has been suggested that alternative methodologies are needed that tap into informed judgments as opposed to top-of-the-head opinions (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0004865811431328">Green, 2006</xref>). The latter phases of this national sentencing and public confidence project have explored the efficacy of alternative strategies for achieving precisely this distinction, and they will be the subject of additional papers to come. Nonetheless, baseline data on these top-of-the-head opinions provides an important starting point and the present research has made a significant contribution to the field by providing reliable national estimates of the views of the Australian public towards sentencing and punishment.</p>

<fn id="table-fn11-0004865811431328"><label>c</label><p>The conventional cut-off value for Cronbach’s alpha in the social sciences literature is 0.70. Thus, the Cronbach’s alpha of 64 for ‘Egalitarian courts’, 69 for ‘Fear of crime’ and 66 for ‘Acceptance of alternatives to prison’ would suggest these scales do not possess acceptable levels of internal consistency. However, the Cronbach’s alpha coefficient is positively influenced by the number of items in the scale even though scales with a small number of items will have a better average inter-item correlation than a larger scale with the same alpha value (e.g. see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0004865811431328">Cortina, 1993</xref>). The average inter-item correlations between the three items comprising ‘Fear of crime’ and ‘Egalitarian courts’ and the five items comprising ‘Acceptance of alternatives to prison’ are comparable to those obtained for the seven items comprising ‘Punitiveness’ and ‘Confidence in Sentencing’ which had a Cronbach’s alpha of 83 and 84 respectively. Therefore, ‘Egalitarian courts’, ‘Fear of crime’ and ‘Acceptance of alternatives to prison’ were retained for analysis as scales in this study.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot>
