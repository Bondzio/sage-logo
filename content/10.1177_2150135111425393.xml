<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Mechanical circulatory support is being increasingly used to provide circulatory support in children with severe cardiorespiratory failure unresponsive to conventional therapies. Mechanical circulatory support in these situations provides circulatory assistance for short duration in reversible illness such as acute fulminant myocarditis as “bridge to recovery” or for longer duration as a “bridge to cardiac transplantation” in those with irreversible diseases such as severe dilated cardiomyopathy. The most common form of mechanical circulatory support used worldwide is extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation can be deployed rapidly regardless of age, size, and cardiac anatomy and can provide short-term circulatory support until myocardial function improves.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-2150135111425393">1</xref></sup> In addition, the oxygenator in the ECMO circuit can provide gas exchange and respiratory support. Survival to hospital discharge for patients supported with ECMO varies by underlying cardiac disease (survival in acute myocarditis was 63% compared with 35% survival following the Fontan operation) and severity of illness prior to device deployment (survival when ECMO is used to support cardiopulmonary resuscitation was 37%).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-2150135111425393">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-2150135111425393"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-2150135111425393">3</xref></sup> The incidence of complications related to ECMO and mortality increase with increasing ECMO duration. Because organ availability for cardiac transplantation is unpredictable and wait times can extend well beyond the ordinary safe ECMO support duration, ECMO does not appear to be a suitable (although frequently used) form of support for patients receiving mechanical circulatory support with the intent of bridging to transplantation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-2150135111425393">4</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>Ventricular assist devices (VADs) can provide mechanical circulatory support for longer duration and are increasingly used to bridge children to cardiac transplantation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-2150135111425393">Figure 1</xref>
).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-2150135111425393">5</xref></sup> Adult VADs have been used to bridge adolescents and to cardiac transplantation for many years. However, pediatric VAD use in infants and children as a bridge to transplantation is recent (first pediatric Berlin Heart EXCOR implant was in the 1990s) but is becoming increasingly utilized.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-2150135111425393">6</xref></sup> Morales et al in a recent publication showed that the use of VADs to provide circulatory support in children has increased.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-2150135111425393">5</xref></sup> However, few VADs are available that cater specifically to wide age and size range of children, and many of the current devices used are those designed for use in adults. The growing recognition that VADs are useful forms of mechanical support in children as a bridge to transplantation and recovery has recently led to the consideration of development of pediatric-specific devices. In this review, we discuss current indications, perioperative management of VADs and current outcomes. For purposes of this article, we do not describe specific devices but broadly illustrate the clinical practice with VAD use in children.</p>

<title>Indications for Initiation of VAD Support in Children</title>
<p>The current indication of long-term mechanical circulatory support with VADs in children is to provide circulatory support until heart transplantation, that is, “bridge to transplantation.” Although less common, VADs are increasingly used to “bridge patients to recovery where the VAD can be explanted following myocardial recovery without need for cardiac transplantation. Ventricular assist devices have also been used to “bridge to decision,” where a patient presents with obvious need for circulatory support, but the patient’s neurological status, etiology of heart failure, and/or transplant candidacy are uncertain. Therefore, VAD support is provided until a better understanding of the therapeutic options available are established.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-2150135111425393">7</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>Current thresholds for initiation of VAD therapy in children are based on a pediatric VAD program’s experience and available devices. Thus, indications for VAD support vary widely between institutions. However, it is generally agreed that VAD implantation should be considered when children have failed conventional therapies for management of cardiac dysfunction and have impending end-organ dysfunction. These children often require some form of mechanical circulatory assistance to bridge them to recovery or transplantation. Successful bridging to transplantation using VAD requires that the VAD implantation occur prior to the onset of permanent end-organ dysfunction.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-2150135111425393">6</xref></sup> However, the field of pediatric VADs is still immature in its indications for VAD support as demonstrated by the pre-Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) Berlin EXCOR experience where over 50% of patients placed on a VAD were in critical cardiogenic shock with death expected in &lt;24 hours (INTERMACS Status 1).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-2150135111425393">8</xref></sup> In time, as available technology improves and clinical experience with VADs grows, early VAD implantation in children with severe cardiac dysfunction experiencing a deteriorating course may help improve their clinical outcomes. Contraindications for VAD implantation may include children with severe neurological injury, those with serious noncardiac malformations, and chromosomal abnormalities.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-2150135111425393">9</xref></sup> Placement and management of VADs in patients with prosthetic mechanical cardiac valves, pulmonary dysfunction, and those with single-ventricle congenital heart disease are challenging and may be associated with high risk of adverse events.</p>
<p>In some children, initiation of mechanical circulatory support with VAD may follow initial support with ECMO.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-2150135111425393">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-2150135111425393">8</xref></sup> Patients initially supported with ECMO and who require transition to a VAD for further mechanical circulatory assistance are patients who do not have adequate myocardial recovery and cannot be weaned off ECMO. These patients are those commonly supported with ECMO after congenital heart surgery or cardiopulmonary arrest. Rarely, patients previously listed for transplantation may deteriorate acutely requiring emergent institution of mechanical circulatory support and thus are placed initially on ECMO. In a recent report of VAD use and outcomes by Morales et al, 21% of 187 children supported with VADs had prior ECMO support.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-2150135111425393">5</xref></sup> In another report of VAD support with the Berlin Heart EXCOR device, Morales et al reported that 31% (22 of 73 patients) received VAD support after prior ECMO support.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-2150135111425393">8</xref></sup> The use of ECMO for mechanical circulatory support prior to VAD support was associated with increased odds of in-hospital mortality.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-2150135111425393">5</xref></sup> Thus, the use of ECMO as a bridge to a VAD remains a high-risk indication of VAD. Children in whom ECMO was initiated for cardiac failure after cardiac surgery and who required VAD support for continued cardiac dysfunction as a bridge to transplantation had especially poor survival outcomes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-2150135111425393">5</xref></sup> Patients supported with ECMO prior to VAD placement may have acquired end-organ injury, been exposed to multiple blood and blood product transfusions, and had ECMO complications (ie, stroke) making them high-risk candidates for VAD support. Consideration of VAD implantation in these patients requires careful assessment of candidacy for further mechanical circulatory support and transplantation. Furthermore, in candidates suitable for VAD after initial support with ECMO, timing of their transition to VAD from ECMO prior to the onset of permanent end-organ injury may be crucial in improving their outcomes. In patients initially supported with ECMO as “bridge to recovery” such as those on ECMO after surgery for congenital heart disease, if myocardial function does not return within 7 days after ECMO support, and if the patient remains a suitable candidate for cardiac transplantation, transition to VAD can be considered at this time.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-2150135111425393">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-2150135111425393">11</xref></sup> However, as pediatric mechanical circulatory support programs gain more experience and a better variety of devices, the percentage of patients requiring ECMO prior to VAD support may decrease as seen in the field of adult mechanical support.</p>

<sec id="section3-2150135111425393">
<title>Types of VADs</title>
<p>The currently used VADs in children can be classified into (<italic>a</italic>) centrifugal VADs: these devices are extracorporeal and create negative inlet pressure to draw blood by spinning and creating a vortex.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-2150135111425393">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-2150135111425393">12</xref></sup> Blood is ejected from the base of the device by the creation of centrifugal force. Examples of centrifugal VADs include the Jostra Rotaflow device and the Levotronix PediMag. Many centrifugal VADs, for example, Jostra Rotaflow device are used as pumps to configure ECMO circuits. (<italic>b</italic>) Pulsatile VADs: these devices are paracorporeal pneumatically driven membrane pumps. The blood is drawn into the device chamber through a unidirectional valve in the inflow limb by the creation of negative pressure (or passive flow) and returned to the circulation by positive displacement through another unidirectional valve in outflow limb. Examples of commonly used pulsatile VADs in children include the Berlin heart EXCOR VAD and the Thoratec PVAD. (<italic>c</italic>) Axial flow VADs: these are small implantable devices that use an impeller to provide continuous flow. Examples of axial flow devices include the Micromed Debakey VAD Child, the HeartWare VAD, and the Thoratec Heartmate II VAD. The Berlin heart Device and the Micromed Debakey device have Humanitarian Device Exemption (HDE) approval status from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Both the Berlin Heart EXCOR and the Thoratec PVAD are commonly used in children. Some centers have successfully used the implantable axial flow devices such as the Micromed Debakey and the Thoratec Heartmate II devices in preadolescents and adolescents, but the experience with these devices remains small and confined to a few centers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-2150135111425393">13</xref></sup>

<title>Perioperative Management of Children Supported With VAD</title>
<p>Ventricular assist devices can be used to support the right VAD (RVAD), left VAD (LVAD), or both biventricular VAD (BiVAD) ventricles. The choice of device, need for LVAD or BiVAD support, VAD size, and cannulation sites depends on patient size, anatomy, clinical situation, and institutional experience. Careful attention to maintaining preload (volume status) and afterload (maintaining low systemic and pulmonary vascular resistance), monitoring device function, hemostasis in the early postoperative period, careful anticoagulation management throughout the duration of VAD use, and early extubation from mechanical ventilation are issues that are crucial to obtaining successful outcomes in patients with VAD .<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-2150135111425393">12</xref></sup> Once the patient is extubated, mobilization and physical therapy, nutritional rehabilitation, careful surveillance and management of infection, and monitoring for neurological complications are essential. Based on institutional protocols and available resources, mobile patients on VAD can be managed on inpatient wards. Patient supported with certain VADs such as the Thoratec PVAD or HeartMate II VADs can be discharged home with careful follow-up while awaiting transplantation.</p>
<p>Anticoagulation management in children supported with VADs poses significant challenges because of age-based differences in the coagulation cascade.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-2150135111425393">9</xref></sup> Anticoagulation for VAD patients may vary based on device type and by institutional protocols. Intravenous heparin infusion is usually started after control of postoperative bleeding and titrated using activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) or unfractionated heparin levels (anti-Xa activity). Longer-term anticoagulation is started when a patient is stable and consists of low-molecular-weight heparin administered subcutaneously or warfarin administered orally, and the addition of antiplatelet agents such as aspirin or dipyridamole. Low-molecular-weight heparin levels, prothrombin time ([PT] and international normalized ratio [INR]), and tests of platelet function are used to titrate long-term anticoagulation therapy.</p>
<p>For patients supported with an LVAD, the preload to the device depends on the presence of an adequately functioning right ventricle and unobstructed blood flow through the pulmonary vascular bed. Right heart function can be monitored using the central venous pressure and right ventricular function by echocardiography. Occasionally, the right ventricle function requires support with inotropes and inhaled nitric oxide. In patients with cardiac dysfunction, early intervention with an LVAD may help preserve right heart function and placement of an RVAD can be avoided in the majority of patients. Some patients may recover enough ventricular function on VAD that they can be weaned and decannulated. Weaning protocols may vary based on the device used and preferences. Anticoagulation must be increased during the weaning phase because of the increased risk of thrombus formation at low flow rates. Bleeding during the early postoperative period and thromboembolic complications especially of the central nervous system are the most common complications in patients with VAD, and these issues should be carefully evaluated and managed. Successful management of children on VADs requires the collaborative effort from a variety of specialists including cardiologists, surgeons, intensive care specialists, anesthesiologists, hematologists, nursing, and allied health care professionals. The cost of hospitalization following VAD is high because of the need for considerable resources.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-2150135111425393">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-2150135111425393">14</xref></sup> However, costs may decrease in the future with increasing experience with VAD use in children. Psychosocial issues associated with stress of critical illness and long hospitalization following VAD implantation may require careful attention and management.</p>

<title>Outcomes for Children Supported With VAD</title>
<p>Blume et al reported on the use of VAD in 99 children (median age 13.3) as a bridge to transplantation during 1993 to 2003, using data from the Pediatric Heart Transplant Study (PHTS) database and showed successful survival to transplantation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-2150135111425393">15</xref></sup> of 77%. Cardiac diagnosis in this study group included cardiomyopathy in the majority of patients (79%) and a smaller number of children with congenital heart disease. Survival to cardiac transplantation for patients supported with VADs was similar to those listed for transplantation as United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) status 1 but did not require mechanical circulatory support. Risk factors for mortality while waiting for transplantation included a diagnosis of congenital heart disease, female gender, and earlier era of VAD implantation. Neurological complications (18 of 96 patients) and device-related infection (31 of 96 patients) were common complications in the cohort. Neurological complications were common in nonsurvivors (65%). A small number of patients in this group (n = 5, 5%) were weaned off VAD due to myocardial recovery. This report established a role of VADs in the bridging of children with decompensated heart failure to successful cardiac transplantation. However, it analyzes a time period in which there were no pediatric-specific VADs and represents a time when the vast majority of VADs were adult devices being placed in children.</p>
<p>Morales et al recently described the outcomes of younger children supported with the Berlin Heart EXCOR device during 2000 through 2007 in North America.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-2150135111425393">8</xref></sup> This analysis included 73 patients with a median age of 2.1 from 17 institutions. Diagnosis groups included dilated cardiomyopathy (58%), congenital heart disease (26%), and myocarditis (10%). Cardiogenic shock was present pre-VAD implantation in 52% and ECMO was used to bridge VAD in 30%. Mode of support included LVAD alone in 57% and BiVAD in 43%. Mortality was higher in children supported with BiVAD (35%) compared to those supported with LVAD alone (14%). Patient outcomes were similar to the earlier report with 70% of patients successfully supported to transplantation, while a smaller number of patients (7%) were bridged to recovery. Risk factors for mortality included younger age and need for BiVAD support. Although outcomes reported here are not significantly different from the report by Blume et al, the median age of children in this report is significantly lower and shows that VAD support can be successfully initiated in children of all ages with good outcomes. It is important to note that the safety profile of the Berlin Heart EXCOR specifically the neurological outcomes was not evaluated in this study and is expected to be addressed in the report of the currently completed EXCOR IDE trial.</p>
<p>Survival to transplantation reported by Morales et al is similar to a recent single European center report of the use of the Berlin Heart EXCOR device.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-2150135111425393">6</xref></sup> In this report, Hetzer et al report on 94 devices implanted in children during 1990 to 2009. They showed survival to transplantation or recovery was 60%. They evaluated their results based on two time periods 1990 to 2001 and 2002 to 2009 and showed that survival to transplantation or recovery was higher in the later time period. They concluded that superior results might be related to earlier implantation of VAD (lower mean serum creatinine and bilirubin levels in the later cohort), modification of their anticoagulation protocol, and use of fewer BiVAD in their later patient cohort. Thus, both reports discussed here confirm that substantial progress has been made in safely bridging children of all ages with VAD support to transplantation or recovery. Therefore, the use of VAD to support children requiring mechanical circulatory support as a bridge to transplantation is likely to grow in the future. However, many issues such as poor VAD outcomes for children with congenital disease, human leukocyte antigen (HLA) sensitization during VAD support, and issues related to safe anticoagulation practices are areas that require improvement in the future.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-2150135111425393">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-2150135111425393">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-2150135111425393">16</xref></sup>

<title>Ventricular Assist Device Support in Patients With Congenital Heart Disease</title>
<p>Congenital heart disease requiring VAD assistance as a bridge to transplantation has been shown to be associated with poor outcomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-2150135111425393">Figure 2</xref>
).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-2150135111425393">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-2150135111425393">15</xref></sup> The reason for decreased survival may be related to technical aspects of VAD implantation imposed by anatomy, prior surgery, and underlying physiology. Many patients with congenital heart disease are younger children and may be transitioned to VAD after several days of ECMO support for nonrecovery of ventricular function resulting in their decreased outcomes. Within this group of patients, those with single ventricle disease remain a significant challenge. Published information regarding outcomes of children with single ventricle disease is sparse.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-2150135111425393">17</xref></sup> VanderPluym et al recently compiled information from case reports of children with single ventricle disease supported with VAD as a bridge to transplantation and found that of nine patients (two systemic to pulmonary artery shunts, two bidirectional Glenn, and five Fontan circulations), six survived to transplantation, one was decannulated from VAD support, and two patients died during VAD support. The authors remark on significant challenges posed by anticoagulation issues in these patients. Given that patients with palliated single ventricle congenital heart disease are surviving longer and may be candidates for cardiac transplantation in the future, it is important that future research on VADs is focused on understanding challenges posed by these patients both from a device design and a clinical management point of view.</p>

<title>Future Directions for VAD in Children</title>
<p>The excellent outcomes of pediatric cardiac transplantation and the need for longer duration of mechanical circulatory support beyond the capabilities of ECMO to safely bridge children to transplantation, destination or recovery have been a major impetus for the development of new devices. Although older children have benefited from the availability of adult VADs, these devices cannot be used to support younger children safely (eg, &lt;12 years). Recognizing these issues, the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute has funded four proposals for new device development for children 2 to 25 kg of weight.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-2150135111425393">18</xref></sup> The Pumps for Kids, Infants and Neonates (PumpKIN) program has awarded contracts for the preclinical testing of devices for children with heart failure. Enrollment in the FDA IDE trial is ongoing and results are awaited.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-2150135111425393">8</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>The use of VADs to bridge patients to recovery is also becoming increasingly realized as recent reports have shown that mechanical unloading of the heart can reverse remodeling of failing hearts in children resulting in improvement both clinically and at a tissue level in the myocardium and demonstrate the potential of VAD therapy to delay or avoid the need for cardiac transplantation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-2150135111425393">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-2150135111425393">20</xref></sup> Thus mechanical unloading of the heart presents a prime opportunity to use novel therapies to induce myocardial recovery and the use of VADs as a “bridge to recovery” will continue to grow as an important indication for their use in the future. Similarly, with future advancements in VAD technology and clinical experience with managing VADs safely in children, it is possible that VADS may be used as “destination therapy,” where a VAD is implanted (usually an intracorporeal device) for permanent circulatory support.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-2150135111425393">7</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>In conclusion, the use of VADs for mechanical circulatory support in children is increasing with improving outcomes. Pediatric-specific devices that can support children of all ages, sizes, and anatomical variations are being developed for clinical use in the future.</p>
