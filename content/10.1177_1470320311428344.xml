<abstract>
<p>The interactions between the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) and angiotensin II (ANG II), and their direct effects in vitro on the enzymes involved in vascular extracellular matrix (ECM) degradation, were examined.</p>
<p>Rats were treated with guanethidine, losartan or the combined treatments. mRNA, protein and activity of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 and MMP-9 and mRNA of tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) and plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1) were quantified in abdominal aorta (AA) and femoral artery (FA). Norepinephrine (NE) or ANG II with adrenergic (β, α1 and α2) or losartan antagonists was tested for MMP mRNA response in cultured vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs).</p>
<p>Combined treatment enhances the inhibition of MMP-2 mRNA and protein level induced by simple treatment in AA. However MMP-9 in AA and MMP mRNA in FA were reduced in the same order by treatments. MMP activities were not affected by treatments. The t-PA/PAI-1 ratio, which reflects the fibrinolytic balance, remained higher after treatments. In cultured VSMCs, NE induced stimulation of MMP mRNA via α2 and β adrenergic receptors and MMP-2 activity via β adrenergic receptors, while ANG II-induced stimulation was abrogated by losartan.</p>
<p>Overall, there is a synergic inhibition of both systems on the level of MMP-2 in AA.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The extracellular matrix (ECM) is mostly composed of the vascular wall of collagen and elastin, which are maintained in a dynamic scaffold by the fine interplay between synthesis, organization and degradation of the components.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1470320311428344">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1470320311428344">2</xref></sup> Collagen and elastin are mostly regulated at the gene transcriptional level, while scaffolding will depend on the presence and activity of a set of proteins such as fibrillin and lysyl oxydase and degradation by specific proteases, the matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). MMPs constitute a tightly regulated family of zinc dependent endopeptidases that degrade most components of the ECM and basement membrane, and can also function in many other proteolytic processes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1470320311428344">3</xref></sup> Most MMPs are synthesized and secreted as inactive proenzymes, and to be functional in tissue they require proteolytic activation by enzymes such as plasmin,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1470320311428344">4</xref></sup> which itself is activated by tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA). Thus, t-PA is involved in the activation of ECM degradation but also in the activation of fibrinolysis, preventing thrombosis and myocardial infarction.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1470320311428344">5</xref></sup> However, t-PA activity is inhibited by the plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1470320311428344">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1470320311428344">7</xref></sup> The activity of MMPs is then further regulated by the tissue inhibitors of MMPs (TIMP).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1470320311428344">8</xref></sup> Among the members of the MMP family, MMP-2 and MMP-9 have gained attention because they are expressed in heart and vessels and contribute to the degradation of several types of ECM components such as elastin and collagen, and their enzymatic activities are regulated during vascular remodeling.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1470320311428344">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1470320311428344">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>There are many intervening factors for controlling the ECM composition and turnover; among them are the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system (RAAS) and the sympathetic nervous system (SNS).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1470320311428344">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1470320311428344">11</xref></sup> The role of angiotensin II (ANG II) in ECM degradation has been investigated in depth in heart and blood vessels, especially in pathological conditions or in cultured vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). Most studies have shown a stimulatory effect of ANG II on MMPs, which is abrogated by AT1 receptor (AT1R) blockade.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1470320311428344">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1470320311428344">13</xref></sup> However, little is known about the influence of SNS on MMP. Also, SNS and ANG II may interact with each other, as evidenced by functional studies. ANG II may stimulate release of norepinephrine (NE) from the perivascular SNS by activation of presynaptic AT1R, while blockage of this receptor lowers NE release and enhances its uptake by SNS terminal axons.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1470320311428344">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1470320311428344">16</xref></sup> Little is known about the interactions between the two systems on MMPs in the vascular bed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1470320311428344">17</xref></sup></p>
<p>The aim of this study was to clarify the interactions of the SNS and AT1R mediated ANG II effects on MMPs and on their activator t-PA in the rat vasculature, centered on VSMCs. For this purpose, blocking of SNS and AT1R was performed alone or in combination to determine the respective contributions of SNS and ANG II to the ECM degradation in the rat vessels, and primary VSMCs were used to identify the direct effects and the receptors involved independently of systemic factors.</p>

<title>Animals</title>
<p>The animal protocols used for this study were approved by the University Animal Care and Use Committee of University of Claude Bernard, Lyon 1, France and were in accordance with the National Institutes of Health Guidelines for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals.</p>
<p>Male Wistar–Kyoto rats (<italic>n</italic> = 32) were divided equally into four groups: a guanethidine treated group (GUA), a losartan treated group (LOS), a double treated group (GUA+LOS) and a control group (CTRL). Rats were treated as previously described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1470320311428344">18</xref></sup> with guanethidine sulfate (50 mg/kg i.p., 5 days/week for 5 weeks) (Sigma). Losartan (20 mg/kg/day) was administered in drinking water for 5 weeks. The double treated group received guanethidine and losartan as described above for 5 weeks. The CTRL group received injections of saline for the same time period.</p>
<p>At the end of treatment, rats were deeply anesthetized with pentobarbital (50 mg/kg i.p.); abdominal aorta (AA) and femoral artery (FA) were removed and then frozen immediately in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80°C.</p>

<title>Blood pressure measurement</title>
<p>Systolic blood pressure (SBP) was measured weekly during the 5 weeks of treatment via a tail-cuff method.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1470320311428344">19</xref></sup></p>

<title>Cell culture</title>
<p>VSMCs were obtained from aorta samples (<italic>n</italic> = 6) with the explant technique. Briefly, a strip of aorta, carefully dissected with the adventitia removed, was cut into small fragments which were placed in 25 cm<sup>2</sup> culture dishes in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Medium (DMEM) culture medium supplemented with fetal calf serum 10% (Promocell), glutamine 4.5 mM and antibiotic (streptomycin 0.1g/l and penicillin 100 U/ml), maintained at 37°C and 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. Experiments were performed on cells from passages 2 to 4. The identity of VSMCs was verified with anti-α-smooth muscle actin (DAKO) immunostaining as described elsewhere.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1470320311428344">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1470320311428344">21</xref></sup> For the experiments, 10<sup>6</sup> cells were seeded in 12-well plates in their usual medium for at least 1 day. Twenty-four hours before the experiments, culture medium was changed to a basal VSMCs medium without fetal calf serum. On the day of the experiments, culture medium was replaced and the test substances were added at appropriate concentrations. Cells were stimulated for 24 h with either NE or ANG II. For NE stimulation, three increasing doses of NE (Fluka), 10, 100 and 1000 nM, were tested in the absence or presence of 50 µM propranolol (an antagonist of β adrenergic receptor), 100 nM prazosin (an antagonist of α1 adrenergic receptor) or 10 µM yohimbine (an antagonist of α2 adrenergic receptor). All antagonists were from Sigma. For ANG II stimulation, three increasing doses of ANG, 25 pM, 1 and 100 nM, were tested in the absence or presence of 10 µM losartan.</p>

<title>Total RNA extraction and real-time RT-PCR analysis</title>
<p>RNA was extracted from AA, femoral artery FA and cultured VSMCs using Trizol Reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and treated with DNase (Deoxyribonuclease I, Amplification Grade, Invitrogen). The integrity of the purified RNA was verified by agarose gel electrophoresis followed by ethidium bromide staining. After DNase treatment, 5 µg of total RNA was reverse-transcribed with superscript II transcriptase (Invitrogen, France) using random hexamers as primers (pdN6; Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ). Quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase–polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was performed for selected gene transcripts with a MyiQ thermal cycler (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA). Real-time RT-PCR was performed using the resulting cDNA as template, iQ SYBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA), and the appropriate set of primers (Invitrogen, France) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1470320311428344">Table 1</xref>). Two-step RT-PCR real-time amplifications were carried out as follows: 3 min at 95°C followed by 10 s at 95°C and 45 s at 60°C. For each sample, PCR was performed in duplicate. Dilutions of control template were used to generate the standard curves for each target gene. Cycle threshold values were calculated for the different products with Optical System Software v1.0 (Bio-Rad Laboratories). Expression levels obtained from the standard curves were normalized against 18S rRNA.</p>

<title>Protein extraction and western blotting</title>
<p>Protein extraction and western blotting were performed as previously described.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1470320311428344">18</xref></sup> We have used the specific antibodies to MMP-2 and MMP-9 (1:1000) and monoclonal IgG anti-β-actin (1:5000). All antibodies were from Sigma (St Louis, MO, USA). Immunoreactivity of proteins was visualized by chemiluminescent detection with an enhanced chemiluminescent reagent (ECL, Amersham, Buckinghamshire, UK). Pre-stained molecular weight markers (Sigma, St Louis, MO, USA) were used to assess and check the separation and transfer of the appropriate protein. Visualized protein was scanned and saved on the computer and optical density was measured with Scion image software. Values were normalized to β-actin.</p>

Extracts containing 50 µg of proteins from AA, 25 µg from FA and 40 µg from cultured VSMCs were loaded onto 7.5% sodium dodecyl sulphate–polymerase gel electrophoresis (SDS–PAGE) containing 1 mg/ml of porcine skin gelatin (Sigma) under non-reducing conditions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1470320311428344">22</xref></sup> After electrophoresis, the gels were washed twice in 2.5% Triton X-100 for 30 min to remove SDS and to allow protein renaturation, then rinsed in water and incubated for 48 h in a substrate buffer at 37°C (50 mM Tris-HCl, 5 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, and 0.02% NaN<sub>3</sub>, pH 7.4). At the end of the incubation, gels were stained with Coomassie Blue R-250 for 1 h, then transferred to a 10% acetic acid and 40% methanol solution for 1 h and kept in 10% acetic acid solution.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In the present study we tested the contributions of single treatments and combination of sympathoplegic drug (guanethidine) and ANG II AT1R antagonist on ECM degradation and fibrinolytic balance. In parallel, the in vitro study was focused on VSMCs, to test independently the direct effect of adrenergic stimulation and ANG II. We first used NE (10 nM) and ANG II (25 pM) at their physiological plasma concentrations in rats.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1470320311428344">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1470320311428344">25</xref></sup> High doses of NE (100 nM and 1 µM) and ANG II (1 and 100 nM) were used to verify the effect of high neurohormonal concentrations on the studied targets.</p>
<p>MMP-2 and MMP-9 are produced by most aortic smooth muscle cells and fibroblasts and are implicated in the degradation of ECM proteins.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1470320311428344">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1470320311428344">26</xref></sup> In spite of the attention accorded to the important role played by blocking adrenergic and ANG II receptors on expression and activity of proteases, the interaction between the two systems and the effect of double inhibition remain to be clarified. As we published previously,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1470320311428344">18</xref></sup> our in vivo experimental model makes it possible to discriminate the direct action of ANG II via AT1R from its possible interaction via SNS on the targets studied. Indeed, guanethidine is well known to destroy the pericardiovascular sympathetic fibers,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1470320311428344">27</xref></sup> and thus presumably eliminates the possible indirect action of ANG II via SNS. We showed in the current study that, in the absence of SNS, the fall of MMP-2 mRNA seen in AA from the GUA group was amplified by AT1R blockade in the GUA+LOS group, suggesting a stimulatory effect of ANG mediated directly via AT1R. On the other hand, the fall of MMP-2 mRNA induced by AT1R blockade in the presence of SNS (LOS group) was amplified by combination with sympathectomy (GUA+LOS group), which suggests a stimulatory effect of SNS as well. Additive inhibition of MMP-2 occurring after double treatment does not reflect a completely independent mechanism of action of the two systems, since ANG II-induced stimulation could partially originate via stimulation of SNS. This study corroborates our previous results on heart<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1470320311428344">18</xref></sup> and is in agreement with our in vitro study. NE and ANG II can induce overexpression of MMP-2 at both nanomolar and high concentrations.</p>
<p>However, in vivo study showed the absence of additive inhibition by SNS and ANG II of MMP-9 mRNA in AA or of MMP-2 and MMP-9 mRNA in FA. One hypothesis is that ANG II does not seem to have an important influence on the MMPs concerned. Indeed, based on our experimental model, the reduction of mRNA for these MMPs seen in the GUA group was not affected by a combination with AT1R blockade in the GUA+LOS group. Thus, the lower level of MMPs seen in the LOS group could be due to reduced activity of SNS provoked by inhibition of AT1R existing on perivascular sympathetic fibers. In agreement with this hypothesis, ANG II-induced stimulation of MMP-9 mRNA in vitro was very weak compared with MMP-2. However, similarly, NE induces weak stimulation of MMP-9 in vitro. It is possible that, in vivo, the effect of NE is potentiated by other mediators released from SNS, such as Neuropeptide Y (NPY), which has been shown to increase MMP-3 level in cultured intestinal cells.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1470320311428344">28</xref></sup></p>
<p>Our data show a positive correlation between transcriptional and protein levels for the two MMPs examined in the three treated AA, suggesting that protein changes are directly related to their respective modulated genes. A positive but partial correlation was observed between MMP-2 mRNA and protein levels in AA and SBP in all treated groups.</p>
<p>The use of specific receptor antagonists indicates that the overexpression of MMP mRNA is mediated via both α-2 and β-adrenoreceptors for NE and via AT1R for ANG II. Our results with NE alone corroborate functional studies and those performed in other cell lines demonstrating that NE effects on nasopharyngeal carcinoma cells involve the β adrenergic receptors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1470320311428344">29</xref></sup> Also, carvedilol, a pharmacological antioxidant with α and β adrenergic blocking activity, mediates reduction of MMP-2 and MMP-9 levels in rat aorta.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1470320311428344">30</xref></sup> Elevations of ANG II and NE in the circulation have been associated with upregulated MMP expression in advanced human atherosclerotic plaques.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1470320311428344">31</xref></sup> Our data suggest that the direct effects of ANG II on MMP gene expression could be potentiated by indirect ANG II effects via SNS and NE mediating stimulation through α-2 and β-adrenoreceptors.</p>
<p>Gelatinolytic activity of MMP-2 and MMP-9 was detectable in aorta only after prolonged incubation, and there were no significant differences between groups. This is probably due to the lower level of MMPs in the tissues studied. This hypothesis is supported by other studies performed in healthy subjects indicating a lower MMP activity, depending on the amount of tissue used in the extraction.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1470320311428344">32</xref></sup> In our study we observed that mRNA expression of the two MMPs was more than tenfold higher in AA than in FA; this suggests that the level of protein (and consequently gelatinolytic activity) is low in our extract of FA.</p>
<p>Stimulation of SMC by NE and ANG II directly enhances MMP-2 activity, which is mediated by β adrenergic and AT1 receptors, respectively. These in vitro results are paradoxical compared with the in vivo study. We demonstrate that, in spite of decreased MMP expression, gelatinase activity in AA remained unchanged in the three treated groups. t-PA contributes to the activation of MMPs;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1470320311428344">7</xref></sup> in our study both t-PA and PAI-1 were examined at the mRNA level, and data show that t-PA was expressed more than PAI-1 in all treated groups. Thus, we can infer that the t-PA/PA-1 ratio was increased at the protein level in the arterial wall, activating the plasminogen/plasmin activator system and thereby converting inactive MMPs to active forms. Another hypothesis is that the MMP/TIMP ratio, which reflects the activity balance, was decreased by the treatments. Although we have not examined TIMP in the present study, other reports in several tissues have shown that ANG II increased both MMPs and TIMP, whereas losartan decreased them.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1470320311428344">33</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1470320311428344">35</xref></sup> However, the MMP/TIMP ratio, in the case of MMP-2/TIMP-2, has been reported to be markedly decreased by ANG II and increased by losartan.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1470320311428344">36</xref></sup></p>
<p>In conclusion, we used single and combined inhibition of SNS and ANG II to elucidate the interaction of these systems in the regulation of vascular ECM degradation. Inhibition of SNS and ANG II separately has been widely used to reduce synthesis and activity of MMPs, which are associated with cardiovascular mortality and morbidity, while combined treatments have been less investigated. We demonstrate that combined treatment reduces SBP and the level of MMP-2 in AA more strongly than simple treatment, and enhances fibrinolytic balance, reflected by the higher t-PA/PAI-1 ratio. However, in spite of the stimulatory effects of NE and ANG II on MMP-2 activity seen in vitro, activity remained stable after inhibition of SNS and ANG II in vivo, suggesting that other factors may be implicated in the regulation of MMP activities in vivo.</p>
