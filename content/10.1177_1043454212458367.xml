<abstract>
<p>Although the onset of physiological and emotional stress can greatly affect outcomes for a child with cancer, the focus of this review targets pediatric oncology nurses and their daily occupation-related stress. Literature currently exists that discusses the etiology of stress in the oncology work environment as well as coping strategies and their effects on pediatric oncology nurses’ stress levels. To date, however, no literature review has been assembled to comprehensively address practice implications and provide recommendations for pediatric oncology staff nurses. This review of literature seeks to provide a general overview of stress experienced in the pediatric oncology work environment and supportive interventions to decrease negative outcomes such as compassion fatigue and burnout. Recommendations and conclusions are made based on existing interventions, thus creating a framework for future research to be conducted to compare the effectiveness of these measures and optimize patient experiences through caregiver well-being.</p>

<title>Case Study</title>
<disp-quote>
<p>Layla, a newly graduated pediatric oncology nurse, was assigned to care for a patient with metastatic osteosarcoma. A bond developed between the patient and nurse as the adolescent discussed some of her most challenging experiences and future aspirations since diagnosis. Layla listened as the patient expressed fears about not surviving long enough to have a first kiss, never receiving a driver’s license, and not graduating from middle school at the end of the spring. One week later, Layla arrived to work per her normal routine but was greeted with a disheveled code cart outside her patient’s room. Layla’s heart began racing as she looked into the eyes of the patient’s mother. The image of a mother who has lost her child is lasting and powerful, and Layla saw this for the first time. After the nurses bathed, dressed, and wrapped the patient in a shroud, Layla embraced the patient’s mother and together they grieved.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This case study characterizes some of the typical responsibilities that a pediatric oncology nurse experiences. It is evident that oncology nurses encounter increased stress in the workplace and are in need of interventions to promote their well-being.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1043454212458367">
<title>Background and Significance</title>
<p>Stress is a known effect in nurses providing care to chronically ill children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1043454212458367">Maytum, Heiman, &amp; Garwick, 2004</xref>). Oncology is a subspecialty of pediatrics that brings great reward to the nurse caring for patients and their families. If nurses are unable to relieve their patients’ experiences of suffering, an increased stress response may occur (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1043454212458367">Papadatou, Bellali, Papazoglou, &amp; Petraki, 2002</xref>). Furthermore, pediatric oncology nurses often care for high acuity patients with a terminal diagnosis creating an environment with minimal time for self-reflection. A poor prognosis inevitably causes the nurse to play a role not only in providing care for the sick child but also in supporting the emotional needs of the family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1043454212458367">Taubman-Ben-Ari &amp; Weintroub, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Research has widely accepted the need for increased support systems to foster coping for patients and families during oncologic diagnosis, treatment, and survivorship. However, minimal studies have targeted the nurses who provide daily care to these patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1043454212458367">Conte, 2011</xref>). It has been shown that negative consequences of stress may cause, but are not limited to, psychological illnesses, such as depression and anxiety, in addition to somatic symptoms including headache, gastrointestinal disturbances, hypertension, and increased fatigue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1043454212458367">Isikhan, Comez, &amp; Danis, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1043454212458367">Papadatou, 2001</xref>). Although pediatric oncology nurses grieve over their patients during treatment and even after their death, standardized guidelines for clinical interventions aimed at decreasing the effects of the stress response on the caregiver do not currently exist. This review aims to provide a synthesis of current literature to assist pediatric oncology nursing administration, advanced practice nurses, and staff nurses in understanding the role of stress and the importance of preemptive stress reduction and coping interventions.</p>
<p>Failure to identify stress or implement measures to decrease stress in pediatric oncology staff nurses increases the risk of debilitating exhaustion. Ultimately, this may cause ineffectiveness in the workplace. Resources for stress prevention and management are essential to integrate into daily practice. Negative outcomes for the patient and their family members may otherwise result in addition to decreased nurse productivity within the institution due to compassion fatigue and burnout.</p>

<title>Review of Literature/Method</title>
<p>A literature review was published addressing coping and resilience factors in pediatric oncology nurses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1043454212458367">Zander, Hutton, &amp; King, 2010</xref>). In creating a comprehensive framework, this review will expand the focus by synthesizing currently used interventions to reduce stress in the pediatric oncology nurse. Literature reviewed is limited to data published from 2000 to 2011, with the exception of 2 landmark articles published in 1982 and 1990, which were used for their descriptions of the <italic>Stress Response Sequence Model</italic> and the <italic>Stressor Scale for Pediatric Oncology Nurses</italic>. Articles used were found within Medline (OVID), PubMed Plus, CINAHL (EBSCO), PsycINFO, Sociological Abstracts, and Social Work Abstracts (EBSCO). Studies were searched with the following terms: <italic>nursing, oncology, cancer, stem cell transplant, pediatric, infant, child, adolescent, psychological adaptation, stress, burnout, compassion fatigue, coping</italic>. Inclusion criteria required that articles were written in English and described physiological or psychological adaptations in nurses caring for pediatric patients with chronic conditions or malignancy. This review of literature compiles previously published articles, which explore stress experienced in pediatric oncology staff nurses and complications, such as compassion fatigue and burnout. Interventions employed to reduce these outcomes are analyzed and recommendations for clinical practice based on these studies are presented. Finally, conclusions are drawn for future directions of research in an effort to create a framework for comparative research as well as to encourage nursing leaders to better understand imposed stress on pediatric oncology nurses. Comprehension of this subject and methods to reduce complications are essential to decrease negative outcomes for the patient, staff nurse, and institution.</p>

<title>Etiology and Impact on Pediatric Oncology Staff Nurses</title>
<p>Stress is a real and harmful effect of caring for children who are combating cancer and their families. It is widely acknowledged that oncology nurses are among health care professionals who experience stress due to various physiological and psychological factors in the workplace (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1043454212458367">Campos de Carvalho, Muller, Bachion de Carvalho, &amp; de Souza Melo, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1043454212458367">Chang, Kicis, &amp; Sangha, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1043454212458367">Hinds et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1043454212458367">Isikhan et al., 2004</xref>). Hinds, a researcher in the area of stress in pediatric oncology nursing, modeled her research from the <italic>Stress Response Sequence Model</italic> created by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1043454212458367">Elliot and Eisdorfer in 1982</xref>. Several studies have been conducted to better understand how pediatric oncology nurses experience stress. A tool known as the <italic>Stressor for Pediatric Oncology Nurses</italic> was consequently created to measure the intensity of role-related stress for such health care professionals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1043454212458367">Hinds et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1043454212458367">Hinds et al., 2003</xref>). Data from these studies have shaped how stress in this population is understood.</p>
<p>According to the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1043454212458367">American Cancer Society (2012)</xref>, 12,060 children below the age of 15 will be newly diagnosed with cancer in the United States in 2012. Furthermore, 80% will survive 5 years or more, and 1,340 are expected to die. These numbers are significant because they illustrate that although oncology is a small subset of pediatrics, health care professionals are providing daily care at the bedside to thousands of children with cancer. Therefore, attention to the stress response in nurses is critical. Pediatric oncology nurses care for these children with direct interventions, such as chemotherapy and blood product administration, pain and symptom management, end of life care, and emotional support. It is often the staff nurse who grieves with the family after the patient has passed away and provides postmortem care. It is clear that the job of a pediatric oncology nurse extends far beyond the workday as compounded grief often affects their personal lives. Understanding the meaning of stress, compassion fatigue, and burnout and how they interrelate is imperative before interventions can be considered.</p>
<p>Researchers have identified groups at higher risk for work-related stress within the oncology work environment. Factors that contribute to this target group include age, work experience, and marital status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1043454212458367">Isikhan et al., 2004</xref>). Nurses with less than 5 years of experience display increased levels of role related stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1043454212458367">Hinds, 2000</xref>). Furthermore, other sources that may induce stress in the pediatric oncology nurse are conflicts with colleagues, increased role responsibilities, long and tiring working hours, lack of time for socialization, and troubles encountered with patients and their families (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1043454212458367">Isikhan et al., 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Compassion fatigue can be best understood as severe exhaustion, which occurs after providing continued care to individuals enduring pain or suffering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1043454212458367">Sabo, 2006</xref>). Specifically, oncology nurses are at risk for experiencing compassion fatigue due to the demanding psychological and physiological stressors in the workplace (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1043454212458367">Aycock &amp; Boyle, 2009</xref>). Conversely, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1043454212458367">Maslach, Schaufeli, and Leiter (2001)</xref> articulate that burnout syndrome is composed of emotional exhaustion, distancing from the patient, and reduced personal achievement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1043454212458367">Italia, Favara-Scacco, Cataldo, &amp; Russo, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1043454212458367">Maslach et al., 2001</xref>). Without proper prevention and management of stress, patient care is at risk because of decreased productivity, and ineffective or unsafe patient care serves as a costly outcome to the institution as increased absenteeism or turnover can ultimately occur (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1043454212458367">Medland, Howard-Ruben, &amp; Whitaker, 2004</xref>).</p>

<title>Interventions Previously Explored and Their Effect</title>
<p>It is important to use interventions to avoid stress and enhance coping within the pediatric oncology setting. Use of various interventions has been shown to assist nurses in their coping related to compassion fatigue and burnout (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1043454212458367">Maytum et al., 2004</xref>). Although various institutions recognize that stress is common among pediatric oncology staff nurses and programs have been developed, standardized clinical interventions are often unavailable for staff.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1043454212458367">Isikhan et al. (2004)</xref> illustrated that nurses cope similarly when stressed. Mechanisms to manage stress, such as social support, optimism, helplessness, and submissive approaches, were the common themes identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1043454212458367">Isikhan et al., 2004</xref>). Clinical interventions for coping with stress are often used by pediatric oncology nurses but only subsequent to the loss of a patient or traumatic event. For example, support through clergy, family, and friends, in addition to debriefing, are prevalent ways to combat grief. These methods of coping with stress are repeatedly used by pediatric oncology staff nurses but traditionally as reactive mechanisms opposed to routine prevention. To assess the advantage of prevention, a study was conducted that implemented weekly psychosocial rounds for oncology nurses. Nurses acknowledged the benefit of consistent psychosocial and debriefing rounds in which one professional stated, “It was phenomenal … just knowing you would have that outlet on a weekly basis, I just thought that was really valuable. I would love to see something like that started again” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1043454212458367">Wenzel, Shaha, Klimmek, &amp; Krumm, 2011</xref>, p. 278).</p>
<p>A slight variation on debriefing is the approach of storytelling for stress reduction. The structure for conducting a storytelling session may include a listener prompting the storyteller to describe a pediatric oncology patient who was under their care and whose death was grieved. A story is thereby created and listened to in an uninterrupted fashion and is then discussed with the listener to understand its meaning and advantage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1043454212458367">Macpherson, 2008</xref>). The result of sharing personal experiences related to patients who have died has been suggested to be of value, leading to decreased stress in the pediatric oncology nurse.</p>
<p>End-of-life education focusing on clinical management of patient symptoms and training in providing support to the patient and family has been regarded as constructive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1043454212458367">Caton &amp; Klemm, 2006</xref>). However, coping with stress for nurses in the workplace through end- of-life education is not always available (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1043454212458367">Aycock &amp; Boyle, 2009</xref>). Recommendations specific to supporting the emotional and physical well-being of the nurse caring for these patients and families are often deficient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1043454212458367">Conte, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Of particular interest within pediatric oncology is the role of the clinical support nurse (CSN), who functions to assist nurses in their daily tasks during the workday. Role-related stress may be reduced as the CSN can assist the bedside nurse with patient procedures, education, and providing care to difficult families (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1043454212458367">Chang et al., 2007</xref>). The CSN may be particularly advantageous for nurses who are less experienced. Nursing researchers explored the use of a clinical resource nurse for newly graduated nurses who work in the pediatric oncology environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1043454212458367">MacKay &amp; Bellamy-Stack, 2010</xref>). The valuable role of the CSN has shown to reduce stress within the pediatric oncology setting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1043454212458367">Chang et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1043454212458367">MacKay &amp; Bellamy-Stack, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Two interventions to decrease the stress response, which are less commonly used, are complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) and art therapy. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1043454212458367">Wilson, Ganley, Mackereth, and Rowswell (2007)</xref> studied the effects of CAM in an oncology center demonstrating a decrease in harmful physiological and psychological effects of stress including anxiety, depression, and increased blood pressure. Additionally, oncology staff experienced benefits of CAM including increased levels of self-confidence, happiness, and relaxation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1043454212458367">Wilson et al., 2007</xref>). A recent study looked at the use of art therapy in oncology staff members who were at risk of burnout (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1043454212458367">Italia et al., 2008</xref>). Statistically significant findings suggest that those who participated in art therapy experienced a decreased stress response through psychodrama and relaxation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1043454212458367">Italia et al., 2008</xref>). Coping with stress may be enhanced within the oncology staff through CAM and art therapy, potentially improving attendance and productivity in the workplace.</p>
<p>An all-encompassing stress reduction activity worthy of discussion is the use of staff retreats. The pediatric oncology nurse has access to various modes of psychosocial support as time is specifically designated to stress reduction. An example of this model was created by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1043454212458367">Medland et al. (2004)</xref> and named the <italic>Circle of Care Retreat</italic>. During this workshop, staff members were exposed to a variety of activities designed to reduce and manage stress, such as group meetings, individual counseling, skill building, and behavioral activities, focused on self-care. The objective of this workshop was to limit stress in oncology nurses to prevent burnout, with the hopes of retaining these nurses within the institution. This intervention may be a useful model for hospitals as improved occupation-related stress can lead to caregiver well-being, decreased levels of absenteeism, and enhanced patient care.</p>
</sec>

<sec id="section7-1043454212458367">
<title>Clinical Practice Implications</title>
<p>There is no single intervention that can prepare the nurse for each stressful event that may be encountered in the pediatric oncology workplace. However, employing a wide range of stress prevention and management interventions can assist in decreasing the stress response. Staff nurses working within pediatric oncology endure the challenge of supporting the patient and family during illness, which often includes the dying process in terminally ill patients. Furthermore, nurses may be expected to know how to cope with stress, as it can be an organic aspect of pediatric oncology. Hospitals, particularly those specializing in pediatric oncology, should work to preserve the mental health of employees such as staff nurses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1043454212458367">Caton &amp; Klemm, 2006</xref>). Although the staff nurse must acknowledge when additional resources are needed to combat increased stress, this should not take the place of applying proactive strategies for stress prevention and management.</p>
<p>In addition to storytelling with peers working within the oncology unit, communication with family, friends, and clergy outside of the hospital setting is recommended for support. Moreover, a pediatric oncology unit–based approach for debriefing may be beneficial as staff working within the division have daily interactions with one another and are therefore often aware of individual stress reduction needs. On a daily basis, a stress reduction intervention can include discussing patients’ needs and support desired during a morning huddle with the unit leadership and staff nurses. Regular psychosocial rounds with a hospital staff social worker can often assist nurses in the bereavement process as well. Communication regarding stress prevention, triggers, and management may be accomplished through group collaboration with the nurse manager during monthly staff meetings or by creating a unit-based committee facilitated by staff nurses to focus on stress reduction. Individual concerns of stress may be communicated with the nurse manager during evaluation meetings or regularly scheduled appointments with the hospital staff social worker. Generation of proactive methods may decrease repression of stress and increase caregiver well-being leading to quality improvement.</p>
<p>Improving bereavement education with an emphasis on coping interventions for stress is proposed. It is important to provide a comprehensive introduction to bereavement, palliative care, and psychooncology for staff nurses during new hire orientation. However, focused coursework and seminars should begin during undergraduate nursing programs as part of the pediatric curriculum for individuals interested in oncology or other chronic illnesses. Continuing education regarding bereavement and stress reduction may offer added benefit as well for combating grief in the workplace.</p>
<p>In an effort to holistically support the well-being of pediatric oncology nurses, CAM workshops could be offered during work time. The CSN may be key in assisting to cover a nurse’s assignment in order to attend a relaxation session. Examples of CAM workshops may include massage and art therapy, meditation, yoga, and healing touch to promote respite care. If institutional funding for these programs is unavailable, grants may be able to offset the cost.</p>
<p>A wide variety of data are available to support the argument that pediatric oncology nurses are at increased risk of experiencing stress(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1043454212458367">Campos de Carvalho et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1043454212458367">Chang et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1043454212458367">Hinds et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1043454212458367">Isikhan et al., 2004</xref>). Therefore, it is unacceptable not to provide appropriate resources. Nursing administrators and advanced practice nurses are leaders who have the knowledge and power to ensure resources are readily available. Staff nurses must also be empowered to suggest novel ways in which coping with grief can be improved upon.</p>
</sec>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Whether it is skipping a lunch break to ensure patients have received their medications or holding the hands of an adolescent as she expresses fears about what it feels like to die, it is the oncology nurse who provides care and support for patients and their families. It is important that nursing and hospital administration understand stress, compassion fatigue, and burnout ramifications to avoid occupational hazards, which may affect both the nursing staff and institution.</p>
<p>Several interventions have been tested to decrease stress and found to be effective. Nursing administration, advanced practice nurses, and staff nurses are encouraged to employ recommendations to decrease stress in the pediatric oncology setting, thereby avoiding chronic effects such as compassion fatigue and burnout. Utilization of such interventions is likely to provide cost savings to the institution as decreased absenteeism and increased productivity may result. Additionally, improvement in patient outcomes is likely as nurses are more physically and emotionally capable of providing efficient care. Future research is recommended to compare stress reduction interventions to determine those most beneficial and cost-effective in the clinical setting.</p>
