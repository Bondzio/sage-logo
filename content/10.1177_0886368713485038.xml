<abstract>
<p>It is widely recognized that in the management of employee pay, there is a definite divide between government and the private sector. The immediate question comes to mind: “How is performance-related pay working in government?” A closer look provides insight on the kind of challenges governments are facing in getting this process working. It is obvious that they need to, as this pay philosophy is not working as it should or could. A proper analysis of the current scenario would pave the way to a much improved performance-related pay structure in government as a whole. It is clear that the link to performance management is of critical importance. Should governments and the private sector alike not start to learn from each other, instead of adopting the “we are better and different than you philosophy?” It is all one economy in each country with two major role players, of which government is a significant stakeholder. It is hoped that this article will assist senior government officials in establishing that closer link between performance and pay.</p>

<body>
<p>Government institutions<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0886368713485038">1</xref></sup>, not only in South Africa but also in most other developing nations, are increasingly placing greater emphasis on performance-related pay. That is to say, they are working to link wage and salary increases to individual performance.</p>
<p>The main emphasis is not only on their employees but also to better satisfy the concerns of stakeholders and customers for better government. An increase in accountability is by far the largest contributor to this increased emphasis, but it is not the only one. Most government departments around the world rely heavily on the interdependence between themselves. Many decisions made in one department will certainly have an impact on other departments. This interdependency between government departments requires much more transparency within governments. All of this contributes to the increased emphasis on performance in governments today and on the relationship to pay.</p>
<p>Global competition has further added to this voice of emphasis on performance-related pay. It has prompted governments to develop programs to serve the public more efficiently, to become more output based and market related. Government departments are developing and implementing programs to improve not only the performance of their employees but also the relation between the performance of their employees and their subsequent pay structures. Therefore, the emphasis has become a dual one, on employee performance and employee pay.</p>
<p>To keep abreast with market developments and remain competitive for talent, governments had to significantly update and improve their employee performance-related pay programs. Some countries have even gone as far as to draft legislation requiring that departmental performance be monitored, to ensure greater outcomes.</p>
<p>This is, furthermore, leading to increased financial based performance, in that the link between budget and performance is becoming tighter. As a result, governments are requiring a greater integration between budget and performance extending to the lowest levels possible.</p>
<p>Government in general is seeking to improve its service delivery. In order to successfully realize improved performance, it is necessary to make departmental structures and processes function more efficiently, and more important, its human capital needs to be monitored and rewarded accordingly. If government human resources are not consistently monitored, these initiatives are likely to fail. For these and other government programs to be implemented successfully and to be sustainable, the capabilities of experienced employees are essential. Toward that end, the latest information technology and best practices in managing human capital are required.</p>
<p>For these and many other reasons, any public employer today, to be sustainable and competitive in the global economy at large, will require professionally developed performance-related pay systems. Current performance-related pay systems will need to be reviewed, upgraded or even redeveloped if necessary. No performance-related pay system is sustainable if not regularly reviewed, updated and improved. The focus should include more effective monitoring of the performance of the human resources function. However, the goal of improving performance is more important than rewarding performance. Hence, performance-related pay links the management of performance with the appropriate remuneration thereof. That approach provides a standardized framework for the employer and the employee alike.</p>
<p>As in any private company, government also has various levels of human capital. Specifically, those are the senior management service, the middle management service and those below (general staff). There are thus three different levels included in the remuneration process. From a strategic perspective, the Minister and Head of Department would identify the strategic outcomes of the department and assign them accordingly to each component within the relevant department. Each is then responsible for the implementation of the component operational plans. At the employee level, each employee enters into a performance agreement for the operational year ahead. Both parties to this unique agreement are responsible for the successful achievement of its objectives.</p>
<p>The strategic operational objectives of each department are the platform for performance-related compensation. The department’s strategic plan gives direction to priorities and outcomes of business units. It is not necessary that all the work performed in a particular department is included in its strategic plan. This could result in certain employees’ key performance areas not being incorporated into the strategic or operational plan of the department where they are employed. This means that those employees would need to develop their own key performance goals and link them to the strategic plan. This would provide these employees with a greater sense of ownership for the planned outcomes.</p>
<p>Successful implementation of a performance management system linked to employee performance necessitates that managers have a solid knowledge of the system. Sufficient knowledge and skills in using the system are important, but improved performance is always the priority. In other words, improved performance is more important than the rewards.</p>
<p>In this performance-driven era, governments need to focus more on linking performance to rewards for the same reasons that variable pay is rapidly becoming the norm in the private sector. However, variable pay is extremely complex to implement and often difficult to justify in government. Therefore, the focus in government is on the management of wage and salary increases, rather than variable pay. The remainder of this article will, thus, focus on performance-related pay instead of variable pay.</p>
<sec id="section1-0886368713485038">
<title>Mandatory Requirements</title>
<p>Governments all over the world are generally the largest employers in a country’s economy. The average staff complement is much more than just the normal 20,000 to 30,000. The South African Public Service constitutes more than 1.2 million employees. This requires what is termed a <italic>regulatory framework</italic> to govern the successful implementation of performance management and successfully linking the system to employee rewards.</p>
<p>A performance management system in government needs to comply with various forms of legislation, for example, The Constitution of the Republic of South Africa, 1996, The Public Service Act, 1994, as amended. There are many more. Governments usually have other regulatory documentation in place to regulate its human resources systems, for example, The Public Service Regulations, which are reviewed from time to time. A department’s performance-related pay system needs to be aligned to this framework as well, in particular when it is linked to financial rewards.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0886368713485038">
<title>The Need for Performance Management</title>
<p>Performance management has been part of the managerial process in organizations for a very long time. Originally the focus was more on the monitoring of performance. Now the focus has shifted to ensure optimal performance of each individual employee. Enhancing the performance of each employee within the organization will subsequently lead to improved organizational performance.</p>
<p>One of the principles of performance appraisals<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0886368713485038">2</xref></sup> in the Overstrand Municipality’s policy on performance management is “The PMS [performance management system] will be a corrective system and not a punitive system”—a principle more often than not misunderstood in general.</p>
<p>Wikipedia defines performance management<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0886368713485038">3</xref></sup> within Government as follows:
<disp-quote>
<p>Government Performance Management (GPM) consists of a set of processes that help government organizations optimize their business performance. It provides a framework for organizing, automating, and analyzing business methodologies, metrics, processes and systems that drive business performance.</p>
<p>Some commentators see GPM as the next generation of business intelligence (BI) for governments. GPM helps governments to make use of their financial, human, material and other resources.</p>
<p>In the past, owners have sought to drive strategy down and across their organizations; they have struggled to transform strategies into actionable metrics and they have grappled with meaningful analysis to expose the cause-and-effect relationships that, if understood, could give profitable insight to their operational decision-makers.</p>
<p>GPM software and methods allow a systematic, integrated approach that links government strategy to core processes and activities. “Running by the numbers” now means something: planning, budgeting, analysis, and reporting can give the measurements that empower management decisions.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In order to achieve that sought-after excellent performance from each employee, performance management must be underlined by certain objectives and principles. Some of them are the following (there are many more):</p>

<title>Integration of Performance-Related Pay With Other Organizational Processes</title>
<p>In order for performance-related pay to be effective, the process therefore needs to be integrated with all other organizational processes. The essence of performance-related pay is rather a process of how work is done and organized than merely a system. It should be much more of an integrated process than an individualized system. Performance-related pay should provide input to other HR areas such as job profiling, job evaluation, remuneration structuring, incentives, strategic planning and the like. Furthermore, to ensure the successful implementation of performance-related pay, it needs the approval and support of top management. There should be a direct and clear link between individual performance-related pay and a department’s strategic and operational plans.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0886368713485038">
<title>The Need for Performance-Related Pay</title>
<p>Why do employers introduce performance-related pay? Over the years the reasons have changed. The game has changed. Obviously the main reason has always been to reward good performance, but it is also to identify poor performance. However, in recent years there is an additional reason or two.</p>
<p>Talent markets have become so competitive that no employer, government or private, can afford to ignore the effects of performance-related pay and benefits. It has become a competitive necessity in a big way. Many applicants ask the rhetoric question to a prospective employer: “What are their bonuses like?” or “how are their benefits?” or even “what is their incentive strategy?”</p>
<p>Total reward is also driven by the retention factor. Another motive for performance-related pay is for organizations to retain those high performers and to motivate those who underperform. The phenomenon of performance-related pay has become a generally accepted reward practice in its totality for various reasons. It has become a must philosophy. No organization can any longer do without it.</p>
<p>The Total Guaranteed Package is not sufficient to incentify, motivate, develop or retain employees. It has become the variable part or the performance-related part that creates the competitive advantage in terms of reward practices.</p>
<p>The challenge for public employers is to come up with new ideas for performance-related pay. Governmental institutions are not profit-driven organizations, and they generally lag behind the private sector in taking the initiative in these models. Government, globally, will need to be significantly more creative in developing cutting-edge performance-related pay models to keep up with global trends. Ultimately, governments make up a huge part of the total economy and can no longer ignore such developments. It is, therefore, no longer a question of “why the need to for performance-related pay” but “the how of performance-related pay.”</p>
<p>The further challenge to governments is that due to the profit nature of the private sector, it has not been able to develop the variety of performance-related pay systems that exists in the private sector. The challenge put to governments is to develop more types of performance-related pay models, including variable pay systems. The fact is that variable pay in its purest form probably exists in few public organizations.</p>
<p>Some of the most common types of performance pay models<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0886368713485038">4</xref></sup>, in addition to salary increases linked to performance, are the following: piecework, payment by results, organizational incentives, team bonuses, gain sharing and profit sharing. Performance-related pay in the form of wage and salary increases is the norm in the public sector</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0886368713485038">
<title>The Performance Management Process<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0886368713485038">5</xref></sup></title>
<p>Some refer to this as the performance management cycle, as it is cyclic in nature; however, it is still a process of engagement. When managed effectively, it is an ongoing interactive engagement process between the employee and his or her supervisor. The engagement process is specifically centered on the employee’s performance over a specified period of time, usually a month, quarter, semester, biannually or annually. For the entire process to be effective, there are phases in the process that should be followed. These phases can be referred to as follows:</p>
<list id="list2-0886368713485038" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Planning and agreement of the performance management process</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Monitoring, development and control of performance management</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Assessment or appraisal of performance</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Outcome management of the assessment</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>The performance management process or cycle involves a 12-month period, commencing on the first day of a particular month and ending at year-end. The performance management process is normally linked to the financial year due to the central importance of the budget, operational plans and the payment of various kinds of incentives—hence the importance of linking performance management in part to financial results.</p>
<p>Performance-related pay can unfortunately not be implemented successfully unless it is integrated with a professionally developed performance management system. They are both integral part to the process. The first is used to manage performance and the second managing pay (or the outcome). Sadly, many a performance-related pay system is criticized and poorly managed. Even with the best of intentions, if a pay-related system is not managed effectively and does not offer sufficient rewards, it is unlikely to achieve its objectives.</p>

<title>Planning and Agreement Components of the Performance Management Process</title>
<sec id="section7-0886368713485038">
<title>The Performance Management Agreement</title>
<p>The psychological contract arrangement between supervisor and employee is generally referred to as the performance agreement, which is the first step in the performance management process, without which performance management cannot occur. Every employee needs to accept such an agreement before the commencement of the process.</p>
<p>One, two or maximum three formats apply to this process. One format of the process applies to general staff, another to middle management and a third to senior management. The content of the relevant format should be integrated with the organization’s strategic and operational plans, component business plans, employee’s job profile, key performance indicators and responsibilities.</p>
<p>The performance agreement needs to include the following data points:</p>
<list id="list3-0886368713485038" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Employee data, that is, employee number, job title, job level, description of the role of the job; the purpose of the job; key result areas (KRAs) and the generic assessment factors (GAFs)</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>A detailed work plan, including the KRAs, outcomes, activities and resources required</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>A personal development plan (PDP) that focuses on identifying areas and needs within the employee that requires further development; the mode of development should also be addressed during this phase</p></list-item>
</list>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0886368713485038">
<title>The Work Plan Phase</title>
<p>The work plan is the phase during which most of the time in the entire performance management process is spent. The two main elements of the work plan are the KRAs and the GAFs, which are also contained in the performance agreement. Both areas are used, against which each employee must be assessed. The KRAs account for most part of the assessment, usually 80%, whereas the GAFs account for only about 20%. Each employer needs to decide the weights.</p>
<p>KRAs are those main areas of outcome expected from the employee during his or her normal day-to-day activities. The main focus of attention should be those activities that assist the department to perform optimally. KRAs may cover activities such as the following:</p>
<list id="list4-0886368713485038" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Specific tasks that the employee should achieve</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Specific performance levels that the employee should maintain</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Specific activities for which the employee is personally accountable</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Specific duties related to advice and support on the employee’s area of expertise</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>There is no right or wrong in terms of the number of KRAs, but they should preferably be between four and seven. Each KRA should be weighted as a percentage (%) in terms of importance and the total weight must add up to 100%.</p>
<p>GAFs are factors used during the assessment process to measure areas of performance linked to skills, knowledge and attributes or attitudes. Numerous GAFs could be identified for assessment purposes, but for practical reasons let us identify 15 of them:</p>
<list id="list5-0886368713485038" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Job knowledge</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Quality of work</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Technical skills</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Leadership</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Interpersonal relationships</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Communication</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Reliability</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Initiative</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Acceptance of responsibility</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Team work</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Flexibility</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Planning and execution</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Delegation and empowerment</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Management of human resources</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Management of financial resources</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>The employee and supervisor should agree on only five GAFs, which need to make up 20% of the total assessment score. The five GAFs that are most related to the particular job needs to be utilized. Each GAF must be weighted in terms of importance to the job, and the weighting should add up to 100%.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0886368713485038">
<title>The Personal Development Plan</title>
<p>As performance management must have a personal agreement, there should also be a PDP for each individual. The main purpose of the PDP is to identify any areas within the KPAs or GAFs that may reflect a shortcoming or weak area within the personal employee framework, which may need further development. A clearly defined personal development program needs to be identified and agreed on to ensure that the relevant gaps are reduced over the assessment period. Both the supervisor and employee must accept responsibility for the development program. The actions required must be clearly articulated, together with time frames for achievement.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0886368713485038">
<title>Absence and Mobility During the Performance Management Process</title>
<sec id="section11-0886368713485038">
<title>Absence During the Process</title>
<p>Normal vacation leave and/or short periods of sick leave usually do not negatively affect the performance management process. When prolonged absence does occur, supervisors and employees need to agree on how the required outcomes will be achieved and a proper assessment be done for the specific period in question. If for whatever reason, a valid assessment is not possible, the reasons need to be outlined in writing for proper recording purposes as well as to provide professional structure to the performance management process. Depending on the length of absence, it could be required to review and possibly modify the PDP.</p>
<p>This becomes particularly relevant when performance bonuses are involved. Those who were not absent for prolonged periods of time have, in effect, produced more than those who have been absent for longer periods. Situations of such nature need to be treated with circumspection.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0886368713485038">
<title>Working in Higher Level Positions During the Process</title>
<p>When an employee has been appointed to serve in a higher position for less than 6 weeks, the assessment must be done for the position the employee permanently holds. When an employee acts in a higher position for longer than 6 weeks and an acting allowance is being paid, the assessment needs to be done for the performance within the acting position. The PDP, therefore, needs to be amended accordingly.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-0886368713485038">
<title>Employee Mobility During the Process</title>
<p>When employees are transferred to other units within the department, it is their responsibility to provide their new supervisor with progress on their performance management and development to date. This implies that performance reviews need to take place before such movements occur. If the employee moving is a supervisor, he or she should complete the performance reviews of all subordinates under his or her control prior to the transfer taking place.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-0886368713485038">
<title>Misconduct and Suspension of Employees During the Process</title>
<p>Decisions regarding performance assessment must be based on actual performance during the relevant cycle. When alleged misconduct by an employee has occurred, certain facts about the alleged misconduct must be determined. This may be done by obtaining answers to the following questions:</p>
<list id="list6-0886368713485038" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>What is the nature of the alleged misconduct?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Was the employee found guilty or innocent?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>If the employee was found to be guilty, what was the sentence?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Was the employee’s performance affected by the misconduct and/or sentence?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Was the employee suspended for a prolonged period of time, disallowing him or her to achieve his or her performance targets?</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>However, each case needs to be dealt with on merit; for example, an employee with a misconduct charge against him or her has affected his or her performance negatively, so it would be difficult to justify a satisfactory assessment, let alone a performance bonus.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-0886368713485038">
<title>Amendments to the Performance Agreement</title>
<p>Government and the private sector alike, are working in a significant changing environment. A performance agreement can, therefore, never be the same document throughout the performance management cycle. Jobs, positions and projects change from time to time. The time frames within which these changes occur are becoming increasingly shorter. Performance agreements need to reflect these changes and should, therefore, be reviewed and amended accordingly. These changes must be agreed on and signed by the employee and supervisor accordingly.</p>
</sec>
</sec>

<title>Performance Monitoring, Review and Assessment</title>
<sec id="section17-0886368713485038">
<title>Performance Monitoring</title>
<p>Consistent individual performance monitoring should be done throughout the entire process to identify barriers in achieving performance objectives. During this phase, developmental needs should also be identified and addressed, which may include the following areas:</p>

When an employee receives a “3,” he or she has met all the minimum requirements of the performance agreement. However, a new approach is emerging. An employee who has met all the minimum requirements of the performance agreement has in effect achieved 100% and, therefore, a score of 100% as opposed to 60% in the past.</p>

<sec id="section20-0886368713485038">
<title>The Performance Review Discussion</title>
<p>Performance review meetings between supervisor and employee are an important part of the monitoring process and should occur at least four times a year. These meetings are necessary to provide some sense of direction to the employee, in particular when the employee is not performing according to the requirements of the performance agreement. If the employee performance is according to the requirements of the performance agreement, these review meetings may be of a verbal nature. However, when an employee is not performing at an acceptable level, the specific incidences when deficiencies were noted need to be brought to his or her attention, first verbally but then also in writing.</p>
<p>Should the supervisor at any stage of the process come to the conclusion that the employee has been performing well below the requirements of the performance agreement, the supervisor must complete a formal and complete assessment and have both parties sign the document. This will leave the employee in no doubt that his or her performance has not met the requirements of the performance agreement, that organizational performance will be affected and that persistent poor performance will have further implications to the employee.</p>
<p>The supervisor should be prepared for this review in the following manner:</p>
<list id="list8-0886368713485038" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Reviewing the results of the previous period as well as the targets for the next review</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Identifying any support the employee may require, together with developmental needs</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Seeking counsel from relevant stakeholders in the process</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Studying all relevant documentation part of the process</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Identifying any factors that may contribute to the employee’s unacceptable performance</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Similarly, the employee should also prepare for this review in the following manner:</p>
<list id="list9-0886368713485038" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Analyzing past performance and requirements and identifying new targets</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Searching for supporting facts to performance achieved</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Identifying possible factors that caused performance problems</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Identifying any support that the employee may require, together with possible developmental needs</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Reviewing the possible feedback that would be submitted to the supervisor</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Each review session should be documented and signed by both parties. All reviews should include a discussion on performance during the period in question as well as any future developmental needs. The result of the review needs to translate into an assessment score of the employee’s performance for the relevant period in relation to preidentified KPAs and GAFs.</p>
<p>The purposes of the assessment engagement are the following:</p>
<list id="list10-0886368713485038" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Provide the employee an opportunity to assess his or her performance relative to organizational goals and identify shortcomings in performance</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Provide the supervisor an opportunity to present the employee with feedback of his or her performance over the period of review and identify areas of improvement</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Reach consensus of the final ratings and score reflecting the performance achieved in relation to the KPAs and GAFs</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Offer both parties the opportunity to agree on areas of personal development</p></list-item>

<title>The Annual Performance Assessment</title>
<sec id="section22-0886368713485038">
<title>The Performance Assessment Instrument</title>
<p>Two separate assessment instruments are used: one for general staff and the second for senior managers. The same instrument is used for quarterly performance reviews and the annual overall assessment. The annual overall performance assessment score is ultimately used to determine any managerial actions toward the employee, namely, disciplinary, incentives or skills development. The assessment should be based only on the information contained in the instrument.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section23-0886368713485038">
<title>Steps During the Assessment Phase</title>
<p>The success of the performance management process depends heavily on the agreement between the supervisor and employee—first, in terms of the achievement of specific goals or outcomes established at the beginning of the cycle, and second, in terms of the actual results achieved at the end of the cycle. The annual assessment takes place at the end of the performance cycle, which is March 31 of each year in the South African Government.</p>
<p>The employee assesses himself or herself first before the supervisor does his or her assessment and then reviews the assessment of the employee. Both then finally agree on the final rating score for each KPA and GAF.</p>

<title>Core Management Criteria for Senior Managers<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0886368713485038">6</xref></sup></title>
<p>These are knowledge, skills, attributes and/or activities directly related to job performance. These are, in particular, applicable to the senior management service in the Public Service. They are as follows:</p>
<list id="list15-0886368713485038" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Strategic skills and leadership</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Program and project management</p></list-item>

<p>The main reason for including these criteria in the performance management system for senior managers is to develop a greater understanding of effective management practices.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section29-0886368713485038">
<title>The Provisional Assessment Rating Score</title>
<p>The first overall score agreed on between the supervisor and employee is outlined in a summary of the annual performance review, including the total between the KRA and the GAF score. This then becomes the provisional assessment rating score.</p>
<p>The provisional rating is submitted to the next level of management for approval. If he or she questions the provisional rating, it is referred back for reviewing. When the provisional rating is approved, it is submitted for first-level moderation by the moderation committee.</p>
<p>If the supervisor and employee cannot agree on a provisional rating, both parties need to put their reasons in writing to a mutually agreed mediator. If the mediation is not resolved satisfactorily within a specified period (e.g., 5 days), the written notes will be used should a grievance be lodged after completion of the entire process.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section30-0886368713485038">
<title>The Moderation or Leveling of Performance Ratings<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0886368713485038">5</xref></sup></title><p>There are a few good reasons why performance ratings need to be moderated by a third body. Some of those reasons are listed below:</p>
<list id="list16-0886368713485038" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>To ensure that performance ratings are done fairly and consistently throughout the organization</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>To ensure that performance-related increases or bonuses for exceptional performance are kept within the budgetary framework</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>To ensure that the granting of a pay progression for acceptable performance is also within the budgetary framework</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Moderation of performance takes place at different levels within the organization. The higher the jobs to be moderated, the higher the level of incumbents participating in the moderation process. The main challenge with moderation is when the provisional assessment rating needs to be changed, in particular lowered. The employee is at this stage of the process aware of the provisional rating, and if the moderation committee is of the view that it needs to be reduced, such changes must be dealt with in consultation with the affected employee. These changes could ultimately affect the financial reward the employee would be qualifying for.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section31-0886368713485038">
<title>The Distribution of Ratings</title>
<p>In South Africa, effective performance is generally rewarded with annual remuneration, 13th-month checks, annual cost-of-living-adjustment and pay progression (notch increase). Only performance that falls within the highly effective and excellent categories should qualify for performance incentives. The distributions in the table below will assist the moderating committee in analyzing the agreed-on ratings between supervisor and employee. Generally 25% of employees would qualify for performance incentives. These percentages should assist the moderating committee in identifying trends and making recommendations for incentives within the budgetary framework.</p>

<title>The Review Committee</title>
<p>One or more intermediate reviewing committees also needs to be established, which functions in-between the supervisor and the moderation committee. The purpose of a reviewing committee is to review the provisional ratings of employees. When the reviewing committee recommends any changes to ratings, these changes need to be communicated to supervisors and employees. Financial rewards will always be part and parcel of these discussions.</p>
<p>The reviewing committee receives all provisional ratings of employees, to review, compare and validate ratings. Managers and supervisors should be asked to explain and defend ratings that do not appear to be justified. Once the reviewing committee has assessed all the provisional ratings, they are referred to as the validated assessment ratings. If a supervisor and employee are unable to agree on the lowering of a score as recommended by the reviewing committee, such rating should be referred to the moderation committee. Once the moderation committee has confirmed a rating, it becomes the confirmed assessment rating, which is then the employee’s final rating.</p>
<p>If an employee is still aggrieved after receiving written confirmation of his or her rating, the employee may lodge an appeal to the assessment appeal panel. If, after this process, the employee is still not satisfied, he or she may lodge a formal grievance in terms of the formal grievance procedure applicable to the South African Public Service.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section33-0886368713485038">
<title>The Moderation Committee</title>
<p>Each department must establish its own moderation committee for general staff, which must be chaired by the head of department, corporate manager or chief financial officer. Members of the committee include senior managers of the department.</p>
<sec id="section34-0886368713485038">
<title>Powers and Functions of the Moderation Committee</title>
<p>The main purpose of the establishment of the moderation committee is to moderate all annual performance assessments in a consistent and fair manner. The moderation committee should not necessarily assess each employee but rather assess the overall results of the performance management process. When the moderation committee identifies deviations or outliers, these should be referred back to the supervisors for reconsideration. The moderation committee should not change any ratings without referring such back to the reviewing committee and supervisors. All decisions by the moderation committee should be documented.</p>
<p>The moderation committee must furthermore do the following:</p>
<list id="list17-0886368713485038" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Provide advice on the awarding of financial rewards to the department</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Identify shortcomings in the performance management system</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Consider all rating scores for the entire department</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Recommend performance rewards as well as remedial action for noneffective performance</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Make recommendations where supervisors and employees have not fairly implemented the performance management system</p></list-item>
</list>
</sec>
<sec id="section35-0886368713485038">
<title>The Assessment Appeal Panel</title>
<p>The role of the assessment appeal panel is threefold:</p>
<list id="list18-0886368713485038" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>It provides the employee with a platform when the reviewing committee has amended a performance rating.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>It, furthermore, assists the employee before lodging a formal grievance, after being informed of a final rating score.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>It acts as an arbiter during disputes or disagreements.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Members of the panel should include the head of department in certain cases, managers from line function, performance management, labor relations and legal affairs. The assessment appeal panel has the following responsibilities:</p>
<list id="list19-0886368713485038" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Reviewing of disagreements between employees and the department regarding confirmed assessment ratings and to then make relevant recommendations to the moderation committee</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Acting as arbiter in special disputes or disagreements, that is, a specific division, supervisor,employee or where interpretation matters are at stake</p></list-item>
</list>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section36-0886368713485038">
<title>Rating and Assessment Disagreements</title>
<p>Unfortunately, agreements between the various parties involved in assessment rating are not a formality. If supervisor and employee have regular performance reviews, disagreements are normally limited to the minimum and should be the exception rather than the norm. Disagreements occur between the following parties:</p>
<list id="list20-0886368713485038" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Employee and supervisor</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Employee and supervisor on one side and the reviewing committee on the other</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Reviewing and moderation committees</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Moderation committee and head of department</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Disagreements are, furthermore, limited to the minimum when the performance assessments of senior managers are completed before those of their subordinates. This approach limits contradictions in rating score as well as the linking of KPAs. If there are serious differences between the reviewing and moderation committees or if the head of department is unwilling to approve the moderation committee’s recommendations, they should be dealt with at senior management level. If changes have been made to final rating scores and employees refuse to accept them, they need to follow the formal grievance procedures applicable in the Public Service.</p>

<title>The Matter of Probation</title>
<p>Employees who are on probation are managed in terms of the formal performance management system together with departmental policies. The process should include the following:</p>
<list id="list21-0886368713485038" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>The formal performance management system should be used.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Performance assessment should be done quarterly and be linked to the performance management system.</p></list-item>

</sec>
<sec id="section39-0886368713485038">
<title>Managing Poor Performance</title>
<p>Supervisors should, by means of, regular performance reviews identity noneffective or poor performers as early as possible. If identified at an early stage, they should be dealt with in a developmental approach. An employee’s final annual performance rating should not be the first identification of his or her inadequate performance. Regular, for example, quarterly, reviews ensure that this does not occur. The supervisor should apply the following processes when an employee experiences weaknesses:</p>
<list id="list23-0886368713485038" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Employee counseling</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Close coaching and mentoring</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Training programs</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Reviewing the work plan requirements</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Identifying other factors, such as work environment, that are affecting performance</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Should the employee’s performance not improve significantly and remain less than 100%, such an employee should be registered on the incapacity program. The employee must be informed accordingly in writing.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section40-0886368713485038">
<title>Pay Progression</title>
<p>General staff, senior managers and below may annually qualify for a pay progression to the next higher notch (step rate) within their salary scale. The pay progression is not automatic but is based on consistent satisfactory performance throughout the year. The annual performance assessment needs to reflect meeting expected performance levels. An employee also needs to be in the relevant position for at least 12 months before qualifying for a pay progression.</p>
<p>Pay progression is over and above the annual cost-of-living-adjustments in the Public Service. A further, performance bonus may also be paid to employees who qualify in terms of the criteria. However small it may be, this is a form of performance-related pay that is generally not practiced in the private sector. Many governments around the world apply some form of pay progression based on steps. In terms of best practice, it is an approach that governments should begin to consider going forward.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section41-0886368713485038">
<title>Performance Bonus</title>
<p>A performance bonus is a financial reward for consistent exceptional performance by an employee over a 12-month period. Their performance needs to be rated accordingly in terms of the performance management system. The amount of the bonus is calculated according to the employee’s specific salary notch.</p>
<p>For bonus purposes, there are three main groups of performance ratings. Those categories are indicated in the tables below:</p>

<title>The Budget for Bonuses</title>
<p>This is the critical area where governments generally are severely restricted to incentify their employees. In South Africa, only 1% of a department’s wage bill may be paid to pay progression for salary levels 1 to 12. The budget for performance bonuses is limited to 1.5%. Most companies in the private sector are at liberty to pay incentives way beyond this parameter.</p>

<title>Nonfinancial Incentives</title>
<p>Financial incentives are not always adequate measures of reward to motivate employees to excellent performance. Other ways of rewarding excellent performance need to be identified. The following are examples of what may be considered as nonfinancial incentives:</p>
<list id="list24-0886368713485038" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Recognizing performance in departmental publications</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Certificates for certain achievements or performance</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Presentations at conferences or attendance of high-level conferences</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>More autonomy or resources in one’s work environment</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Public awards for new innovations or specific achievements</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Specialized training and development programs</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Participation in study tours or an overseas visit</p></list-item>

<title>Evaluation and Review of the Performance Management System</title>
<p>A comprehensive evaluation of any system is necessary in order to determine how effective the system is being implemented. From time to time, any system also needs to be reviewed to improve on shortcomings that may exist within the system.</p>
<p>An evaluation schedule should be developed to provide participants in the system the opportunity to evaluate the system and also to propose improvements to the system. The evaluation strategy must be reviewed if the data obtained throughout the evaluation process do not assist in making future decisions regarding departmental performance. Ultimately they need to be comfortable and supportive of the system.</p>
<p>The typical format of the evaluation methodology could be to develop a survey questionnaire and ask questions such as the following:</p>
<list id="list25-0886368713485038" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Is the system meeting the department’s requirements?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Do supervisors and managers have the required knowledge and skills to effectively implement the system?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Does the system provide the necessary data to make futuristic human resources strategic decisions?</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>The review process should be based on legal requirements, best practice, monitoring and evaluation principles. The moderation committee, together with the human resources department needs to determine whether the following requirements have been met:</p>
<list id="list26-0886368713485038" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>All employees have been assessed annually.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Employees know which supervisors will be performing their annual assessment.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Employees are aware that they may refuse to sign their performance assessment.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Employees are informed of the disagreement and grievance route.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Employees are permitted to be represented by employee representatives during a grievance procedure.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Before implementing amendments to the current system or developing a new system, those amendments and system must be consulted with employee organizations. Any changes to the current system or the implementation of a new system should be communicated comprehensively and well in advance to all employees concerned.</p>

<title>The Link to Strategic Planning</title>
<p>Departmental performance-related pay systems should be aligned to departmental operational and strategic plans. The KPAs of each individual employee should be aligned to his or her immediate supervisor’s KPAs as well as to those of the relevant unit. There needs to be a cascading link between supervisor and employee KPAs. This process should already start from the head of department down to the lowest level employee.</p>
<p>The identified KPAs should further be aligned to the unit’s operational and strategic plans. Each unit’s operational and strategic plans should therefore be aligned to those of the next higher department or business unit. This process should result in a clear line-of-sight strategic process from the highest to the lowest level. This will ensure that there is an interrelationship between the KPAs of supervisors and employees throughout the organization.</p>
<p>During the development of each unit’s operational and strategic plans, the relevant managers, supervisors and employees should be involved in the development process. Similarly, during the identification of the KPAs of the employees and supervisors alike, the relevant parties should be closely involved during the identification process.</p>
<p>Ultimately the incentive structure also needs to be discussed. Increasingly employees are being afforded the opportunity to provide inputs into this process. The more employees buy into the incentive strategy, the more likely it is to succeed. If employees see the benefits and the possibilities of them being achieved, it serves as motivational to its successful implementation. During the evaluation period, employees’ inputs to improving the system are also imperative to its continuing efficiency.</p>

<sec id="section46-0886368713485038">
<title>The Matter of Confidentiality</title>
<p>All the performance assessment rating scores of employees need to remain confidential at all times and may only be provided to third parties with the written consent of the employee concerned. The same principle applies to specific rewards within the incentive framework.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section47-0886368713485038">
<title>The Reporting of Performance-Related Pay Outcomes</title>
<p>All performance-related pay results of employees need to be kept in proper record-keeping systems. Such record keeping facilitates the collection of assessment data as and when required.</p>
<p>The Political Head of Department will determine which performance-related pay information may be included in annual reports of departments.</p>
