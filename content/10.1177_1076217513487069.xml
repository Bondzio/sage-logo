<title>Introduction</title>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>This paper is really exceptional! Who helped you with it? Did you use Cliffs Notes?</p>
<attrib>Teacher to Donna Y. Ford as a 10th grader</attrib>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In the previous issue of <italic>Gifted Child Today</italic> (GCT; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1076217513487069">Ford, 2013</xref>) focused on prejudice (beliefs and attitudes) and discrimination (actions and behaviors) using the theoretical frameworks of Gordon Allport and Robert Merton to inform, in part, why Black students were underrepresented in gifted education. She argued that deficit thinking (low and negative expectations) and prejudicial thinking about the capabilities of Black students keep them from being referred by teachers for gifted education screening, identification, and services. It was noted that the models by Allport and Merton were only two of many other models that inform not just underrepresentation, but also recruiting and retaining culturally different students in gifted education. A fuller treatment of recruitment and retention barriers for culturally different students appears in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1076217513487069">Ford (in press)</xref>.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>“To eliminate all types of microaggressions in gifted education, teachers require systematic and comprehensive multicultural coursework and professional development.”</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In this article, the coauthors continue this line of scholarship to concentrate on an equally relevant and timely theory of prejudice and discrimination—microaggressions—in the context of gifted education. As with the previous article, the dual purpose of the current article is (a) to (further) expose professionals in gifted education to attitudinal barriers that hinder, at best, and deny, at worst, access to gifted education for Black and Hispanic students and (b) to effect significant changes to advocate for and be professionally accountable for all the culturally different gifted students we must teach. Ultimately, we hope that sharing this third model will further help educators to decrease/eliminate underrepresentation and improve recruitment and retention among these culturally different groups.</p>
<p>It is not our intent to reiterate the need and rationale for addressing prejudice, and possible and real discrimination, in gifted education. To the point, readers can and must refer to the previous GCT article (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1076217513487069">Ford, 2013</xref>), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1076217513487069">Ford (in press)</xref>, and our individual and collective works with schools, communities, families, and culturally different students.</p>
<p>The data speak volumes—at <italic>no</italic> time in the history of gifted education have Black students been equitably represented (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1076217513487069">Ford, 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1076217513487069">2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1076217513487069">in press</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1076217513487069">Ford, Grantham, &amp; Whiting, 2008</xref>). The same holds true for Hispanic students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1076217513487069">Castellano &amp; Frazier, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1076217513487069">Ford, in press</xref>). In the majority of our publications and work with schools and organizations, we present gifted education trends for Black and/or Hispanic students, with attention to gender disparities. The experiences of Black males, Hispanic males, Black females, and Hispanic females are similar and different. Black males and Hispanic males, respectively, are the most underrepresented students in gifted education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1076217513487069">Ford, 2011</xref>). Gender differences cannot be ignored or trivialized in the gifted education recruitment and retention process (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1076217513487069">Ford, in press</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1076217513487069">Moore &amp; Flowers, 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>As we write this article, the most recent data reveal that Black and Hispanic students are <italic>again</italic> extensively underrepresented in gifted education as of 2012. Black students represent 19% of public schools that offer gifted services, but only 10% of gifted education enrollment in such districts. Hispanic students represent 25% of public schools offering gifted services, but only 16% of gifted education enrollment (U.S. Department of Education, Office for Civil Rights, retrieved from <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/docs/crdc-2012-data-summary.pdf">http://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/docs/crdc-2012-data-summary.pdf</ext-link>). As we describe next, microaggressions play a significant role in contributing to the problems associated with recruiting and retaining Black and Hispanic students in gifted programs.</p>
<p>Microaggression is the notion that specific interactions between those of different races and cultures are often problematic, and result in demeaning and insulting non-Whites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1076217513487069">Pierce, 1970</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1076217513487069">Sue and colleagues (2007)</xref> described microaggressions as brief and commonplace daily verbal, behavioral, and/or environmental indignities, intentional and unintentional, that communicate hostile, derogatory, or negative racial slights and insults toward racially different individuals and groups.</p>
<p>Microaggressions are demeaning subtle insults against non-Whites. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1076217513487069">Pierce (1970)</xref>, the chief vehicle for proracist behaviors is microaggressions. They are subtle, stunning, often automatic, and nonverbal exchanges that are put-downs of Blacks by offenders.</p>
<p>From the overview thus far, readers may be confused regarding the need to study microaggressions in the context of gifted education. In the following sections, we attempt to put this confusion to rest.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1076217513487069">
<title>Racial Microaggressions</title>
<p>Racial microaggressions pertain to understanding variables that influence intergroup relations. Teachers may ask students who have the highest grade(s) if they received assistance. The question may be innocent and not ill intended (recall Merton). However, when this and other situations are perceived as being tied to or a function of cultural differences, they become distinct and take on a different meaning. Subsequently, Black and Hispanic students subjected to microaggressions may experience or respond with anger, hurt, self-guessing, and other negative feelings and thoughts. Having their abilities second-guessed and interrogated can (and does) contribute to underachievement among culturally different students, which ultimately contributes to underrepresentation.</p>
<p>Derald Sue and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1076217513487069">Sue, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1076217513487069">Sue, Capodilupo, &amp; Holder, 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1076217513487069">Sue et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1076217513487069">Sue, Lin, Torino, Capodilupo, &amp; Rivera, 2009</xref>) proposed a classification of racial microaggressions where they described three types of racial transgressions:</p>
<list id="list1-1076217513487069" list-type="order">
<list-item><p><italic>Microassaults.</italic> Conscious and intentional actions or antilocution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1076217513487069">Allport, 1954</xref>), such as using racial epithets, racist jokes, displaying nooses, and/or deliberately complimenting a gifted White student but not a gifted Hispanic student who earned the same grade or test score.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Microinsults.</italic> Verbal and nonverbal communication that subtly convey rudeness and insensitivity, as well as demean culturally different students’ heritage and/or racial identity. One example is querying a gifted Black student how she or he got admitted in the gifted program, implying that she or he was admitted to fulfill some type of racial quota.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Microinvalidations.</italic> Communications that subtly exclude, negate, and/or nullify the thoughts, feelings, and experiences of Black and Hispanic students. For instance, teachers who ask a Hispanic student where she or he was born convey the message that the student could not possibly be born in the United States. This suggests that the non-White student is a foreigner in his or her own land (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1076217513487069">Ford, 2013</xref>).</p></list-item>
</list>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1076217513487069">Table 1</xref> presents the three types of microaggressions accompanied by examples specific to gifted Black and Hispanic students. These examples are not contrived; in our collective experiences, we have been witness to such statements, questions, and behaviors. And we have witnessed the psychological and social toll they placed on gifted students who are Black and Hispanic. The table has three columns that describe the specific theme, microaggression, and conveyed message(s) to gifted Black and Hispanic students.</p>

<title>Summary and Recommendations</title>
<p>The three microaggressions are powerful reminders that Blacks and Hispanics seldom have the privilege of being comfortably different. Their cultural differences from White students become the target of both overt (microassaults) and covert (microinsults and microinvalidations) racial prejudice. Microinsults and microinvalidations, often dubbed new or aversive racism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1076217513487069">Dovidio &amp; Gaertner, 1986</xref>), are the most difficult to prove because of their subtle nature. While the Black or Hispanic student(s) may feel insulted, she or he has trouble pinpointing why, and the perpetrator does not acknowledge that anything has happened because she or she professes to be unaware of having been offensive or insulting.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I didn’t mean to imply that he [Black or Hispanic student] did not do the work independently. It was just so well done that I, initially, had a hard time believing he did not get help. I was trying to be complimentary. (Teacher)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>To eliminate all types of microaggressions in gifted education, teachers require systematic and comprehensive multicultural coursework and professional development.</p>
