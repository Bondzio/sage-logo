<p>My ways of seeing <italic>Ways of Seeing</italic> are ubiquitous, pervasive, and at multiple remove from their origin point. That is to say, I was never assigned John Berger’s book as a student, though I tackled it on my own at some point. I’ve never taught it, though I often assumed that my grad students had been exposed to it earlier in their educations. When asked to create a lineage for my transmedia publishing initiatives, I always talk about Marshall McLuhan, Quintin Fiore and Jerome Agel’s <italic>The Medium is the Massage</italic> (1967), but only rarely mention <italic>WoS</italic>.</p>
<p>And yet, tasked with rethinking the 40th anniversary of its multiple birth – as video telecast, magazine articles, and print book – <italic>WoS</italic> now seems to me to have anticipated and informed a huge amount of my practice, whether I was aware of it or not. In terms of the transmedia approach that I have taken in multiple projects with the MIT Press,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1470412912444187">1</xref></sup> ranging from pamphlets to books to websites to apps, <italic>WoS</italic> was there decades before. The multi-pronged reading strategy – text, pull quote, remixed image – in the Dj Spooky-authored, COMA-designed <italic>Rhythm Science</italic> (2004): <italic>WoS</italic> lays claim to essays composed entirely of images. In shaping Bruce Sterling’s <italic>Shaping Things</italic> (2005), designer Lorraine Wild and I referenced early 20th-century instructional pamphlets when she decided to use text from the first page as the cover image, somehow eliding the fact that Richard Hollis did just that on <italic>WoS</italic>. The choice to grant substantial authorial credits to designers in <italic>USER</italic> (2005) and <italic>Digital_Humanities</italic> (2012)? The second page of <italic>WoS</italic> reads in its entirety: ‘A book made by John Berger, Sven Blomberg, Chris Fox, Michael Dibb, Richard Hollis’.</p>
<p>Before going further, I want to go back to the beginning – the title. Not one way, but many ways of seeing. This is an acknowledgement of the power of pluralism to invite design, new media and multiplex authoring to the table. This pluralism has become a key feature not only of my own practice, but also of the emerging Digital Humanities, in which teams of makers combine to create new modes of knowledge formation that could not be completed by single authors, no matter how multi-talented. The fact that Berger shared the profits from the first edition of the book equally among the group is a sign not merely of intellectual and economic generosity, but of a prescience about how large-scale, public dissemination of knowledge would evolve over the following half century.</p>
<p>The academic norm since the publication of <italic>WoS</italic> has been to find master theorists, from Barthes to Butler, Deleuze to Spivak, who do not even need first names, and then build around their work. But at least in my case, Berger is less like those name-checkable superstars and more akin to a designer. I’m thinking here of the kind of designer who shapes an interface, an object, a text, or a space without its users, readers, or inhabitants being consciously aware of his or her identity until the moment at which one determines that it was graphic designer Massimo Vignelli wayfinding you through New York City with his brilliant subway maps, or product designer Jonathan Ive who shaped the physical interface you’ve had with Apple i(ve)Macs, i(ve)Pods, i(ve)Phones, and i(ve)Pads over decades. If I write here about the forms and modes and media here rather than the ‘content’ of <italic>WoS</italic>, it is because Berger’s theories have had less visible influence on my practice than his methods.</p>
<p>This is not to say that Berger himself did not have an impressive capacity to deploy theories. <italic>WoS</italic> invokes Soviet filmmaker Dziga Vertov’s writing on the kino-eye’s mechanization of vision and German critic Walter Benjamin’s seminal account of art in an era of technological reproducibility. These two concepts form the backbone of Berger’s theoretical project in the first segment of the television show and chapter 1 of the book. On television, Berger plays an excerpt of <italic>Man With a Movie Camera</italic> and in print, he closes the chapter with the iconic image of the 20th-century intellectual: the shaggy haired, mustachioed, bespectacled Walter Benjamin, head tilted and resting heavily on his closed right hand, the thinker deep in thought.</p>
<p>I invoke Vertov and Benjamin not merely because of my affinity for both – as a media philosopher, how could I not engage with these two titans? – but rather to point out an interesting temporal inflection. In 1972, John Berger used restricted, ultra-high cost modes of production – working with Britain’s premier television network and mass market publisher – to popularize and disseminate avant-garde ideas about aesthetics and politics from four decades earlier. In 2012, art historians, visual and media studies professors, and virtually every other academic dealing with those cultural theories Berger brought to mass audiences, use new technologies and networks to disseminate Berger’s methods to ever-wider domains. In other words, Berger was the model for meta-aware media dons deploying sound and image, still and moving pictures, all in service of long-form arguments about art, culture and meaning. In this way, Berger is the exemplar of what I’ve called the ‘visual intellectual’, a culture worker who produces a post-print, or print-plus discourse, choosing to upload meaningfully after having downloaded mindfully (to use the language of my 2011 book, <italic>The Secret War Between Downloading and Uploading</italic>). Those of us who create multimedia Powerpoint slideshows that combine images and texts, who rip CDs or download music to accent our lectures, who count on YouTube and Vimeo to livestream once impossibly obscure videos, who repurpose our courseware as online, open sources of knowledge, who blog, vblog, tweet, and otherwise make use of the computer as culture machine, all of us are in some way massifying John Berger’s ways of showing four decades after he himself massified Vertov and Benjamin’s ways of seeing.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1470412912444187">Berger (1969)</xref> memorably wrote that, ‘criticism is always a form of intervention.’ For all the power of his arguments and the bombast he brought to them, there is also an underlying generosity to his interventions, a willingness to treat his project as unfinished business, a pluralism that resounds in the final line of the book, which stands alone on the last page: ‘To be continued by the reader.’ I hope to be around for the 80th anniversary of <italic>WoS</italic> to find out what even newer ways of seeing and showing and telling those future readers create.</p>
