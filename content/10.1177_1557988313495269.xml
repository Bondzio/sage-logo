<p>The evolution of men’s health as a concept in the social, psychological, emotional, and physical aspects of health continues to advance and create an awareness and presence in the general public. Men’s health is currently being integrated into many aspects of our lives. Whether this integration is a legitimate aspect of promoting men’s health status or a marketing strategy is yet to be fully known. For example, vitamins are promoted as targeting the health care needs of men and nutritional drink and snacks being promoted as nutritionally balanced for men’s specific health care needs. A question continues to surface regarding the evidence base for the promotion of these products, goods, or services. Regardless of the intent of this promotion of men’s health, these promotional strategies are increasingly presenting men’s health as something that needs to be addressed. As men’s health care professionals, this creates new challenges and provides a need for our increased awareness of the promotion of men’s health in a variety of nontypical health care areas.</p>
<p>Furthermore, information science has facilitated information explosion regarding men’s health. In addition, technological advances in our very mobile and electronically connected society have further promoted the explosion of information available to men’s health consumers, beyond the Internet. A simple search for apps on men’s health identified more than 134 apps available for free or a nominal fee that can be used by individuals interested in men’s health. These apps are diverse, from magazine apps to apps targeting general and specific men’s health information. The availability of this information presents further challenges for health care providers to remain current and knowledgeable about what information is available to men’s health consumers. This information explosion has been a great impetus for the evolution of men’s health; however, we must remain vigilant regarding the accuracy of this information. These advances in information technology provide opportunities for men’s health care professionals to partner with technology developers and information scientists to advance men’s health using these various technology modalities.</p>
<p>I support these technological advances in the area of men’s health; however, my remaining concern after exploring some of the information on men’s health on the Internet and available on mobile apps is regarding the accuracy and evidence to support what is promoted in the area of men’s health. Let us capitalize on these current initiatives but ensure that these products, goods, and services represent the best evidence in the area of men’s health.</p>
