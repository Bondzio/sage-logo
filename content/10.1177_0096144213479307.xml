<abstract>
<p>Late in the twentieth century public opinion began to turn against the Australian suburb, as its enemies began to outnumber its friends. For more than 150 years, Australia was itself a mental suburb of England, taking many of its ideas ready-made from the world’s metropolis, London. This article identifies the main ideological strands of the suburban idea as it first appeared in England—Evangelicalism, Romanticism, Sanitarianism, and Class Prejudice—and examines how they were reproduced, with occasional variations, in the colonial city. Critics of the suburban idea, it is argued, shared many of the tacit assumptions of its friends, differing only in the value they assigned to each component. Anti-suburbanism, even in its contemporary forms, continues to reproduce many features of its nineteenth-century antecedents.</p>

<p>Australia’s famously rebellious daughter Germaine Greer recently lobbed a grenade into the suburban backyards of her homeland. “I love Australia with a fierce passion that churns my guts and makes my eyes burn with tears of rage and frustration,” she protested. “But I would rather not be there.” The trouble with Australia, she explained, was its relentlessly suburban character.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>The reality is not Uluru or the Sydney Opera House but endless, ever-expanding replications of Ramsay Street that spread out as rapidly as oil stains on water, further and further from the tiny central business districts of the state capitals. Each street has a nature strip; each bungalow faces the same way, has a backyard and a front garden, all fenced, low at the front, high at the back. . . . If your ambition is to live on Ramsay Street, where nobody has ever been heard to discuss a book or a movie, let alone an international event, then Australia may be the place for you.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0096144213479307">1</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Greer was at least right about Australia’s demography. It is indeed one of the most suburbanized societies on earth. It was her characterization of her homeland as a spiritual Sahara, molded in the image of the soap opera <italic>Neighbours</italic>, that brought the wrath of everyone, from the Prime Minister down, on her unbowed head.</p>
<p>In attacking the spiritual emptiness of the suburbs, Greer and her Australian critics were joining a long argument. The suburb has a claim to being one of the most successful and least loved inventions of the modern era. Many intellectuals, being city people at heart, find the suburb a hard place to love. Even its friends are seldom more than half-hearted while its enemies are more inclined, like Greer, to sneer than to analyze. The suburb, to be sure, was a modest idea, a pragmatic accommodation with the great forces of the age rather than a heroic attempt to transcend them, yet it has proved far more resilient than many purer or nobler ideals.</p>
<p>Like a hardy hybrid, the suburban idea has flourished even in environments remote from its origins, and outlived most of the criticisms hurled against it. If it had been up to the intellectuals it would have been dead long ago, but it had merits that the intellectuals simply missed. The suburb was something that England invented, but its potential was only fully realized in the new lands that Britain colonized. Going back to its origins, and looking at how it was transplanted, may help us recognize some of the reasons for its remarkable durability.</p>
<p>The modern suburb was born, almost precisely, at the beginning of the Victorian era. From the end of the eighteenth century, cities across western Europe had begun to grow more rapidly. Yet in form and inner character, the cities of England were already subtly different from the rest. By the 1830s, on the outskirts of London and some of the new industrial towns, like Manchester, the crescents and avenues of the first middle class suburbs had begun to appear. In 1839 the architectural writer Samuel Brooks had declared, with some exaggeration, that England was “a country of suburban villas.” Suburban living, he believed, had become the goal of every “Englishman in whose mind the idea of retreat from business and country life are inseparably united.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0096144213479307">2</xref></sup> By the mid-1840s, the trend had become more obvious. “The vastness of suburban London distinguishes that city eminently from continental cities,” observed J. F. Murray in 1843. “A mile beyond Paris you are in a wilderness of bond hills, gypsum quarries, sterile rocks and windmills; beyond the walls of Rome there is literally an immense expanse of desert; whereas London . . . surrounds itself, suburb changing into suburb, like onions fifty on a rope.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0096144213479307">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>In 1850 London, with two and a half times Paris’s population covered an area four times as great. Six times as populous as Vienna, it covered an area twenty times as large.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0096144213479307">4</xref></sup> Yet London’s sprawl was nothing compared with that of its New World progeny. By 1890 Chicago, with a population only a quarter of London’s, covered an area more than 30 percent greater. In Australia the suburban trend was even more striking. By 1891 Melbourne, founded in 1835, only two years before Victoria ascended the throne, covered a territory as large as London’s even though its population was scarcely one-eighth the size.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0096144213479307">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>Something more than the sheer pressure of population fostered this distinctively Anglo-Saxon propensity to sprawl. Climate, economics, and new technologies of transport and production all played a part, but the early nineteenth-century English suburb was also a response to four great contemporary ideologies: Evangelicalism, Sanitarianism, Romanticism and Class Segregation. Each, at its core, was an ideology defined by the logic of avoidance—the determination to escape the vice, disease, ugliness, and violence of the city—as much as by the forces of attraction: the desire to embrace the virtue, health, beauty, and seclusion of the countryside. To understand its inner character and development, we need to ponder the cultural logic by which the suburban idea was shaped and reproduced.</p>
<sec id="section1-0096144213479307">
<title>Virtue</title>
<p>At the core of the English suburb is a distinctively English idea of domesticity.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0096144213479307">6</xref></sup> No other language, it is said, has a single word for “home.” The French say “chez nous,” the Germans say “haus” for both “house” and “home.” “An Englishman’s home,” the Victorians liked to say, “is his castle.” It is a revealing saying, both for its close alignment of domestic and national ideals and for the tone of defensiveness that underscores it. The home, like the island nation itself, was visualized as a fortress, a retreat, a place of sanctuary.</p>
<p>No one did more to codify and promote this conception of Home than the Victorians. But the origins of the idea lay even further back, in the Evangelical Revival of the mid-eighteenth century. Central to the Evangelicals’ message was the call to holiness and moral seriousness. Christians, said its founder John Wesley, must live a sanctified life, vigorously engaged in the affairs of the world, but resisting its spiritual standards. The Evangelical outlook was thus deeply dualistic; it saw life as a constant battle between spiritual forces: God and Satan, Heaven and Hell, Righteousness and Sin, Light and Darkness, the Spirit and the Flesh, the Christian and the World.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0096144213479307">7</xref></sup> In this spiritual warfare, Home was the Christian’s safest earthly stronghold.</p>
<p>Evangelical poets and tract-writers helped to disseminate the cult of Home more widely in British society. In their imagination, the family became both a nursery of virtue and a foretaste of Heaven.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Domestic happiness, thou only bliss</p>
<p>Of paradise that hast survived the fall! . . .</p>
<p>Thou art the nurse of virtue,</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>wrote William Cowper, the most popular of Evangelical poets.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0096144213479307">8</xref></sup> In his poems, the World from which the Christian flees is painted in recognizably urban forms: it is not a vale of tears so much as a crowded, restless, riotous street. Like other Evangelicals, Cowper saw great cities as putrid reservoirs of vice and corruption.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>… thither flow</p>
<p>As to a common and most noisome sewer,</p>
<p>The dregs and faeculence of every land.</p>
<p>In cities foul example on most minds</p>
<p>Begets its likeness. Rank abundance breeds</p>
<p>In gross and pamper’d cities sloth and lust</p>
<p>And wantonness and gluttonous excess.</p>
<p>In cities, vice is hidden with most ease,</p>
<p>Or seen with least reproach; and virtue taught</p>
<p>By frequent lapse, can hope no triumph there</p>
<p>Beyond th’achievement of successful flight.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0096144213479307">9</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Successful flight could be achieved either seasonally or permanently. Aristocrats and gentry shuttled between town and country according to the season, but the ideal bourgeois residence stood on the threshold between the two, within sight of the city, yet safely beyond its corrupting influence:<disp-quote>
<p>’Tis pleasant through the loopholes of retreat</p>
<p>To peep at such a world. To see the stir</p>
<p>Of the great Babel and not feel the crowd.</p>
<p>To hear the roar she sends through all her gates</p>
<p>At a safe distance, where the dying sound</p>
<p>Falls a soft murmur on th’ uninjured ear.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0096144213479307">10</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Evangelicals and nonconformists led the flight from the city. Evangelical members of the Church of England including Cowper, and his influential friends the Wilberforces and Thorntons—the so-called Clapham Sect—pioneered the suburbs southwest of London while another Evangelical, Lord Calthorpe, created Birmingham’s Edgbaston.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0096144213479307">11</xref></sup> In Manchester’s Victoria Park and Nottingham’s Park Estate, the Congregationalists were the prime-movers, while in Leeds it was the Methodists.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0096144213479307">12</xref></sup> Glasgow’s Kelvin Grove and Edinburgh’s Morningside took their character from the Free Presbyterians while in Dublin, Protestants (Church of Ireland and Presbyterian) were proportionally more than twice as numerous in the suburbs as in the city.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0096144213479307">13</xref></sup> Across the Atlantic, in New York’s Llewellyn Park and Chicago’s Riverside, evangelical Protestants were also to the fore in suburban development. 14</p>
<p>During the 1820s and 1830s, when the Evangelical James Stephen was Under-Secretary of the British Colonial Office, several of the Australian governors, including George Arthur in Van Diemen’s Land (1824–1836), Ralph Darling (1824–1831), and Charles La Trobe (Port Phillip 1839–1859), were Evangelicals themselves or were sympathetic to evangelical schemes of religious and moral improvement. In 1828, Darling founded Australia’s first suburb Woolloomolloo on the eastern outskirts of Sydney as a moral refuge for the “Exclusives,” the well-to-do free settlers of the colony, from the convict riff-raff of Sydney Town.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0096144213479307">15</xref></sup> Later in the century, in Melbourne’s Hawthorn and Camberwell, Sydney’s Ashfield and Mosman, and Adelaide’s Norwood and Magill, evangelical Protestants pioneered the middle-class suburbs, often reinforcing their respectability with legal controls on hotels, late-night drinking, prostitution, and sabbath-breaking.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0096144213479307">16</xref></sup></p>
<p>Evangelicals believed that the godly household was based on a divinely ordained division of roles between men and women. Men, under God, were the spiritual heads of the Home, but women were entrusted with the day-to-day management of the household. “Home,” write Leonore Davidoff and Catherine Hall in their superb study of the English middle class, <italic>Family Fortunes</italic>, “was business for women, haven for men.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0096144213479307">17</xref></sup> Contemporary household manuals drew on a common stock of imagery to describe this idealized separation of spheres between the sexes. Men were the lofty pines, women the clinging vines; men were the knights in armor, women the maids who waited; men were voyagers into a stormy sea; women were the keepers of the safe haven to which they returned.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0096144213479307">18</xref></sup> From the beginning, the suburb was coded feminine.</p>
<p>“That house only is well conducted where there is a strict attention paid to order and regularity,” advised Mrs Ann Taylor in her <italic>Practical Hints to Young Females on the Duties of a Wife</italic> (1815). “To do everything in its proper time, to keep everything in its right place, and to use everything for its proper use, is the very essence of good management.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-0096144213479307">19</xref></sup> “Keeping everything in its proper place”—both within the household and outside—was the first rule of bourgeois life. Domesticity was a spatial as well as an ideological concept, and its growing influence can be charted in both the changing architecture of the middle-class house and the changing geography of the city.</p>
<p>The desire for domestic privacy and seclusion would gradually remodel the wider urban environment. At its beginning, the typical neighborhood was a little world of its own, often hidden from the rest of the city to which it was connected only by a maze of narrow, illegible streets and alleys. The boundary between public and private space was indistinct. As ideas of domestic privacy gained ground, such promiscuous sharing of space became less acceptable to civic authorities, landlords, and working-class tenants alike. Increasingly local by-laws banned the construction of dead-end alleys and courts, back-to-back houses, and cellar dwellings.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-0096144213479307">20</xref></sup></p>
<p>The physical form of the neighborhood changed too: instead of tenements and flats arranged around narrow courts and alleys, later nineteenth-century houses were typically self-contained, with their own front and back doors, arranged in rows along wide and open streets. Some of these changes were encouraged by sanitary science; and some were arguably a sign of growing prosperity. The suburb was the logical extension of the desire, inspired in part by the Evangelical cult of Home, to reinforce the privacy of domestic life.</p>

<title>Health</title>
<p>“Cleanliness is, indeed, next to godliness,” observed John Wesley in one of his sermons. The Evangelical call to holiness implied a new sensitivity to all kinds of impurity and uncleanliness—spiritual, sexual, and physical. Reinforcing the dualities of God and the Devil, sin and righteousness, light and darkness, was the primal logic of what the anthropologist Mary Douglas has called “purity and danger.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-0096144213479307">21</xref></sup> Evangelical thinking, like the Hebrew Bible and the Pauline epistles from which it derived so much of its inspiration, was deeply shaped by metaphors of pollution, purification, and separation. “Come out from among them and be ye separate” was one of their favorite texts.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-0096144213479307">22</xref></sup> As Douglas insisted, there was no firm line between the religious and secular dimensions of such thinking.</p>
<p>There was indeed much in the early nineteenth-century city to flee. Cities simply stank. Long before the traveler crossed a city’s threshold, its presence had been announced by a rich mélange of stinks: of rotting garbage lying in the gutters, the contents of chamber pots emptied into the streets under cover of night, streams so laden with human filth that bubbles of hydrogen rose to the surface with an audible plop-plop, mounds of steaming horse manure lying in the street; the noxious fumes of glue factories, tanneries, and dyeworks; of soot and smoke billowing into the air, shutting out the sun and spreading layers of dirt on everything below. Even hardened city-dwellers often returned to their dwellings faint and nauseated by the smell.</p>
<p>Cities were also dangerous. By the 1840s, sanitarians had confirmed what most doctors had long suspected, that the life-expectancy of the average English city-dweller was barely half that of the rural-dweller.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-0096144213479307">23</xref></sup> The pioneer statistician William Farr compiled tables demonstrating a clear correlation between density and mortality. He even devised a mathematical formula to describe it: death rates varied according to the sixth root of density.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-0096144213479307">24</xref></sup> Density not only promoted physical disease, but moral contagion. “If human beings are crowded together moral corruption takes place, as certainly as fermentation or putrefaction in a heap of organic matter,” the Reverend John Montgomery told the Social Science Association in 1860.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-0096144213479307">25</xref></sup> Overcrowding broke down the natural inhibitions between human beings; it lowered their morale and predisposed them to depression, drunkenness, and sexual vice; and it made them nervous, quarrelsome, and coarse. Though its rationale was often obscure, the fear of density lay like an incubus on the Victorian urban imagination.</p>
<p>Health and hygiene, accordingly, were high among the attractions of the new suburbs. “The healthiness of the situation intended for a dwelling is obviously the first and most important consideration,” advised John Claudius Loudon in his best-selling <italic>The Suburban Gardener and Villa Companion</italic>. Perhaps the favorite epithet for the new middle-class suburb was “salubrious”: literally clean-aired. Loudon’s instructions on the proper location for a new villa were a distillation of contemporary sanitary wisdom. The ideal suburban demesne should be high, dry, and breezy.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>In the neighbourhood of towns, where the air is always more or less charged with smoke, an elevated site will always be found to have the clearest atmosphere; and, for persons in good health, it is generally allowed that the atmosphere should not only be free from impurities, but free from more than the average quantity of water held in suspension in the given climate.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-0096144213479307">26</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>A less elevated site might be equally healthy if it was exposed to freshening breezes, or close to the sea, where the bracing qualities of the air compensated for the dampness of the soil. In the neighborhood of larger industrial centers, a site on the windward side of the town was recommended. “In almost every situation, the wind prevails, throughout the year, more in one direction than in all the others; and hence, it is obvious that such winds must blow the smoke of the town or city, throughout the greater portion of the year, in the opposite direction,” Loudon reasoned.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn27-0096144213479307">27</xref></sup> To a striking extent, early nineteenth-century suburbanites, in Australia as well as in Britain, followed these precepts. The West End of London, the West End of Glasgow, Birmingham’s Edgbaston, the West End of Leeds, Manchester’s Broughton and Pendleton, Bristol’s Clifton, and Newcastle’s Jesmond are all on the high, dry, and windward side of the town.</p>
<p>Disciples of Edwin Chadwick made a strong contribution to the development of public health in Australian cities, and their belief in the environmental causes of contagious diseases continued to influence real estate agents and house purchasers well into the twentieth century. The most salubrious suburbs in Sydney and Melbourne were located beside the harbor (at Woollahra, Mosman or Hunters’ Hill) or the Bay (at Brighton or St Kilda) where residents enjoyed the benefits of fresh air and health-giving ozone, or on the picturesque hillsides on the city’s fringe (Bellevue Hill, Ashfield, Hawthorn, and Heidelberg). The expectation that suburbs produced good health was largely self-fulfilling. By the early twentieth century, when doctors found that suburban schoolchildren were taller and stouter than their slum counterparts, they often gave the credit to the suburb when it belonged to the comfortable incomes, well-stocked larders, and personal hygiene of the middle-class residents who flocked there.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0096144213479307">
<title>Beauty</title>
<p>The suburb was a product not just of contemporary morality and science, but it was also shaped by a new aesthetic, that of the Romantic movement in literature, art, and architecture. It reflected many of the leading impulses of the romantic movement at large: the pursuit of feeling rather than reason; of the organic rather than the artificial; of fancy rather than wit; of solitude rather than sociability; of nostalgia rather than aspiration. Yet the modern suburb was not a simple inversion of classical ideals. The naturalness it promised was necessarily a contrived naturalness, achieved only through a level of planning and superintendence greater even than that of the classical towns it supplanted.</p>
<p>The modern suburb was the hybrid offspring of antithetical architectural styles, the country villa or cottage and the townhouse. One of the striking features of the late eighteenth-century urban scene was the appearance, on the fringes of the towns, of new urban estates such as London’s Regent Park (1811–) and Edinburgh’s Second Newtown (1820–) displaying a new awareness of the town-dweller’s need for fresh air and semirural vistas.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn28-0096144213479307">28</xref></sup> John Nash’s design for Regent’s Park included several novel features, not exactly “suburban” in the modern sense, which nevertheless laid the groundwork for the emergence of the modern suburb: the adoption of lower residential densities, the creation of “natural” open areas for recreation, social homogeneity, the segregation of residential from retail and service areas such as shops and stables, and development under a single superintending ground landlord. The word “newtown,” which was sometimes applied to them, is suggestive both of their novelty and of their essentially urban character.</p>
<p>The nearest prototypes of the modern suburb were found not in the metropolis or the smoky industrial towns but in aristocratic resort towns like Cheltenham, Leamington Spa, Tunbridge Wells, and Bournemouth. It was in these places ostensibly devoted to health and exercise, where the wealthy gathered to bathe and take the waters, gossip and complain about their gout, that urban design began to move away from the formality of the classical newtown. In the Pittville Estate at Cheltenham (1824), the Calverley Park in Tunbridge Wells (1827–1828), and the Newbold Estate at Leamington (1827), houses and gardens are more closely integrated into schemes of naturally curving streets, detached houses, and secluded gardens.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn29-0096144213479307">29</xref></sup></p>
<p>The final step in the evolution of the modern suburb took place in the early 1830s when, first in Britain, and very quickly afterwards in the United States and Australia, suburbs designed expressly for middle-class commuters and embodying the ideal of rural retreat began to appear on the edge of the larger towns. The words <italic>retirement</italic> and <italic>retreat</italic>, like the word <italic>villa</italic>, had begun to carry a distinctively suburban connotation. In estates like Birmingham’s Edgbaston, Manchester’s Victoria Park (1837), Edinburgh’s Newington (1827), Nottingham’s The Park (1851), and Glasgow’s Kelvinside (1845), the imagery of romantic retreat was more deliberately invoked. Instead of the elegant geometry of squares, crescents, and circuses, the tree-lined avenues of the new suburbs followed sinuous curves that imitated the curves of nature itself. Instead of terraced houses and shared gardens, they offered detached houses with gardens of their own. By the late 1850s, architectural writers were beginning to decry “the rage which now prevails among builders for the formation of ‘squares’ in the suburbs.” What commuters wanted, they claimed, was not gardens dedicated to “semi-public use,” but “a plot, however small, for the special delectation of our family.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn30-0096144213479307">30</xref></sup></p>
<p>Simultaneously, architectural writers were beginning to codify the requirements of the ideal suburban house. The most influential of these suburban designers was the Scottish-born landscape designer John Claudius Loudon (1783–1843). The son of a Lowland farmer, Loudon had first made his reputation as a designer of greenhouses and gardens, but after his move to London in 1816, where he took up residence in a semidetached house in Bayswater, he embarked with his wife Jane (nee Webb) on a career as a writer and publisher on horticultural and architectural subjects. Together, over the next twenty years, they edited or wrote many millions of words on subjects as diverse as villa design, public parks, flora, and prefabricated housing. They founded the <italic>Gardener’s Magazine</italic> and the <italic>Architectural Magazine</italic>, edited encyclopaedias of gardening and architecture and wrote more than a score of books and pamphlets including, most notably, <italic>The Suburban Gardener and Villa Companion</italic> (first edition 1838). The Loudons’ ideas traveled fast and far throughout the Anglo-Saxon world. His villas and cottages became style-setters in both Britain and the United States, where their influence was rivaled by the New York architect Andrew Jackson Downing.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn31-0096144213479307">31</xref></sup> In keeping with the romantic, religious origins of the movement, the most popular suburban house designs in England and the United States were in a Gothic idiom, with the steep roofs, dormer windows, wide carved bargeboards and asymmetrical facades of ecclesiastical architecture.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn32-0096144213479307">32</xref></sup></p>
<p>In Australia, the suburban idea spread even more rapidly than in America. Loudon’s magazine was already circulating in New South Wales by the late 1820s and several of the villas erected on the shores of Sydney harbor, such as Colonial Surveyor Thomas Mitchell’s “Carthona,” were straight copies of designs published in the <italic>Suburban Gardener and Villa Companion</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn33-0096144213479307">33</xref></sup> From the shores of Port Jackson, the architecture rapidly diffused throughout the emergent Australian cities. The colonists’ early preference for Gothic, still visible in a small number of surviving villas and cottages in Sydney, Hobart, and Melbourne, was soon overtaken by a rage for Italianate, a secular, symmetrical style more in keeping with a Mediterranean climate, and better suited, in the long run, to both elite and popular forms of suburban architecture.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn34-0096144213479307">34</xref></sup></p>

<p>The modern suburb was not only an instrument of moral, aesthetic and sanitary improvement, it was also—at least at the beginning—a mechanism for class segregation. “I am disposed to consider very important ... the gradual separation of classes which takes place in towns by the custom which has gradually grown up, that any person who can afford it lives out of town,” observed John Garwood in 1853. “Now this was not so formerly; it is a habit which has, practically speaking, grown up within the last half-century.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn35-0096144213479307">35</xref></sup></p>
<p>When the well-to-do fled to the suburbs, they sought to place a protective cordon between themselves and a class on whose labor they relied but increasingly sought to avoid. This gulf, according to contemporary observers, was deepest in the new industrial towns where the mill-owning and mercantile class had abandoned the older residential districts for the safety—sanitary as well as social—of the suburbs. Thomas Harbottle, the Manchester manufacturer whose factory had been attacked by rioters in 1829, was among the promoters and first residents of Victoria Park, the picturesque suburb founded on the outskirts of the city in 1836.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn36-0096144213479307">36</xref></sup> When Leon Faucher, an observant Frenchman, visited Manchester in 1844, he found that “the town, strictly speaking . . . is only inhabited by shopkeepers and operatives; the merchants and manufacturers have detached villas, isolated in the midst of gardens and parks in the country. This mode of existence within the somewhat contracted horizon of the family circle, excludes social intercourse, and leads to a local absenteeism.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn37-0096144213479307">37</xref></sup></p>
<p>To many of the middle classes, suburban segregation was no more sinister than a natural desire to live among one’s friends. Loudon advised his readers<disp-quote>
<p>to choose a neighbourhood where the houses and inhabitants are all, or chiefly, of the same description and class as the house we intend to inhabit, and as ourselves. To go into a neighbourhood where the prevailing character of the houses indicated a smaller income than that of the individual choosing the residence, would be to incur a risk of being marked out as the rich man in the locality; while to choose one where the majority of the houses was of a higher class, would be to incur the risk of becoming unsocial on the one hand, or of being led in to unsuitable expenses, by associating with persons of higher fortune, on the other.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn38-0096144213479307">38</xref></sup></p>

<p>Loudon, an associate of Bentham and the Philosophic Radicals, had sought to bring the aristocratic ideal of country life within the reach of the urban middle classes.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>The master of a suburban residence, however small may be his demesne, may thus procure health and enjoyment at the same time, with more certainty than the possessor of a larger property; because his grounds lie more in his hands, and he can superintend every change himself. . . . All the necessaries of life may be obtained in as great perfection by the occupier of a suburban residence in the neighbourhood of London, who possesses £200 or £300 a year, as by the greatest nobleman in England, and at a mere fraction of the expense.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn39-0096144213479307">39</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The house designs in his <italic>Suburban Gardener</italic> ranged from the first and second-rate houses for merchants and wealthy tradesmen down to the third and fourth-rate houses for clerks, “respectable artisans” and “mechanics, in the suburbs of London, in inferior occupations.” In practice, however, Loudon recognized that suburban living was largely limited to the upper middle class with the means to travel to and from their city occupations.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn40-0096144213479307">40</xref></sup></p>
<p>Loudon’s desire to democratize the suburb was at odds with the desire of many of his followers, and of the developers of many suburban estates, to actively exclude social inferiors. Rather than encouraging the growth of cheap transportation, suburbanites often opposed the construction of new roads and railways. In 1820 when a new road was proposed to connect the infant suburb of Hampstead to London, local householders petitioned against it.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Hampstead is a very eligible situation for its nearness to the Metropolis. It has enough publicity at present. It is desirable, in order to meet the taste and choice of the Residents there for privacy, not to put in to practice any measure to make it more public. The Gentlemen there who fill official situations, or are in professions, or are Merchants in the first rank in the Metropolis, wish to preserve about their Dwellings the quiet and privacy which the country should secure for their refreshment and necessary retirement from active duties and pursuits daily prosecuted in the Metropolis. The quiet and privacy will be disturbed and diminished if, by the new Road, as designed, the idle, or pleasurable (not to say vicious) members of any portion of the Metropolis are to be drawn to Hampstead for objects of pleasure and crime.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn41-0096144213479307">41</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Much of the topographical terminology applied to new suburbs was coded class language. When a new estate was praised as “very select,” or the houses as “very superior,” it was the population as much as the landscape that was being described. Similarly, many of the mechanisms of environmental control had social, as much as hygienic or aesthetic, objectives. Minimum dwelling sizes implied minimum incomes; minimum garden sizes probably encouraged families with young children; the provision of gates and gatekeepers denoted security from thieves and robbers. The prohibition of public bars, a common feature of new suburbs, was adopted not because their residents were teetotalers but because, as the architects of Blythswood in Glasgow’s West End noted, pubs attracted ruffians to the neighborhood. The class war was thus a war often fought covertly and indirectly, by redrawing the bounds between private and public, by introducing physical barriers, like parks or gates, or social ones like covenants and restricted leases, by buying access and selling space in a hundred routine and seemingly innocuous ways.</p>
<p>Class segregation was probably a stronger motive for suburban development in the Old World than the New. In Australian cities, for example, attempts to create exclusive suburbs based on leasehold and restrictive covenants seldom survived a year or two beyond their foundation.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn42-0096144213479307">42</xref></sup> Edward Morris, an English gentleman immigrant, remarked on the social and visual “diversity” of Melbourne’s suburbs: “A poor house stands side by side with a good house, a cottage, one might almost say a hovel, in close proximity to a palace.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn43-0096144213479307">43</xref></sup> By the end of the nineteenth century, however, even Australian suburbs were beginning to become more differentiated socially, a process that was assisted by the tendency of real estate agents to promote their social status, and by the development of new forms of mass urban transportation that increasingly sorted populations along class lines. “The different suburbs have characters of their own,” Morris noted in a reconnaissance of Melbourne’s social landscape. In the 1920s, some Australian suburbs were beginning to reinforce their class character by introducing zoning schemes to define minimum allotment sizes or to exclude timber houses.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn44-0096144213479307">44</xref></sup> These, to be sure, were very mild measures of class segregation compared with the gated communities in some British and American cities.</p>
<p>To summarize: the suburban idea was an intellectual hybrid, born of a marriage between several powerful, and mutually reinforcing, ideologies. Its strength, and possibly its durability, derived in part from its appeal to diverse sections of the British diaspora. Some classes may have been more attracted to some aspects of the ideal than others, as may different regional components of the British population.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn45-0096144213479307">45</xref></sup> Sometimes it was framed defensively, by the logic of avoidance; sometimes more positively, around the attractive power of the countryside or the opportunity for independence. Similarly, local circumstances offered more or less opportunity to realize each dimension of the ideal, so even the meaning of the word <italic>suburb</italic> may have changed from place to place. In Australia, for example, the ideal became so nearly universal that almost every part of the city, even dense row-housing on the edge of the CBD, is still usually called a “suburb.”</p>

<title>The Enemies of the Suburban Idea</title>
<p>In the mid-nineteenth century, when its ideological foundations were strong, the suburban idea was more admired than followed, but towards the end of the century, as the suburbs spread more widely, it also began to attract a vociferous, if still tiny, band of critics. At the beginning, friends and enemies of the suburban ideal agreed on almost as much as they disagreed. Both worked within the physical determinist assumptions that undergird the “logic of avoidance.” Suburbanites, they assumed, would indeed be healthier, more virtuous, according to middle-class standards, more family-minded and closer to nature. If they disagreed, it was not so much because they thought that the suburbs made no difference to the lives of the suburbanites, but because they thought that they made the wrong sort of difference. What advocates of the suburban idea regarded as virtues, its enemies often regarded as vices. The suburb was simply <italic>too</italic> spacious, <italic>too</italic> clean, <italic>too</italic> safe, <italic>too</italic> conventionally virtuous, <italic>too</italic> sanctimonious.</p>
<p>Libertarians rebelled against the Evangelical morality that inspired its ideal of domestic privacy. Socialists opposed its effect on class segregation. By the 1890s new aesthetic movements, often influenced by European realism or decadence, began to question the romantic idealization of nature. Even the fears of bad air and overcrowding, that had energized the sanitary movement and driven protective parents to seek the safety of the suburbs, were slowly dissolving as doctors embraced more complex theories of bacterial transmission.</p>
<p>Although the suburban idea absorbed something of the moral atmosphere of Evangelicalism, its enemies typically adopted a more ironical, even frivolous, tone. William Thackeray, the satirist of London snobbery, also took aim at the saints of suburban Clapham in his comic novel <italic>The Newcomes</italic> (1855). Likewise, in <italic>Our Mutual Friend</italic> (1865), his contemporary Charles Dickens introduced “Mr and Mrs Veneering” as “bran-new people in a bran-new house in a bran-new quarter of London.” A decade later, the Melbourne novelist and critic Marcus Clarke took a Dickensian swipe at the gold city’s new rich in a satirical sketch of Mr and Mrs Wapshot, residents of “Nasturtium Villas,” a seaside suburb.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn46-0096144213479307">46</xref></sup> The sins of these suburbanites were the sins of the new rich everywhere: they had too much money and too little taste.</p>
<p>Only toward the end of the century, however, does the suburbanite emerge as an identifiable target of social commentary. Mr Pooter of “The Laurels” at Brickfield Terrace, Holloway, the comic hero of the delightful <italic>Diary of a Nobody</italic> (1888), is an obvious descendant of the Veneerings and the Wapshots, but his creators, George and Weedon Grossmith, portray him much more sympathetically. Like the Veneerings, he exemplifies the bourgeois preoccupation with respectability, but, as a humble City clerk, he simply lacks the means to match his pretensions, and much of the comedy comes from his clumsy attempts to keep up appearances. What endears him to us is his simple-hearted domesticity, his cheerful embrace of the suburban idea. “After my work in the City I like to be at home. . . . ‘Home, Sweet Home,’ that’s my motto,” his diary begins.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn47-0096144213479307">47</xref></sup> Content with the mundane round of horticulture and home improvements, and his little circle of like-minded friends, he is the prototype of a figure that appears, sometimes in more tragic guise, in the writings of Edwardian novelists, like H. G. Wells.</p>
<p>The most famous satirist of the Australian suburb, Barry Humphries, is a direct descendant of the Edwardian critics and their Australian imitators. Like them, he is a suburban refugee, though not from lower-middle-class Moonee Ponds, home of his most famous character Edna Everage, but from upper-middle-class Camberwell. During the 1950s Humphries, already an aficionado of 1890s Bohemianism, had read <italic>The Diary of a Nobody</italic> and decided to write a sketch of his own about a “decent, humdrum old man of the suburbs.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn48-0096144213479307">48</xref></sup> As his model he took Mr Whittle, an inoffensive old man he often passed on his way to the station. “Mr Whittle,” Humphries later recalled, “came to represent not merely my parents’ generation, but Respectability Itself. He represented punctuality, industry, courtesy, thrift, temperance, niceness. I despised him.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn49-0096144213479307">49</xref></sup> An Australian Mr Pooter, he became the model for the most affecting of Humphries’ gallery of Australian suburban types, Sandy Stone. As Edna Everage has evolved from mousy housewife to spangled superstar, and from satire to burlesque, Sandy has remained what he always was: a face for the deep pathos that Humphries detects beneath the complacent surface of suburban life.</p>
<p>According to its critics, the logic of avoidance, which had shaped the suburban idea, had finally created a morally timid and superficial way of life. Security, sedentary occupation, and respectability were the hallmarks of “the suburbans,” as C.F.G. Masterman calls London’s emerging lower middle class in his penetrating book <italic>The Condition of England</italic> (1909). “It is no despicable life which has thus silently developed in suburban London,” he writes. “Family affection is there, cheerfulness, an almost unlimited patience.” But while he could admire the simplicity of suburban existence, and even the suburban residents’ heroic struggle to raise themselves clear of poverty, there was something about its self-limiting, self-centered, and spiritually enervated atmosphere that left him dissatisfied. Like his contemporary H.G. Wells, Masterman recognized the troubling possibility that the suburbs—still, of course, only a small segment of London—might nevertheless become universalized. “Is this to be the type of all civilisations, when the whole Western world is to become comfortable and tranquil and progress finds its grave in a universal suburb? Or is the old shaggy and untamed earth going to shake itself suddenly once again and bring the whole edifice tumbling to the ground?”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn50-0096144213479307">50</xref></sup></p>
<p>As perceptive and even prophetic as it undeniably is, there is also an unmistakeable air of condescension running through Masterman’s critique of the suburbs. Masterman and Wells were themselves refugees from suburban London and, like many other critics of suburbia, their sense of its limitations was a measure of their self-proclaimed emancipation from the restrictions of youth. At its strongest, condescension could turn into alienation. In 1910 the Australian socialist playwright Louis Esson declared:<disp-quote>
<p>The suburban home must be destroyed. It stands for all that is dull, and cowardly and depressing in modern life. It endeavours to eliminate the element of danger in human affairs. But without danger there can be no joy, no ecstasy, no spiritual adventures. The suburban home is a blasphemy. It denies life. Young men it would save from wine, and young women from love. But love and wine are eternal verities. They are moral. The suburban home is deplorably immoral.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn51-0096144213479307">51</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Esson, a self-conscious Bohemian, whose own marriage was on the rocks, saw the suburban home as a symbol of the Puritan values that, by now, had taken a strong hold on the public life of Melbourne. In rejecting suburbia, he inverted the value system of its Evangelical creators but endorsed the equation between morality and urban form that underlay it.</p>
<p>To its critics, suburbia was as much a state of mind as a geographical place. Disenchantment with suburbia was a symptom of a more general disenchantment with Australia itself. “Much anti-suburban writing,” David Walker observes of Australian writers in the interwar period, “was derogatory rather than analytical.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn52-0096144213479307">52</xref></sup> Suburbia was not so much a characterization of an urban form as a convenient label for characteristics—stagnation, timidity, docility, mass culture—which inhibited the development of a more authentic national culture. It was a criticism of the habit of avoidance, rather than a defense of the things the suburb sought to avoid.</p>
<p>Since Australian cities were so uniformly suburban, there was actually little in the local landscape to represent the more liberating possibilities of urban life. Nettie Palmer had to sift her memories of prewar European travel for useful comparisons. The university towns of Germany, even the suburbs of Paris, had a charm that was missing in the suburbs of Melbourne. The trouble with the suburb, she concluded, was that it was neither city nor country. In promising the best of both, it had delivered the worst. It lured people “out and out, away from the centre, without assuring them of any positive advantages such as might accrue to little communities with parks, theatres and concert-halls of their own.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn53-0096144213479307">53</xref></sup></p>
<p>At the beginning, the attack on the suburban idea was mainly an attack on its culture, mounted largely by literary men. Only gradually did the offensive broaden to include a wider range of economic, environmental, hygienic, and social considerations. The evils of suburbia, according to a growing band of enemies, were manifest in an environmental disease they called “sprawl”. Like the suburb, “sprawl”—literally “an awkward or clumsy spreading of the limbs”—was an idea that originated in London where, by the 1930s, unplanned ribbon development on the fringes of the metropolis had begun to draw the fire of architects and planners. It conjured the image of a lazy, ill-mannered, inconsiderate invader of other people’s space, an offender against good manners, a careless steward of the national heritage. The first critics of sprawl were defenders of traditional country life like the architect Clough Williams-Ellis, whose 1928 book <italic>England and the Octopus</italic> was among the first to use the term. Williams-Ellis was a country gentleman and, through his wife, Annabel Strachey, an associate of the Bloomsbury set. From the windows of their beautiful house “Plas Brondanw,” they had watched with mounting horror as lines of pink asbestos bungalows spread along the Welsh coast, “like nettles along a drain, or lice upon a tapeworm.” Sprawl, in Williams-Ellis’s eyes, was not only an aesthetic abomination but a social disaster, the unwelcome democratization of the countryside. After almost three-quarters of a century, the term still carries more than a whiff of class snobbery.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn54-0096144213479307">54</xref></sup></p>
<p>A subtler critique argued that suburbia not only destroyed the countryside but the town as well. One of the most influential English writers on town planning in the interwar period, the prickly independent socialist Thomas Sharp, attacked the self-defeating, self-deceiving character of the suburb as “Neither-Town-Nor-Country.” He declared, “Every person who goes to the suburbs seeking the edge of the countryside pushes the countryside away from somebody else—and he in turn suffers from having it pushed away from him. The inhabitants of Suburbia continually thwart themselves and each other, and the more they strive to embrace the object of their desire the more it escapes them.” Suburbia, he continued, was also an escape from the communal life of the town: “The town as a place where, through their co-operative association, men expand their humanity, develop their culture, achieve and symbolise their civilisation, will cease to exist for most people; it may cease to exist altogether: it will disappear in the thin spreading twilight of the suburbs.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn55-0096144213479307">55</xref></sup> As Sharp—a working-class refugee from Britain’s industrial north—must have known, this was to compare the worst of suburbia with the best of town life. But in his sociological and political viewpoint, he anticipated the more comprehensive critiques of suburbia that would gain ground in Europe and America in the 1960s and 1970s.</p>
<p>Possibly the most influential critic of twentieth-century suburbia, the American planning advocate Lewis Mumford, began as a supporter. As a disciple of Patrick Geddes and admirer of the English Garden City, Mumford had also sought to achieve a new, more organic, relationship between city and country, technology and nature. In his 1938 book <italic>The Culture of Cities</italic>, he recognized the romantic suburb as expressing a “rational purpose”: the attempt to create “a biological environment on an urban basis.” If it was to be criticized, it was not for what it did, but what it failed to do.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn56-0096144213479307">56</xref></sup> By the time he came to write his most influential book, <italic>The City in History</italic> (1961), Mumford’s opposition had hardened. The suburb had expressed the aspiration of the urban middle class “to withdraw like a monk and live like a prince.” But now, “what only kings could demand” had become “the prerogative of every commoner.” In democratizing the suburban idea, its original promise had been fatally compromised. Residents of the post-war suburbs enjoyed neither society nor solitude. The dormitory suburbs were not just “child-centred,” but expressed “a childish view of the world.” The suburb, he writes in one of his more colorful passages, was “an asylum for the preservation of illusion.” Underlying Mumford’s florid rhetoric we may sense, not only the aesthete’s distaste for the standardization of “mass production, mass consumption and mass recreation,” but the patrician’s disdain for the suburban masses who often seem to share the characteristics (“bland,” “dreary,” “childish,” “innocent”) that Mumford attributes to the suburbs themselves.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn57-0096144213479307">57</xref></sup> In Mumford, as in many of the critics of suburbia, the suburb, typified as a place of illusion and retreat, is always contrasted with the city, the real world, where the great issues of civilization are being played out, and where the rich share civic responsibility with the poor. The worst effect of the logic of avoidance, in Mumford’s scale of values, was the avoidance of civic responsibility.</p>
<p>It is Mumford’s political or class critique of the suburb, rather than his disdainful view of its aesthetics or social atmosphere, that has had the most enduring influence. In the United States, where local property taxes determine so much of suburban amenity, and where race has become so potent a determinant of residence, the suburb was increasingly characterized, not just an asylum for the preservation of illusion, but a bastion of class and race prejudice. According to one of its defenders, the suburbs were characterized as “little more than exclusionary enclaves where affluent conformists congregate in order to avoid responsibility for the central city.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn58-0096144213479307">58</xref></sup> Under Ronald Reagan and his successors, the suburbs, in both northern and southern cities, became the territory of a Republican Party pledged to low taxes and low spending on the welfare of those they strangely called “minorities.”</p>
<p>The 1950s and 1960s, the decades that saw the triumph of the suburban idea, were also, paradoxically, the time when educated opinion turned against its ugly <italic>alter ego</italic>, “suburban sprawl.” “Sprawl,” as we noted previously, began its life as a put-down in the vocabulary of country gentlemen resisting the “uglification” of the rural–urban fringe. By the 1940s, however, under the influence of the great planner of Greater London, Sir Patrick Abercrombie, it had entered the professional lexicon of town planners throughout the English-speaking world.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn59-0096144213479307">59</xref></sup> In 1948, Abercrombie toured Australia, preaching the hot gospel of metropolitan planning. In Melbourne, he drew on his London experience to warn against the perils of “sprawl,” and urged the creation of a greenbelt to offer breathing space between the city and the countryside. But although he was against sprawl—the unplanned expansion of the city into the countryside—he was complimentary about Melbourne’s suburbs, describing its houses as the finest in the world.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn60-0096144213479307">60</xref></sup> The antidote to sprawl, in his way of thinking, was not densification but good planning. The metropolitan planning schemes adopted by Sydney and Melbourne in the 1940s and 1950s followed his lead, proposing green belts and green wedges, activity centers and firmer metropolitan boundaries, but seldom directly challenging the low-density suburban way of life.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn61-0096144213479307">61</xref></sup></p>

<sec id="section6-0096144213479307">
<title>The Pyrrhic Victory of the Suburban Idea</title>
<p>Both the intellectual creators of the suburb and its critics shared a conviction that a particular urban form—low density, detached house and garden, in a semirural setting, remote from the city—would create, or at least facilitate, a desirable way of life: quiet, secluded, law-abiding, family-centered, perhaps conservative. They differed not about the power of the idea but about the value that they placed on it. The one’s utopia became the other’s dystopia.</p>
<p>That idea was only as strong, however, as the link between the ideology and the urban form. Over the century or so since the emergence of the first modern suburbs the ideological foundations of the suburban idea were gradually crumbling. The sentimental idea of Home, as a haven in a heartless world, survived the decline of Evangelical Christianity, and even its secularized version, Respectability. By the 1970s, however, the family was itself undergoing radical changes, especially the massive entry of married women into the paid workforce. The sanitarian’s belief in the healthiness of a semirural environment also proved more tenacious than the anticontagionist theories of disease on which it was based, yet by the 1970s the automobile suburb was generating new pathologies of its own and environmentalists were beginning to condemn the suburbanites’ profligate use of land and water as vigorously as their forefathers had condemned the squalor of the slum. After the Second World War, modernist architects and planners rebelled against the nostalgic and romantic impulses that had inspired so much of the physical character of the suburbs. And, most significantly of all, the application of the techniques of mass production, and the postwar building boom, so universalized the suburban form that its character as an exclusive middle-class retreat was finished forever.</p>
<p>It was not really until the 1960s that social scientists began to question the environmental determinism that underlay what one of them now dubbed “the suburban myth.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn62-0096144213479307">62</xref></sup> Both the traditional critics and defenders of the suburb had succumbed to the same flawed logic. Because the suburb was <italic>intended</italic> to foster domesticity, health, beauty, and class solidarity, they assumed that it did so, and differed only on whether these were the highest values. It was only when the suburbs became more extensive and diverse that people began to recognize that you could find just as much domestic misery, ill health, ugliness, and class conflict in the suburbs as in the city. Conventional accounts mistakenly equated the suburb, as a built form, with the ways of life of the middle class who had long monopolized them. But working-class suburbs, as the American sociologist Herbert Gans argued, could exhibit ways of life and outlook as diverse as the people who lived in them.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn63-0096144213479307">63</xref></sup></p>
<p>A rash of Australian studies added to the doubts. Robin Boyd’s <italic>The Australian Ugliness</italic> (1960) deplored the “uglification” of the countryside as tree-haters and featurist architects shaped the new suburbs.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn64-0096144213479307">64</xref></sup> Patrick Tennison’s <italic>The Marriage Wilderness: A Study of Women in Suburbia</italic> (1972) depicted the loneliness and depression among suburban housewives.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn65-0096144213479307">65</xref></sup> Political scientists probed the complex interrelations between location, class, and politics on Melbourne’s suburban fringe and the “circumambient apathy” that seemed to characterize it.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn66-0096144213479307">66</xref></sup> Hugh Stretton’s <italic>Ideas for Australian Cities</italic> (1970) offered the most penetrating discussion of the trade-offs between urban density and the suburban way of life. Yes, he agreed, “plenty of dreary lives are indeed lived in suburbs. But most of them might well be worse in other surroundings.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn67-0096144213479307">67</xref></sup> The house in a garden had many virtues, not least its flexibility. Stretton’s aim was not so much to defend the suburb as to question the logic of both its critics and defenders.</p>
<p>Paradoxically, it was the widespread realization of the suburban idea that finally proved its undoing. Only when almost everyone was a suburbanite did it finally become clear that similar places could in fact mean different things to those who lived in them. Social critics were quicker to spot the physical determinist flaws in the idea of the slum than they were to recognize the similar skewed logic in the idea of the suburb. As Germaine Greer’s remarks illustrate, some of them have not caught up yet. Rather than surrender their disapproval, they may prefer to detach “suburbia”—a metonym for a loathed way of life—from the geographical realities of the suburb.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn68-0096144213479307">68</xref></sup></p>
<p>Antisuburbanites have been as slavish in their imitation of international fashions as the suburbanites were before them. Suburbia, they often argued, produced a stultifying conformity, yet as Stretton observed, “conformist imitation is itself a strongish feature of suburban intellectuals’ manifestos about suburban life.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn69-0096144213479307">69</xref></sup> The uncritical adoption by Australian commentators of the pejorative term <italic>McMansion</italic>—originally coined by the American environmentalist Jay Westervelt to describe medium-density houses in southern California—illustrates this tendency. In fact, the material and social character of suburbanization in the two societies are very different. In the United States, the middle classes have deserted the inner city for the suburbs, largely in order to avoid the costs and risks of sharing the inner city with poorer black and Hispanic neighbors. Some of the most criticized aspects of American suburbia, such as gated communities, fiscal selfishness, religious and political conservatism—and now subprime loans—are shaped by forces that are either absent, or much less powerful, in Australia. Here, by contrast, the upper middle classes have been deserting the suburbs in droves, forsaking the haciendas and swimming pools of Commodore Country for the terrace houses and restaurants of Cappuccino Country.</p>
<p>The suburb as a physical form has long outlived the ideologies that gave it birth. Yet in Australia and elsewhere, the suburbs continue to grow. The forces that propel them are largely economic and pragmatic and they now have to make their way against planning orthodoxy, rather than with its support. The most serious strike against the suburb is now environmental: its profligate consumption of land, energy, and water. “We are full of regret for our gluttonous consumption of space and now we are questioning the ideology on which our lifestyle is based,” journalist Tony Collins observed in 1993. “As a nation we are in therapy, slowly coming to terms with the consequences of our over-indulgence.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn70-0096144213479307">70</xref></sup> Collins was preaching a new austerity on behalf of the Hawke Government’s Better Cities Program and its policy of urban consolidation. The suburban idea was losing its moral legitimacy. The new antisuburbanism in Australia echoed the arguments of North American critics, inveighing against gated communities (even though there were few in Australia), nostalgic cookie-cutter architecture, and the false comforts of home-ownership.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn71-0096144213479307">71</xref></sup> After two decades of moralizing, the critics have succeeded, not so much in killing the suburban ideal, as in cutting it down to size. Even among the intellectuals, however, they have not had it all their own way, although scepticism about the virtues of urban consolidation does not necessarily translate into a full-blooded defense of the suburban idea.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn72-0096144213479307">72</xref></sup></p>
<p>After two centuries of hegemony, the tide has turned against the suburban idea. The most prestigious ways of living among university-educated professionals in Sydney and Melbourne are dense, urban, and cosmopolitan rather than sparse, monocultural, and suburban.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn73-0096144213479307">73</xref></sup> Theirs is the voice, self-righteous and condescending, that now dominates public commentary on the suburbs. The urban fringe is increasingly the refuge of the so-called aspirationals, a working class that often feels excluded from the national conversation. Real estate promoters still invoke the familiar rhetoric of <italic>rus in urbe</italic>, or attempt to graft it onto the language of urban sophistication (“Latte by the Lake” was the slogan of one recent suburban development on Melbourne’s western edge). But the suburban idea seems more like a marketing stratagem than the popular ideal it had once been. Its day is not yet over, but its heyday has passed.</p>

<p>The measurement of urban mortality was a statistically difficult and much debated matter, since it was difficult to make due allowance for the different age structures of populations and statistical measures were highly sensitive to the effects of infant mortality.
