            <p>This experimental study investigates the impact of short-messaging service (SMS)—text messaging—on social connectedness and group attitude in student technical communication projects. It also investigates message types and communication medium preferences. Using a between-subjects design, the experiment compares two student groups: SMS only and non-SMS. The results indicated several statistically significant differences. Compared to students in the non-SMS group, students in the SMS-only group (a) communicated more, (b) felt more connected, and (c) sent more questions, answers, and nonproject-related messages. These results provide empirical evidence for using SMS in team contexts.</p>

      <p>Considerable technical communication scholarship has investigated computer-mediated communication, particularly e-mail and instant messaging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1050651912468888">Ishii, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1050651912468888">Lam, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1050651912468888">Lam &amp; Mackiewicz, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1050651912468888">Lee &amp; Lee, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1050651912468888">Mackiewciz &amp; Lam, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1050651912468888">Pendharkar &amp; Young, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1050651912468888">Volkema, Fleck, &amp; Hofmeister, 2011</xref>). But no studies in technical and professional communication have examined text messaging in any capacity. Text messaging, or short-messaging service (SMS), however, is a worthwhile topic for technical communication scholars, instructors, and practitioners because it represents an exponentially growing medium. As technical communicators, it is essential to our scholarship and profession to grow and evolve as technology does. According to Nielson mobile, in 2008, SMS users aged 45 and under used SMS more than they used actual phone calls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1050651912468888">Nielson Mobile, 2008</xref>). Thus, the primary mode of communication on mobile phones is no longer the traditional phone call, but rather SMS. Further, in 2010, 72% of adult mobile phone users reported using SMS regularly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1050651912468888">Pew Research Center, 2010</xref>). SMS, then, is clearly a communication medium that is highly used—and not just by teenagers and college students. According to Pew’s data, however, SMS use for work-related communication is limited: Only 15% of adult SMS users reported using SMS for work several times a day. </p>
      <p>Outside of the technical communication field, one prevalent stream of research in SMS has focused on the social component, specifically the role of SMS in relationship building and maintenance. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1050651912468888">Rettie (2003</xref>) found that “connectedness” was a factor in media choice among teens and college students. Further, participants reported higher levels of connectedness when using SMS as opposed to e-mail. Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1050651912468888">Reid and Reid (2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1050651912468888">2010</xref>) reported that users of SMS formed deeper relationships with people in their “text circles” due to the immediacy, perpetual contact, and near conversational nature of SMS. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1050651912468888">Wallace and Mundell (2003</xref>) also found that college students using SMS “develop(ed) a good working relationship with their partner” (p. 105). Although research on SMS in the workplace is limited, the research that does exist has reported similar findings, linking SMS to managing work relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1050651912468888">Ekanjume, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1050651912468888">Kim, Kim, Park, &amp; Rice, 2007</xref>). </p>
      <p>As a response to the lack of research on SMS in the workplace and as an extension to the ample research on the role of SMS in relationship building, my study empirically examines the impact of SMS use in work-related communication. More specifically, this article describes an experiment involving students who are working on a technical communication team project. The experiment compares two conditions, one in which the participants used only SMS and the other in which the participants used any communication medium except SMS. Because no studies on SMS exist in technical communication scholarship, this will be the first study to guide technical communicators in this growing medium. Additionally, no studies have used experimental methods to test the efficacy of SMS.</p>
      <p>First, I provide an overview of the relevant literature followed by a detailed outline of the hypotheses and research questions that drive the study. Then, I describe and justify my method for the study. I present the results for each major hypotheses and research question and then a discussion on each. This discussion includes the implications of the findings for scholars, instructors, and practitioners of technical communication. Finally, I point out the limitations of this study and directions for future research.</p>

         <title>Literature Review</title>
         <p>SMS is a unique communication medium even when compared to other computer-mediated forms of communication such as e-mail. For example, SMS allows users to have “greater command over the expressive content of a communication” because they can carefully construct a message or response without the “multiple distractions of real-time social interaction” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1050651912468888">Reid &amp; Reid, 2010</xref>, p. 4). Although e-mail and other forms of computer-mediated communication also allow for this careful construction, SMS users report that they use the medium conversationally, making it function much more in real time than e-mail does (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1050651912468888">Fox, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1050651912468888">Grinter &amp; Eldridge, 2003</xref>). Additionally, SMS allows users to think about and manage face (defined by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1050651912468888">Goffman, 1969</xref>, as positive self-image) relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1050651912468888">Ling, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1050651912468888">Ling &amp; Yttri, 2002</xref>). Finally, SMS may allow users to be more honest and candid compared to other communication media (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1050651912468888">Hashimoto, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1050651912468888">Ito, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1050651912468888">Plant, 2001</xref>). </p>
         <p>In the following literature review, I survey research from a few relevant areas. First, I present research that intersects SMS use and interpersonal relationships, then I briefly discuss SMS use in professional settings, and finally, I describe research on functional uses for SMS.</p>

         <title>SMS, Interpersonal Relationships, and Connectedness</title>
         <p>One SMS topic that has been thoroughly investigated is the impact of SMS on interpersonal relationships. Much of this research suggests that people who regularly use SMS report having increased feelings of social <italic>connectededness</italic>, which <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1050651912468888">Ijsselsteijn, Van Baren, and Van Lanen (2003</xref>) have defined as the “feeling of being in touch with the other” (p. 928). SMS seems to be an effective medium for creating a sense of connectedness because SMS users can perpetually be in contact with fellow users (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1050651912468888">Katz &amp; Aakhus, 2002</xref>). Providing further evidence linking SMS to connectedness, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1050651912468888">Faulkner and Culwin (2005</xref>) categorized a corpus of SMS messages written by U.K. teenagers and found that more than half of these messages were used for interpersonal maintenance. Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1050651912468888">Döring (2002</xref>) also categorized and coded SMS messages and found that more than half of the messages were used “primarily [to] maintain relationships” (p. 3). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1050651912468888">Pettigrew (2009</xref>) investigated SMS use specifically within dyads in which the partners already had a close relationship. Results indicated that users found that SMS allowed them to be in perpetual contact with their partners, which in turn led to their increased feelings of connectedness. In the same vein, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1050651912468888">Coyne, Stockdale, Busby, Iverson, and Grant (2011</xref>) examined SMS use within dyads in which the partners were involved in romantic relationships. Overall, the results indicated that SMS was used by these participants more than any other communication medium and was often used as means to express affection and stay connected.</p>
         <p>
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1050651912468888">Reid and Reid (2010</xref>) found that SMS users, particularly young, single, and socially anxious users, “take advantage of the social functionality” of the medium to “enrich their personal relationships” (p. 3). Similarly, the notion of <italic>virtual copresence</italic>, the concept that people who are geographically apart can still feel present with one another, has been linked to the SMS medium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1050651912468888">Hjorth, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1050651912468888">Ito &amp; Okabe, 2005</xref>). Even between strangers, SMS has been found to create virtual intimacy via virtual copresence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1050651912468888">Grinter &amp; Eldridge, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1050651912468888">Ling, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1050651912468888">Ling &amp; Yttri, 2002</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1050651912468888">Kim, Kim, Park, and Rice (2007</xref>) surveyed South Koreans about their communication preferences and found that respondents used SMS specifically to expand relationships with “weak ties” (p. 1183). Finally, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1050651912468888">Lin and Tong (2007</xref>) pointed out that SMS can be used to maintain interpersonal relationships not only by providing a sense of intimacy but also by eliminating negative aspects of face-to-face interactions or other synchronous forms of computer-mediated communication:</p>
         <disp-quote>
            <p>[SMS is used to] maintain social relations in modern society, and affords resources to achieve a sense of co-presence of intimacy with both existing friends and new acquaintances, while avoiding having to deal with the fluster and embarrassment of a face-to-face interaction or the intrusive disturbance of a phone call. (p. 312)</p>
         </disp-quote>
         <p>Thus, even though negative aspects of SMS communication exist (e.g., limited autonomy), a significant amount of research focusing on SMS and interpersonal relationships provides strong evidence suggesting that there are many positive relational outcomes of SMS use. SMS can be used to foster and maintain relationships between people who are already close with each other, as well as between acquaintances who do not know each other well. Much of this research, however, has been conducted in contexts that differ from that of my study. That is, many of the studies in this literature review rely on self-reports from participants who reside in countries outside the United States, including the United Kingdom, South Korea, Japan, Pakistan, Finland, and Australia. Results from those international studies, therefore, may not be directly applicable to this study. Although this study is not specifically focused on culture as a variable, we need to keep in mind cultural differences. For example, according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1050651912468888">Hofstede, Hofstede, and Minkov (2010</xref>), each national culture cited in this literature review scores lower on the individualism dimension than does U.S. culture. These cultural differences could perhaps influence the effect that SMS might have on connectedness and other relational outcomes. Because of the lack of research on the impact of SMS on interpersonal relationships that uses U.S. university students as participants and because previous research has yet to examine how SMS might affect interpersonal relationships in this specific context, this study explores the connective nature of SMS in the specific context of student team projects at a U.S. university. </p>
         <sec id="section3-1050651912468888">
            <title>SMS in Professional Settings</title>
            <p>While a majority of the research on SMS has studied non nonprofessional contexts, a small body of literature has investigated SMS in professional contexts. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1050651912468888">Ekanjume (2009</xref>) conducted a sociolinguistic analysis of the use of SMS by an academic staff at a university. In that analysis, the author described SMS as a medium that is “dynamic, mobile, individualistic and bonding largely due to its unique linguistic style” (p. 15). This theme of “bonding” or connection arises even in research focusing on professional contexts. In Kim et al.’s (2007) study, more than 60% of the respondents to their South Korean national survey worked for a living in some capacity (i.e., they were not students). One major finding of this study was that among those full-time workers, SMS was used specifically for “management of work relations” (p. 1203). Much like <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1050651912468888">Ekanjume (2009</xref>), Kim et al. found that SMS can indeed be used to manage relationships within the workplace, providing further evidence that the use of SMS to manage relationships extends to contexts outside of social relationships. Finally, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1050651912468888">Galushkin (2003</xref>) presented an argument for SMS use in distributed organizations, asserting that SMS may be effective in organizations because it can help remove hierarchical boundaries. More specifically, it allows subordinates to carefully craft and edit responses to their leaders without having to worry about other information cues such as body language. These assertions are similar to Lin and Tong’s (2007) findings.</p>
            <p>Although limited research specifically examines SMS in professional contexts, the research that does exist suggests that the unique affordances of SMS might also apply in professional contexts. This study extends this line of research by examining how SMS may affect relationships on a team project. Although the population of this study is undergraduate students, the context in which the participants communicated closely resembles that of a professional workplace. More important, this study investigates SMS as work-related communication as opposed to personal communication. </p>

            <title>Functional Uses for Text Messages</title>
            <p>In addition to the literature on SMS in interpersonal relationships and on SMS in professional settings, there is research that may aid in shifting the paradigm of typical SMS usage. SMS is often stereotyped as a medium that young people use to communicate informal messages, such as scheduling leisure activities with friends. But recent research has investigated more functional uses for SMS. Several studies examine text messaging as a means for communicating an intervention or training protocol. For instance, SMS has been tested and found to be useful as a communication reminder that aids schizophrenics in their daily functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1050651912468888">Pijnenborg et al., 2012</xref>), a support tool for parents who experience violence from their adolescent children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1050651912468888">Howard, Friend, Parker, &amp; Streker, 2010</xref>), and a system for deliverying an intervention to people with eating disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1050651912468888">Bauer, Okon, Meermann, &amp; Kordy, 2012</xref>).</p>
            <p>Similarly, several studies examine text messaging as a communication medium for health professionals. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1050651912468888">Joyce and Weibelzahl (2006</xref>) reported on a program that used SMS to communicate vital mental health messages to depressed youth. Two studies have found that SMS can be an effective tool for promoting awareness about sexually transmitted diseases to high-risk groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1050651912468888">Dobkin et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1050651912468888">Gold et al., 2010</xref>). Another study has found that using SMS as a reminder system increases patients’ attendance at doctor’s appointments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1050651912468888">Geraghty, Glynn, Amin, &amp; Kinsella, 2007</xref>). Finally, two studies have tested SMS as a means for helping adolescents and young adults to stop smoking. These studies suggest that sending SMS interventions is a relatively inexpensive and effective way of promoting smoking cessation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1050651912468888">Haug, Meyer, Dymalski, Lippke, &amp; Ulrich, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1050651912468888">Rodgers et al., 2005</xref>).</p>
            <p>Based on the studies cited in this literature review, SMS is clearly a more robust communication medium than stereotypes might suggest. Furthermore, scholars outside of the technical communication field have begun to embrace a paradigm shift, now viewing SMS as a highly functional medium. SMS, of course, will not replace traditional forms of communication or intervention programs, and research does not suggest that it will. But SMS can effectively supplement traditional forms of communication as technology and our relationships to technology continue to evolve. It is time to empirically examine this technology that we once dismissed as juvenile in order to determine what benefits SMS might provide for scholars, teachers, and practitioners of technical communication.</p>

         <p>Hypotheses 2 and 3 fall directly in line with previous literature that has pointed out the impact that SMS use has on interpersonal relationships (Grinter &amp; Eldridge, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1050651912468888">2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1050651912468888">Lin &amp; Tong, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1050651912468888">Ling, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1050651912468888">Ling &amp; Yttri, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1050651912468888">Reid &amp; Reid, 2010</xref>). Further, research in professional contexts supports the notion that SMS use has an impact on working relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1050651912468888">Ekanjume, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1050651912468888">Galushkin, 2003</xref>; Kim et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1050651912468888">2007</xref>). Although previous research provides a strong basis for these hypotheses, no empirical studies have tested these hypotheses specifically in team projects. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1050651912468888">Figure 1</xref> illustrates the theoretical model that this study tests.</p>

         <p>In addition to those three hypotheses, this study examines some additional research questions. These questions are not presented as hypotheses because they have not been addressed in previous literature, so they are better served as areas for inquiry:</p>

            </list-item>
         </list>
         <p>As part of my research design, I randomly assigned participants either to use SMS exclusively or to not use SMS at all. Because participants in one of the groups are allowed to choose any medium but SMS, I am interested in discovering what medium they will choose most. Medium choices and patterns can provide insight into communication behavior in team projects. Examining such insights are essential in order to assess and target areas for improvement in student communication behavior. </p>

            </list-item>
         </list>
         <p>As part of the research design, I instructed participants to log all communication, including the date, time, sender, receiver, and type of message. Throughout the study, I categorized and adapted the types of messages based on linguistic speech act theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1050651912468888">Austin, 1955</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1050651912468888">Searle, 1976</xref>) in order to investigate whether the communication medium has an impact on the types of messages participants are willing to send. For example, because SMS only allows users to send messages of 140 characters or less, will participants who use SMS be less likely to send messages that involve important questions about the project? By examining the types of messages each group sends, I may be able to determine what, if any, medium restrictions SMS poses.</p>

         <title>Method</title>
         <p>Before presenting the results of this investigation, I need to describe my method for the study—the participants, research design, instruments, and procedure. This study was approved by my university’s Institutional Review Board.</p>
         <sec id="section7-1050651912468888">
            <title>Participants</title>
            <p>I recruited a total of 49 participants from a population of undergraduate students enrolled in technical communication courses at a large state university in the southern United States. I used an a priori power analysis, which employs statistical assumptions to calculate the optimal sample size for a particular statistical test, to determine the sample size. The analysis assumed an α level of .05, a power level of .8, and an effect size of .4 based on previous benchmarks set in psychological research. The results of this analysis indicated that 52 participants would be an appropriate sample. My sample of 49 participants, therefore, is appropriate based on the power analysis.</p>
            <p>Participation in the study was voluntary. Students received background information about the study and were informed that they would earn a small amount of extra credit in exchange for participation. Of these 49 participants, 26 were women and 23 were men. The median age of the participants was 21.</p>
            <p>Each participant was enrolled in one of the two technical communication courses: a course on Web writing, design, and development and a second course on manual and procedures writing. Both courses required team projects and worked with the same external client. I recruited participants enrolled in these two courses because both courses are writing intensive and highly collaborative.</p>

      <sec id="section8-1050651912468888">
         <title>Research Design</title>
         <p>The research was designed as a simple between-subjects experiment, so each participant, and their subsequent responses, belonged to only one experimental group. The study had one independent variable, communication medium, with two levels: SMS only and non-SMS. The SMS-only group used only text messaging for all team communication done outside of class throughout the duration of the project. The non-SMS group used any other communication medium except SMS throughout the duration of the project. The study had two dependent variables: mediated social connectedness and group attitude. I collected data for the two dependent variables twice during the study: once after 4 weeks and again after 8 weeks. I collected data twice in order to provide a view of the teams at two unique stages of the project.</p>
         <sec id="section9-1050651912468888">
            <title>Instruments</title>
            <p>To measure the data, I used two instruments: the Mediated Social Connectedness scale and the Group Attitude scale.</p>
            <p>The Mediated Social Connectedness scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1050651912468888">Gonzales, 2009</xref>) measures the effectiveness of a technology tool in establishing social connections. The internal reliability for this 5-item scale is high (α  = .76), but it has only been initially validated and would benefit from further validation. Here is one of the items that this scale measures: “When I am using this system, I don’t feel that others are concerned about me as a person.”</p>
            <p>The Group Attitude scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1050651912468888">Evans &amp; Jarvis, 1986</xref>) measures the attraction that group members have to their group. This 20-item scale has a high internal reliability (ᾳ = .90–97). Here is one of the items that this scale measures: “I feel involved in what is happening to my group.”</p>

         <sec id="section10-1050651912468888">
            <title>Procedure</title>
            <p>After introducing students to the study and receiving their consent, I randomly assigned them to one of two experimental group conditions: SMS-only or non-SMS. I achieved random assignment using an online random-number generator. After assigning students to experimental groups, I then randomly divided them into 11 four-person teams and 1 five-person team. Between the two technical communication courses, then, there were 12 teams, with 6 teams in each experimental group. But I did not treat the two courses as separate populations; instead, I treated the 49 participants from both courses as the entire study sample. Furthermore, I did not make statistical comparisons across courses. That is, I randomly assigned students from both courses to a specific communication medium (SMS-only or non-SMS), so each of the two groups contained a nearly equal number of participants from each course, thereby reducing any bias that may arise from course differences. Both sets of participants completed projects that were identical in length and spanned the final 8 weeks of the semester.</p>
            <p>After assigning students to their experimental group and team, I gave them documentation with detailed instructions and an outline of the study parameters. Each participant needed to follow two major parameters: First, participants were to use only the communication medium that they had been assigned to for all of their out-of-class communication (except if their health or well-being was threatened, they should use whatever medium is appropriate). Second, participants were to log all communication they had with their team members outside of class. I gave each participant a log sheet for recording the date, communication medium, sender, receiver, and type of message. I created message categories based on major speech acts, including questions, answers, scheduling, directives, and announcements. A sixth category for nonproject-related communication was also an option. Other than following those two major parameters, students were to proceed with their team projects as they normally would.</p>
            <p>I was particularly interested in how team members became acquainted with one another and began functioning as a team. Therefore, after the first 4 weeks of the project, I asked students to complete a 26-question survey that measured mediated social connectedness and group attitude. In addition to measuring initial team formation at the project’s midpoint, I wanted to measure students’ connectedness and group attitude at the end of the project, so in the 8th week, I asked students to complete the same survey. Students turned in their communication logs on the last day of class.</p>

         <title>Results</title>
         <p>In this section, I present the results for each of the three hypotheses and then for each of the two research questions. </p>
         <list list-type="simple">
            <list-item>
               <p>
                  <italic>Hypothesis 1:</italic> Participants who communicate via SMS communicate more than do participants who do not use SMS.</p>
            </list-item>
         </list>
         <p>The quantity of communication produced by teams that were assigned to the SMS-only group was nearly 40% higher (<italic>M </italic>= 43.62, <italic>SD </italic>= 27.43) than that produced by teams in the non-SMS group (<italic>M </italic>= 27.04, <italic>SD </italic>= 14.82). I conducted a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) to compare the quantity of communication for the SMS-only group with that of the non-SMS group. The results of the ANOVA indicated that a significant difference existed between the two groups. I used an adjusted <italic>F</italic> value based on the results of Levene's test for equality of variances (<italic>F</italic> = 6.64, <italic>p</italic> = .013). With these adjusted values, the SMS-only group communicated significantly more than did the non-SMS group (<italic>F </italic>= 6.585, <italic>p </italic>= .014, <italic>d </italic>= .73). <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1050651912468888">Table 1</xref> presents the complete ANOVA source table, which includes the results not only for communication quantity but also for mediated social connectedness and group attitude. As a follow-up to the ANOVA, I also calculated the effect size for this significant difference. Statistical significance is an important indicator of group differences, but effect size allows us to see the magnitude or strength of the difference between the two groups. Guidelines surrounding the interpretation of effect size indicate three basic levels of effect: small (<italic>d = </italic>.2), medium (<italic>d </italic>= .5), and large (<italic>d </italic>= .8). The effect size for this significant difference in the quantity of communication between the two groups (<italic>d </italic>= .73) was large (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1050651912468888">Cohen, 1992</xref>). Thus, Hypothesis 1 was supported with a large effect.</p>

         <p>In addition to the ANOVA, I conducted post hoc follow-up analyses. After examining the overall data for quantity of communication, I found that most of the participants’ communication occurred during the first 4 weeks of the project. Communication seemed to drop off during the last 4 weeks. To statistically examine this observation, I conducted a repeated measures <italic>t</italic>-test that compared the quantity of communication from week 1 to week 4 with the quantity of communication from week 5 to week 8. The results showed that participants communicated significantly more in weeks 1 through 4 (<italic>M </italic>= 22.93, <italic>SD </italic>= 16.59) than they did in weeks 5 through 8 (<italic>M </italic>= 12.37, <italic>SD</italic> = 10.24), (<italic>t </italic>= 3.43, <italic>p </italic>= .001, <italic>d </italic>= .55). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1050651912468888">Figure 2</xref> shows a visual summary of the quantity of communication for both experimental groups over the 8-week period.

         <p>Data collected from weeks 1 through 4 yielded significant differences for mediated social connectedness between the SMS-only and the non-SMS groups.

         </list>
         <p>Because participants in the non-SMS group had their choice of any communication medium besides text messaging, I investigated which medium was most popular. Overwhelmingly, participants in the non-SMS group chose to communicate via e-mail. Of the 569 total communications, only 13 were conveyed via a medium other than e-mail. Facebook™ (2) and phone calls (11) were the only other media that participants used. </p>

            </list-item>
         </list>
         <p>To determine whether the communication medium had any effect on the types of messages, I conducted a one-way ANOVA to compare types of messages sent by the SMS-group with those sent by the non-SMS group. I used a total of six message types: questions, answers, scheduling, directives, announcements, and nonproject-related. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1050651912468888">Table 2</xref> presents the frequencies, by group, for each of the six message types. The ANOVA results indicated significant differences between the two groups in three of the six message types. The SMS-only group sent and received significantly more questions (<italic>F </italic>= 11.433, <italic>p</italic> = .002, <italic>d</italic> = 1.02), answers (<italic>F </italic>= 8.284, <italic>p </italic>= .009, <italic>d</italic> = .87), and nonproject-related messages (<italic>F </italic>= 5.157, <italic>p </italic>= .041, <italic>d</italic> = .68) than did the non-SMS group.

         <title>Discussion</title>
         <p>The results of this study have several implications for technical communication scholars, instructors, and practitioners. In the following discussion, I explain the study findings regarding each hypothesis and research question and the implications of these findings. </p>
         <sec id="section13-1050651912468888">
            <title>SMS Use Led to a Larger Quantity of Communication</title>
            <p>Hypothesis 1 posited that SMS users would communicate more throughout the project. The study found that the SMS-only group produced a significantly larger amount of communication than did the non-SMS group: The quantity of communication produced by the SMS-only group was almost 40% higher than that produced by the non-SMS group. This finding extends the suggestion of previous research that texting is a medium that allows for constant connection and conversational, quasi-synchronous communication. Because the medium itself is limited to short messages (usually less than 140 characters), these short bursts may lend themselves to a conversation in a way that e-mail does not (Fox, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1050651912468888">2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1050651912468888">Grinter &amp; Eldridge, 2003</xref>). Furthermore, in several studies, SMS users have reported that they feel a necessity or responsibility to respond to an incoming message in a timely manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1050651912468888">Horstmanshof &amp; Power, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1050651912468888">Laursen, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1050651912468888">Pettigrew, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1050651912468888">Thurlow, 2003</xref>). This sense of responsibility to respond promptly to an incoming message may provide a strong explanation for this study’s finding that the SMS-only group produced significantly more communication than did the non-SMS group. Because e-mail is less conversational in nature than SMS is, users may not feel this responsibility to respond so promptly. E-mail users cannot reasonably be expected to respond immediately although some e-mail can be time sensitive. Further, because e-mail allows users to include more information in a single message, interlocutors can send fewer messages with more information.</p>
            <p>This finding has a few important implications for instructors who assign student projects and for practitioners who work in team projects. Because the population of this study was made up of undergraduate students, these implications cannot be directly generalized to the work of technical communication practitioners. As a technical communication instructor, I can attest to a general lack of communication between students working on team projects. For example, each semester in which I have taught, students have complained that other team members have not contacted them the entire semester, or completed their assigned work, or shown up to team meetings. The results of this study provide evidence that instructors of technical communication can use to advocate for using SMS in team projects. Furthermore, according to several studies, students may feel obligated to respond to text messages. Thus, SMS use might aid in student accountability within teams by creating a culture in which students feel a sense of responsibility and obligation to their fellow team members. As such, SMS may be a medium that does not allow a single student to avoid work by fading into the background of a team project. In addition, previous research has shown that SMS might allow people with anxiety to express themselves more freely than do other media (Hashimoto, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1050651912468888">2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1050651912468888">Ito, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1050651912468888">Plant, 2001</xref>), so SMS use might motivate students who experience social anxiety or awkwardness in team settings to communicate more frequently. That is, the use of SMS may lower the inhibitions of team members, allowing a variety of personalities to contribute to a project. </p>
            <p>For practitioners, some of the unique affordances of SMS will likely extend into professional contexts. For example, the conversational nature of SMS is relevant not only for undergraduate students. Similarly, the sense of responsibility to promptly respond to an incoming message that SMS evokes would also likely extend into professional settings. Therefore, practitioners seeking to communicate more often with teammates may want to consider the use of SMS in their overall communication strategy. Although research shows that SMS is rarely used by professionals for work-related communication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1050651912468888">Pew Research Center, 2010</xref>), they might find that using this medium is a step forward in certain team projects. Professionals, however should not simply begin using SMS without a strategic plan. Instead, they should first clearly understand the advantages and disadvantages of specific communication media and set forth expectations at the beginning of team projects about when and how to use a variety of media. The use of SMS by practitioners working on team projects is clearly an area for future research, and I intend to continue building a testable framework based on empirical evidence.</p>

            <title>SMS Use Led to Feelings of Connectedness</title>
            <p>Hypothesis 2 suggested that the SMS-only group would report greater feelings of mediated social connectedness. This hypothesis was supported in the data collected from weeks 1 through 4. The results for weeks 5 through 8 may be less valid than the first round of data collection simply because groups communicated significantly more in the first half of the project. One possible explanation for this decrease in communication is that several smaller assignments were due before week 4. In weeks 5 through 8, however, the teams simply worked on the final deliverables. This dynamic may have required the teams to do more planning and communicating in the first half of the semester. Another possible explanation is that teams communicated more during the first half of the project because they were trying to get to know each other.</p>
            <p>Regardless of the reason for this decrease in communication, I will focus here on the significant finding in weeks 1 through 4. Previous research may provide a possible explanation for this feeling of connectedness experienced by the SMS-only group. Studies indicate that SMS may allow users to be more open and honest with one another, especially with new acquaintances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1050651912468888">Grinter &amp; Eldridge, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1050651912468888">Kasesniemi &amp; Rautiainen, 2002</xref>). This might provide a strong explanation for the feeling of connectedness that the SMS-only group reported. The participants were randomly assigned to teams, and the team members did not have previous relationships with each other, so most of the participants were merely acquaintances. Therefore, according to previous research, the acquaintances in this study may have benefited from the affordances of SMS. The non-SMS group, however, communicated primarily via e-mail, which might not provide the same open and honest line of communication that SMS does.</p>
            <p>Additional research might extend this explanation. That is, the freedom to be honest and open might also have contributed to the SMS-only group’s quick formation of text circles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1050651912468888">Reid &amp; Reid, 2005</xref>). The concept of text circles stems from the idea that individuals form a variety of social networks, some based on specific communication media. For example, individuals may have one social network on Facebook and a different one on Twitter™. Reid and Reid argued that social networks can form based on the people you text message regularly. Generally, individuals feel closer or more connected to people in their text circle than they do to people whom they may be willing to e-mail but are outside of their text circle. For example, individuals may feel less socially strained by simply sending an e-mail to a potential client whom they have never met than they would by sending a text message to that same client who is not yet in their text circle. Consequently, the participants in this study who used SMS may have quickly formed a text circle with their teammates, which in turn helped to foster feelings of connectedness, openness, and honesty.</p>
            <p>The finding that SMS users felt more socially connected than did non-SMS users has important implications for both instructors and practitioners. It may have special significance for projects in which team members are merely acquaintances or have just met. This context is particularly pertinent for undergraduate instructors. As an instructor, you rarely find a group of students who have previously worked with one another although it is more common in courses specifically aimed toward majors. And even if some of the students have worked together previously, they may be better served educationally by working with a different, more diverse set of students. In professional settings, teammates are much more likely to have worked together on multiple projects. But in some instances, often in distributed environments, a new team is formed, and the individuals know little about each other. In such contexts, an argument could be made for implementing SMS in addition to other team-building activities. Although it does not replace traditional forms of team building, such as a team dinner or game-based icebreaker, SMS may be useful in speeding up the process of building a social network because it inherently forms an intimacy between users that is not inherent with other mediums like e-mail. If SMS can add a layer of connectedness between new team members, it may be worth investigating at the least.</p>

            <title>SMS Use Did Not Change Group Attitude</title>
            <p>Hypothesis 3 suggested that the SMS-only group would have a more positive group attitude than would the non-SMS group. This hypothesis was not supported by the data. Although the difference between groups was not significant, the SMS-only group did report a higher level of group attraction than did the non-SMS group. Even though the data did not support this hypothesis, they present some interesting context for the overall model (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1050651912468888">Figure 1</xref>). One possible explanation for the study’s not finding a significant difference in group attitude between the two groups is that team dynamics are simply too complex for a simple communication medium to control. Although SMS has clear advantages, it is not a cure-all for negative team dynamics. Team members have different personalities, majors, and work ethics, among a host of other demographic differences. Therefore, even if SMS users communicate more and feel more connected with their teammates, these outcomes do not ensure that they will necessarily like working with their teammates. Further, such outcomes do not ensure that the final product will be of high quality. In a different context, however, the results might have differed—for example, in an advanced undergraduate or graduate course in which students all have the same major or in a workplace in which all team members are equally invested. Therefore, these results suggest that group members’ attitude toward their group cannot be significantly affected by a communication medium.</p>
            <p>Although the results did not show a statistically significant difference in group attitude between the two groups, this finding still has implications. For example, changing group members’ attitude toward their group can be a difficult task, particularly when that group is composed of people who are incredibly different from each other. Also, there is more than one solution to the complex issues that arise in teams, so attempts to address issues and change behaviors and attitudes should be made from a broad perspective by experimenting with various solutions and seeking the optimal combination of solutions for the given context. This finding also has particular importance to technical communication scholars as an area for future research. Although SMS was not a predictor of group attitude, scholars should examine additional variables that might affect group attitude within an adjusted framework.</p>

         <title>When Given a Choice, Students in the Non-SMS Group Overwhelmingly Chose E-Mail</title>
         <p>Based on an analysis of the communication logs of each of the participants in the non-SMS group, these students clearly favored e-mail over other communication media. A possible explanation for this finding is that the prevailing technoculture has steered students toward e-mail, a medium that is more commonplace than any other and used widely in social, professional, and educational settings. Additionally, e-mail might simply have been the most convenient way for team members to send messages to multiple recipients. Another possible explanation is that participants might not have felt comfortable enough with each other to make a phone call, send an instant message, or perform a video chat. Finally, the participants may have preferred e-mail because of its asynchronicity. Synchronous communication forces both participants to be active in the communication act simultaneously. Further, synchronous communication requires, at the least, a short-term commitment to the communication act. Students who juggle multiple courses and projects may find such a commitment, even if it is short, unfeasible or, more likely, inconvenient. E-mail’s asynchronicity may also allow team members to more easily give bad news to their teammates. For example, students may feel more comfortable sending an e-mail, as opposed to a phone call or instant message, if they are going to miss a team meeting or have not completed their portion of the project. Although there are several other possible explanations for selecting e-mail as a primary form of communication, it is likely due to a combination of the previous explanations. </p>
         <p>The finding that participants in the non-SMS Group overwhelmingly chose e-mail as a primary form of communication has implications for scholars—and particularly for future research. Although I examined what media participants chose, it was outside the scope of this study to determine exactly why they chose a particular medium. That is, the fact that participants overwhelmingly chose e-mail could indicate that they did not make a conscious effort in choosing a medium. Rather, they more likely simply chose the most convenient or agreed-on medium. Understanding why individuals choose a medium can guide instructors and practitioners because they will be able to examine the root causes for medium choice. </p>
         <p>Considering this finding that students overwhelmingly choose e-mail rather than other non-SMS media, instructors may want to explicitly provide instruction about medium choice. Aside from SMS, there are a host of other media and collaboration tools that are potentially more effective than e-mail. For example, group-authoring software is available for free via Google™. Similarly, there are several options for free videoconferencing software. Groups that want to author collaboratively may find these software tools to be more effective than e-mail, which requires group members to send and receive attached versions of files. </p>

         <title>SMS Users Sent More Questions and Answers Than Did Non-SMS Users</title>
         <p>The study found that the SMS-only group sent significantly more questions and answers than did the non-SMS group. There are a few possible explanations for this finding. The medium of text messaging may be more conducive to a conversational, back and forth style of communication that often entails asking questions and providing answers. Further, text messaging is a medium that possesses characteristics of both synchronous and asynchronous communication. It is synchronous in the sense that when you send a message, barring a technological failure, you can reasonably expect that the other person will immediately receive the message. You can also expect the receiver of the message to respond if appropriate. Extenuating circumstances, however, can make text messaging asynchronous. For example, the receiver’s cell phone may be turned off, or the receivers may get the text messages but choose to ignore it or respond at a later time. If the participants in the SMS-only group used text messaging synchronously, as the data suggest, they may have been more apt to send questions regarding the project because they could reasonably expect an answer to the question.</p>
         <p>To fully understand the uniqueness of questions and answers as speech acts, we need to see how they are different from other speech acts reported in this study. Questions and answers encouraged <italic>active </italic>communication. That is, team members used questions and answers in order to achieve a specific communication objective. A question is a speech act that by nature requires feedback: The person asking the question requires and expects a response. But other speech acts investigated in this study are much less active. For example, both experimental groups sent scheduling, directive, and reminder messages. These three speech acts do not require a response. They are simply one-sided messages. Furthermore, in this study, scheduling is a speech act that actually put off project work until the time of an actual face-to-face meeting. This speech act differs vastly from questions and answers. When participants asked a question, they not only expected an answer, they presumably used that information to actively work on the project. Therefore, because the SMS-only group sent significantly more questions and answers than did the non-SMS group, the SMS-only group may have been more effective in using communication outside of face-to-face meetings to actively complete portions of the project. In contrast, the non-SMS group may have used their interactions simply to schedule future actions. </p>
         <p>The finding that SMS users sent more questions and answers than did non-SMS users has did has implications for both instructors and practitioners. Instructors of team projects could approach this finding in one of two ways: They could encourage their students to use text messaging as a means to achieve more active communication outside of class or they could simply encourage students to ask each other more questions outside of class using whatever medium they choose. Practitioners working in teams might also consider using text messaging for time-sensitive material. Although such practical advice may seem obvious, teams might find it beneficial to set out their communication expectations and boundaries at the beginning of the project. Often times, people have difficulty sending a text message to someone with whom they are not well acquainted, and they may prefer to send an e-mail. But if a team specifies particular contexts in which text messaging is appropriate, the team members may be able to more effectively communicate with each other outside of face-to-face interactions.</p>

         <title>SMS Users Sent More Nonproject-Related Messages Than Did Non-SMS Users</title>
         <p>The study also found that the SMS-only group sent significantly more nonproject-related communication than did the non-SMS group. A possible explanation for this finding is that because the participants in the SMS-only group felt more socially connected to their team members, they may have felt more comfortable discussing nonproject-related topics. Further, the medium of text messaging may have allowed team members to feel that they were part of an intimate text circle. That is, because participants in the SMS-only group had no choice but to communicate via text, they may have quickly adopted the medium and accelerated the process of forming a social circle. The formation of these text circles may have made it easier for participants to communicate on a more personal level. The nonproject-related messages may also indicate that the use of text messaging may encourage team members to move beyond a working relationship and into a deeper, more meaningful relationship with one another. </p>
         <p>This finding, like many of the other findings I have discussed, implies that the benefits of SMS in team environments may outweigh the restrictions that are inherent in the medium. For instance, if the goal is to quickly bond as a team, using text messaging may be quite beneficial.</p>

         <title>Limitations and Directions for Future Research</title>
         <p>This study has several limitations. As with any experimental design, the findings are not necessarily generalizable outside of the studied population. Therefore, we must view the findings of this study in the context in which they were discovered. This limitation, however, lends itself directly to future research. Future studies should investigate SMS use in a variety of contexts, especially in professional contexts. Technical communication scholars should investigate SMS use in professional settings both quantitatively and qualitatively. This topic is severely understudied in professional contexts, and it would benefit greatly from a variety of research methodologies.</p>
         <p>There are a couple of limitations concerning the data collection. First, although the measure for mediated social connectedness achieved initial validation, it should be further validated. This limitation is difficult to overcome when studying a relatively new topic, which often produces more ideas, research questions, and hypotheses than results. Second, the participants categorized their own messages. Although they were trained to categorize their communication, and the communication categories were fairly apparent, obtaining copies of the actual messages and having an expert code them would be a stronger alternative to self-reporting.</p>
         <p>Another limitation of the study is the way in which e-mail and SMS, as communication media, were treated. That is, e-mail can be sent and received through multiple hardware environments. For example, e-mail can be sent and received through mobile devices, Web clients, and desktop clients. Each of these environments could perhaps affect a user’s experience with e-mail. In stark contrast, SMS messages are usually sent and received through one environment, mobile devices. Therefore, a major limitation of the current study is that the non-SMS group did not categorize the hardware environment for their communication. Future studies, then, should collect data concerning the actual environment through which messages are sent and received. I would have been able to statistically examine whether the actual environment of a particular interface had any effect on connectedness and group attitude.</p>
         <p>A final limitation of the study was the scheduling of the group project itself. It is not possible to control all variables in a classroom experiment, but the study may have benefited from a different schedule. For example, a longer project (more than 8 weeks) might provide a stronger longitudinal basis for measuring connectedness and other relational variables. Furthermore, spacing out assignments so that students would be encouraged to communicate more consistently throughout the study might provide a more holistic view of relationships.</p>
         <p>Research in SMS is young but promising. SMS is a prevalent medium that is beginning to find its way into a variety of contexts, including the workplace. To gain a strong understanding of the impact that SMS may have on interpersonal relationships, we must continue to add, remove, and test more variables. We must build on the findings in this study and move forward the knowledge that will ultimately benefit scholars, instructors, and practitioners of technical communication.</p>
