<title>Stopping Breast Cancer Metastasis</title>
<p>When breast cancer cells disseminate through the lymphatic system, they often access systemic circulation and form metastasis in the loci away from the primary tumor, leading to a poor disease prognosis and a high mortality rate.</p>
<p>The molecular mechanisms underlying the tumor cell dissemination have been poorly understood and, therefore, little is known about how to control this process and how it might be disrupted in order to prolong the lives of women with metastatic breast cancer.</p>
<p>A recent report by Schito et al, which has just been published on the <italic>Proceeding of National Academy of Sciences</italic>, sheds some promising light on this issue (<italic>PNAS</italic>, Early Edition, September 2012).</p>
<p>Schito and colleagues sought to investigate the role of hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) in lymphatic dissemination and verified that HIF-1 promotes lymphatic metastasis of breast cancer by direct transactivation of the gene-encoding platelet-derived growth factor B (PDGF-B), which is produced by the breast cancer cells and has proliferative and chemotactic effects on the lymphatic endothelial cells.</p>
<p>Mice bearing human breast cancer orthografts, in which HIF-1 or PDGF-B had been knocked down, showed considerably fewer human breast cells in the axillary lymph nodes when compared to the mice with breast cancer orthografts with a normal HIF-1and PDGF-B expression. When the orthografted mice were administered digoxin, an HIF-1 inhibitor, or imatinib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor that mimics the effect of PDGF-B knockdown in breast cancer cells, lymphangiogenesis and lymphatic metastasis were blocked.</p>
<p>In addition, immunohistochemistry analysis of the human breast cancer biopsies showed co-localization of HIF-1 and PDGF-B whose expression was positively correlated with the lymphatic vessel area and the histological grade.</p>
<p>Thus, altogether the exciting findings presented by Schito et al not only provide evidence that the HIF-1/PDGF-B pathway plays a major role in metastasis formation in breast cancer but also present 2 inhibitors of the pathway that may be of major clinical significance to prevent breast cancer spreading through the lymphatic system.</p>

<title>Disrupting the Link Between Human Papillomaviruses Infections and Cancer</title>
<p>Human papillomaviruses (HPVs) are small, double-stranded DNA viruses that infect the stratified squamous epithelium causing benign proliferative lesions. High-risk HPVs, such as HPV-16 and HPV-18, have long been associated with a variety of anogenital and a subset of head and neck malignancies, including nearly all cases of cervical cancer. Despite intense investigation in this medical field, the molecular processes in the relationship between HPV infection and cancer development have not been completely clarified.</p>
<p>Aiming to better understand the molecular mechanisms supporting cell transformation after HPV infection, Jabbar et al investigated whether the continuous expression of a specific HPV-16 oncoprotein, E7, was essential for cervical cancer maintenance. Their results have been recently published in Cancer Research (Cancer Res., 2012; 72: 4008-4016).</p>
<p>Previous work suggested that cervical cancers arising in the transgenic mice that express E7 in an inducible manner require its continuous expression for their maintenance, making E7 a potential excellent therapeutic target for HPV-associated cancers. Knowing that in the in vivo occurring HPV-associated cancers the 2 oncoproteins, E6 and E7, are invariably coexpressed, Jabbar and colleagues investigated the need of continuous expression of E7 in the context of constitutively expressed E6.</p>
<p>In order to test their hypothesis, the authors created a conditional E7 mouse mutant with constitutive expression of E6 and observed that in mice with high-grade cervical dysplasia lesions and cervical cancer, repressing the expression of E7 led to the regression of all cancers and the vast majority of dysplastic lesions. Moreover, when E7 was repressed and then re-expressed, the authors observed the occurrence of occasional cervical cancers.</p>
<p>The work by Jabbar et al strongly supports the notion that E7 is required for the maintenance of cervical cancer and most precancerous lesions, reinforcing its indication as a therapeutic target for HPV-associated cancers. As such, the findings here referred may present a major breakthrough for the prevention and clinical management of cervical cancer.</p>
