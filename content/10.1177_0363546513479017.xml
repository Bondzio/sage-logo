<sec id="section1-0363546513479017">
<title>Background:</title>
<p>Achilles tendon ruptures represent more than 40% of all tendon ruptures requiring surgical management. About 20% of acute Achilles tendon tears are not diagnosed at the time of injury and become chronic, necessitating more complicated management than fresh injuries. Several techniques for the reconstruction of chronic tears of the Achilles tendon have been described, but the superiority of one technique over the others has not been demonstrated.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0363546513479017">
<title>Hypothesis:</title>
<p>Mini-invasive reconstruction of the Achilles tendon, with a gap lesion larger than 6 cm, using the ipsilateral free semitendinosus tendon graft will result in improvement of the overall function with a low rate of complications.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0363546513479017">
<title>Study Design:</title>
<p>Case series; Level of evidence, 4.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0363546513479017">
<title>Methods:</title>
<p>Between 2008 and 2010, the authors prospectively enrolled 28 consecutive patients (21 men and 7 women; median age, 46 years) with chronic closed ruptures of the Achilles tendon who had undergone reconstruction with a free semitendinosus tendon graft. They assessed the Achilles tendon Total Rupture Score (ATRS), maximum calf circumference, and isometric plantarflexion strength before surgery and at the last follow-up. Outcome of surgery and rate of complications were also recorded. The median follow-up after surgery was 31.4 months.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0363546513479017">
<title>Results:</title>
<p>The overall result of surgery was excellent/good in 26 (93%) of 28 patients. The ATRS improved from 42 (range, 29-55) to 86 (range, 78-95) (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .0001). In the operated leg, the maximum calf circumference and isometric plantarflexion strength were significantly improved after surgery (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .0001); however, their values remained significantly lower than those of the opposite side (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .0001). All patients were able to walk on tiptoes and returned to their preinjury working occupation. No infections were recorded.</p>

<sec id="section6-0363546513479017">
<title>Conclusion:</title>
<p>Mini-invasive reconstruction of the Achilles tendon, with a gap lesion larger than 6 cm, using the ipsilateral free semitendinosus tendon graft provides a significant improvement of symptoms and function, although calf circumference and ankle plantarflexion strength do not recover fully.</p>

<p>Achilles tendon ruptures represent more than 40% of all tendon ruptures requiring surgical management.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0363546513479017">13</xref></sup> They can affect both young adults, when associated with sport participation, and older people (&gt;50 years), when they occur in nonathletes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0363546513479017">18</xref></sup></p>
<p>Although the diagnosis of a complete Achilles tendon rupture can be formulated on the basis of clinical examination alone, it is missed in up to 25% of patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0363546513479017">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0363546513479017">23</xref></sup> A delayed diagnosis changes an acute into a chronic rupture when it is achieved after 4 to 6 weeks. In chronic ruptures, tendon stumps are thin, atrophic, and retracted, leading to large gap lesions. The tendon sheath is thickened and adherent to the retracted stumps, and no functional tissue is present between the torn ends.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0363546513479017">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0363546513479017">34</xref></sup> In this condition, the isometric plantarflexion strength of the gastrocsoleus complex is markedly affected because of the retraction of the proximal stump and the shortening of the muscle, leading to nonpropulsive gait.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0363546513479017">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0363546513479017">37</xref></sup></p>
<p>Given these features, the management of chronic Achilles tendon ruptures is challenging.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0363546513479017">22</xref></sup> Moreover, a direct end-to-end repair is usually not possible because of the retraction of the stumps and the consequent gap. For this reason, the management of chronic Achilles tendon ruptures may include surgical debridement of scar tissue at the site of the lesion and reconstruction of tendon continuity to restore the appropriate Achilles tendon length and plantarflexion strength.</p>
<p>Several techniques for Achilles tendon reconstruction have been described, including turndown flap, tendon transfer, tendon graft, or augmentation with synthetic materials.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0363546513479017">16</xref></sup> However, the superiority of one technique over the others has not been demonstrated, and the best surgical management of chronic Achilles tendon ruptures still remains controversial.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0363546513479017">50</xref></sup></p>
<p>In ruptures with a large gap (&gt;6 cm), the semitendinosus tendon can be used to undertake the reconstruction because it is long and strong.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0363546513479017">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0363546513479017">27</xref></sup> It has been used for open reconstruction of the Achilles tendon with encouraging results.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0363546513479017">42</xref></sup></p>
<p>The aim of this single-center prospective case series was to assess the clinical outcomes of the minimally invasive reconstruction of chronic Achilles tendon ruptures, with a gap lesion larger than 6 cm, using the ipsilateral free semitendinosus tendon graft at midterm follow-up.</p>

<title>Patient Selection</title>
<p>During the period from 2008 to 2010, we prospectively enrolled 28 consecutive patients (21 men and 7 women; mean age, 46 years; range, 28-66 years) with chronic closed ruptures of the Achilles tendon who had undergone surgical reconstruction.</p>
<p>All patients were tertiary referrals and were included in the study if they had a diagnosis of a chronic closed rupture of the Achilles tendon on the basis of clinical examination.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0363546513479017">21</xref></sup> The average time between injury and diagnosis was 29 months (range, 7-71 months). The right side was affected in 16 patients and the left side in 12 patients. The patients were included in the study if they had a gap between the proximal and distal stumps of the Achilles tendon of at least 6 cm after freshening of the tendon stumps with the ankle in maximal plantar flexion. Ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans were also available for 18 and 13 patients, respectively, as some patients had received both investigations.</p>
<p>At the time of first consultation with the senior author (N.M.), all the patients reported the onset of a sudden sharp pain in the calf or at the posterior aspect of the ankle when the rupture occurred (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0363546513479017">Table 1</xref>). Subsequently, all experienced difficulty in performing routine daily tasks such as walking uphill or climbing stairs. At examination, all patients had a palpable gap at the site of the rupture. All had a typical nonpropulsive gait on the affected limb and were not able to stand on their tiptoes. However, they were able to perform active plantar flexion of the affected ankle. In all patients, the calf muscles of the affected limb were wasted.</p>

<p>The clinical diagnosis of an Achilles tendon rupture was made using the calf squeeze test<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0363546513479017">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0363546513479017">43</xref></sup> and the knee flexion test.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0363546513479017">33</xref></sup> The former test is suggestive of ruptures if a squeeze of the calf does not induce plantar flexion of the foot with the patient lying prone with both feet dangling from the edge of the examination table. To perform the second test, the patient lies prone with the knees flexed to 90°. When the tendon is intact, the foot comes to rest in slight plantar flexion. The test finding is positive if the ankle on the affected side falls into the neutral or dorsiflexed position as compared with the normal side. All the patients showed positive results for both clinical tests. When ultrasound and/or MRI scans were available, imaging findings were consistent with the clinical diagnosis.</p>
<p>Seven of these 28 patients had been managed by other orthopaedic surgeons for Achilles tendinopathy, and these 7 patients underwent blind or ultrasound-guided local steroid injections around the affected tendon with a temporary benefit. The average time between the last injection and the rupture was 7.5 months (range, 1.5-13 months).</p>
<p>All patients were managed with the same surgical procedure and postoperative rehabilitation.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0363546513479017">
<title>Operative Technique</title>
<p>The patient was positioned prone with both feet dangling from the edge of the operating table. A dorsal vein of the foot of the limb to be operated on was cannulated. A thigh tourniquet was applied, and the limb was exsanguinated. A single dose of first-generation cephalosporin was administered after exsanguination of the limb and inflation of the tourniquet to 300 mm Hg.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0363546513479017">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0363546513479017">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0363546513479017">51</xref></sup> Skin preparation was performed in the usual fashion, and sterile drapes were applied. Preoperative anatomic markings were the palpable tendon defect, the distal and proximal tendon stumps, and the superior posterolateral corner of the calcaneum.</p>
<p>The semitendinosus tendon was harvested through a 2-cm transverse incision in the popliteal fossa.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0363546513479017">41</xref></sup> The incision was performed directly over the tendon, which was carefully dissected from the surrounding tissues in a standard fashion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0363546513479017">Figure 1</xref>). Then, the tendon was harvested proximally using an appropriately sized tendon stripper. This procedure was performed with the knee at 30° of flexion to reduce the tension on the tendon. Finally, after the vincula with the medial head of the gastrocnemius was severed, the tendon was harvested distally by using the same stripper to detach it from the tibia. After the harvest, the proximal and distal ends of the tendon were prepared with a whipstitch with No. 1 Vicryl (Ethicon, Edinburgh, United Kingdom) in the usual fashion.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0363546513479017">27</xref></sup></p>

<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0363546513479017-fig1.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>Two skin incisions were performed: a 3-cm longitudinal incision, made 2 cm proximal and just medial to the palpable end of the proximal stump, and a 2.5-cm longitudinal incision, made 2 cm distal and just lateral to the lateral margin of the distal stump. The second incision was performed as close as possible to the lateral border of the Achilles tendon to prevent damage to the sural nerve, which normally passes around 18 mm lateral to the Achilles tendon insertion.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0363546513479017">47</xref></sup></p>
<p>The proximal Achilles tendon stump was mobilized from the proximal incision, freeing it of all the peritendinous adhesions, and delivered into the skin wound. The ruptured tendon end was then resected back to regularize the edge of the stump. The average resection of the tendon was 10 mm (range, 7-15 mm). The distal stump of the torn Achilles tendon was exposed but not delivered out of the wound.</p>
<p>Through the distal incision, the Kager triangle anterior to the distal tendon stump was exposed, providing access to the posterosuperior corner of the calcaneum. The Achilles tendon was followed to its insertion on the posterior aspect of the calcaneum. With an oscillating saw, an osteotomy of the posterosuperior corner of the calcaneum was performed, making sure that no sharp edges of bone were left impinging on the anterior aspect of the insertion of the Achilles tendon. The osteotomy allowed us to expose the insertion of the tendon on the calcaneum and to avoid impingement between the Achilles tendon and the tendon graft, preventing excessive tension on the skin covering the insertion of the tendon. A Beath pin was drilled in an antegrade direction, starting from anterior to the midportion of the insertion of the Achilles tendon, in a posterior to anterior direction of approximately 45°. A 7-mm cannulated headed reamer was used to produce a bone tunnel into the calcaneum for the passage of the double-stranded semitendinosus tendon graft. A loop of Ethibond (Ethicon) was inserted in the eyelet of the Beath pin and left in situ for later passage of the graft.</p>
<p>The semitendinosus tendon was passed transversely through a small incision in the substance of the proximal stump of the Achilles tendon in a medial to lateral direction and was sutured to the proximal stump of the Achilles tendon, at the entry and exit points, using 2-0 Vicryl (polyglactin 910 braided absorbable suture; Johnson &amp; Johnson, Brussels, Belgium) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0363546513479017">Figure 2</xref>). The proximal stump was then gently relocated under the skin. The 2 strands of the semitendinosus tendon, which were medial and lateral to the distal portion of the proximal stump, were then kept parallel and passed under the intact skin bridge, anterior to the Achilles tendon stumps, and delivered into the distal incision. They were then shuttled through the calcaneus tunnel. Finally, the semitendinosus tendon graft was placed in tension with the ankle in maximal plantar flexion and was fixed to the calcaneum using a 7 × 20–mm or a 7 × 25–mm metallic or bioabsorbable interference screw inserted over a guide wire into the tunnel in the calcaneum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0363546513479017">Figures 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0363546513479017">5</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0363546513479017">6</xref>). The semitendinosus tendon was sutured to the distal stump of the Achilles tendon with 2-0 Vicryl (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0363546513479017">Figure 4</xref>).</p>

<p>At the end of the procedure, the wounds were closed with subcuticular 3.0 Biosyn (Tyco Healthcare, Norwalk, Connecticut) and Steri-Strips (3M Health Care, St Paul, Minnesota). The tourniquet was deflated, the wound was dressed in the usual fashion, and a below-the-knee synthetic cast boot was applied with the patient prone, maintaining the ankle in a maximal plantarflexion position.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0363546513479017">
<title>Postoperative Rehabilitation</title>
<p>Postoperatively, the operated leg was kept elevated until the patient was discharged. Patients were allowed to bear weight on the metatarsal heads as tolerated, with the knee flexed, with the use of elbow crutches.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0363546513479017">31</xref></sup> They undertook short walks and kept the leg elevated as much as possible for the first 2 postoperative weeks. During this period, they were strongly encouraged to perform active flexion and extension of the hallux and toes, isometric exercises of the calf muscles and of the toes, straight-leg raises, and active flexion and extension of the knee.</p>
<p>The cast was removed after 2 weeks, and an Aircast boot with 5 heel wedges (XP Walker, DJO Ltd, Guildford, United Kingdom) was applied. Formal physical therapy was started, including proprioception, plantar flexion of the ankle, inversion, and eversion exercises.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0363546513479017">31</xref></sup> Dorsiflexion and stretching were forbidden. During this period, the patients were allowed full weightbearing with the boot in situ. One heel wedge was removed every 2 weeks, and the boot was removed after 6 weeks.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0363546513479017">27</xref></sup> No heel raise was prescribed after removal of the boot, and patients normally regained a plantigrade ankle over an average period of 3 weeks.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0363546513479017">
<title>Follow-up</title>
<p>All patients had a clinical follow-up consultation at 2 and 8 weeks from the index surgery, when the cast and the boot were removed, respectively. Further visits occurred at 3, 6, and 12 months after surgery, unless clinical needs were required. Subsequently, all patients were seen once per year up to a maximum of 4 years. The mean latest follow-up after surgery was 31.4 months (range, 24-40 months).</p>

<sec id="section13-0363546513479017">
<title>Subjective Outcomes</title>
<p>The Achilles tendon Total Rupture Score<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0363546513479017">35</xref></sup> (ATRS) was used to evaluate the clinical picture after surgery. It is a self-administered rating system recording both symptoms and physical activity.

<title>Objective Outcomes</title>
<p>The anthropometric assessment was performed by measuring the maximum calf circumference in both the affected and the contralateral legs. The evaluation was made with a commercially available measuring tape before surgery and at the time of the last follow-up.</p>
<p>To assess the function of the reconstructed gastrocsoleus–Achilles tendon complex, patients were asked to perform 10 single-legged heel lifts on the affected leg. One independent operator judged the ability of the patients to perform this task at the time of the last follow-up.</p>
<p>The isometric plantarflexion strength of the gastrocsoleus complex was measured at the preassessment clinic bilaterally with the ankle in neutral (0°) position, as previously described.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0363546513479017">28</xref></sup> In brief, a custom-made footplate was connected through an analog-to-digital converter (ADC-10, PICO Technology, Cambridge, United Kingdom) to a voltmeter (PicoScope, PICO Technology). The voltmeter was connected to a computer, and the strength was measured by converting voltage changes into newtons. Each patient performed 2 attempts exerting maximal isometric force on the footplate for 3 to 5 seconds. The mean value was calculated and used for further analysis. Isometric strength was measured in the same fashion at the last follow-up visit. For all patients, we recorded the return to their preinjury working occupation and sport/leisure activity at the time of the last follow-up.</p>

<title>Objective Outcomes</title>
<p>In the affected leg, the maximum calf circumference was 36.2 cm (range, 28.4-44.5 cm) before surgery and 37.9 cm (range, 29.4-46.4 cm) at the last follow-up (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .0001).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In the present study, we assessed the clinical outcomes of the minimally invasive reconstruction of chronic Achilles tendon ruptures using the ipsilateral free semitendinosus tendon graft with a mean follow-up of 31.4 months. We enrolled 28 consecutive patients in a prospective fashion and evaluated the ATRS, maximum calf circumference, isometric plantarflexion strength, and the rate of complications.</p>
<p>In our series, the overall outcome of surgical management was excellent or good in 26 (93%) of 28 patients and fair in only 2 (7%). We found a statistically significant improvement in the ATRS at the time of the last follow-up. In the operated leg, the maximum calf circumference and isometric plantarflexion strength were significantly improved after surgery, despite their values remaining significantly lower than those of the opposite side. Although the isometric plantarflexion strength of the gastrocsoleus complex did not fully recover, all patients were able to stand and to walk on tiptoes and showed propulsive gait with appropriate pushoff on the operated limb. Moreover, the decreased strength did not affect the return to work and leisure/sport activities.</p>
<p>To date, the best surgical management of chronic Achilles tendon ruptures has not been defined.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0363546513479017">50</xref></sup> Several techniques for Achilles tendon reconstruction have been described, including turndown flap, tendon transfer, tendon graft, or augmentation with synthetic materials.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0363546513479017">16</xref></sup> Tendon transfer techniques have been widely used with good results but can be associated with loss of function. Indeed, transfer of the tendon of the flexor hallucis longus results in a permanent decrease of the strength of the great toe flexor,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0363546513479017">46</xref></sup> whereas transfer of the flexor digitorum longus affects the push-off strength.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0363546513479017">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0363546513479017">10</xref></sup> Finally, as the peroneus brevis provides 28% of the eversion capacity of the hindfoot, its transfer can be associated with a decrease in eversion strength of the ankle.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0363546513479017">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0363546513479017">40</xref></sup></p>
<p>To overcome these problems, we proposed hamstring tendons to reconstruct chronic tears of the Achilles tendon.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0363546513479017">25</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0363546513479017"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0363546513479017">27</xref></sup> Hamstring tendons are currently used as a free graft for anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstructions because of the low risk of donor site morbidity and fast recovery and easy harvest procedure.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0363546513479017">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0363546513479017">38</xref></sup> Moreover, they are quite long tendons, allowing us to reconstruct the continuity of the Achilles tendon even in chronic ruptures with a wide gap between the stumps.</p>
<p>Some authors investigated open techniques for reconstruction of the Achilles tendon. In previous long-term studies, Maffulli et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0363546513479017">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0363546513479017">30</xref></sup> showed that both peroneus brevis tendon transfer and free gracilis tendon graft techniques can be performed to manage, respectively, gaps up to and greater than 6 cm. On the other hand, Sarzaeem et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0363546513479017">42</xref></sup> evaluated an open technique using a free semitendinosus tendon graft to reconstruct Achilles tendon ruptures with gaps larger than 6 cm. All these approaches are associated with good functional results, providing a statistically significant improvement of the ATRS after surgery. Moreover, peroneus brevis tendon transfer and free gracilis tendon graft techniques described by Maffulli et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0363546513479017">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0363546513479017">30</xref></sup> lead to a significant improvement in the ankle plantarflexion strength and calf circumference in the affected leg.</p>
<p>The technique reported in the present investigation provides good clinical results in terms of the ATRS, ankle plantarflexion strength, and calf circumference, comparable with those reported in the previous studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0363546513479017">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0363546513479017">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0363546513479017">42</xref></sup> However, it allows us to reconstruct torn tendons with a gap larger than 6 cm in a minimally invasive fashion, through 2 small incisions, without exposing the site of the rupture. In this way, we preserved skin integrity in the area of the gap between the retracted tendon stumps in an effort to minimize the rate of postoperative infections.</p>
<p>Wound infection is a challenging complication after surgical reconstruction of the Achilles tendon, and it should be prevented. Although open techniques are effective, they, by definition, involve exposure of the stumps and rupture site of the Achilles tendon and are associated with a high risk of postoperative infections. Maffulli et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0363546513479017">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0363546513479017">30</xref></sup> reported that 3 of 15 (20%) patients undergoing a free gracilis tendon graft procedure and 1 of 16 (6%) patients undergoing peroneus brevis tendon transfer developed a superficial wound infection. Finally, Sarzaeem et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0363546513479017">42</xref></sup> reported superficial infections in 2 of 11 (18%) patients undergoing a free semitendinosus tendon graft procedure. On the other hand, in the present series, no patients developed a wound infection, suggesting that this minimally invasive approach is associated with a lower risk of infections when compared with open techniques.</p>
<p>In a previously reported mini-invasive reconstruction technique using the semitendinosus tendon, Maffulli et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0363546513479017">26</xref></sup> exposed and delivered both the distal and the proximal stumps of the Achilles tendon out of the wound. They also bridged the gap by performing a loop with the free semitendinosus graft and attempting to pass it twice through the proximal and distal stumps of the Achilles tendon. Therefore, that technique was a soft tissue reconstruction. In the current technique, we exposed but did not deliver the distal stump out of the skin. Also, the graft was passed only through the proximal stump, and it was fixed to the calcaneum distally using an interference screw. Thus, the procedure is technically less demanding and less invasive than the previous technique. Finally, it provides a stronger fixation of the graft than those achieved with tendon-to-tendon sutures.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0363546513479017">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0363546513479017">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0363546513479017">39</xref></sup></p>
<p>Although this technique is more technically demanding when compared with traditional open techniques, minimally invasive surgery provides faster recovery times, shorter hospital stays, lower rates of complications, and improved functional outcomes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0363546513479017">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0363546513479017">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0363546513479017">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0363546513479017">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0363546513479017">32</xref></sup> We also advocate the use of the semitendinosus tendon because it is long enough to manage lesions with a large gap (&gt;6 cm) and provides a robust reconstruction of the Achilles tendon. As shown by studies of ACL reconstruction, interference screw fixation provides excellent mechanical properties of the construct and a good integration rate.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0363546513479017">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0363546513479017">49</xref></sup> Finally, the use of a free semitendinosus graft does not cause any significant loss of function and does not deprive the knee of motor strength and power.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0363546513479017">1</xref></sup> Finally, the semitendinosus tendon can regenerate,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0363546513479017">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0363546513479017">38</xref></sup> thus further minimizing the morbidity of its harvest.</p>
<p>Although the best postoperative rehabilitation protocol after surgical reconstruction of Achilles tendon ruptures is unknown, we advocate the use of an early functional protocol because of its advantages. Indeed, early return to protected full weightbearing ambulation and early active rehabilitation exercises are associated with significant improvement in functional outcomes and patient satisfaction and less morbidity in the first months after surgery when compared with conservative rehabilitation protocols in patients who have undergone surgical repair for acute or chronic Achilles tendon ruptures.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0363546513479017">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0363546513479017">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0363546513479017">45</xref></sup> Moreover, no difference has been found in terms of the rerupture rate between the 2 approaches.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0363546513479017">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0363546513479017">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0363546513479017">45</xref></sup> The present evidence suggests that early functional rehabilitation protocols can be also safely undertaken in patients who have undergone reconstruction of the Achilles tendon, given the strong fixation of the graft achieved with the interference screw, as demonstrated by the absence of reruptures in our patients. The safety of such an approach may be questioned, but both basic science and clinical studies show that early motion avoiding stretching of the reconstructed areas is not deleterious, and most likely beneficial, to the reconstruction.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0363546513479017">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0363546513479017">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0363546513479017">31</xref></sup></p>
<p>The present study employed a well-validated scoring system to provide a quantitative assessment of clinical benefits related to the procedure. The ATRS is a patient-reported instrument with high reliability, validity, and sensitivity for measuring outcomes after the management of patients with a complete Achilles tendon rupture. We are aware that the Tegner activity scale is a validated scoring system to assess changes in activity level. However, it is usually performed in athletes; therefore, we recorded the return to preinjury working occupation and sport/leisure activity because not all our patients participated in sports. Moreover, we performed objective evaluations, such as measurement of the isometric plantarflexion strength of the gastrocsoleus complex and maximum calf circumference. Further strengths of the study are that only 1 fully trained orthopaedic surgeon performed the surgery in all patients and that postoperative management was uniform throughout the study. Also, the final evaluation was performed by an independent assessor.</p>
<p>Despite its prospective nature, a major limitation of the present study is the lack of a control group. This uncontrolled design does not allow us to prove that this surgical procedure is superior to previous described techniques for the management of chronic Achilles tendon ruptures. However, we suggest that this approach should be taken into consideration to manage these patients. Obviously, a randomized controlled trial would be necessary to definitely ascertain the superiority of one technique over another. However, these injuries are relatively infrequent, and surgeons may not have equipoise or not be technically equally proficient in undertaking more than one reconstruction technique.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the present technique allows the reconstruction of the Achilles tendon, with a gap lesion larger than 6 cm, using the ipsilateral free semitendinosus tendon graft with bone fixation achieved using an interference screw. Although some complications seem to be inevitable, and the calf circumference and ankle plantarflexion strength could not recover completely, the procedure is safe, providing significant improvement in the symptoms and function.</p>
