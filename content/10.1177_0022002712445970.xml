<abstract>
<p>This article tests the hypothesis that ordinary people favor punishing badly behaved foreign actors to make them “pay” for their crimes rather than purely to protect national security interests. In an undergraduate sample, people’s endorsement of the principle of retributive punishment was related to their support for punishing transgressor states and their support for torturing detainees, controlling for partisanship, ideology, humanitarian and security values, and beliefs about the efficacy of force. The interstate transgression scenarios included a state sponsoring terror attacks against a rival, a nuclear proliferator, and a small, unnamed aggressor. Retributive dispositions were also strongly related to support for the death penalty, which helps explain prior findings that American death penalty supporters are unusually bellicose toward foreign wrongdoers.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Much of international relations theory is devoted to analyzing security incentives for the use of force, especially against states that have behaved aggressively or greedily (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0022002712445970">Glaser 2010</xref>). Simplified versions of the same logic inform rationalist theories of public support for war (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0022002712445970">Gelpi, Feaver, and Reifler 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0022002712445970">Jentleson 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0022002712445970">Jentleson and Britton 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0022002712445970">Page and Shapiro 1992</xref>). But only recently have researchers turned their attention to another possible goal for the use of force, the goal of retributive justice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0022002712445970">Harkavy 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0022002712445970">Lebow 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0022002712445970">Löwenheim and Heimann 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0022002712445970">Scheff 1994</xref>).</p>
<p>Retributive justice is punishment that makes wrongdoers “pay” for their crimes, to give them the punishment they deserve, rather than to achieve goals such as protecting public safety. President George W. Bush in early 2003 implied a retributive justice motive for the 2003 Iraq War when, in internal deliberations earlier that year, he rejected the idea of a war-avoiding settlement granting Saddam Hussein a safe exile on the grounds that the Iraqi leader was “a thief, a terrorist, a war criminal. Compared to Saddam, Milosevic would be a Mother Teresa. When we go in, we’ll uncover many more crimes and we’ll take him to the International Court of Justice in The Hague” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0022002712445970">Danner 2007</xref>). Bush also implied a retributive motive in his decision to approve waterboarding in the interrogation of Khalid Sheikh Mohammad, who reportedly masterminded the September 11, 2001, terror attacks and personally beheaded a kidnapped American reporter, Daniel Pearl. “I thought about my meeting with Danny Pearl’s widow, who was pregnant with his son when he was murdered,” Bush recalled. “I thought about the 2,973 people stolen from their families by al Qaeda on 9/11. And I thought about my duty to protect the country from another act of terror. ‘Damn right’, I said” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0022002712445970">Bush 2010</xref>). In general, however, political leaders rarely endorse retribution as a reason for punishing foreign offenders. When they do, they usually add national-interest arguments (e.g., my duty to protect the country).</p>
<p>Retributive motives are easier to investigate in public opinion than in political decision making, and they may play a greater role in public opinion as well. Moral or emotional impulses probably have more sway when the material incentives for or against war appear marginal or uncertain, as must often be the case for ordinary citizens with little knowledge about the costs and benefits of force. Citizens are also not held personally accountable for the consequences of their preferences, a fact of life for responsible decision makers that may compel a greater focus on the long-run consequences of war, and greater restraint from the temptation of “feel good” acts of revenge. Moreover, there is ample evidence that retribution plays a critical role in public thinking about <italic>domestic</italic> crime and punishment (reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0022002712445970">Carlsmith and Darley 2008</xref>). If retributive motives shaped public support for international punishment as well, that might explain leaders’ frequent references to foreign enemies’ crimes and evil natures in their prowar rhetoric (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0022002712445970">Ben-Porath 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0022002712445970">Moerk 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>Prior research on retributive motivation in foreign policy opinion has provided some suggestive, but so far limited, evidence for this hypothesis. Retributive motivations could explain why death penalty supporters and citizens reporting high levels of anger are disproportionately bellicose toward rogue states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0022002712445970">Huddy, Feldman, and Cassese 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0022002712445970">Lambert et al. 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0022002712445970">Liberman 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0022002712445970">2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0022002712445970">Pagano and Huo 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0022002712445970">Sadler et al. 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0022002712445970">Skitka et al. 2006</xref>). Retributive logic can also explain why Americans' support for torture is affected as much by detainees' past crimes as by the prospect of gaining useful intelligence (Carlsmith and Sood 2009).</p>
<p>This article builds on prior work by using a more direct measure of retributiveness than death penalty support (DPS) and by using multiple measures of support for international punishment. Analyzing survey data collected from a large college–student sample I find that individual differences in the endorsement of the principle of retributive punishment predicted support for punishing a range of transgressor states as well as for torturing enemy detainees. These relationships, moreover, were not artifacts of partisanship, ideology, humanitarian or security values, or beliefs about the efficacy of coercion. Retributiveness also correlated highly with support for the death penalty, suggesting that it is death penalty supporters’ retributive values that mainly account for their punitiveness toward domestic and foreign offenders alike.</p>
<p>In addition to seeking a better understanding of the role of retributive logic in public attitudes about war and torture, this article contributes to a broader research agenda on the role of core values in political attitudes (see, e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0022002712445970">Feldman 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0022002712445970">Goren 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0022002712445970">Hurwitz and Peffley 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0022002712445970">Schwartz, Caprara, and Vecchione 2010</xref>). Core values appear to play an important role in structuring people’s political attitudes, particularly on issues that cut across the party lines. Retributivism has been generally neglected in this literature. But as an abstract belief about desirable social outcomes, albeit one confined to approved responses to wrongdoing in various social spheres, it might also be considered a basic value.</p>
<p>The rest of this article is divided into several sections. The next section reviews prior research to set the stage for the present study. This is followed by a description of the main hypotheses, research design, survey sample, and measure of retributiveness. Ensuing sections analyze in turn support for punishing transgressor states, for coercive interrogation, and for the death penalty. A brief conclusion reviews the findings, discusses caveats and directions for future research, and considers implications for theories of public opinion and international politics.</p>

<title>Study Context</title>
<p>Retribution plays a large role in both interpersonal violence and attitudes about criminal punishment. Research on the latter surged following the US Supreme Court’s 1976 reinstatement of the death penalty on the grounds that “the instinct for retribution is part of the nature of man” and that public opinion should help define the boundaries of “cruel and unusual” punishment (quoted in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0022002712445970">Finckenauer 1988</xref>). Surveys revealed that “a life for a life” in fact was Americans’ favored justification for the death penalty, more important than either deterring serious crime or preventing killers from killing again. Most death penalty supporters did not waver when asked to suppose that the penalty had no deterrent effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0022002712445970">Bohm 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0022002712445970">Ellsworth and Gross 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0022002712445970">Ellsworth and Ross 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0022002712445970">Gross and Ellsworth 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0022002712445970">Tyler and Weber 1982</xref>). More recently, experimental research has demonstrated the centrality of retribution in laypeople’s penal sentencing preferences for a variety of crimes, and a surprising insensitivity to instrumental incentives for punishment (reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0022002712445970">Carlsmith and Darley 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Scholarship on criminal punishment attitudes has generally conceptualized retributiveness as a “punishment philosophy,” a “justice orientation,” or a “penal sentencing goal” (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0022002712445970">Bohm 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0022002712445970">McKee and Feather 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0022002712445970">Okimoto, Wenzel, and Feather 2011</xref>). But it might also be considered as one of many fundamental human values, which can be defined as “cognitive representations of desirable, transsituational goals” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0022002712445970">Schwartz, Caprara, and Vecchione 2010</xref>). Most scholarship on values and political attitudes has focused on more self-evidently political values, such as egalitarianism, humanitarianism, libertarianism, militarism, anticommunism, and ethnocentrism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0022002712445970">Feldman 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0022002712445970">Goren 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0022002712445970">Hurwitz and Peffley 1987</xref>; and the review by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0022002712445970">Feldman 2003</xref>). Retributiveness has also been omitted from most basic personal values inventories, such as the values of power, achievement, hedonism, stimulation, self-direction, universalism, benevolence, tradition, conformity, and security studied by Schwartz and collaborators (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0022002712445970">Schwartz, Caprara, and Vecchione 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>None of the Schwartz’s ten basic personal values quite captures the concept of retributive justice. Although retributive punishment may incidentally affect security or conformity, it is defined as an end in itself—“just deserts” —rather than a means to personal or societal safety or stability. Nor is retributivism the polar opposite of benevolence or humanitarianism. Retributivism sometimes calls for the kind of harsh and tough-minded violence opposed by humanitarians, but only when the targets are wrongdoers. This conditionality probably accounts for the exclusion of retributivism from most lists of basic values. But a likely “transsituational relevance” of retributive values can be seen in the correlations observed between people’s endorsement of these values, their own vengeful behavior, and their sentencing preferences for garden-variety criminals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0022002712445970">Cota-McKinley, Woody, and Bell 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0022002712445970">Douglas and Martinko 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0022002712445970">Eisenberger et al. 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0022002712445970">McCullough et al. 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0022002712445970">McKee and Feather 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Even if a retributive disposition or core value shapes thinking across multiple social domains, it might not influence support for punishing international transgressions as much as personal or societal ones. The relative costliness of wars, compared to death row executions, may overshadow the moral urgency of punishing wrongdoers. Retributive motives for punishment are also likely to be far weaker when it is foreign peoples who have been wronged rather than fellow citizens, with whom people tend to identify much more strongly.</p>
<p>However, several studies have produced suggestive evidence that retributive punishment goals do in fact affect support for punishing foreign transgressors, at least in certain circumstances. Desires to avenge the September 11 attacks on the United States were strong predictors of support for the War on Terror and the Iraq War (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0022002712445970">Liberman and Skitka 2011a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0022002712445970">2011b</xref>). Death penalty supporters’ disproportionate support for wars against Afghanistan and Iraq also suggest retributive motivations for war, in light of the retributive nature of people’s support for capital punishment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0022002712445970">Liberman 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0022002712445970">2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0022002712445970">Liberman and Skitka 2011b</xref>). Equally suggestive, in light of anger’s close connection to retribution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0022002712445970">Barber, Maltby, and Macaskill 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0022002712445970">Carlsmith, Darley, and Robinson 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0022002712445970">Douglas and Martinko 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0022002712445970">McCullough et al. 2001</xref>), are findings that anger predicts support for war or other sanctions on offending out-groups (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0022002712445970">Gordijn et al. 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0022002712445970">Lambert et al. 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0022002712445970">Mackie, Devos, and Smith 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0022002712445970">Huddy, Feldman, and Cassese 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0022002712445970">Sadler et al. 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0022002712445970">Skitka et al. 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0022002712445970">Pagano and Huo 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Inferring retributive motivations from such cross-sectional data requires controlling for covariates that might account for these findings. Even with direct measures of vengeance-seeking or retributiveness, it is necessary to address the possibility that their associations with punitiveness are due, for example, to desires for security and inclinations or aversions to the use of force, along with any dispositions to experience these desires (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0022002712445970">Cohrs et al. 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0022002712445970">Hurwitz and Peffley 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0022002712445970">Schwartz, Caprara, and Vecchione 2010</xref>). Abstract efficacy-of-force beliefs like “bad actors will inevitably strike unless they are incapacitated” and “punishing bad actors demonstrates that crime does not pay” offer another plausible explanation for these associations, one consistent with “rational public” theories of public opinion (applications to public support for war include <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0022002712445970">Eichenberg 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0022002712445970">Gelpi, Feaver, and Reifler 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0022002712445970">Jentleson 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0022002712445970">Jentleson and Britton 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0022002712445970">Page and Shapiro 1992</xref>). Reliance on proxy measures for vengeance seeking or retributiveness, such as anger and DPS, only increases the range of plausible alternative explanations for associations with support for international punishment.</p>
<p>Experiments that manipulate retributive and utilitarian incentives for punishment, at least certain types of punishment, can circumvent this problem. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0022002712445970">Carlsmith and Sood (2009</xref>) reported the results of a survey experiment that manipulated both retributive and instrumental incentives for using coercive interrogation against an Afghan detainee. Respondents were given varying estimates of the likelihood that the prisoner was withholding vital information about an imminent terror attack. Some were given additional information about his past terrorist activities, and this group’s members endorsed much harsher interrogation methods than those who were not told about these activities. Exposure to these past crimes increased the severity of preferred interrogation methods as much as did being told that there was a 95 percent chance that the prisoner was withholding vital information, compared to being told that this likelihood was zero. Preferences on interrogation severity also correlated closely with those on how harshly the prisoner should be “punished,” providing further evidence that people viewed torture as a punishment rather than simply a means to extract information.</p>
<p>Although this study provided compelling evidence of the retributive nature of punitiveness toward individual terrorists, it is far from self-evident that the effect generalizes to punitiveness toward transgressor states. Punishing states usually entails more blood and treasure than does punishing powerless prisoners, and these costs might lead people to think twice before allowing their retributive urges to determine their level of support for war.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, experimental designs are less able to discriminate between retributive and pragmatic motives for punishing states than in the case of detainees. It is easy to imagine an imprisoned terrorist or insurgent having no information about future terror attacks and posing no further danger to others. But international punishment is inherently a public affair, and a state’s past crimes might easily be seen as a measure of its future dangerousness. Respondents might see war against a rogue state as useful for security, even when provided with expert assessments to the contrary. Thus, the present study focuses on relationships between retributiveness and support for punishment, albeit using measures of each that differ in important ways from prior cross-sectional studies.</p>

<title>Hypotheses, Research Design, Study Sample, and Measuring Retributiveness</title>
<p>To advance our understanding of the retributive basis for international punishment, this article tests three hypotheses: Retributiveness heightens support for the use of military force against states that have violated international norms (Hypothesis 1), for torturing detained terrorists and insurgents (Hypothesis 2), and for the death penalty (Hypothesis 3). Although this article’s focus is on retributive punishment of foreign wrongdoers, I use DPS data in the same data set as an aid to interpreting other studies’ findings on the disproportionate bellicosity of death penalty supporters.</p>
<p>The data analyzed here were collected in an online survey completed by 946 college students at a large southeastern university, for extra credit in a required introductory American Politics course, from April 26 to May 6, 2010. The sample was obviously younger (<italic>M</italic> = 21) than the nation as a whole, as well as being more female (63%), African American (39%), Asian (14%), Democratic (52%), and liberal (44%). But it is nonetheless useful for investigating relationships between retributiveness and punitive attitudes.</p>
<p>I measured retributiveness by asking respondents about their approval or disapproval of the principle of retributive punishment. The two central concepts in retributive justice are deservingness and proportional punishment. Several seven-level agree/disagree questions addressing both of these concepts, drawn from prior work on criminal punishment sentencing goals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0022002712445970">Bohm 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0022002712445970">McKee and Feather 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0022002712445970">Pratto, Stallworth, and Conway-Lanz 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0022002712445970">Tyler and Weber 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0022002712445970">Vidmar 1974</xref>):
<list list-type="order">
<list-item>
<p>Society should not punish murderers just to avenge the victims. (Reversed)</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>For a terrible crime, there should be a terrible punishment.</p>
</list-item>

<list-item>
<p>Those who hurt others deserve to be hurt in return.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Punishment should fit the crime.</p>
</list-item>
</list>
For the most part, these items avoid loaded terms like “retribution,” “vengeance,” and “revenge,” whose negative connotations might increase measurement error. The two con-trait items were somewhat distinct from the pro-trait items, an exploratory factor analysis (EFA) showed. But I retained these items to reduce acquiescence bias, combining all five items into a <italic>Retributive</italic> scale, adjusted to range from 0 to 1 (like all the variables in this study), with higher scores representing greater approval of retributive punishment (α = .68; <italic>M</italic> =.56; <italic>SD </italic>=.19).</p>
<p>Although analyzing correlations between dispositions and attitudes is an indirect way to investigate their motivations, it is probably better than simply asking people why they support or oppose punishing particular foreign offenders. People often are unaware of the reasons for their preferences on specific issues, especially those guided by intuition and gut feeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0022002712445970">Wilson 2002</xref>). Moral judgment is particularly likely to be driven by intuition; what is often taken for moral reasoning is really postdecisional rationalization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0022002712445970">Haidt 2001</xref>). Even when people are aware of their retributive motives, moreover, sensitivities to a cultural taboo on revenge and retribution—rooted in Christian teachings of forgiveness, states’ demands to monopolize the administration of justice, and widespread utilitarian principles—may lead to systematic misrepresentation. Of course, these problems might also undermine measures of retributive dispositions (for a related discussion, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0022002712445970">Carlsmith 2008</xref>). Any such measurement error, however, would tend to limit observed associations between retributiveness and support for punishment, resulting in a more conservative test of this study’s hypotheses.</p>

<title>Does Retributiveness Predict Support for International Punishment?</title>
<p>In order to probe the generality of retributive punitiveness toward foreign transgressors, I used a variety of international crime-and-punishment scenarios and avoided Afghanistan and Iraq, cases that already have been studied in prior research. Two questions were posed about each of the three hypothetical international transgressions:
<list list-type="order">
<list-item>
<p>How should the United States respond if one small nation attacks another that has done it no harm? [Response options: do nothing; condemn the aggressor; impose economic sanctions on the aggressor; bomb the aggressor; invade the aggressor and overthrow its government]</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>How severely do you feel the aggressor should be punished for its actions? [No punishment at all; very weak punishment; weak punishment; moderate punishment; strong punishment; very strong punishment]</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>How should the United States respond if Iran withdraws from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty and tries to build nuclear weapons? [Do nothing; condemn Iran; impose economic sanctions on Iran; bomb Iran; invade Iran and overthrow its government]</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>How severely do you feel Iran should be punished for its actions? [No punishment at all; very weak punishment; weak punishment; moderate punishment; strong punishment; very strong punishment]</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>How should the United States respond if the government of Pakistan was found to have sponsored a deadly terrorist attack killing hundreds of civilians in India? [Do nothing; condemn Pakistan; impose economic sanctions on Pakistan; bomb Pakistan; invade Pakistan and overthrow its government]</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>How severely do you feel Pakistan should be punished for its actions? [No punishment at all; very weak punishment; weak punishment; moderate punishment; strong punishment; very strong punishment]</p>
</list-item>
</list>
The intercorrelated responses to these items suggest that they measured a common underlying reaction. An EFA revealed a single dominant underlying factor (Eigenvalue = 1.97 followed by 0.29).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0022002712445970">1</xref></sup> I thus averaged these items into a single scale named <italic>Punishment</italic> (α = .74, <italic>M</italic> = .54, <italic>SD</italic> =.17).</p>
<p>This measure provides relatively conservative tests of the hypothesis that people punish transgressor states to give them their just deserts. Retributive reactions to these scenarios were likely to be limited by the absence of American or allied victims, as well as by the lack of vivid details about the wrongdoers, their malevolent intentions, and their crimes, all of which would have tended to magnify emotional arousal and judgments of blame (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0022002712445970">Alter, Kernochan, and Darley 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0022002712445970">Douglas, Lyon, and Ogloff 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0022002712445970">Gordijn, Wigboldus, and Taber 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0022002712445970">Gordijn et al. 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0022002712445970">Ogloff and Vidmar 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0022002712445970">Small and Loewenstein 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0022002712445970">Yzerbyt et al. 2003</xref>). In addition, the position of the <italic>Punishment </italic>items immediately following questions about the utility of force (described in the following) and far removed from the <italic>Retributive</italic> items eliminated the possibility of question-order effects favorable to the hypothesis that retributiveness matters.</p>
<p>To control for political identification and ideology, I used standard seven-level measures of political partisanship (<italic>Republican</italic>, <italic>M</italic> =.36, <italic>SD</italic> =.31) and left–right ideology (<italic>Conservative</italic>, <italic>M</italic> =.43, <italic>SD</italic> =.27), as well as an abbreviated scale of right-wing authoritarianism (RWA), which has been found in prior work to correlate with attitudes about both criminal punishment and war (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0022002712445970">Doty et al. 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0022002712445970">McFarland 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0022002712445970">McKee and Feather 2008</xref>). The <italic>RWA</italic> scale combined six questions on agreement/disagreement with the following statements (α = .76, <italic>M</italic> =.29, <italic>SD</italic> =.11):
<list list-type="order">

</list-item>
</list>The survey also included items on humanitarian values, security concerns, and instrumental beliefs about the efficacy of punishment. Several were specific to the foreign policy domain. An EFA on these items revealed two clear dimensions (two Eigenvalues near 2.0 and the third dropping to 0.36). One dimension reflected hawkish/dovish attitudes. As can be seen from the rotated factor loadings shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0022002712445970">Table 1</xref>, there was considerable similarity between the importance people attached to national security (item 3), their belief in the utility of force (items 9 and 10), and their desires for military power and spending (items 1, 2, and 4). I thus combined these 6 items into a single scale named <italic>Hawk</italic> (α = .76, <italic>M</italic> =.56 of a 0–1 range, <italic>SD</italic> =.16). Because responses to the item on bombing (item 11 in the table) were relatively unrelated to this hawk/dove factor, I used it as a separate measure of belief in the coercive efficacy of <italic>Bombing </italic>(scaled 0–1 so that higher values reflected belief in the efficacy of coercive bombing; <italic>M</italic> =.39, <italic>SD</italic> =.34). The 4 items on helping poor countries (items 5–8) loaded on the second factor and were combined into a <italic>Humanitarian</italic> scale (α = .74, <italic>M </italic>=.63, <italic>SD</italic> =.18), which correlated only weakly with <italic>Hawk</italic> (<italic>r</italic> = .05).</p>

<p>For added confidence that the importance of observed associations between <italic>Retributive</italic> and <italic>Punishment</italic> was not due to the importance respondents attached to security, I used Schwartz’s measure of the personal value of security, taken from the 21-item version of his Portrait Values Questionnaire (PVQ). <italic>Security</italic> combined two questions on the similarity or difference people felt with those for whom “It is important to her/him to live in secure surroundings.

These items did not load heavily on either of the two foreign policy factors when added to the EFA shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0022002712445970">Table 1</xref>, and <italic>Security</italic> correlated only moderately with <italic>Hawk</italic> (<italic>r</italic> = .33).

<p>
<italic>Retributive</italic> was a significant predictor of <italic>Punishment</italic>, as can be seen from the first regression in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0022002712445970">Table 2</xref> (model 2A).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0022002712445970">3</xref></sup> This association was not epiphenomenal to gender, race, partisanship, or ideology; controlling for these variables hardly affects the <italic>Retribution</italic> term (model 2C). <italic>Retributive</italic> remained significantly related to <italic>Punishment</italic> after controlling for <italic>Hawk, Bombing, Security,</italic> and <italic>Humanitarian</italic> (see model 2E).

<p>Among the individual <italic>Punishment</italic> items, the more abstract ones on the preferred severity of punishment correlated more strongly with <italic>Retributive</italic> than did those asking about specific sanctions. In separate ordinary least squares regressions of the abstract punishment items for each separate scenario on the independent variables in model 2E, all ranging 0–1, <italic>Retributive</italic> was a significant predictor of punishing Iran (unstandardized <italic>b</italic> = .23, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01) as well as of punishing the small nation and Pakistan (both <italic>b</italic> = .18, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01). But <italic>Retributive</italic> predicted support for the escalating specific sanctions only against Iran.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0022002712445970">4</xref></sup> This might reflect a weaker retributive motivation when the prospect of specific international sanctions brings their costs and complications to mind, particularly at the time of relatively high war weariness among US citizens.</p>
<p>It is not clear why retributivists responded relatively more virulently in the Iran case than in the Pakistan or “small state” scenarios. Prior images of Iran as a more evil state than either Pakistan or the “small nation” might have amplified retributive responses, despite the arguably less serious moral wrongfulness of nuclear proliferation compared to interstate aggression or supporting terrorism. Americans have widely regarded the Iranian regime as morally bad from the time of the 1979 hostage crisis, an image no doubt accentuated by Iranian leaders anti-American rhetoric and President Bush’s branding Iran as part of an “Axis of Evil.”</p>
<p>An alternative possibility is that perceptions of Iran as more threatening accounted for retributivists’ greater willingness to endorse specific sanctions in that case. Most small nations are unlikely to pose much danger to the United States and Pakistan’s current alliance with the United States might have diffused the threatening implications of its sponsorship of terrorism against a third party. But 60 to 72 percent of Americans have called Iran’s nuclear program a “major threat to the well being of the United States” in recent years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0022002712445970">Pew Research Center for the People &amp; the Press 2009</xref>). If it was the security rather than moral implications of a nuclear Iran that aroused retributivists, that would be more consistent with a utilitarian account than a retributive one.</p>
<p>Although these questions will require further research to resolve, the overall findings are consistent with the hypothesis that retributiveness is an important source of support for punishing foreign transgressor states. It is certainly not the only source, and security and humanitarian beliefs and values accounted for greater variance in international punishment than did retributiveness. But the effect of retributiveness appears to be distinct from these other beliefs and values, and it contributes to punitiveness above and beyond their effects.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0022002712445970">
<title>Does Retributiveness Predict Support for Torture?</title>
<p>I now turn to the hypothesis that people’s endorsement of retributive justice affects their approval of the use of torture. Rather than testing the situational factors shaping the severity of preferred interrogation measures, a la <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0022002712445970">Carlsmith and Sood (2009</xref>), I investigate the role of individual-level differences in retributive values and potential covariates. This approach can explain why people differ over torture even when possessing the same information about the issue, and it provides a novel test of Carlsmith and Sood’s (2009) argument that retributive motives play a large role in public opinion about torture.</p>
<p>This survey included four questions on support for torture, prefaced with a common stem: “The US has signed a number of treaties that prohibit certain methods for trying to get information from detainees. Here are some of those prohibitions. For each one, please select whether you agree or disagree:”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0022002712445970">5</xref></sup>
<list list-type="order">
<list-item>
<p>Governments should never use physical torture.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Governments should never threaten physical torture.</p>
</list-item>

</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Governments should never use humiliating or degrading treatment.</p>
</list-item>
</list>The four items combined into an internally reliable scale of <italic>Torture, </italic>ranging from 0 to 1 so that higher values reflected greater support for coercion (α = .82, <italic>M</italic> = .44, <italic>SD</italic> = .25). Even though the questions did not specifically mention any particular sort of detainees, it is reasonable to assume that <italic>Torture</italic> measured people’s support for torturing foreign terrorists and insurgents, whose treatment has been at the forefront of the national debate on the issue. As with the items used to measure <italic>Punishment,</italic> the <italic>Torture</italic> items appeared so much later in the survey than the <italic>Retributive</italic> items (by nearly ninety questions), results were unlikely to be strengthened by question-order effects.</p>
<p>The goals and consequences of torture obviously differ from those of military punishment in some important ways. So while controlling once again for general military hawkishness with <italic>Hawk</italic>, I drop the utility of <italic>Bombing</italic> from the analysis of support for torture. In addition, I controlled for three additional variables reflecting beliefs about the utility of torture. Defenders of torture contend that it can extract information vital for preventing impending terror attacks, whereas critics reply that it yields unreliable confessions. Critics also contend that US maltreatment of enemy detainees will make American personnel falling into enemy hands more likely to be mistreated as well. These two reasons for and against torture were tapped, respectively, by questions 12 and 13 included in the EFA shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0022002712445970">Table 1</xref>. Responses to these questions were distinct from the “hawk” and “humanitarian” factors underlying the other foreign policy items, as can be seen from their high uniqueness. They were also scarcely related to each other (<italic>r</italic> = −.05), so I treated them as separate variables, <italic>Savelives</italic> (<italic>M</italic> =.47, <italic>SD</italic> =.28) and <italic>Blowback</italic> (<italic>M</italic> =.61, <italic>SD</italic> = .27). Both were scored 0–1, so that higher values of <italic>Savelives</italic> represented stronger faith in the utility of coercive interrogation, and higher values of <italic>Blowback</italic> reflected greater concern that torturing terrorists would eventually boomerang against American detainees. The third variable was concern about the terrorist <italic>Threat</italic>—measured with a four-level question asking, “How worried are you that in the near future there will be terrorist attacks in this country?” This should control for any effect of the desire to prevent future terror attacks on support for torture, just in case security-minded individuals also tend to be disproportionately retributive as well.</p>
<p>
<italic>Retributive</italic> was a strong predictor of support for torture even when controlling for all of these variables (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0022002712445970">Table 3</xref>, model 3B). Republicans were somewhat more favorable to torture than were Democrats, unsurprisingly, given the partisan debate over the Bush administration’s use of waterboarding and other coercive interrogation measures. Those worrying about the terror threat, and especially those who said that torture can save American lives, also tended to be more supportive of torture, while those concerned about blowback from torture were more opposed. More surprising was the relatively large coefficient of <italic>Hawk</italic>, indicating a substantial role for people’s general posture on national security issues.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0022002712445970">6</xref></sup>

<p>The shrinking of the <italic>Hawk</italic> coefficient with the addition of <italic>Retributive</italic> indicates some shared explained variance. It seems unlikely that hawkish international security preferences could have shaped retributiveness. Another possibility is that retributiveness influences beliefs about the acquisition of military power, which can support military retribution as well as more prosaic goals. Retributiveness might also lead some people to endorse the deterrent and defensive virtues of force, in order to rationalize desired retributive punishment. But the shared variance could also stem from abstract moral or instrumental beliefs about force reflected in, but not fully captured by, these measures.</p>
<p>Although addressing these questions will require further research, they do not alter the basic finding that the endorsement of retributive justice was a strong predictor of support for torture after controlling for gender, race, partisanship, ideology, humanitarianism, the core value of security, foreign policy hawkishness, and more specific beliefs about the utility of torture. This provides further evidence for the contention that ordinary people support torture in large part because they feel that detainees deserve to suffer for their crimes.</p>

<title>Retributiveness and DPS</title>
<p>Because there has been so much more data collected on DPS than on retributive values per se, there are many more opportunities to use secondary data analysis to study associations between DPS and support for international punishment or for torture. Additional data on DPS collected in the survey analyzed here offer an opportunity to test the validity of this approach. Prior work on beliefs and values behind DPS has generally focused on retributive versus deterrent punishment principles, but not the other security and humanitarian beliefs and values measured in this survey.</p>
<p>DPS was measured using 3 items:
<list list-type="order">
<list-item>
<p>Do you favor or oppose the death penalty for persons convicted of murder? [Response options: strongly oppose, somewhat oppose, neutral, somewhat support, strongly support]</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>If you could choose between the following two approaches, which do you think is the better penalty for murder, the death penalty or life imprisonment, with absolutely no possibility of parole? [Strongly prefer death penalty, moderately prefer death penalty, neutral, moderately prefer life imprisonment, strongly prefer life imprisonment]</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Uphold the death penalty for the most serious crimes. [Strongly agree, agree somewhat, agree, neither agree nor disagree, somewhat disagree, disagree, or strongly disagree]</p>
</list-item>
</list>
These items were averaged and rescaled 0–1 so that higher values reflected greater <italic>DPS</italic> (α = .77, <italic>M</italic> =.47, <italic>SD</italic> =.15).</p>
<p>People’s benevolence toward their fellow citizens ought to be more salient to domestic crime and punishment attitudes than their general benevolence toward foreigners. So instead of using <italic>Humanitarian</italic>, which comprises attitudes about world hunger and development, I used a measure of interpersonal universalism and benevolence constructed from the following PVQ items:<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0022002712445970">7</xref></sup>
<list list-type="order">
<list-item>
<p>She or he thinks it is important that every person in the world should be treated equally. She or he believes everyone should have equal opportunities in life.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>It is important to him or her to listen to people who are different from her or him. Even when she or he disagrees with them, she still wants to understand them.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>It’s very important to her or him to help the people around her or him. She or he wants to care for their well-being.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>It is important to her or him to be loyal to her friends. She or he wants to devote herself or himself to people close to her or him.</p>
</list-item>
</list>All 4 items were averaged and rescaled 0–1 so that higher values reflected greater universalism and benevolence, or <italic>Benevolent</italic> for short (α = .67, <italic>M</italic> =.82, <italic>SD</italic> =.14).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0022002712445970">8</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>The survey lacked questions on the utility of criminal punishment for public safety, requiring reliance on the measure of foreign policy hawkishness, <italic>Hawk</italic>, used in the earlier analyses, as a surrogate measure. <italic>RWA</italic>, with its item on the need to “do what has to be done to destroy the radical new ways and sinfulness that are ruining us,” might also reflect such beliefs.</p>
<p>
<italic>Retributive</italic> was by far the strongest predictor of <italic>DPS</italic>, although race, gender, personal benevolence, concern for security, and foreign policy hawkishness were also significant predictors (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0022002712445970">Table 3</xref>, model 3D).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0022002712445970">9</xref></sup> The steep decline of the <italic>Hawk</italic> term when controlling for <italic>Retributive</italic> is consistent with retributiveness being a source of both hawkishness and DPS. Another possibility, however, is that this measure of retributiveness is contaminated by beliefs about the utility of punishment. This cannot be determined further with the present data.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, these findings suggest that the retributive nature of DPS–rather than its basis in insecurity or tough-mindedness—accounts for much if not all of the associations found in prior research between DPS and support for punishing transgressor states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0022002712445970">Liberman 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0022002712445970">2007</xref>). But because DPS is also related to humanitarian and security values and beliefs, it remains important to control for these values and beliefs when using DPS as a proxy for retributiveness.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>In the survey data analyzed here, college students who more strongly endorsed the principle of retributive punishment also tended to favor harsher punishment of transgressor states and harsher treatment of detainees. These relationships occurred despite the hypothetical nature of the transgressions and the absence of the sort of graphic details that heighten anger and desires for retributive justice. The fact that the United States was not victimized in the international transgressions—in contrast to the presumably American victims of terrorist and insurgent detainees—also would have logically limited retributive reactions.</p>
<p>The results controlled for partisanship, ideology, humanitarianism, security concerns, and beliefs in the efficacy of military force or of coercive interrogation. These controls represent a different and, arguably, more comprehensive set of potentially confounding beliefs and values than were included in prior studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0022002712445970">Liberman 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0022002712445970">2007</xref>). Undoubtedly, there remains room for improvement in these measures. But if additional items fell on the same hawk/dove and humanitarian dimensions underlying the diverse issue positions and beliefs measured in this survey, they would be unlikely to account for the apparent effects of retributiveness.</p>
<p>The findings on torture are also consistent with prior research showing that laypeople endorse torturing terrorists to give them their just deserts rather than merely to extract vital information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0022002712445970">Carlsmith and Sood 2009</xref>). The different method of capturing retributive motivations used here—individual differences in retributive values rather than situational differences in deservingness—lends added weight to this conclusion.</p>
<p>In addition, the substantial relationship of retributiveness to DPS lends support to inferences about retributive dispositions from studies analyzing DPS/war support correlations (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0022002712445970">Liberman 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0022002712445970">2007</xref>). In other words, death penalty supporters would appear to be disproportionately bellicose toward rogue states because of their “eye for an eye” values rather than because of their beliefs about the sanctity of human life or the utility of punishment. Insofar as the college student sample analyzed here resembles the US population, scholars lacking more direct measures would be justified in using DPS as a proxy for retributiveness in future secondary data analyses. This caveat about generalizability owing to reliance on a convenience sample applies to the study’s other findings as well. Future research ought to try to test whether these findings can be replicated in random samples, not only in the United States but also in other countries as well.</p>
<p>More broadly, this study contributes to the accumulating evidence that values and morality shape political attitudes (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0022002712445970">Schwartz, Caprara, and Vecchione 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0022002712445970">Skitka 2010</xref>). It also points to the potential fruitfulness of looking beyond systems of universal values, such as the Schwartz basic personal values inventory, to other values that might shape judgment about particular value-laden personal, societal, and international issues. This is not to argue that retributiveness accounts for broad structures of public foreign and domestic policy attitudes. The ethic of desert may extend beyond criminal and international punishment, but it applies mainly to the punishment of wrongdoing. Future work ought to investigate the explanatory horizons and boundaries of retributiveness.</p>
<p>Security and other material incentives cannot explain punishment sought as an end in itself, especially when punishment is costly to impose.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0022002712445970">10</xref></sup> To be sure, none of the scenarios used here to measure punishment specifically ruled out the utility of punishment. Moreover, rational materialism can explain why retributive values explained less variance in attitudes about the costly enterprise of punishing states than about punishing helpless detainees. It might also explain why retributivism predicted support for punishment in the abstract more than support for specific sanctions, whose concreteness might have made their costs more salient. However, these limitations point to potential boundary conditions on retributive motives for military punishment rather than challenging their existence altogether.</p>
<p>The support for interstate punishment observed in this study was unlikely to have been elite led, due to the hypothetical nature of the scenarios and the lack of elite polarization over them. Torture has been a more partisan issue, which is reflected in data analyzed here. The apparent effect of retributiveness on both sorts of attitudes suggests that elite leadership is not a necessary condition. But political communication that frames conflicts in morally black-and-white terms, punctuated by graphic descriptions of heinous, unpunished crimes, is likely to amplify the public’s retributive bellicosity. Political elites favoring restraint should instead acknowledge offending states’ legitimate grievances and trumpet successful punishments. Political communication on international morality is likely to have an independent effect from communication focused on the costs and benefits of international sanctions, even though the latter may well moderate the effect of the former.</p>
<p>Parallel lessons can be drawn, though with still more serious caveats, about foreign policy making and international politics. To the extent that decision makers have the same retributive reactions as the student population studied here, or to the extent that they feel compelled to pander to such audiences, desires for retribution might actually shape actual international conflicts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0022002712445970">Harkavy 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0022002712445970">Lebow 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0022002712445970">Löwenheim and Heimann 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0022002712445970">Scheff 1994</xref>). If so, that would underline the importance of avoiding gratuitous international injury and insult, as well as the value of international apologies in deflating international animosities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0022002712445970">David and Choi 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0022002712445970">Lind 2009</xref>). However, there are good reasons to expect that most leaders think about foreign policy in less emotional and moralistic terms than do average citizens and have considerable autonomy from public pressure to go to war. Much work remains to be done to investigate not only the psychology of international punishment but also how it might affect actual foreign policies and conflicts.</p>

<p>The item on specific sanctions on the “small nation” was most unique, with a factor loading of .38 compared to .50–.72 for the rest. I retained the item for simplicity and symmetry, but dropping it from the <italic>Punishment</italic> scale yielded a stronger <italic>Punishment</italic>/<italic>Retributive</italic> relationship. The other two specific sanctions items also loaded less strongly (.50–.52) than did those on punishment severity (.58–.73). This could reflect the inferior psychometric qualities of substantively diverse response options or more complex interactions between the specific response options and the scenarios.</p>

<p>Compound measures of universalism/benevolence and power/achievement values were only other PVQ values besides <italic>Security </italic>having significant bivariate correlations with <italic>Torture</italic>.

<p>This does not necessarily mean that retributive punishment is irrational—people can rationally seek deontological moral as well as material ends. And although retributive justice has many critics among ethicists, it also has trenchant defenders from Immanuel Kant to the present (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0022002712445970">French 2001</xref>).</p>
