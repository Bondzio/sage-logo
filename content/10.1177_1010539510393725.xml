<abstract>
<p>The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of job stress among secondary school teachers using Karasek Job Content Questionnaire (JCQ), the association between salivary cortisol, salivary IgA, and sociodemographic characteristics, and the association between log cortisol, IgA levels, and job strain categories. A cross-sectional study was undertaken using JCQ and salivary cortisol and IgA samples. Cluster sampling was done yielding 302 respondents. The prevalence of stress among all teachers was 20.2%. Being a Malay, teaching experience of 5 to 10 years, and those without a supervisor’s support had higher prevalence of high job strain. Teachers in the 31 to 40 years age bracket, educating handicapped children with the absence of supervisor support exhibited higher stress levels with lower log salivary IgA levels. Further studies must be conducted using salivary biomarkers to study the in-depth relationship of stress, extending into other occupational groups.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Since the 1980s, teaching has been cited as a stressful job because of increasing complexity and intensity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1010539510393725">1</xref></sup> The reasons cited for this being multitasking, namely handling additional responsibilities, reviewing curriculum, handling students, parents, the school community, and departmental initiatives.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1010539510393725">2</xref></sup> The complexity and intensity in teaching has been further compounded by societal changes, reformed and increased work tasks, changed moral and normative character of teacher work, and devoting too much of time for all this.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1010539510393725">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1010539510393725">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1010539510393725">5</xref></sup> Globalization has brought along advancement in information technology and together with the advancement of knowledge among students, the school teacher’s job has remarkably become stressful.</p>
<p>Surmounting job stress among teachers has led to concerns of increasing resignation, stress, and burnout among teachers. In the Western world, 25% to 40% of beginning teachers are leaving the profession or are burned out in the first 3 to 5 years of teaching, and the overall attrition rates in Australia are quoted as 3% to 8%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1010539510393725">6</xref></sup> Significant importance is given to stress affecting teachers as this not only affects their performance and health status but also the quality of teaching.</p>
<p>Stress studies in the past used traditional methods namely subjective questionnaires or interviews. Lately, stress studies have ventured into using serum or salivary biomarkers namely cortisol and IgA. Work stress, a common phenomenon currently, has been shown to be associated with several salivary biomarkers. The choice of the salivary biomarker to assess the body’s response to work stress depends on the type of stress studied. Chronic stress is related to the kind of job teachers do. Chronic stress encompasses a stimulus (persisting for an extended period of time) from the environment, a person’s appraisal of that environment, and biobehavioral responses that support coping strategies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1010539510393725">7</xref></sup> Chronic stress is associated with the activation of the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis (measured by salivary cortisol), as well as with the depression of immune function (measured by salivary IgA and lysozyme).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1010539510393725">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>Salivary biomarkers (cortisol and IgA) have found a place in stress studies because they can be obtained noninvasively and because they do not need trained phlebotomists. Other added advantages include no risk of needle pricks, ease of use, reflect real-time levels of biomarkers, self-collection, and relevance in chronic stress. Salivary cortisol and plasma-bound cortisol correlate closely. An added advantage is the minimization of stress from fear of needles, which may bias the results.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1010539510393725">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>Salivary cortisol levels have been studied in ambulance paramedics, where there was a greater salivary cortisol reaction during the handling of life-threatening situations compared with non-life-threatening situations. Similarly, ambulance dispatchers exhibited increased salivary cortisol levels during work compared with controls.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1010539510393725">9</xref></sup> On the contrary, low salivary cortisol levels were found in teachers with work exhaustion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1010539510393725">8</xref></sup> and chronic work stress due to laboratory stress task.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1010539510393725">10</xref></sup> One explanation for the opposite regulations of the HPA seen in chronic stress could be the chronic high levels of cortisol downregulating the glucocorticoid receptors in the hypothalamus and pituitary gland.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1010539510393725">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1010539510393725">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>A few studies have reported the response of salivary IgA in chronic work stress. Several studies have examined the association between chronic work stress and salivary IgA levels and found an inverse relationship.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1010539510393725">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1010539510393725">14</xref></sup> Furthermore, studies addressing job stress using salivary biomarkers have rarely been executed in this country.</p>
<p>The aim of this study was to determine (<italic>a</italic>) the prevalence of job stress among secondary school teachers using the Job Content Questionnaire (JCQ), (<italic>b</italic>) the association between salivary biomarkers (cortisol and IgA) and sociodemographic characteristics, and (<italic>c</italic>) the association between salivary biomarkers and job strain categories based on Karasek Job Strain Model.</p>

<sec id="section2-1010539510393725" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>This was a cross-sectional study carried out among secondary school teachers in the Federal Territory, Malaysia. Cluster sampling was done to select 7 secondary schools among a total of 35. The exclusion criteria were as follows: those who did not provide consent, had a history of psychiatric illness, temporary and part-time teachers, pregnancy, a chronic diseases affecting the immune system, regular medication with known effects on the immune system; and present or past (1 week) history of upper respiratory tract infection (URTI), as URTI will affect the level of IgA. The study was carried out from June 2007 till June 2008.</p>
<p>A self-administered JCQ in 2 languages (English and Bahasa Malaysia, national language) was used to collect the data. The questionnaires were pretested and validated in Malaysia in a previous study.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1010539510393725">15</xref></sup> One of the well-known theoretical models used in job stress studies is the job demand/control model developed by Karasek with 2 main dimensions: psychological demand (PD) and decision latitude (DL) at work.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1010539510393725">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1010539510393725">17</xref></sup> This job strain model proposes that workers with high demanding jobs also have low control with limited opportunities to use skills resulting in high job strain/stress.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1010539510393725">18</xref></sup> This instrument measures the content of a work task. This model provides a summary of the 4 types of job combinations that can result from the different combinations of job demand and job decision latitude (job control), namely high strain, low strain, active job, and passive job. Job strain was defined as a combination of 2 scales, namely, DL and PD. The prevalence of job strain was determined by using the median of the PD and DL scores as cut-off points, where those above the median were considered high and those below were considered as low for both scales. The PD and DL dimensions were used to classify the work into 4 exposure groups: the “high strain” workers were characterized by high PD and low DL, “active” by high PD and high DL, the “low strain” by low PD and high DL, and “passive” by low PD and low DL.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1010539510393725">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1010539510393725">20</xref></sup></p>
<p>For the purpose of the analysis, the 4 job strain groups were dichotomized into “high job strain” and “non–high job strain.” The high job strain group consisted of subjects classified under “high strain” based on the Karasek Job Demand Control Model, whereas the subjects in “active,” “passive,” and “low job strain” were grouped as the non–high job strain. The total scores for selected psychosocial job factors, namely, job insecurity, job dissatisfaction, depression, psychosomatic strain, sleeping problems, physical exertion, and social support were calculated based on the answers from the JCQ. The sociodemographic variables consisted of age, gender, ethnic group, marital status, education level, and number of children. The occupational factors were duration of teaching experience, number of student taught per day, type of students taught, presence of peer support when needed, and presence of supervisor support when needed.</p>
<p>Respondents were in advance advised not to brush their teeth, eat or drink 1 hour before saliva collection. This was to minimize possible debris contamination or stimulation of saliva. They were also requested to rinse their mouths at least 10 minutes before saliva collection. Respondents with oral lesions or dental bleeding disorders were excluded from saliva collection. Respondents were also asked to record whether they had suffered from URTI on the day the saliva was collected or in the past week.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1010539510393725">21</xref></sup></p>
<p>A written protocol on how to collect the saliva was printed and given to the respondents in advance. Furthermore, they were briefed and supervised on the collection method on the day of collection. All collections were done at 3 <sc>pm</sc> in the afternoon. Each respondent was requested to passively drool (unstimulated) saliva into a 15-mL conical test tube for 5 minutes. The volume of the saliva collected was measured and divided by 5 minutes to obtain salivary flow rate, expressed in mL/min. After collection, the test tubes were kept in an icebox and immediately transported to the laboratory, where they were stored at −70°C until analysis.</p>
<p>Salivary IgA(µg/mL) and cortisol concentrations (nmol/mL) were determined using the Salimetrics HS-IgA kit and HS-Cort kit, respectively. Salivary IgA secretion rate (µg/mL) in the saliva was computed by multiplying the salivary IgA concentration with salivary flow rate. Salivary cortisol concentrations were reported as such as it is not affected by the salivary flow rate. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay method was used to determine the salivary IgA concentration (µg/mL) and salivary cortisol concentration (nmol/mL).</p>
<p>The study was reviewed and approved by the ethics committee of the authors’ medical institution. Prior written approval was obtained from the Ministry of Education and the Kuala Lumpur Federal Territory Education Department. Study subjects were assured participation on a voluntary basis and that confidentiality would be maintained. Written informed consent was obtained from all respondents.</p>
<p>Data entry and analysis was done using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 15. Mean ± standard deviation (mean ± SD) was used in the descriptive statistic, whereas median with interquartile range (median ± IQR) was used for skewed data. χ<sup>2</sup> test was used for categorical data. A natural logarithm (log) transformation of the mean cortisol and IgA levels was done because of skewed data. The analysis of variance for logarithm transformation of cortisol and lgA levels was done on sociodemographic characteristics. Logistic regression analysis was performed on the IgA levels and sociodemographic factors against the job strain. The level of significance was set at .05.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>From a total of 471 teachers in the 7 schools earlier identified through cluster sampling, 302 (64.1%) volunteered to participate in the study. Those who did not participate included nonrespondents and those who were on medical leave and/or course/seminar/conference leave.</p>
<p>The prevalence of stress among all teachers was 20.2% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 15.9, 25.2). The mean age of the respondents in both job strain categories was 35 years. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1010539510393725">Table 1</xref> shows the prevalence of stress among the teachers according to job strain categories. The comparison of sociodemographic factors between teachers with high strain and non–high strain shows higher prevalence of high strain among Malay, those with teaching experience of 5 to 10 years, and those without a supervisor’s support. Other sociodemographic factors showed no difference between the 2 groups (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1010539510393725">Table 2</xref>).</p>

<p>The mean ± SD of salivary cortisol and IgA levels in all subjects were 2.84 ± 1.57 nmol/mL and 181.34 ± 154.09 µg/mL, respectively. The log transformation results of salivary cortisol and IgA levels were 0.83 (0.53) nmol/mL and 4.98 (1.00) µg/mL, respectively. The teachers aged between 31 and 40 years had lower log salivary IgA levels than other age group. Single, divorced, and widowed subjects were found to have higher log salivary IgA levels than married subjects. Those with teaching duration of more than 240 months were found to be associated with higher log salivary IgA levels. Besides, the teachers who taught handicapped children had lower log salivary IgA levels than the others. The absence of supervisor support was associated with lower log salivary IgA levels among the teachers. All the above associations were statistically significant.

<p>An analysis was done to look at the association between the Karasek job strain categories and the salivary cortisol and salivary IgA levels. This analysis showed no statistical significance. Multiple logistic regressions only showed significant association between the high job strain and Malay ethnicity (odds ratio [OR] = 3.12; 95% CI = 1.10, 8.86) and presence of supervisor’s support (OR = 0.30; 95%CI = 0.13, 0.70; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1010539510393725">Table 4</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>A prevalence of 20.2% job strain (high strain) was reported by the teachers in this study. Similarly, 23.4% teachers in England self-reported teaching as an extremely stressful or very stressful job.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1010539510393725">22</xref></sup> Twenty-six percent Taiwanese teachers reported teaching to be “very very” or extremely stressful whereas secondary school teachers in China reported a prevalence of 42% extreme job stress.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1010539510393725">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1010539510393725">24</xref></sup> This wide range of difference in proportion of job stress can be attributed to the varied systems of education in each country, the differing circumstances of teachers and norms, values, and attitudes that could be unique for these schools and teachers.</p>
<p>The Malay teachers exhibited high job stress compared with non-Malays (Chinese, Indians, and others). This may be because of their inherited personal characteristics, cultural norms, and being the largest group educated in the national language (Bahasa Malaysia), having to suddenly shift teaching in English for mathematics and science subjects.</p>
<p>The teachers with a teaching experience of 5 to 10 years experienced high job strain compared with those with less than 5 years and more than 10 years experience. Those in the 5- to 10-year teaching experience bracket may be required to handle extra leadership roles such as administrative duties, disciplinary teachers, and as heads of departments contributing to their higher stress levels.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1010539510393725">25</xref></sup></p>
<p>Supervisor support when needed does have a bearing on the stress levels of teachers as shown in this study. This is relevant to the Malaysian context and has been shown by studies among teachers in China where supervisor support does alleviate job stress.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1010539510393725">26</xref></sup></p>
<p>As the data of the biomarkers showed positive skewness, natural logarithmic transformations were performed for all data. The chronic stress status of subjects who were 30 to 40 years old, were married, were teaching handicapped children, and those without supervisor support was reflected in their having lower salivary IgA levels. Several other studies have shown that salivary IgA was inversely correlated with self-perceived work-related stress.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1010539510393725">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1010539510393725">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1010539510393725">27</xref></sup> This study has a female dominated profession with findings similar to studies on nurses (female) with work stress and salivary IgA. Home–work conflict was still very important in the generation of work-related stress.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1010539510393725">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1010539510393725">22</xref></sup> Similarly, it appears acceptable that teaching handicapped students contributes to work stress and the presence of supervisor support alleviates stress.</p>
<p>There was no difference reported in the mean log salivary cortisol level among the teachers of different sociodemographic characteristics This may be because of the discrepancy of theories that exists concerning the salivary cortisol secretion, namely, the diurnal rhythm (low levels in sleep, peaking just after awakening and declining for the rest of the day) exhibited by salivary cortisol, the timing of the collection of saliva being only a single sample taken at 3 <sc>pm</sc>, and the very short period of &lt;1 hour.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1010539510393725">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1010539510393725">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1010539510393725">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1010539510393725">29</xref></sup> Furthermore, the elevation of cortisol to chronic work stress has differing results. One study has reported high cortisol levels with chronic stress whereas others have reported a flattening cortisol curve because of the negative feedback response on the hypothalamic–pituitary axis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1010539510393725">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1010539510393725">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>This study showed no association between the job strain categories based on the Karasek Job Strain Model and the log salivary cortisol or salivary IgA levels. Multiple logistic regression analysis showed a significant association between high job strain and Malay ethnicity as well as the presence of supervisor support. A study done among Arab and Jewish teachers showed that Jewish teachers were more vulnerable to environmental expectations unlike Arab teachers, who were highly vulnerable to work conditions, their professional image, and a higher status accorded to them.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1010539510393725">30</xref></sup> A study in China has shown that among the different types of support, leader or supervisor support plays a prominent role in alleviating stress or burnout among teachers.</p>
<p>The limitations of this study include the small sample size, the representation limited to teachers in urban schools in this city and the inability to describe a cause–effect relationship because of the cross-sectional nature of the study design. This study is limited by a single time sample of salivary biomarkers though salivary cortisol secretion provides a diurnal variation that could not be deliberated in this study.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>This study adds evidence to earlier studies that teachers are stressed with a prevalence of 20.2%. The sociodemographic characteristics of being a Malay, having a teaching experience of 5 to 10 years, and absence of a supervisor’s support had higher prevalence of high job strain. Thus stress management techniques should be introduced to this group of teachers. Teachers in the 31- to 40-year age bracket, those educating handicapped children, and those without supervisor support exhibited higher stress levels with lower log salivary IgA levels. In addition, teachers in this active age group are expected to be confounded with other types of stressors outside the school environment. Supervisor support and social support encompassing easy access to stress management programmes should be instituted in these schools. It is strongly recommended that a larger sample size with several salivary cortisol samples in a day be taken in future studies to study the in-depth relationship of job stress and diurnal variation of salivary cortisol levels. Salivary biomarker studies must be extended to other work groups to strengthen findings associating job stress and salivary biomarkers especially in Malaysia where very little has been explored in this area.</p>
