<p>Although crude oil and natural gas have been produced from the same fields, they have different reservoir conditions in fact. Nowadays, there are a number gas fields which are not associated with crude oil. In addition, the fuels used in conventional internal combustion engine are regarded as alternative fuel for IC engine researchers, except for gasoline and diesel fuel. Natural gas used as alternative fuel has been extensively investigated in the past decades.</p>
<p>Usually, there are three different octane numbers associated with all fuels, i.e. Research Octane Number (RON), Motor Octane Number, and Anti-Knock Index. Author can either choose one or all these values to describe fuel octane rating based on paper content. Hydrogen is used as additive in this article, and its aim is not investigated, the combustion of net hydrogen. In my viewpoint, the RON value does not disturb reader’s understanding of this article. Moreover, the most common type of octane rating is the RON.</p>
