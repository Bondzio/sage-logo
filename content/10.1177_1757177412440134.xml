<body>
<p>A policy on Never Events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1757177412440134">National Reporting and Learning Service/National Patient Safety Agency, 2010</xref>) was introduced in the NHS in England from April 2009, following its proposal in High Quality Care for All (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1757177412440134">Department of Health, 2008a</xref>). Never Events are serious, largely preventable, patient safety incidents that should not occur if the available preventative measures have been implemented by healthcare providers, such as wrong site surgery, retained instrument post-operation, escape from within the secure perimeter of medium or high security mental health services by patients who are transferred prisoners.</p>
<p>The Health and Social Care Act (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1757177412440134">Department of Health, 2008b</xref>) states that “Effective prevention and control of infection must be part of everyday practice and be applied consistently by everyone”. The opposite of a Never Event is an Always Event. The <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1757177412440134">Picker Institute (2011)</xref> developed four principles when introducing an Always Event Standard. The standard should be (SEAM):</p>
<list id="list1-1757177412440134" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p><underline>S</underline>ignificant to the patient;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><underline>E</underline>vidence-based practice;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><underline>A</underline>ffordable;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><underline>M</underline>easurable.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Whilst the general public are aware of the need for hand hygiene and clean environment the author believes that it is time to lay down a simple standard of IPC Always Events that our patients/ clients should be aware of and should always expect to happen to ensure that both they and our staff are safe and protected from infection. The Always Events for infection prevention and control (IPC) should be simple, achievable, patient safety preventative measures which should be implemented by all healthcare providers.</p>
<p>The list of IPC Always Events which meet the SEAM criteria could be as follows:</p>
<p><italic>It is expected that</italic>:</p>
<list id="list2-1757177412440134" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>All staff will follow the WHO 5 Moments for Hand hygiene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1757177412440134">World Health Organization, 2009</xref>).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>All patients with a known or suspected infection are cared for appropriately and that they are made aware of their condition and the precautions required.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>All staff will have access to personal protective equipment which they will wear appropriately.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>All staff will handle and dispose of needles and sharps safely.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>All staff will decontaminate the environment/equipment appropriately and effectively between patients.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>All staff will handle and dispose of waste correctly.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>The author proposes that the introduction of an Always Event for IPC would improve patient/client awareness and empowerment, communication and standard setting and therefore, ultimately, safety.</p>
