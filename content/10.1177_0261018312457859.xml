<abstract>
<p>Voluntary sector advice agencies have performed an important function in providing free, accessible advice in the UK for many decades. As legal aid is slashed, and ‘austerity’ leaves everyday life for many ever more precarious, their role has never been more essential. Advice agencies provide a dynamic and increasingly significant transition point where the rights, responsibilities and grievances of the individual are brought into dialogue with formal legal structures. Drawing on ideas from the ‘sociology of translation’, this paper sets out to consider the multiple, complex roles these organizations play. They are involved not simply in the delivery of advice to individuals, but in a collective concern that translates <italic>personal</italic> grievances into matters-of-<italic>public</italic>-concern. The paper concludes by considering the implications for an emerging research agenda that considers advice organizations as legal actors in a fragmenting world.</p>

<p>Poetry is what is gained in translation. (Joseph Brodsky, quoted in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0261018312457859">Clare, 2012</xref>)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Legal services to the poorest citizens in the UK are severely threatened. As cuts in the legal aid budget bite ever deeper, and the Legal Aid and Sentencing of Offenders Bill becomes an Act (relatively intact as the Commons restores it from the Lords’ attack of the highest ever number of amendments to a Bill) it is advice organizations who are becoming key actors in legal arenas. This trend, however, is nothing new: in Genn’s seminal study <italic>Paths to Justice</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0261018312457859">1999</xref>) the majority of participants faced with events concerning legal issues sought help from advice agencies rather than lawyers. Advice bureaux have played an important role in the UK for many decades, however there has been little attempt to understand or to theorize the complex role played by such organizations. Given ever deepening inequalities, it becomes even more critical to understand how such organizations can mediate and make possible interventions into those spaces of everyday life that have become infused with law, such as workplace relations, consumer relations and caring relations. This paper opens a dialogue in order to fill that gap.</p>
<p>The argument here is that advice agencies provide a dynamic and increasingly significant transition point where the rights, responsibilities and grievances of the individual are brought into dialogue with formal legal structures. They perform multiple, complex roles. Through their casework they can open doors to enable citizens to pursue their own rights and responsibilities, translating complex legal structures so that citizens can work within them. This casework then allows agencies to see through into the lives of ‘ordinary people’, and forms the basis for their interventions in social policy. Through re-presenting the personal grievances of multiple clients as matters-of-<italic>public</italic>-concern, they can show to legislators and policy-makers the ways in which the policies and practices of powerful institutions create injustices for citizens; and make visible the ways in which mechanisms meant to enable access to justice frequently fail.</p>
<p>I have called these ‘acts of translation’, drawing on the work of Callon, Latour, Law and others who have developed a ‘sociology of translation’ as a mechanism for understanding the role of science and scientists in society (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0261018312457859">Callon, 1986a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0261018312457859">Law, 1997</xref>). They use the idea of translation not simply in a linguistic sense, but to refer to the processes and practices of bringing together two or more things into a relation with each other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0261018312457859">Law, 1999</xref>). These processes bring into being new sets of relationships, an actor-network which changes the characteristics of the objects – things or people – that are part of that actor-network. Translation is not merely a technical process; it is a political process in which the translators actively choose between alternatives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0261018312457859">Freeman, 2009</xref>: 435); it is a process of transformation and change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0261018312457859">Law, 1997</xref>); and it is a collaborative process, one of ‘mutual definition and inscription’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0261018312457859">Callon, 1991</xref>: 143). Translation places the translator in a pivotal role, for ‘to translate is to speak for, to be indispensable, and to displace’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0261018312457859">Callon, 1986b</xref>: 28).</p>
<p>To demonstrate translation in action, this paper presents a case study of a specific issue – the exclusion of households from social housing waiting lists – which was translated into a matter-of-public-concern by the actions of a housing advice centre. To begin I consider the characteristics of advice agencies, their complex identity enabling them to use creatively the public/private divide. This is a function that law and legal institutions find difficult, as is discussed in the following section. I then present the case study, describing the multiple acts of translation performed by advice agencies, and then the researchers’ translations in taking up the issues raised through the advice centres. This leads into an examination of the ways in which an understanding of the role of advice agencies as <italic>acts of translation</italic>, as creative, potentially poetic acts, can help us think about the identities of the agencies, their clients and the relationships created. In concluding I suggest some possible directions for research opened up by this perspective.</p>

<p>The enormous diversity of functions and modes of organization in the voluntary sector is often claimed as its strength. With fewer statutory constraints than the public sector, and lacking the concern for shareholders’ profits, voluntary organizations appear to be able to respond quickly to a wide range of needs. Milligan and Conradson suggest that we can think of the voluntary sector as
<disp-quote>
<p>organisations that are formal, non-profit distributing, constitutionally independent of the state and self-governing. While such organisations may employ paid staff and receive funding from the state their remit is to act for public rather than shareholder benefit … One further defining feature is their engagement with volunteers, whether in their day-to-day operation, on their management boards, or in both contexts. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0261018312457859">2011</xref>: 3)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>So whilst defining the voluntary advice sector with clear precision is probably fruitless (and in any case, is partly an empirical question), Milligan and Conradson’s broad definition helps frame its modes of organization. As the statements from the websites of three of the UK’s major advice-giving organizations demonstrate, one common principle is the <italic>free</italic> provision of advice; and Citizens Advice and Shelter also state up front the principle that advice should be <italic>independent</italic>. The principle of independence runs through the whole not-for-profit sector and has, until recently at least, generally been interpreted as independence from the state. However, as I have discussed in relation to housing associations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0261018312457859">McDermont, 2010</xref>), perhaps third sector organizations should begin to worry more about independence from private funders.</p>
<p>Despite the ‘voluntary’ label, advice organizations have for a long time relied heavily on state funding. But state funding brings a dilemma: it can allow for expansion of services, but at the loss of independence from the funder (see e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0261018312457859">Brown, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0261018312457859">Milligan, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0261018312457859">Milligan and Fyfe, 2005</xref>). In the past the principal source of funding has been grants from local councils. However, over the past decade or so, franchise arrangements for the provision of advice services through the Legal Services Commission have been seen as a way of removing agencies from the ‘annual round of the begging bowl’ of local authority funding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0261018312457859">Francis, 2000</xref>: 67). Contracting, nevertheless, raises new difficulties as funding contracts themselves can act as catalysts for translating organizations. They may be seen as facilitating positive change, for instance by enabling advice agencies to employ specialist staff, train volunteer workers to carry out more in-depth work and perform representation of clients at tribunals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0261018312457859">Francis, 2000</xref>: 65). However, contracts are also seen as threatening fundamental aims and principles: interviews with Citizens Advice Bureau (CAB) advice workers showed concerns that the franchise contracts were perceived as endangering principles of promoting self-help and ‘free advice at the point of delivery’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0261018312457859">Francis, 2000</xref>: 69–70). Additionally, managerialist demands of funding contracts, which make the well-managed organization a priority, shape daily practices through involving workers in lengthy, time-consuming form-filling. Such managerialism produces tensions: volunteers do not necessarily see their involvement with a bureau as ‘going to work’ and may resent attempts to bring them into line with business-derived assumptions of good management (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0261018312457859">Clarke, 2010</xref>: 6).</p>
<p>So the very idea of ‘advice agency’ is fluid and changing as funding contracts attempt to translate ‘voluntary’ organizations into service providers with professionalized internal structures and service delivery (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0261018312457859">Milligan and Fyfe, 2005</xref>). No doubt the recent emergence of private sector companies as advice providers will increase these tensions, as voluntary organizations, in their fight for survival, compete with private providers for diminishing resources.</p>
<p>I have asserted that advice agencies operate in legalized spaces. This does not mean that advisers are lawyers; indeed for the most part they are not. For some organizations the use of voluntary advisers is a central element of their ‘voluntarism’. Citizens Advice, one of the most long-standing organizations in the UK, relies largely on volunteers as front-line advisers, who undergo an extensive training programme and then period of observation before they take on casework. They are supported by a staff of paid caseworkers and managers, but these also are generally not legally trained. In Shelter Housing Aid Centres<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0261018312457859">1</xref></sup>, advisers are paid workers, may be legally trained, but not necessarily. Some advice agencies set up arrangements to access legal advisers through a range of pro bono schemes, but this varies across agencies and according to geography, and in any case access is generally by referral rather than at the initial point of contact. Research by Citizens Advice has indicated that bureaux experienced problems with solicitors providing pro bono services, in the main because solicitors are trained as specialists and so find it difficult to respond to bureaux clients’ needs for generalist advice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0261018312457859">Citizens Advice Bureau, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>In any case, the argument in this paper is that advice agencies are not just calling law into action as lawyers do; their role is not to be ‘the poor man’s lawyer’ as Citizens Advice described their service in the 1940s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0261018312457859">2009</xref>: 20). Indeed, the implication in this label, that advice agencies offer a second-rate service, is not borne out by research. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0261018312457859">Moorhead et al. (2003)</xref>, in a comparison of the performance (in legal aid contracts) of solicitors’ firms and not-for-profit agencies staffed by non-lawyers, concluded that advice services provided by non-lawyers are certainly not inferior to those provided by lawyers and may not be cheaper. Their findings, they said, allowed them to ‘confident[ly] assert […] that taken as a group, non-lawyers perform to higher standards than lawyers’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0261018312457859">2003</xref>: 795).</p>
<p>The important point, however, is not simply that advice agencies can provide as good a casework service as lawyers, but that they perform a different, more complex role. The potential of advice agencies lies in the ways that they can mediate the divide between the personal lives of clients and the public domain. The personal/private and the public are often posed as opposite poles with a barrier between them. This is particularly so in law where we talk of the public/private divide. For advice agencies in their role as translators in the double sense the public/private is not such a dichotomy. For them the ‘divide’ can have the possibility of becoming a creative device, to bring alive and into the public domain the impact of decisions on personal lives made by public, private and hybrid bodies. This is a role that law and legal institutions find difficult to perform, as is explored in the next section.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0261018312457859">
<title>The constraints of ‘public’ in legal discourse</title>
<p>In the case study that follows it is the complex nature of the voluntary advice agency that enables it to translate individual, essentially private grievances into matters-of-public-concern. Law itself has problems with this. Law has a way of privatizing and individualizing issues, resisting claims to the publicness of public law and making individuals disappear as their personal grievance becomes a legal case. Take, for example, the sphere of employment relations. Trade unionists have for long sought to resist law’s propensity to colonize, seeing the resolution of employment disputes as a matter of collective concern to be resolved through collective bargaining with employers (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0261018312457859">Hawes, 2000</xref>). That environment has changed: trade union membership has dramatically declined, and many employment disputes now end up as individual claims in Employment Tribunals, to be fought out (mostly) by lawyers for the aggrieved employee and employer. Trade unions can become more like advice agencies, focussing resources on supporting members’ individual claims (and indeed, only able to support those who have a clear chance of winning). And whilst trade unions still have the possibility of translating individual grievances into public concerns, for many of the most vulnerable workers in workplaces without unions, this is not one that can be actualized. Here advice organizations have stepped into the vacuum, for example with a campaign for government action to deal with rogue employers who refuse to pay up Employment Tribunal awards (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0261018312457859">Citizens Advice, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>The body of law called ‘public law’ may appear to contain the possibility of raising claims on behalf of publics, but these are often thwarted by law’s difficulties with the meaning of ‘public’. In order to engage public law and so argue for its standards of openness, reasonableness, proportionality and the principles of human rights, the claim must be taken against a body that law considers to <italic>be public</italic>, or to be carrying out <italic>public functions</italic>. A particularly sterile debate has developed about whether certain bodies – housing associations, for example – are, or are not, public bodies or performing public functions. Many would consider it common sense that housing associations would be public bodies, given that, in many localities they have taken over the functions and the properties of local authorities to provide housing for those in need. However, rather than discussing principles, for law this boils down to a <italic>list</italic> of attributes that describe the nature of the body: the extent to which it is publicly funded, or can be directed in its operations by another obvious public body, amongst others. Even when it appears that common sense has prevailed, such victories are contingent and temporary: the Court of Appeal decided, in a case concerning London &amp; Quadrant Housing Trust (<italic>R (Weaver) v L&amp;QHT</italic> [2010] WLR 363), that the housing management functions of housing associations are indeed public; but there nevertheless remains doubt about the extent of the court’s interpretation and indeed the outcome (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0261018312457859">Cowan, 2011</xref>: 130–139). In any case, from April 2010, housing associations and trusts, previously termed ‘registered social landlords’ (RSLs) by the Housing Act 1996, have been renamed once again, now known as <italic>private</italic> registered providers of housing (Housing and Regeneration Act 2008 (Consequential Provisions) Order 2010, SI 2010 No. 866).</p>
<p>So, using legal arenas to translate individual grievances into public concerns is limited by narrow understandings of what is ‘public’; and law has other limitations. The dry debates which take place within the allegedly ‘neutral’ legal arena can make the identities of those bringing claims disappear. Take, for example, the case of an 83-year-old woman with Alzheimer’s disease who had been threatened with eviction from the care home where she had been placed by Birmingham City Council, which got all the way to the House of Lords in 2007 (<italic>YL v Birmingham City Council</italic> [2008] AC 95). The judgments in the House of Lords made little reference to this person-centred aspect of the case. In true legal style, the ‘legalfacts’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0261018312457859">Silbey, 2005</xref>) re-construct the case as being a dispute about contracts and institutional relations between the local authority who had placed YL in the care home and the business that owned the home. YL’s need for a <italic>caring</italic> home disappeared. The House of Lords concluded that the care home was not performing any public functions; the dispute was one of private law.</p>
<p>What these examples demonstrate is the way that law and legal institutions, on the one hand, try to turn issues into private matters; but on the other they evince a neutral arbitrator stance whilst in reality making decisions that support the interests of private property. Nevertheless, not all those who are trained to operate within the legal arena as lawyers see law as the neutral arbitrator. There are some, identified in the academic literature as ‘cause lawyers’ (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0261018312457859">Scheingold, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0261018312457859">Sarat and Scheingold, 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0261018312457859">2001a</xref>), who attempt to ‘deploy their legal skills to challenge prevailing distributions of political, social, economic and/or legal values and resources’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0261018312457859">Sarat and Scheingold, 2001b</xref>: 13). They publicly identify with the values and goals of those they represent, making choices about whom they represent in order to pursue their own ideological agendas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0261018312457859">Sarat, 1998</xref>). Research into cause lawyering primarily focuses on US lawyers, where the legal system allows only those with legal qualifications to advise on legal matters. In the UK, the community law centres network is much diminished, and cause lawyers (in the commercial sector) are said to be less prevalent, less ‘transgressive’, and more likely to adhere to the norm of lawyer neutrality. They keep their professional activities within the bounds of their role and seek other outlets for their political commitments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0261018312457859">Boon, 2001</xref>), such as the Legal Action Group (set up in 1971 to promote equal access to justice for those socially, economically or otherwise disadvantaged and unable to access legal services).</p>
<p>The cause lawyering literature warns of further limitations of legal arenas. Attempts to mobilize rights through litigation, Scheingold suggests, will be
<disp-quote>
<p>more useful in fomenting change when used as an agent of political mobilization than when it is employed in the more conventional manner – that is, for asserting and realizing rights. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0261018312457859">1974</xref>: 9)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the cause lawyering literature may be of some assistance in understanding the role of advice agencies for, as the case study below shows, these too are organizations that can be vehicles for creating ‘causes’. In this case study of a housing advice centre, the advisers did not see court action as a route for addressing the issues. Instead their role was to assemble the personal concerns of their clients then, through <italic>mediating</italic> these concerns, to re-present such personal and private matters into matters-of-public-concern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0261018312457859">Latour and Weibel, 2005</xref>). Where law closes down possibilities of making things public, the complex, hybrid nature of advice agencies provides them with the potential to summon up new publics, enabling them to perform multiple ‘acts of translation’. Rather than seeing public as a narrow, list-defined category rarely achieved, the intervention of actors such as advice agencies in the legal field brings to the foreground the inherently political nature of the constitution of publicness, a quality that, as Newman and Clarke suggest, is
<disp-quote>
<p>historically and socially variable – the combinations of things, sites, people, ideas and the rest are not permanently or intrinsically public: their constitution as public involves political struggles to make them so. They may also be de-publicised, and de-politicised (taken out of recognisable public concern). (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0261018312457859">2009</xref>: 2)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>

<sec id="section4-0261018312457859">
<title>Acts of translation</title>
<p>As will be shown through the case study, there are multiple sites and acts of translation in this story; indeed, it is the complexity of translation that is an important element in revealing the crucial nature of the advice agency roles.</p>
<p>The first way in which advice agencies perform acts of translation is, perhaps, fairly obvious: in the daily interaction between adviser and client, the adviser must come to understand the problems and concerns the client brings to the interview room as matters that might have a resolution through action, frequently action that involves law. The adviser then has to translate back to the client the complex, technical issues in such a way that the client him/herself can act upon them. In this, the adviser is acting very much like the lawyer Boyd White describes for us:
<disp-quote>
<p>in her conversations with her client, from the beginning, her task is to help him tell his story, both in his own language and in the languages into which she will translate it. … The client is thus led to learn something of the language of the law; at the same time, the lawyer must learn something of the language of the client. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0261018312457859">1990</xref>: 261)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>This is demonstrated in the findings of research exploring the experiences of applicants to Employment Tribunals (funded by the Society of Legal Scholars and University of Bristol School of Law: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0261018312457859">McDermont and Busby, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0261018312457859">Busby and McDermont, 2012</xref>) for whom the approach to the CAB was often in ignorance of the possibilities for seeking redress offered by the Employment Tribunal (ET) system, let alone its highly legalized and court-like nature. For most it was the CAB that enabled them to become applicants to the tribunal. CAB advisers told them of the existence of the ET and their rights to have their dispute heard by a tribunal, helped them complete the necessary form to lodge a claim with the tribunal and, in varying degrees, were able to provide support to clients engaging with the ET system. The advisers were in effect <italic>translating</italic> the procedures and language of the ET system into formulations that could be understood by clients.</p>
<p>However, for advice agencies this translation need not be the end of their relationship with the problems clients bring to them. For many organizations running advice agencies, advice work is intimately linked to campaigning on social policy issues. Shelter, which runs a nation-wide network of housing advice centres, was set up in 1966 to campaign on issues of poor housing and homelessness. Initially it funded housing associations to buy properties to directly meet housing needs; however, from 1974 an increase in central government support for housing associations meant that it was able to put significant resources into its advice centres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0261018312457859">McDermont, 2010</xref>: chapter 7).</p>
<p>For Citizens Advice the interaction between advice and campaigning happened the other way round. Citizens’ advice bureaux were first established in 1939, when 200 bureaux were set up throughout the UK to meet the anticipated needs of the civilian population that arose out of the chaos and crisis of war (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0261018312457859">Citizens Advice, 2009</xref>). However, from outset its objectives were wider than just advice giving and included
<disp-quote>

The story of translation becomes more interesting when we consider the interaction between casework and policy work in the re-presentation of clients’ stories as objects for <italic>public</italic> concern; clients are no longer understood as isolated individuals with grievances, but (potentially) emerge as new publics with shared concerns.</p>
<sec id="section5-0261018312457859">
<title>Making things public – Re-presenting issues</title>
<p>Publics emerge around objects of concern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0261018312457859">Dewey, 1927</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0261018312457859">Latour, 2005</xref>). These objects of concern do not simply appear; they also must go through a process of formation. Advice agencies are at a particularly pivotal point that enables them to be instrumental in processes of object formation. To illustrate my argument I turn now to the story of the North East Housing Aid Centre (NEHAC) and their campaign against what they considered to be the illegal exclusion of applicants from social rented housing.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0261018312457859">2</xref></sup> In this story a number of actors become involved in the process of this particular object formation, as NEHAC explain in their report:
<disp-quote>
<p>Following the introduction of the Homelessness Act 2002, advisers at Shelter’s North East Housing Aid Centre became increasingly alarmed by the numbers of people who were being excluded from local authority waiting lists in spite of the new legislation. To address this problem we ran the Fobbed Off campaign. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0261018312457859">Shelter, 2006</xref>: 5)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>It was the advice centre’s casework that initially identified that exclusions from social housing might be an object of general concern. They found that most people arriving at the housing aid centre complaining that a social landlord was refusing to house them had no idea that they could appeal the decision. When cases were appealed over a quarter of decisions were overturned, and it seemed that in every case where an advice centre intervened they won the appeal. It was the volume of casework, as well as the identification of seemingly incorrect decision-making by housing officers, that raised exclusions as an object of/for concern. For the advice workers their daily contact with people and their everyday problems provided legitimacy to begin the process of <italic>re-presenting</italic> clients’ claims in the public domain. The first element in representation is a process of gathering those who have an interest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0261018312457859">Latour, 2005</xref>: 6). NEHAC ran a public awareness campaign under the banner of ‘Fobbed Off’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0261018312457859">Figure 1</xref>), which aimed to get housing applicants to <italic>seek advice</italic>, so forming a particular <italic>public</italic> based around this particular concern.</p>

</fig>
<p>However, ‘Fobbed Off’ had limited success:
<disp-quote>
<p>Although the campaign had some success in raising awareness, caseworkers were continuing to deal with cases where housing providers were (in our opinion) applying the test [for exclusion in the Homelessness Act 2002] incorrectly. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0261018312457859">Shelter, 2006</xref>: 6)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>So NEHAC launched the Exclusion Campaign, which began by gathering evidence from a broader base, those advisers throughout the north-east region who dealt with similar clients. To collect evidence they sent a questionnaire to advice agencies and other organizations in the region, asking them to record cases, for a specified period, of people excluded from waiting lists. So the second stage in this process of turning casework into a matter-of-public-concern involved gathering more allies, in the form of other agencies and <italic>facts</italic>.</p>
<p>The third stage was the <italic>re</italic>-presentation of this evidence in a report, <italic>Exclusions in Tyne and Wear: An Investigation by Shelter’s NEHAC into Why Applicants Are Excluded from Social Rented Housing</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0261018312457859">Shelter, 2006</xref>) at a public launch event. What made the claims in this report so powerful was the mixing of the personal and the statistics, reporting both the findings from the survey and individual stories of personal distress caused by the application of wrong decision-making, such as Jill’s story (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0261018312457859">Figure 2</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>In addition to stories and statistics, the advisers drew upon symbolic forms of representation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0261018312457859">Bourdieu, 1989</xref>). The Foreword to the report by the Bishop of Newcastle provided symbolic legitimacy, just as our cultural elevation of large numbers as providing ‘truth’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0261018312457859">Hacking, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0261018312457859">Power, 1997</xref>) supported their claims for the legitimacy of statistical evidence.</p>
<p>Although I have drawn upon a recent example to demonstrate this process of <italic>making things public</italic>, this is not a new role for advice agencies. I used this example because the agency itself explained so clearly how they went about the processes of assembly, translation and representation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0261018312457859">Newman and Clarke, 2009</xref>). Numerous other examples from Shelter, Citizens Advice and others could have been called up. Through this particular example I have been able to explore the complexity of the role advice agencies play in mediating the interface between the public, private and personal domains. Their work on the ‘front-line’, their daily interactions with people aggrieved by administrative <italic>in</italic>-justices, provide legitimacy to their claims to be re-presenting and so making <italic>public</italic> issues of concern. They make choices about which ‘matters-of-fact’ (casework and research) should be translated into ‘matters-of-concern’ (their social policy campaigns). Through these choices they can determine which matters may, or may not, come into the public domain as matters-of-public-concern.</p>
<p>It is not the aim of this article to consider the success or otherwise of these campaigns, or the conditions that might lead to success – these questions would be a subject for further research (on which see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0261018312457859">Coglianese, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0261018312457859">Langridge, 2011</xref>). In the case of NEHAC’s campaign against social housing exclusion practices, little changed in social policy and practice. However, by 2007 the advice workers had enrolled new allies, the researchers (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0261018312457859">Callon, 1986a</xref>).</p>

<title>Researchers as translators</title>
<p>My colleagues and I became involved in this story in the course of conducting research about the role of tenants on the boards of housing associations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0261018312457859">McDermont et al., 2009</xref>). The issue arose during an interview with an officer from the Local Government Association (LGA, a voluntary membership organization lobbying for the local government sector), who was far less worried about the problematic of tenants on the governing bodies of housing associations than about concerns raised by local authorities that households they nominated to housing association tenancies were increasingly being excluded. The particularly big issue arose around those households accepted as statutorily homeless by the local authority, for in these cases an association’s refusal to re-house the tenants into one of their properties meant that the council continued to foot the bill for expensive temporary accommodation such as bed and breakfast. Problems for local authorities had increased because many had transferred their own housing stock to associations, and so had no alternative but to rely on relations with housing associations. This left the LGA as allies with Shelter in seeking to force the issue of exclusions into the public arena. So when my colleagues and I conducted a research project about ‘problematic nominations’ in 2007 both the LGA and Shelter were our partners. The focus of this second project was the relationship between local authorities and housing associations that arose out of nomination agreements, which were arrangements that enabled the local authority to nominate households to a housing association tenancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0261018312457859">Cowan et al., 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0261018312457859">2009</xref>). Our relations with Shelter’s head office led to an interview with the advice workers at NEHAC.</p>
<p>As researchers we now became involved in the acts of translation and re-presentation and just like Shelter and the LGA, we came to this research with a ‘history’. In a previous life, prior to becoming an academic researcher, I had worked in local government where one of my roles had been to monitor these nomination arrangements with housing associations working in the district. So from experience and my subsequent research, I knew both that nomination arrangements were a critical object around which the local authority/housing association relationship was structured (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0261018312457859">McDermont, 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0261018312457859">2010</xref>: chapter 4) and that they frequently proved to be ‘problematic’. We also knew that there was a role for law in this arena. There were public law requirements that housing associations should co-operate with local authorities as far ‘as is reasonable in the circumstances in offering accommodation to people with priority on the authority’s housing register’ (Housing Act 1996 s 107). Furthermore, in law the nomination agreements would be considered as contracts (though empirical evidence showed a marked resistance by some local government and housing association officers to recognize them as such (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0261018312457859">Cowan and Morgan, 2009</xref>)).</p>
<p>Our research identified ‘problematic practices’ that could give rise to problematic exclusions – at least from the point of view of the local authority, the prospective tenants and the housing advice workers. We saw that housing associations often translated the issue of exclusions into a business plan issue, with claims that they were protecting investments in their stock which could be damaged by ‘problematic’ tenants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0261018312457859">Cowan et al., 2009</xref>). Our interviews with advice workers pointed us to the ‘Fobbed Off’ campaign, but also revealed these workers drawing on a range of strategies to deal with individual cases of households excluded on what they considered invalid grounds. For them, courts or tribunals rarely had purchase, nor did appeals to the sector’s regulator, the Housing Corporation, who (so the advice workers understood) would only intervene if there was persistent evidence of bad practice. One effective strategy was discovered by an adviser dealing with a case that concerned the local office of a large, national housing association:
<disp-quote>
<p>it was a complicated case … they were trying to evict … she’d been excluded from the council list … which got overturned … There were real issues with her tenancy but a lot of it was fabricated, it was hearsay and they were going for eviction … and I think then they wouldn’t allow her back on the list. … After the appeal, I went through the internal complaints, and it went through the various levels, and it ended up in London in front of the committee and basically we won it. They agreed with us that she’d been treated unfairly, and they were going to do a complete review of their internal policies. But that took quite a long time. (Adviser Interview, 2007)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>This is an interesting twist to the translation narrative, for here the adviser was specifically seeking to resolve an individual complaint; its translation into a social policy issue seems to arise almost by chance.</p>
<p>With the exception of this adviser’s success with one association, the story continued to appear as one of failed translations. Our report also produced no change in the exclusionary practices of social landlords. However, several years later comes a new government with a cocktail of local government issues tied up in the Localism Act 2011; one unintended consequence may indeed resolve the problematic relations between local authorities and housing associations around nominations. The Act only allows local housing authorities to house ‘qualifying persons’ (s.160ZA(6)(a)), but subject only to two qualifications, allows them the freedom to determine the identity of those ‘qualifying persons’. If local authorities follow the guidance that accompanies the Act, their disputes with associations could melt away:
<disp-quote>
<p>3.21 In developing their qualification criteria, housing authorities are strongly encouraged to consult with their tenants and residents, partner Private Registered Providers and relevant statutory agencies and voluntary and community organisations. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0261018312457859">Communities and Local Government, 2012</xref>: 17)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>In effect, the Localism Act enables the practices of housing associations that are themselves framed by the practices of business to become normalized into the relations between local authorities and housing associations, and allows local authorities to rid themselves of all those ‘problematic tenants’ by excluding them from the housing list all together. For housing advice centres and those who are badly housed or homeless it feels like the story has gone back to the 1960s – never has the campaigning role of advice centres been more crucial.</p>

<title>The important insights of translation</title>
<p>How does this exploration of the practices of advice agencies as acts of translation help theorize the role of advice agencies? Is it any more than a neat explanatory device? I would argue that it is not simply illuminating the <italic>what</italic>, but also the <italic>how</italic>: and that this can then lead us to further insights concerning the identity(ies) of the actors in these acts of translation (the <italic>who</italic>), and those particular mappings of truth that are enmeshed in these translations (the <italic>why</italic>; cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0261018312457859">Dean, 1999</xref>: 17). It allows us to consider how the translation from matter-of-individual-concern to matter-of-public-concern brings into play different subject positions of the actors, in particular, the advice agencies and their clients. To develop this line of analysis I first want to call upon a visual image, the Celtic triple spiral, as an explanatory device.</p>

<title>Translation as a ‘triple spiral’</title>
<p>Although the narrative so far presents acts of translation as being fairly linear, with advice agencies translating in two directions (from public policy and practice to personal disputes; from a collection of personal disputes into the field of public concerns), an earlier section has demonstrated the complexity of the field in which agencies are contained. It is better then to understand acts of translation as being <italic>multi</italic>-lateral (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0261018312457859">Star and Griesemer, 1989</xref>). It helps, I believe, to use the Celtic image, the <italic>triple spiral</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0261018312457859">Figure 3</xref>).</p>

<p>The triple spiral is found at Newgrange, Co. Meath, a passage grave constructed around 3000 BC, ‘possibly the earliest personal signature of Irish identity’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0261018312457859">Kee, 1995</xref>: 24). It presents a powerful symbol of the complexity and interconnectedness of life. Following the line in any single spiral leads to the realization that the three spirals are entirely connected; you go from one to the next, to the third and back to the first without leaving the page. This spatial image could well describe the social practices of advice agencies: they listen to those who seek them out for advice and give back a translation of what is possible to address the specific grievance. These personal stories tell other stories of what is, and is not possible, spaces where the legal/illegal boundary is being mis-used or mis-interpreted. So they take these personal stories, identify the collective issues that must be addressed (and, critically, they also make decisions about what <italic>not</italic> to address); they remove these stories from the domain of individual personal experience, re-arrange them, embellish them with more stories, facts and statistics; and then, in the third spiral, re-present them as matters of public concern, translating them (for policy-makers) into issues that should be addressed. The advice agencies become a pivotal point; through their practices they enrol a <italic>public</italic> with collective issues and interests; and through the re-telling of these stories, they enrol policy-makers in the re-shaping of social policy. Their allies in this process must be the policy-makers and decision-makers (in the example above, those who hold the social housing waiting lists and those who think of themselves as policy-makers: government ministers, directors of housing), and <italic>also</italic> those who are excluded from these circles of decision-making. Their allies must be locked into place if the campaign is to succeed (a process <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0261018312457859">Callon (1986)</xref> terms ‘interessement’), so that this translation of the case-notes, the personal stories and the research data becomes both heard and accepted as part of a re-shaped discourse.</p>
<p>The triple spiral portrays this well because it does not present us with two separate spheres (public and private/personal) that the advice agency must jump between, but rather a series of interconnected processes. The divide between individual and collective is shown to be false and unhelpful (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0261018312457859">Callon and Law, 1997</xref>). The advice agency acting as translator knows that ‘what is said in one language cannot simply be set over into another without loss or gain’; that their task is therefore ‘the creation of new compositions that will establish mutually respectful relations between them’ (c.f. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0261018312457859">Boyd White, 1990</xref>: 19–20).</p>
<p>In evoking the Celtic triple spiral, its <italic>spatial</italic> nature shows more than a nod towards a rich vein of critical analysis developed by scholars linking law with geography, understanding ‘law’, ‘space’ and ‘power’ as inextricably linked constructions (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0261018312457859">Blomley, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0261018312457859">Cooper, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0261018312457859">Blomley et al., 2001</xref>). The Celtic spiral provides an image of interactions occurring in legalized spaces that shows the interconnectedness of (micro) ‘everydayness’ with what goes on at the (macro) level of ‘politics’. It suggests that attempts to understand the everyday will be limited if we observe it in such a way as to make the macro level invisible; and equally that studies of policy-makers and legislators will have limited use if the everyday is denied. Like the ‘flat ontology’ of those geographers working to eradicate scale from space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0261018312457859">Marston et al., 2005</xref>; also see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0261018312457859">Collinge, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0261018312457859">Jones et al., 2007</xref>), the imaging through the Celtic spiral does not ignore power relations, or the inequalities that exist within. Rather, it attempts to investigate power relations without presuming a ‘top’ and a ‘bottom’, for the spiral has no top and bottom. So I am suggesting that we develop a level of analysis that acknowledges that different types of actors exist; that
<disp-quote>
<p><italic>[t]here are</italic> of course macro-actors and micro-actors, but the difference between them is brought about by power relations and constructions of networks that will <italic>elude analysis</italic> if we presume <italic>a priori</italic> that macro-actors are bigger than micro-actors. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0261018312457859">Callon and Latour, 1981</xref>: 280, emphasis in original)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Indeed, if we were to view advice agencies as either macro-actors (policy-makers) or micro-actors (providers of front-line services) we would lose the opportunity to see what was indeed ‘going on’. In applying this analysis to advice agencies, I am suggesting that these organizations can in fact exist as both micro- and macro-actors; that they function at the boundaries as translators <italic>between</italic> different actors.</p>
<p>This analysis also has important implications for the ways in which we understand the identities of both the advice agencies and their clients. Suggesting that clients’ personal concerns might become matters-of-public-concern implies that clients can become new publics. Certainly the language of enrolment suggests an identity that is not passive. And if what advice agencies are doing is good translation, then the narrative they present in the public sphere not only must make sense in the language of the public sphere, but it must also remain engaged in the everyday lives of the clients whose stories are being re-presented. When the divide between the everyday lives of those who seek out advice agencies and the everyday lives of politicians focussed on cutting welfare and support becomes a cavernous gulf, the advice agency role as translator becomes ever more difficult. How can one bridge such a cavernous gulf? Returning to the triple spiral image, its attraction is that it eschews hierarchy – in its continuous spiral one element moves into another to another and back to the first in a seamless movement. This is an image of representation not simply as expert to lay person (as a lawyer performs for her client), but as a form of representation that can enfold the ‘client’ and the advice giver in a continuous movement together. It makes a presumption of equality of all those bound up in these acts of translation.</p>
<p>So we are brought back to the subject positions of advice agency and clients, of how to maintain an understanding of the agency and its clients that can see them all as actors, whether it be micro or macro; and a role for advice that is not simply educating clients into the ways of the legal system. Indeed, the importance of this visioning of advice agencies is to see them not only as part of the legal system, but also as part of the <italic>political</italic> system, as an intermediary in democratic structuring.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>My intention in this paper has been to begin to understand and theorize the role of advice agencies in the UK. As legal aid and direct social provision are cut, the increasing use of voluntary sector advice organizations to fill gaps in provision leaves them open to simply becoming a ‘new institutional fix’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0261018312457859">Peck and Tickell, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0261018312457859">Macmillan and Townsend, 2011</xref>). The analysis offered in this paper attempts to take agencies beyond a concept of substitute lawyers. Indeed, translation in the ‘triple spiral’ mode requires their acts also to be acts of resistance, offering back to government the everyday crises created in the lives of those on the receiving end of fiscal measures.</p>
<p>I have argued that to see advice agencies as simply advice <italic>givers</italic> misses the complex nature of these organizations. For organizations such as Shelter and Citizens Advice, whilst the provision of advice and information to individuals is an end in itself, it is also seen as a tool in a wider strategy of promoting social change. Advice organizations therefore have the possibility of being <italic>translators</italic> into multiple domains. First, in the daily interactions between advisor and client, a central part of their task is to translate the many complex procedures and mechanisms by which citizens might achieve justice into a language and format that can be understood by ‘ordinary people’ without specialist knowledge. Second, processes of translation that transform those individual, essentially private grievances, complaints, actions and appeals into matters-of-<italic>public</italic>-concern. I have argued that the strength of advice organizations is that they are able to translate individual casework that is the everyday life of an adviser (and the client), into evidence of the need for change. This translation can happen through the aggregation of cases into statistics, or it can be in the use of individual stories as illustrations of the pain, hardship and abuse that can be caused by particular policies, or lack of policies. In the sense that campaigning advice organizations can translate personal grief into public demands, advice organizations can be seen as translators of issues that often seem to belong to the private sphere into the public sphere. Through these acts of translation advice agencies can resist the narrow understandings of public and private that law attempts to draw; the image of the triple spiral helps demonstrate the interconnectedness of the various roles advice agencies can perform, with campaigning relying on advice giving and effective advice giving relying on the sector’s ability to influence policy-makers and politicians in the public sphere.</p>
<p>The triple spiral image, along with actor network theory, and the geographers’ ‘flat ontology’, are all attempts to move away from the narrowness of theorizations that assume predetermined identities of public <italic>or</italic> private, collective <italic>or</italic> individual, micro-actor <italic>or</italic> macro-actor. They are, however, not attempts to ignore power relations and inequalities, but rather, they set out to examine power relations differently by moving away from such pre-assumed identities. They make us look in different places for relations of power and actions of resistance, and the subject positions these relations and resistances create. This raises many new questions for research.</p>
<p>First, back to the original problem of definition: how do we understand the identity(ies) of advice organizations? Just as the advice agencies are involved in creating new stories for public consumption through the translation of clients’ matters-of-concern, they are also caught up in the stories that are created about them, and that they create about themselves. One line of enquiry would be to investigate the different genealogies of the organizations that form the voluntary advice sector, and the ways in which these differing genealogies might result in different placings for advice agencies. How, for example, does a genealogy with roots in campaigning, social action and resistance differently place an organization, its workers and its clients, from those of an organization that started out with advice giving as its purpose? Or how does the inclusion of ‘citizen’ in the organization’s name place citizens’ advice bureaux in relation to their clients, for it seems like an attempt to set out horizontal understandings of citizenship (citizens as volunteer advisers supporting other citizens to understand and use their rights) that are in apparent opposition to present-day vertical understandings of citizenship (citizens’ rights ensured by state intervention)? Such ‘histories of the present’ could provide new understandings of the advice sector, problematizing the idea of a singular identity as well as the boundaries between public, private and voluntary providers.</p>
<p>Second, what sorts of identities are created for those who seek out advice agencies for help and support? Individual problems and disputes are translated into matters-of-public-concern, so are clients also translated into new publics? Does this mean that the very act of going to an advice agency could be an act of resistance? This must depend on the ways in which the advice agency projects itself into the public arena, its public acts, the discourses created around its existence and its campaigns. Certainly in the NEHAC story above, the housing aid centre proactively sought to enrol people in their attempts at governing. The ‘Fobbed Off’ campaign sought to give those refused access to social housing waiting lists the possibility of something other than passive acceptance of a bureaucratic decision, by their coming forward with their story and seeking to challenge it. Equally, in the next stage of the campaign, NEHAC re-presented their clients’ concerns not simply through statistics but by giving voice to their stories – and this vocalizing of clients makes the agency’s claims so powerful. This raises questions for advice agencies: is the only role for clients to be a statistic or a story, or can other mechanisms be found that allow them an active role in these acts of resistance?</p>
<p>Third, what insights can we achieve about the relationships between advice agency and clients that go beyond the mechanistic inputs/outputs often found in official research? How do these relationships create understandings and expectations about roles (active? passive?) of clients, advisers and the organization itself? How do the differing genealogies of the organization impact upon clients’ engagement? How do new modes of delivery of advice, through telephone call centres and internet sites, impact upon the client/agency relation? New methodologies must be employed that enable clients, advice workers and volunteers to give voice to their own stories and interactions in ways that can open up new insights into the mesh of power relations.</p>
<p>Lord Beveridge once said of citizens’ advice bureaux that they opened up ‘a window through which social workers and legislators could see the man in the street’ (quoted in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0261018312457859">Brasnett, 1964</xref>). Looking at advice agencies through the lens of translation opens up many new horizons for socio-legal research.</p>
