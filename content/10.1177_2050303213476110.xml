<p>The sociology of religion, particularly in 20th century North America, has had a complicated relationship with the subject of its inquiry. In Western Europe, institutional religion largely seemed to conform to the trajectory envisioned by various secularization theories. Differentiation from the state, and the market economy, resulted in a privatization of religious practices, a drop in institutional affiliation, and receding influence on public politics. In the US, however, proclamations regarding the imminent demise of religion have had to be tempered by the obvious signs of institutional vitality, widespread personal piety, and public relevance. The meta-narrative of American history certainly described declension from the colonial establishments of the 18th century, but the emergence of denominational and now religious pluralism, the religious diversity accompanying large-scale immigration, and the continued marginalization of those who self-identify as atheists have kept religion as a formidable institutional sector in American life, and periodically elevate it into headlines and public debate. It is noteworthy that the recent and significant rise in the number of Americans who claim no religious affiliation is not matched by the number who claim to be atheist.</p>
<p>Ironically, particularly since the 1960s, much of American sociology has not considered religion very seriously in its analyses of social life. Some of this is probably a holdover from theoretical traditions (both “modernization” theories drawing from Durkheim and Weber, and Marxian-inspired theories) that imported the European problematic onto American life. Some of this is undoubtedly owing to the fact that there is a significant percentage of secular people among academic sociologists—well above the percentages in the general population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-2050303213476110">Gross and Simmons, 2009</xref>). And some of this is because of a more “critical turn” in US sociology during and after the cultural and political changes of the 1960s. Whereas many liberal religious communities and individuals were integrally involved in the civil rights and anti-war movements, organized religion faced some of the same critiques as other societal institutions. Further, active religious involvement in the New Right from the 1980s to the present further tainted religion as a subject matter for many sociologists, especially those with progressive political sympathies.</p>
<p>One result is that the sociology of religion largely became an enclave for sociologists personally sympathetic to religion. This is not a characteristic unique to the sociology of religion, of course. Most sociologists of social movements study movements with which they have great political and personal affinity. Most scholars of racial and ethnic minorities, or of immigration, or of gender, are sympathetic to their subjects and critical of the ways in which inequalities damage their life chances. Sociologists who studied religion were convinced that religion mattered for its impacts on social life, if for no other reason than the highly understandable desire to study something vibrant and relevant to society.</p>
<p>If many in sociology generally had written off religion as not important, or declining in significance, or even as an epiphenomenal “opiate of the people,” it is not difficult to comprehend why scholars studying that subject matter would want to emphasize its efficacy, and moreover, the positive aspects of that efficacy. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-2050303213476110">Cadge et al. (2011)</xref> note, for the sociology of religion, at least in the US, this understandable reaction has led to a certain theoretical impoverishment, as the empirical work pursued by many scholars often begins with the presumption, and then consistently reinforces the idea, that “religion is good for you” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-2050303213476110">Williams, 2008</xref>: 3). This may often be true—we do not dispute that—but by focusing too much on positive effects, the subfield has missed a chance to theorize more complexly about its subject of interest, and to speak to larger scholarly audiences.</p>
<p>In this essay we illustrate our contention with brief examples from fields of study where we find theoretical oversight and empirical under-exploration to have unnecessarily limited knowledge: religion and health, family and youth; and in the absence of a well-developed sociology of religion and violence. We do not dispute the many good things that religion does for people, in terms of the quality of their social life and as an institution in society. But this is too often accompanied by presumptions about religion’s social efficacy that preclude a serious engagement with potentially negative outcomes of religion—either as a belief system or as a functioning form of social organization. This tendency is manifested both as defining religion and pro-social behavior in terms that play to particular forms of religions’ strengths, and a dearth of empirical studies into the more dangerous and destructive expressions of religion.</p>
<p>That is, we make two claims here. First, too often religion’s effects are conceptualized in ways that tend to reinforce the “religion is good for you” premise—for example, individualizing religion’s impact and social role in ways that undercut a collective, critical perspective that might emphasize social justice or political mobilization. Second, the role religion plays in “negative” social phenomena—such as religiously inspired terrorism, or legitimating violence—is too often ignored as a subject area, in favor of examples of religion acting as a positive force (e.g. as a call for non-violence or protesting for civil rights).</p>
<p>First, we provide a short overview of the contours of the sociology of religion as it is revealed in recent handbooks on the subject. Then we highlight some dimensions of social research on religion that we consider important if we are to develop critical inquiry in the sociology of religion. We call for a “critical” approach and use the term critical to mean both critical of the dominant methodological and theoretical approaches reigning in the subdiscipline, as well as critical of religion’s role in a number of social settings, interactions, and institutions. Finally, we provide a critique of the research areas noted above.</p>
<sec id="sec1-2050303213476110"><title>The state of the field</title>
<p>In the last decade, a plethora of “handbooks” on academic subjects has hit the book market and library shelves. There are a variety of reasons for this, mostly bound up in the economics of book publishing and library budgets. Nonetheless, it has been possible to lure both senior scholars, and up-and-coming names in the field, both to edit and contribute to them. The contributions to knowledge of these handbooks range widely, but they certainly give us an opportune vantage point to assess the contours of academic disciplines as they now stand.</p>
<p>The sociology of religion has been no different, with at least six major handbooks since 2003 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-2050303213476110">Beckford and Demerath, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-2050303213476110">Clarke, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-2050303213476110">Dillon, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-2050303213476110">Ebaugh, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-2050303213476110">Fenn, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-2050303213476110">Turner, 2010</xref>). All but two of the editors are located in the US (even if not born there), and although several of the handbooks have “comparative” sections, most have a center of gravity in the US, with chapters written by American-based scholars. The Clarke handbook is an exception, as Clarke was English, worked in England, and the book has a roster of authors heavily Western European rather than North American.</p>
<p>The handbooks have reasonably similar formats and chapters. There is a section on theory, with chapters on Durkheim, Weber, and/or classical theory, chapters on modern approaches, particularly rational choice theory, and engagement with secularization theories. There is a section on method and epistemology, and often a section on religion and social change. And in a variety of formats there are sections on religion, identity and the life course, religion, politics and public life, and religious behavior and religious organizations. The organizing principles are the relationship of religion to major societal institutions and its connection to major forms of social interaction.</p>
<p>There are many extremely useful and learned chapters in these handbooks, and one emerges from them with an effective overview of the field and its major engagements. And there is some engagement with what one might call a “critical” perspective. For example, the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-2050303213476110">Dillon (2003)</xref> handbook has a section on “Religion and socioeconomic inequality” and a chapter on religion and violence; the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-2050303213476110">Beckford and Demerath (2007)</xref> volume has a chapter on religion, the state, violence and human rights; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-2050303213476110">Turner’s (2010)</xref> volume has a chapter on religious nationalism. Here, Clarke’s volume is again a bit distinct. The theory section has a chapter on Habermas, Bourdieu, and Foucault, and there are chapters on atheism, religion and power, and religious nationalism. The topic of violence is included in a section on “Religion and ecology, health, social issues, and violence” (with separate chapters on religious violence and the French theologian Rene Girard). Although a number of chapters in all the handbooks, and their authors, undoubtedly take a critical look at the phenomena they write about, the field, as a totality, is rooted in mainstream understandings of sociology and of social life, and operates within the existing institutional and epistemological framework. Critical topics and approaches are a minority.</p>
<p>Of course, this approach makes sense at several levels. It is wise, in general, for individual scholars to hew to the middle-of-the-road. No matter what right-wing commentators say about “tenured radicals,” the academy is at most a left-of-center place, if at all, and mainstream research is most rewarded. This is particularly true when considering research carried out with external funding. The two most valued sources of funding for research are the US Federal Government’s National Science Foundation and National Institutes for Health. Not only are these agencies committed to standard approaches to scientific research, they also answer to Congress for their budgets. Enterprising legislators can make headlines criticizing the funding decisions, on either political or budget-cutting grounds. Thus there is an incentive to avoid potentially controversial subject areas, such as research focusing on the negative dimensions of a highly valued social institution (i.e. religion). Several private foundations have also, in the recent past, funded research on religion. These funders often have personal interests in religion and, again, tend to generate research that focuses on religion’s positive effects in society (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-2050303213476110">Smilde and May, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-2050303213476110">Williams, 2008</xref>). As universities increase the pressure on faculty to bring in external money, conservative tendencies in research methods and substantive topics may well increase.</p>
<p>We do not believe that all research must be “critical” as we conceptualize it. Nor are we offering the only possible way to understand what “critical” might mean—for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-2050303213476110">Goldstein (2009)</xref> makes a case for a critical sociology of religion that is more explicitly grounded in Frankfurt School-inspired theory. Nonetheless, we would argue for a more robust critical approach in the sociology of religion. At the very least it would complement the current mainstream research approach, which is both highly institutionalized and implicitly conservative. We are convinced that such an approach would enrich our theoretical and empirical understandings by bringing to light the complex and multi-faceted impact of religion on the world and vice versa.</p>
<p>Calling for the development of a critical sociology of religion requires a definition of what makes something “critical.” Given our own groundings in North American sociology, we are reluctant to confine our critical approach to critical theory formally defined—that is, the Frankfurt School and its progeny. We do, however, share some basic concerns with that version of critical theory, even if we do not share all the vocabulary and epistemological assumptions. We begin with two basic principles that must characterize research in order to be called “critical”:
<list id="list1-2050303213476110" list-type="roman-lower">
<list-item><p>The substantive focus must be on injustice and consistent disadvantage within society, and the analysis must lift up the role religion plays in such injustice.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Religion can have negative social outcomes in its normal, institutionalized workings, and these are as integral to religion’s social functions as are positive outcomes.</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>These principles are broad enough to encapsulate a wide array of studies and forms of analysis ranging from post-positivist and ethnographic designs to experimental and survey research methods. The orientation towards understanding various religions’ roles in maintaining inequalities or producing anti-social outcomes highlights particular gaps in existing literatures.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-2050303213476110"><title>Examples of current research</title>
<p>A vibrant line of recent scholarship emphasizes positive relationships between religion and measures of health and pro-social behavior (for example, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-2050303213476110">Benjamins, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-2050303213476110">Bierman, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-2050303213476110">Cline and Ferraro, 2006</xref>). Although we recognize the broad tendency for religion, as both a belief system and as an attribute of a community of believers, to be positively correlated with measures of individual health, framing the research question in this way misses the options it might have for a critical perspective. Like much research in the field of public health, much of this research individualizes the threats to health and the potential responses to them. Religion is conceptualized as a “buffer” to the risk of individuals suffering physical or mental illnesses. Rather than focus on environmental or contextual threats, or ask why some communities are more at risk than others (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-2050303213476110">Ellison et al., 2008</xref>, for an exception), or examine how religious communities might participate in ameliorating (or perhaps whether they exacerbate) collective problems, the research treats religion as some type of medicine or therapeutic answer available to individuals. This perspective is a logical way to approach religion’s effect on health. Yet our sociological imaginations demand that we look at how religion is more than just a buffer and how it functions at institutional and societal levels. Rather than conceptualizing religion as a buffer for solving individual problems, we can focus on religion as a collective resource that reproduces, as well as challenges, social power.</p>
<p>Further, the behaviors categorized as “pro-social” are also individualized—such as regular exercise—or often resonate with traditional pietistic notions of sin, such as avoiding alcohol, drugs, or extra-marital sex. Other pro-social behaviors are explicitly conservative, such as measuring whether young people get into trouble with school officials (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-2050303213476110">Smith and Denton, 2005</xref>). Of equal theoretical interest, we claim, are particular anti-social behaviors potentially connected to religion; but these are not as well studied by sociologists of religion. For example, although religious involvement does seem to lower the risk of young people smoking or using drugs, there is much less examination of whether religion exposes youth to homophobic or racist attitudes, or whether it justifies inequality or segregation through moral approbation of the victims of inequality (for exceptions, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-2050303213476110">Emerson and Smith, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-2050303213476110">Merino, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-2050303213476110">Tranby and Hartmann, 2008</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-2050303213476110">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>Moreover, it is crucial to maintain a more structural perspective that reveals how the standards that are used when people evaluate themselves, their subjective states, or their general well-being are in part defined by the religious and social contexts in which they live. Comparative research on the effects of religion on health and well-being between the US and Western Europe (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-2050303213476110">Diener et al., 2011</xref>; Stavrova et al., 2012) show that in predominately religious contexts the “cost” of not being religious is significantly higher (in absolute terms) than in nations with a low general belief in religion. In other words, being religious in a religious nation, rather than simply being religious as an individual attribute, is a significant factor in producing positive outcomes. A critical structural perspective allows us to see religion as not only a “buffer” but also a factor which shapes the context, norms, and acceptable ways of being in a nation – all of which can affect health and well-being. In keeping with our understanding of a critical sociology of religion, using a structural understanding of religion highlights how particular ways of being, thinking, and believing become the standards with which individuals live and are assessed.</p>
<p>Part of the positive assessment of religious effects comes from the noted association with communal belonging and civic participation. Religion aids individual health through beliefs and the comfort and motivation they bring, but also through the benefits of sociability—both instrumental help through social networks and the moral and emotional support of belonging. And yet, the tendency to treat all civic behavior, and all communal belonging, as positive is also problematic. For example, the Phelps family of the Westboro (Topeka, Kansas) Baptist Church is deeply involved with their church and in civic projects—but this involvement generally involves spending their time harassing people at funerals to protest America’s tolerance for homosexuality. Their actions are motivated by their religious beliefs and they can persevere in the face of withering criticism because of the dense network of social supports in their religious community. Although it is important to measure action verses inaction, the content of those actions is also a matter for social scientists to consider and vital for a critical understanding of religion.</p>
<p>It is important not to ignore the “dark side” of close, highly integrated religious communities. Prejudice, social closure, and exclusion are just as important to study as health and civic commitment. Put directly, too often our discipline studies the effects of religious involvement on health and well-being, but less often the effects of those beliefs and practices on people excluded by them (see, for example,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-2050303213476110"> Maduro, 2007</xref>). Literature on the effects of stress and exclusion on health is well established, and a growing body of literature on the devastating psychological damage to members of the gay community increasingly shows that being the target of exclusion can be deadly (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-2050303213476110">Almeida et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-2050303213476110">Friedman et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-2050303213476110">Kim and Leventhal, 2008</xref>). We also note the role that religious groups have played in trying to stop governments from passing non-discriminatory laws and policies that are based on sexuality or sexual orientation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-2050303213476110">Eckholm, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>The implication of our critique is that investigations of religion and its impacts in the social world must account for the ways in which religion <italic>necessarily</italic> has a dark and destructive side. As religious studies scholars Wellman and Tokuno argue, “the symbolic and social boundaries of religion (no matter how fluid or porous) mobilize individual and group identity in conflict, and sometimes violence, within and between groups” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-2050303213476110">Wellman and Tokuno, 2004</xref>: 291). In bringing people together within strong boundaries, there will always be those who are liminal and excluded. Durkheim’s theory of collective effervescences can mean violent outpourings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-2050303213476110">Graham, 2007</xref>); <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-2050303213476110">Smith (1998)</xref> notes that there are always “negative reference groups” that serve to denote the outer limits of a group; and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-2050303213476110">Stark (2003)</xref> highlights that believing in one true God implies that all other religions are not just wrong but potentially dangerous. In each case there is a potential “dark side” to the intense in-group affiliations created by religion for those on the outside (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-2050303213476110">Putnam, 2001</xref>). The ways in which these dynamics can motivate and legitimate violence or war seem clear.</p>
<p>A particularly acute omission from the sociology of religion is the in-depth study of terrorism. Few forces have shaped the American experience more dramatically at the turn of the current century than terrorism, yet the amount of research within the sociology of religion that focuses on it is sparse. There are notable exceptions (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-2050303213476110">Jerryson and Juergensmeyer, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-2050303213476110">Juergensmeyer, 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-2050303213476110">2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-2050303213476110">Kastenmüller et al., 2011</xref>) but most of the serious sociology on religion and terrorism has been done by political sociologists or sociologists of social movements (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-2050303213476110">Goodwin, 2006</xref>). Compared to the number of articles on the positive effects of religion, one of most historically significant blendings of ideology with the tools of warfare has not received much attention from those who are best equipped to understand what role religion plays in religious terrorism.</p>
<p>It is, of course, tempting to want to explain away religious terrorism analytically, given its comparative rarity compared to other dimensions of religion in social life. It is also tempting to do so normatively, as some acts are so heinous that they risk producing a condemnation of the entire enterprise by association. But many of the dynamics that produce pro-social outcomes are also those that produce violence, exclusion, and oppression—such as the tight bounding of communities and the social supports necessary to create alternative moral worldviews that can persist in the face of mainstream society’s condemnation, and withstand persecution. We need not abandon our normative commitments in order to understand the empirical—indeed, we contend that we can only understand one by fully appreciating the other. There are theoretical resources available that explore the connections between religion and violence (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-2050303213476110">Pahl, 2010</xref>); the sociology of religion, especially in the US, needs to engage them more fully.</p>
<p>Importantly, we do not think it necessary to give up all the tools of quantitative social science in order to do a critical sociology of religion. Quantitative analysis often reveals social patterns difficult to discern with other methods. Particularly when one is interested in examining persistent, structural aspects of social life, statistical tools can be quite useful. Further, the capacity to make generalizable claims—even if, along with their greater scope, they are often more limited in depth—is useful both to theorizing and to understandings of social and political dynamics. Nonetheless, the questions asked, and the orienting paradigms engaged, by quantitative sociology would benefit in turn from the addition of a critical perspective.</p>
<p>Ultimately, we hope that this journal facilitates the development of a more critical investigation into religion using the intellectual resources provided by the sociology of religion subdiscipline. Through identifying what constitutes a critical approach to religion, and noting our over-emphasis on the positive, our de-emphasis of the negative aspects of religion, and our implicit conceptualizations that too often by-pass social-level perspectives, we hope to encourage others to broaden the scope of their inquiry and perhaps question some of their foundational assumptions when approaching their research.</p>
