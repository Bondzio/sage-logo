<p>One of the challenges for those involved in all-ages ministry is trying to make our set lectionary readings accessible to children whilst not ‘dumbing it down’ too much for the adults. Some weeks are easier than others; indeed some months are more straightforward than others. Here is a mixture of Old and New Testament readings for this season.</p>
<sec id="section1-0014524612441460">
<title>Trinity Sunday- 3<sup>rd</sup> June – John 3:1-17</title>
<p>Explaining the Trinity to adults is difficult enough but to youngsters is particularly challenging. Here are some thoughts about how to illustrate the concept of the Trinity.</p>
<p>Show some images of ways to explain the Trinity;</p>
<p>E.g. a picture of a 3 leaf clover with each leaf representing the Father, the Son &amp; the Holy Spirit yet all represent God the Trinity.</p>
<p>E.g. draw a triangle with each corner representing the Father, the Son &amp; the Holy Spirit yet all are part of the same triangle which represents God.</p>
<p>E.g. picture of Ice, Water &amp; Steam= all are elements of water.</p>
<p>E.g. picture of a circle with arrows located at 3 points on the circle’s edge= represents the never-ending relationship between the 3 elements (Father, Son &amp; Holy Spirit) - there is no beginning and no end to God.</p>
<p>E.g. an egg- shell, yoke, white = still all an egg.</p>
<p>No example is perfect… the point to make is that no mater how many symbols we use the Trinity is still a mystery, and it is natural that we should have questions.</p>
<p>Tell the story of Nicodemus who also had many questions. Because he did not want others to know, he went to visit Jesus at night. Nicodemus left his home and went through the town. He knocked on the door where Jesus was staying. He had questions for Jesus. Jesus spoke to him about the Spirit, about the Father and his relationship to him.</p>
<p>You might like to explain the image of a door (photocopy a picture of a door for each person). Reflect on some of the questions we might like to ask Jesus. You could write them on the door. The children might like to draw a picture of their questions.</p>
<p>No matter what age we are, we come to God with many questions.</p>
<p>End with a summary: today we celebrate the Trinity- one God, three persons. It is a mystery. Just like Nicodemus we don’t know all the answers but we can keep coming to Jesus, even in the darkness, for answers.</p>

<title>Proper 5- 10<sup>th</sup> June - Psalm 138</title>
<p>We often forget in the Church to be thankful, to count our blessings. We are good at focusing on what God has done for us; for God’s great love and we’re even quite good at asking for help. This Sunday’s Psalm is one which encourages thankfulness and remembrance of God’s goodness and recalling past deeds of love and faithfulness. In a way, this Psalm is telling God who God is, and being thankful.</p>
<p>Ask the congregation to call out things to be thankful for e.g. beauty of the area, friendships, seasonal weather, good health, educational opportunities, personal and communal blessings etc. Write the list on poster paper so everyone can see.</p>
<p>Use the list to compose a prayer of thanks-giving to God.</p>
<p>Message- even in the most difficult of times we can find many things to be thankful to God for.</p>

<title>Proper 6- 17<sup>th</sup> June- Samuel 15:34-16:13</title>
<p>This week’s Old Testament reading focuses on the story of God calling David to be the King of Israel.</p>
<p>Retell the story of David, the weakest and smallest. You might like to tell this story with a reality TV like approach. E.g. X Factor or Britain’s Got Talent style, where often the most beautiful, most talented, the biggest personality wins in the end.</p>
<p>This is where the story of David is very different. Samuel is looking to find a king, someone who can lead the people and be the kind of role model and king that the people can respect and look up to. Someone who will be with them through the good times and the difficult years. God passes over the most beautiful, the strongest, and the most talented and instead chooses the weakest and youngest of the brothers, David a mere shepherd boy, to become the chosen King.</p>
<p>You might like to illustrate this with a collection of toys; beautiful toys, teddy bears etc, using various categories i.e. largest teddy, most beautiful, best dressed, cutest etc. but in the end choosing the smallest, scruffiest, worn out looking teddy to take home with you….most unexpected, just like God choosing David.</p>
<p>You might like to talk about David and his gifts/abilities and why God might have chosen him over the others. Also how God often does unexpected things.</p>
<p>The key message to get across is that God looks at the heart, not at the outside.</p>

<sec id="section4-0014524612441460">
<title>Proper 7- 24<sup>th</sup> June- Mark 4:35-41</title>
<p>This gospel narrative lends itself perfectly to an imaginative and interactive story telling. The adults can imagine this sitting in their seats, closing their eyes etc. The children can come and sit at the front in the shape of a boat.</p>
<p>As you tell the story, try to give a very strong contrast between the chaos and noise of the storm, and the sudden silence and peace after Jesus stills the storm.</p>
<p>You might like to practise some actions and sounds, with the children (and adults) before you begin to tell the story.</p>
<p>Tell the story ‘Jesus Stills the Storm’ from Mark 4:35-41 in your own words with some repetition. The children can adopt the following actions when the key words/phrases are used.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Words like; ‘tired’ and ‘needed to rest’ → action- sigh and arms folded.</p>
<p>‘a big storm’ → sound of rushing wind and waving hands</p>
<p>‘waves beat into the boat’ → slap thighs and rock from side to side</p>
<p>‘storm be quiet/waves be still’ → silence and sit very still</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The message- Jesus is with us in the storms, in the dangerous times of our lives and in the times of calm.</p>
