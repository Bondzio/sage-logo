<abstract>
<p>Principals play key roles in creating the conditions in which teachers can teach effectively and students can learn. Principals are increasingly being held accountable both for teacher quality and for student learning and development so that young people can become ‘successful learners, confident and creative individuals and active and informed citizens’. The Australian Institute for Teaching and School Leadership (AITSL) was established by the Australian Government in 2010 to provide national leadership for the Commonwealth, state and territory governments in promoting excellence in the profession of teaching and school leadership. Reporting to all state and territory ministers responsible for education, AITSL is charged with driving transformational change and creating new levels of teacher professionalism. In its first year the Institute developed a new National Professional Standard for Principals.<sup>1</sup> This article outlines the origins and development of this standard. Development was a collaborative process including key stakeholders from across Australia with international expert input. Following national piloting of the standard, refinements to the standard were made and mechanisms to support the use of the standard have been put in place.</p>

<title>The Importance of Leadership: The Use of Leadership Standards and Frameworks</title>
<p>School leadership is increasingly recognized internationally as a vital factor in improving school effectiveness, teacher quality and student achievement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1741143213485462">Barber et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1741143213485462">Day et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1741143213485462">Dinham, 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1741143213485462">2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1741143213485462">2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1741143213485462">Leithwood et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1741143213485462">Reeves, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1741143213485462">Schleicher, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1741143213485462">Wahlstrom, 2008</xref>). As a result there has been increasing attention paid to formulating professional standards and frameworks for school leaders both to articulate the breadth and depth of leaders’ roles and to inform professional learning, selection, appraisal and accountability processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1741143213485462">Leithwood et al., 2002</xref>: 863–875).</p>
<p>It is recognized that teachers also exercise leadership (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1741143213485462">Harris, 2009</xref>). As teachers become more experienced and adept it is likely and indeed expected that their leadership involvement and influence will increase and move beyond the classroom, across the school and more widely into the profession. Thus professional teaching standards for teachers need to contain leadership aspects. For those teachers who seek appointment to formal positions of responsibility in schools, these leadership expectations are greater.</p>
<p>In considering professional standards for principals, while principals will continue to perform a variety of managerial roles, they are seen to be most effective where they place major emphasis on ‘instructional leadership’, that is, leadership for teaching and learning:
<disp-quote>
<p>School leaders who focus on students’ achievement and instructional strategies are the most effective … It is leaders who place more attention on teaching and focused achievement domains … who have the higher effects. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1741143213485462">Hattie, 2009</xref>: 83)</p>
</disp-quote> The crucial importance of the teacher to student learning has long been recognized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1741143213485462">Wright et al., 1997</xref>). The challenge for any educational leader is to make things happen within individual classrooms. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1741143213485462">Wahlstrom and Louis (2008</xref>: 459) have commented:
<disp-quote>
<p>In the current era of accountability, a principal’s responsibility for the quality of teachers’ work is simply a fact of life. How to achieve influence over work settings (classrooms) in which they rarely participate is a key dilemma.</p>
</disp-quote> Despite the smaller measured effects on student learning for school-based factors beyond the classroom (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1741143213485462">Hattie, 2009</xref>), research evidence has confirmed that ‘school leaders can play major roles in creating the conditions in which teachers can teach effectively and students can learn’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1741143213485462">Dinham, 2008</xref>: 15).</p>
<p>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1741143213485462">Leithwood et al. (2004</xref>: 5), in reviewing the research literature on leadership and school achievement, found: ‘[t]he total (direct and indirect) effects of leadership on student learning account for about a quarter of total school effects’, and that:</p>
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item>
<p>Leadership is second only to classroom instruction among all school-related factors that contribute to what students learn at school.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Leadership effects are usually largest where and when they are needed most [that is, in the most challenging schools and circumstances or coming off a ‘low base’].</p>
</list-item>
</list>
<p>Today, leadership is seen as central and essential to delivering the changes, improvement and performance society increasingly expects of all organizations, including schools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1741143213485462">Barber et al., 2010</xref>). What has become clear is that leadership generally, including educational leadership, is a more contentious, complex, situated and dynamic phenomenon than thought previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1741143213485462">Dineham et al, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Professional standards for leaders and school principals can play key roles, depending on their intended purposes, in aiding reflection and self-development, in formulating suitable professional learning experiences, in attracting and selecting suitable candidates for positions of responsibility and in assessing the effectiveness of school leaders. Standards also articulate the values, knowledge and practices of school leaders to the wider community.</p>
<sec id="section2-1741143213485462">
<title>The Beginnings of Leadership Standards in Australia</title>
<p>One of the challenges in formulating professional standards for principals is to capture the sheer diversity of the contexts in which they can operate: from teaching principals in small schools to those heading multi-campus schools; from low to high socio-economic status and low to high non-English speaking backgrounds (NESB); from urban to regional to isolated; from struggling, coasting to successful schools, and in government, other systemic and independent schools.</p>
<p>Years of largely discrete work by educational systems, professional associations and other bodies within Australia had resulted in many and varied leadership standards and frameworks being in use across the nation although a uniform national standard was lacking. In 2008, work on national leadership standards<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1741143213485462">2</xref>
</sup> began. This was part of broader work around national professional standards for teachers which had an even longer history (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1741143213485462">Dinham et al., 2008a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1741143213485462">2008b</xref>).</p>
<p>When the Australian Council for Educational Research (ACER) was contracted to conduct a mapping and consolidation of Australian leadership/principal standards for the Commonwealth Department of Education, Employment and Workplace relations (DEEWR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1741143213485462">Dinham et al., 2009</xref>), it examined more than 60 extant leadership/principal standards and frameworks then being used for a variety of purposes across the nation. This set was by no means exhaustive. Like others, ACER concluded that given developments in Australia such as national student standardized testing and a national curriculum, the time was right for a national standard for principals to compliment the national standards for teachers (at four career stages) and national accreditation of teacher education courses, developments advocated previously in a report for the Business Council of Australia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1741143213485462">Dinham et al., 2008a</xref>).</p>
<p>When thoughts turned to developing national standards for leaders/principals there were conflicting views about their intended nature, audience and purpose. Some advocated a generic standard for leadership, while others favoured a standard for principals or multiple sets of standards for aspiring, practising and even exemplary principals. A key point of disagreement was whether a standard for principals should be used for performance appraisal purposes (that is, a <italic>performance standard</italic>) or as a guide for professional development, self-reflection and to inform processes such as promotion and appraisal (that is, a <italic>content standard</italic>).</p>
<p>These debates were at times intensely political and some stakeholders were quite passionate about the superiority of ‘their’ standard(s). It should be noted that while much of education in Australia is funded directly and indirectly through the federal tax system, constitutionally, education is a state and territory responsibility, and thus gaining agreement for national initiatives in education is not easy. ‘Whose responsibility?’ and ‘who pays?’ are frequent refrains.</p>
<p>Over time, jurisdictions, employers, systems, professional associations and individual schools had also developed their own processes to guide, select, appoint and appraise school leaders. Some of these were underpinned or informed by leadership and/or principal standards and frameworks, but the terrain was quite muddy overall.</p>
<p>Gaining universal stakeholder agreement for a National Professional Standard for Principals was not an easy task and represented a significant achievement. To compound matters, the timeframe to write the Standard and have it endorsed was extremely challenging.</p>
<p>Now that the National Professional Standard for Principals has been completed and endorsed, a process described in this article, a key matter is how the Standard will be implemented, supported and used across the profession. The Standard represents a beginning and a means, not an end, a matter taken up in the final section of this article.</p>

<title>Developing the National Professional Standard for Principals in Australia</title>
<p>The mapping and consolidation of existing standards for teachers and leaders conducted by ACER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1741143213485462">Dinham et al., 2008b</xref>) was an interesting exercise. Once the mapping of extant standards had been completed the more challenging task of consolidation into a series of standards for teachers and leaders commenced. After much debate among the various stakeholders it was determined that four sets of standards would be developed for teachers at various stages of development:</p>
<list list-type="order">
<list-item>
<p>Graduate</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Registered or competent</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Highly accomplished</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Exemplary or leading teacher.</p>
</list-item>
</list>
<p>At the time, it was acknowledged that there existed disagreement and discrepancy concerning the use of nomenclature, that is, registered teacher/competent teacher; accomplished teacher/highly accomplished teacher; leading teacher/exemplary teacher/expert teacher. Teacher registration, where it existed, was a state and territory responsibility and employers had their own terminology. The ACER report noted that these debates were ongoing and that these matters would need to be resolved.</p>
<p>Significant work had then been done on the teacher standards including a comprehensive national consultation process before they were handed to a new national body, the Australian Institute for Teaching and School Leadership (AITSL) to finalize and ensure they were supported and endorsed nationally. AITSL’s finalization process involved a psychometric validation by 6000 teachers through two online surveys and focus groups and eventually, after further development, the four levels for teachers became designated as:</p>
<list list-type="order">
<list-item>
<p>Graduate</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Proficient</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Highly accomplished</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Lead.</p>
</list-item>
</list>
<p>The National Professional Standards for Teachers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1741143213485462">AITSL, 2011a</xref>) were endorsed by the Ministerial Council for Education, Early Childhood Development and Youth Affairs (MCEEDYA) in late December 2010 and released in February <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1741143213485462">2011</xref>, although piloting was continuing. The teacher standard pilots were focused on implementation and were about providing AITSL and others with information about how the standards can be used to greatest effect and what forms of support for their use would be most effective.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1741143213485462">3</xref> </sup>In its 2009 report, ACER was also requested to consider standards for ‘school leaders’ and ‘accomplished school leaders’. The former was intended more for those aspiring to formal leadership positions in schools while the latter was broadly aimed at principals although the word principal was not to be used. The leadership standards also proved contentious with jurisdictions and other bodies. After a period of debate and various changes of direction, it was determined to produce a single standard for principals.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1741143213485462">
<title>Development of the Exposure Draft of the National Professional Standard for Principals</title>
<p>Once agreement was reached across the various jurisdictions, AITSL commenced work on the principal standard in early 2010, with drafting beginning in September that year. Professor Dame Patricia Collarbone from the UK played a key role in this work as an external expert and ‘circuit breaker’, given the political nature of the issue noted previously. AITSL also established an external expert steering group and an internal expert group drawn from across stakeholders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1741143213485462">AITSL, 2011b</xref>: 5–6) to guide and support this work and there was an intensive and extensive process of research, drafting, critical review and feedback involving organizations and jurisdictions from across Australia.</p>
<p>The drafting of the Standard was guided by a set of principles:</p>
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item>
<p>privilege the skills and knowledge specific to educational leadership;</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>reflect the complexity and changing nature of contemporary school leadership;</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>recognize the collaborative nature of school leadership;</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>encourage a futures focused leadership capacity;</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>guide principal preparation, development programs and self-refection to meet the needs of school leaders in different contexts.</p>
</list-item>
</list>
<p>Initial research focused upon current thinking about school leadership and the national standards for principals and leaders used in other countries, including the UK, Canada, New Zealand and the USA, as well as the range of standards already in existence in Australia identified by ACER.</p>
<p>The research into school leadership highlighted at the outset the importance of school context, leadership practices, models of leadership and personal qualities, knowledge and skills. What became apparent was the range of environments and the complexity, critical significance and interrelated nature of the role of principal. The first exposure draft of the Standard (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1741143213485462">AITSL, 2010</xref>) was developed to reflect these findings:
<disp-quote>
<p>The school context in which the principal works is unique and of critical importance. The size of the school, the age of students, its traditions, location and other community factors mean that the standard must be applicable to the diverse nature of Australia’s schools. ‘At the same time though, most of the evidence we have reviewed suggests that good leadership is the same irrespective of context, and that ‘what works’ is surprisingly consistent’. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1741143213485462">Barber et al., 2010</xref>: 3)</p>
</disp-quote>
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item>
<p>It should be focused on the primary task of the organization, in this case, learning, teaching and student outcomes.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>The practices and competencies of leaders evolve as they move through their career and their learning and development needs to reflect this as well as being available when and where they need it.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Leadership is collaborative and distributed among members of school teams; it does not reside in one individual. The role of the leader is to orchestrate and engage with and grow and develop other leaders at all levels of the school.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>New models of leadership within and beyond the school are emerging with school leaders taking on a range of roles within their community.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>In order to improve the life chances of all students within the community and the nation, principals have a wider responsibility that involves developing the education system as a whole at local and national levels.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Controversially, research shows that a small handful of personal qualities and skills explain a high proportion of the variation in leadership effectiveness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1741143213485462">Leithwood, et al., 2006</xref>). Successful leaders draw upon the same repertoire of personal qualities and capabilities. This in turn explains a significant amount of the variation in leadership effectiveness.</p>
</list-item>
</list> In addition to this work there was extensive consultation with principals, parents’ associations, academics, state officials, professional associations and other stakeholders from across Australia. This was not a one-off exercise but an iterative process that took place throughout the development of the Standard. The responses supported the key findings from the research. They reinforced the importance of context and the enormous diversity in schools across Australia and the systems in which principals operate as well as the challenges that exist for the indigenous population and others.</p>
<p>There was consensus that the purpose of the Standard needed to be clearly articulated and the language accessible. It requires focus on professional development, creativity and risk taking and should include self-reflection, ethics and values. The importance of relationships and working with others was also stressed by respondents.</p>
<p>Following the research and first round of consultation, the conceptual model was refined and tested for completeness and clarity (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1741143213485462">Figure 1</xref> for the final model). It was critical that the model reflected the systemic nature of the role of principal and was clear and unambiguous. It was only then that this could be built upon and turned into an accessible and useable standard.</p>

<p>At this stage the international panel of experts reviewed a draft of the Standard.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1741143213485462">4</xref>
</sup> Their feedback centred upon the need to make even more explicit the purpose of the Standard – what is it for and what difference will it make. What would be needed to increase its take up and impact were also important questions. There were helpful suggestions related to leadership requirements, professional practices and language from the external panel.</p>
<p>A small but significant change took place as the conceptual model was developed and tested with stakeholders. The name changed from ‘National Standards for Principals’ to ‘The National Professional Standard for Principals’ (and later, as noted to the `Australian Professional Standard for Principals'). This was in response to the overwhelming consensus that the power of the model lies in the way it reflects the integrated and interrelated nature of the role of the principal. Everything that principals do in their professional practice is underpinned by their vision and values, their knowledge, and their personal qualities, requirements common to all leaders: ‘There are statistically empirical and qualitatively robust associations between heads’ educational values, qualities and their strategic actions and improvements in school conditions leading to improvements in student outcomes’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1741143213485462">Day et al., 2009</xref>: 1). The name change to `standard' reflected the systemic or holistic nature of the role and the fact that it is not simply a list of attributes, duties or activities.</p>
<p>Together the leadership requirements and the professional practices principals do to enact these requirements are far more than a lower-level list of ‘person specifications’ or a role description. For a principal they go right to the heart of what it means to be responsible for the life chances of young people in their community.</p>

<title>Piloting the Exposure Draft of the National Standard for Principals</title>
<p>The exposure draft of the Standard (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1741143213485462">AITSL, 2010</xref>: 3) noted that:
<disp-quote>
<p>The National Professional Standard for Principals (the Standard) sets out what principals are expected to know, understand and do to achieve excellence in their work. It takes full account of the crucial contribution made by principals in:</p>
</disp-quote>
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item>
<p>raising student achievement at all levels and all stages</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>promoting equity and excellence</p>

<p>influencing, developing and delivering community expectations and government policy</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>contributing to the development of a 21st century education system at local, national and international levels.</p>
</list-item>
</list> It is important to reiterate that it was determined by AITSL through consultation with stakeholders that the Principal Standard would be a <italic>content</italic>, rather than a <italic>performance</italic> standard that is, the Standard is not intended to be used directly to select principals, assess or certify principals against the standard or appraise principal performance. If the Standard was to be used for performance purposes, it would need to be designed quite differently with prescribed levels of performance and be validated psychometrically to ensure the Standard was fit for purpose.</p>
<p>Because of the above distinction, it was decided that rather than go through a lengthy process of validation – as was deemed necessary and occurred with the national teacher standards – it would be more beneficial to engage the profession nationally in piloting or ‘road-testing’ the Standard in ‘real world’ situations. This piloting project occurred under the direction of Stephen Dinham.</p>
<p>It was determined that pilot projects (under the umbrella of the overall piloting) should take place in a variety of contexts and that the exposure draft of the Principal Standard be applied to a range of its intended purposes, the core and common feature of which was to be active <italic>use</italic> of the Standard with principals, aspiring principals and other stakeholders.</p>
<p>To the above end, tenders were called for in late 2010 with projects to commence early in 2011 for completion by early June 2011.</p>
<p>Nine organizations were selected by AITSL to undertake ten pilot studies. While each project had a particular focus and context (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1741143213485462">Table 1</xref>) all were required to specifically address three key research questions within a common research approach (after Dinham, various):</p>

<title>General Findings from the 10 Pilot Studies</title>
<p>Space precludes detailed examination of the 10 pilot studies (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1741143213485462">Dinham [2011]</xref> for additional information on methodology and findings overall and for each pilot) but what follows is an overview of the general findings and recommendations.</p>
<p>Principals, other educators and stakeholders overwhelmingly welcomed the development of the National Professional Standard for Principals, which was seen as overdue and meeting a need:
<disp-quote>
<p>We applaud the work of the Australian Institute for Teaching and School Leadership in developing the National Professional Standard for Principals. (REFA)</p>
<p>The draft Standard is viewed as a positive initiative by the representatives of the business, parent and teacher groups that were consulted. The AITSL document provided an opportunity for clarity and authority in a potentially confusing area. (ACER)</p>
<p>There was significant evidence from principals in the pilot study that the Standard accurately defined the leadership requirements and professional practices of effective principals and that the Standard described effective leadership. (NSW DEC)</p>
<p>This project focused on the use of the Principal Professional Standard as a professional learning tool and it is clear that the Standard has met our expectations of what a good framework could do for principals’ thinking, knowledge and understanding. (Tas DET)</p>
</disp-quote> There was general agreement as to the appropriateness of the content of the Standard in capturing what principals need to be able to know, understand and do. It was found that the correct balance has been struck between prescription or detail and generality within the Standard.</p>
<p>The potential role of the Standard in promoting reflection and informing professional learning was one of the most common strengths identified in the pilot studies.</p>
<p>In terms of the central study questions of <italic>authenticity</italic>, <italic>utility</italic> and <italic>value add</italic>, once again the views of practicing and aspiring principals as well as stakeholders were positive:
<disp-quote>
<p>The Standard is perceived as achievable through a wide range of professional learning strategies. Its comprehensiveness and balance as a professional learning mechanism are notable … The Standard is particularly useful for experienced principals involved in mentoring, coaching or training aspirants to the principal position. (ACEL)</p>
<p>The Standard has been received positively by the participants of this pilot study. The authenticity of the Standard was positively attested to in all areas with over 80 per cent of responses indicating the opinion that accurate interpretation of the Standard encourages innovation and provides the system with a direction for the development of capable leaders. The standard was considered a valuable tool for the design of professional learning and as a tool for self-reflection. There was also overwhelmingly positive feedback in terms of the value-add capacity of the standard in the form of adding to the skills and knowledge of existing leaders and as an inspirational target for aspirants. (WA DE)</p>
<p>The Standard enables principals to reflect on their practice in specific circumstances and over time. … The Standard promotes an holistic approach to self reflection, encouraging principals to consider the interaction between leadership requirements and professional practices. … The Standard provides a guide for principal self assessment and planning of further professional learning. … The Standard adequately describes the role of principal. … The Standard is a useful guide/reference especially for aspiring and new leaders. The Standard could be used widely with the school community, Governing Council, staff and leadership teams. … The Standard is clearly written in accessible language. (SA DECS)</p>
<p>Generally the Standard was considered to be credible and reflect the work of school principals in regional and remote locations. It was considered to be sufficiently broad to take account of all the different types of responsibilities with which they deal. (CDU)</p>
<p>In relation to the use of the Standard as a framework for professional learning there was substantial evidence from principals in the New South Wales government school survey and focus group that the Standard provides a framework for planning professional learning and reflecting on practice and that the Standard provides a framework for professional learning. (NSW DEC)</p>
</disp-quote> Some stakeholders however, more so than principals, had a perception that the Standard will, should or could be used to judge principals’ performance. As far as principals were concerned, there was a clear preference for the Standard to be used for <italic>developmental</italic> and not <italic>judgemental</italic> or performance measurement purposes. Thus, there existed and no doubt still exists some confusion over the purpose(s) of the Standard. (The above lay behind the view expressed by some that the Standard needs ‘indicators of performance’ if it was to be successfully applied for the purpose of judging performance but as noted, this runs counter to the stated purpose and uses of the Standard.)
<disp-quote>
<p>Most groups of school principals who participated in this study thought the document would be of value to them and their staff, however most found it difficult to see how it was a ‘professional learning’ document. Some expressed concern that it was difficult to make the distinction between a ‘performance standard’ and ‘professional learning’ standard. (CDU)</p>
<p>[The Standard] Could inform professional performance and development discussions but participants were unsure of the value of the Standard as a performance assessment tool. (PA)</p>
</disp-quote> Generally, practizing principals were more likely to identify with and profess to understand the Standard than aspiring principals. This is hardly surprising and points to an important aspect of the Standard – articulating the role of the principal to those not in the position. Research has shown that many principals do not fully appreciate the complexity and demands of the role until the full responsibility is placed upon their shoulders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1741143213485462">Dinham, 2008</xref>):
<disp-quote>
<p>There was some constructive feedback. However, these responses were of two kinds: personalized responses and cautionary responses. The personalized responses came from inexperienced leaders in the form of comments such as ‘I don’t understand’. The more cautionary responses emanated from senior leaders who understood and applauded the Standard themselves. (WA DE)</p>
</disp-quote> While the potential value of the Standard to aspiring and practizing principals was uniformly recognized, there was a view that the Standard was of lesser value to other stakeholders in communicating and engendering understanding of the role and work of the principal.
<disp-quote>
<p>The authenticity and use of The Standard by parents and school communities was seen to be less obviously of benefit to them. (CDU)</p>
</disp-quote> A challenge for the Standard is of capturing and accommodating the myriad contexts in which Australian principals operate. This was a recurring theme in the various reports, most of which were supportive of the degree to which the Standard does in fact allow for context.</p>
<p>A matter raised in a number of reports was what comes next: the need for an adequate communication strategy; a ‘launch’; means to engage the profession and professional development opportunities were all advocated:
<disp-quote>
<p>A National Launch [is needed that] heralds the release of the Standard to highlight the importance of the work of school leaders, rather than a gradual leaking of the document as an optional framework.… Attention is focused on the implementation of the Standard by principals.… Jurisdictions could be supported in developing appropriate resources to be shared with a national audience. (SA DECS)</p>
<p>The next step in developing the Standard should be profession-led and driven by a strong ‘user’ perspective.… The next step in developing the Standard should be open and transparent, and engage parents, students and the general public as ‘consumers’. This will contribute to raising the status of the principalship as a high standing profession in Australian society, and ensure greater public understanding of the link between quality school leadership and improved student outcomes.… AITSL should engage with the profession’s leaders on how the profession itself intends to relate to the proposed AITSL Standard.… The implementation of the Standard must be accompanied by an effective Marketing and Communications Strategy resourced by AITSL.… The implementation of the Standard must be accompanied by an effective professional education and training strategy with the aim of ensuring that all principals have a deep understanding and awareness of the Standard. (PA)</p>

<title>Recommendations</title>
<p>The following recommendations were derived from the pilot study reports. These reports were presented in draft form in an earlier report and were augmented and modified as a result of a two-day Leadership Symposium held by AITSL where pilot study teams presented their findings to a national audience of stakeholders on June 8–9, 2011 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1741143213485462">Dinham, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>In developing these recommendations, a content analysis was undertaken of the findings and recommendations arising from the pilot study reports in order to assess the degree to which the individual pilot findings and their recommendations were more or less universal across the pilots as a whole.</p>
<p>Caution needs to be exercised in generalizing and extrapolating from individual pilots and the overall study. Due to the nature and scope of each pilot project there was an almost inevitable bias in the sample of participants, that is, they could not be said to be representative of the various populations of aspirant principals, principals, other stakeholders and students.</p>
<p>Overall however, there was strong and universal agreement as to the timeliness, quality and worth of the Standard and that the Standard should be endorsed. Where suggestions and recommendations were made, these were more in the area of emphases within the supporting text within the Exposure Draft and in regard to the ‘next steps’ in the implementation and application of the Standard.</p>
<p>Final Recommendations:</p>
<list list-type="order">
<list-item>
<p>That the exposure draft of National Professional Standard for Principals be endorsed following consideration of the matters raised during this series of pilot studies.</p>
</list-item>
</list>
<p>(Areas where attention to emphasis and wording within the Standard are recommended include:</p>
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item>
<p>Recognition of Indigenous students, communities and culture.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>The varied contexts of schooling and the principalship within Australia.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>The purpose of the Standard; what it is, what it is not and why.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>The affective domain of leadership, including relationships with others and the social and emotional well-being of self and others.)<list list-type="order">
<list-item>
<p>That a national communication, ‘marketing’ and implementation strategy for the Standard be formulated and enacted by AITSL in collaboration with key authorities and stakeholders. (Particular emphasis should be given to explaining the intended use and purpose of the Standard as noted above).</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>That the development of supporting documentation, professional learning programs and resources for use of the Standard be encouraged, facilitated and where appropriate, supported by ASITSL. (These may include videos of effective practice, AITSL flagship professional development programs, relevant readings and research, case studies, pod/vod casts, scenarios, templates for self-reflection and examples of suitable approaches and strategies to achieve the Standard across a variety of contexts.)</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>
<italic>That AITSL act as a clearing house to map and integrate resources available to support use of the Standard.</italic> (An interactive website with external links hosted by AITSL based on the Standard is suggested as one way to achieve this).</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>
<italic>That a plan for ongoing evaluation of the Standard’s relevance, implementation, uses, effectiveness and impact be formulated and enacted by AITSL.</italic>
</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>That AITSL consider means to align the Standard with the national professional standards for teachers, especially at the Lead level, to provide more of a continuum or ‘pathway’ of leadership development.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>
<italic>That the reports of the individual pilot studies be made available by AITSL to the wider educational community for further use.</italic>

<title>Endorsement of the national standard for principals</title>
<p>Those working on the exposure draft of the National Professional Standard for Principals responded to the recommendations made through the Leadership Symposium and arising from the pilot studies and made changes to the final version to include a greater emphasis on:</p>
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item>
<p>Moral purpose</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Well being of principals and students</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Community</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Support for and awareness of Indigenous issues</p>
</list-item>
</list>
<p>Consideration was also given to the tone, use of specific words and balance across the document.</p>
<p>On July 8 2011 the Commonwealth, and State and Territory Education Ministers, in light of the strong and widespread support for the National Professional Standard for Principals, endorsed it as the Standard for all Australian principals.
<disp-quote>
<p>In a historic move, Ministers endorsed a National Professional Standard for Principals to support the professional preparation, development and self-reflection of aspiring and practizing principals in all schools across Australia. The National Professional Standard for Principals sets out what principals are expected to know, understand and do to achieve excellence in their work. The Standard will for the first time, unify the professional nationally by describing the professional practice of principals in a common language and in making explicit the role of quality school leadership for improved student outcomes. (MCEEDYA, 2011)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1741143213485462">
<title>Where to from here?</title>
<p>Following endorsement and adoption, the work of AITSL to realize the potential of the Standard to positively impact on the quality of school leaders now needed to begin in earnest. The final recommendations of the pilot studies made a valuable, evidenced-based starting point for thinking, planning and action.</p>
<p>AITSL took the Standard ‘on the road’ deliberately partnering with employing authorities, leadership institutes and professional associations. Professor Dame Patricia Collarbone was invited back to Australia to partner with AITSL in the delivery of interactive sessions that introduced principals across Australia to the Standard. The sessions which were conducted in capital cities and regional centres provided participants with an opportunity to explore the purpose and potential uses of the Standard workshop style, reflect upon their practice using the Standard as the framework and plan for action in both their local setting and within networks.</p>
<p>As part of the ‘road show’, and in response to the clear advice that was received through the pilots, sessions were also conducted with the ‘leaders of the leaders’. These sessions were intended to build the knowledge base and capability of middle tier leaders and those developing employing system/sector leadership strategies.</p>
<p>As enthusiasm for the Standard grows and as the Standard is progressively adopted across the country, so does the willingness to develop and share resources. AITSL assumed a role for facilitating this sharing nationally, by connecting the profession including through online and other innovative mechanisms.</p>
<p>Resources developed included videos that explain and promote the Standard, scenarios and activities that exemplify the practical uses of the Standard. A repository of research has also been developed that is housed within the School Leadership Development Strategies Clearinghouse.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1741143213485462">5</xref>
</sup> AITSL has developed a flagship program focused on leading empowered schools with the Standard at its core. AITSL has also commissioned development of a 360 degree reflection tool to support practitioners engaging with the Standard to improve their practice.</p>
<p>AITSL has begun planning a comprehensive and innovative evaluation of the impact of the Teacher Standards and later the Principal Standards on individual and collective confidence, capability and motivation with explicit reference to assessing the impact on student learning.</p>
<p>The National [Australian] Professional Standards for Teachers and the National [Australian] Professional Standard for Principals serve two different purposes and are intended for different elements of the workforce. The Principal Standard was specifically designed to be relevant for aspiring, emerging, practising and experienced principals.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, AITSL plans to conduct specific research into and source information about teaching principals and the tensions between the expectations for formal leadership positions.</p>
<p>The reports of the pilot studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1741143213485462">Dinham, 2011</xref>) have not only been made publicly available but have been used in promulgating the Standard through the road show and to guide the development of supporting documentation, professional development and resources.</p>

<sec id="section10-1741143213485462">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Australia now has for the first time a National Professional Standard for Principals. This in itself is a remarkable achievement, given the context and history of Australian education. However ultimately, the Standard is a means and not an end. It will be some time before there is evidence emerging of the impact of the Standard on school leadership, the quality of teaching, and student learning and development in Australian schools. More broadly, it will be fascinating to observe the degree to which the Standard has contributed to a more informed view of the principalship within the profession and wider community and the degree to which the various uses of the Standard have served to attract high calibre people to the key role of principal.</p>
