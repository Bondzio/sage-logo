<p>In <italic>Reinventing the Republic</italic>, Catherine Raissiguier masterfully explores the sans-papiers movement in France from a unique feminist standpoint. The sans-papiers movement is an immigration movement that is rooted in undocumented families that are most vulnerable to the changes in immigration law in France. Based on Raissiguier’s own fieldwork in Paris and Marseilles, she explores how the undocumented women in the sans-papiers movement have built their organization from the ground up and changed the laws that specifically affect them. She also analyses the larger political and cultural context that surrounds French immigration in the public sphere. Similarly, she refutes the post-colonial images used in the media by presenting real stories of the unbelievably courageous sans-papiers. Raissiguier explores the discrimination that they encounter on a daily basis in addition to evaluating various racial stereotypes that exist in French culture. Toward the end, she links racism, homophobia, and sexism in anti-immigration rhetoric and images in an incredibly original manner.</p>
<p>Raissiguier, who is particularly sensitive to her subjects and their families throughout the entire book, brings a feminist perspective to a movement that is just as captivating as her own writing on the matter. She beautifully illustrates the background of French immigration via comics and stories that help the reader to understand the cultural and political climate at the time she did her fieldwork. Overall, the book teaches the reader all about the nuances and issues inherent to the sans-papiers movement. Anyone interested in immigration and social movements will find <italic>Reinventing the Republic</italic> thought-provoking and hard to put down. It will be a perfect teaching companion for teaching students about the intersection of immigration, gender, and citizenship.</p>
