<abstract>
<p><italic>Aim</italic>: Traditionally, the child health services have laid emphasis on first-time mothers. Some researchers have argued that the needs of multiparous mothers must be considered equally important. The aim of this paper was to analyse parity-related characteristics in pairs of mothers and 18-month-old children. <italic>Methods</italic>: The study was population-based and cross-sectional. 586 primiparous mothers and 821 mothers with at least one previous child completed a questionnaire. Additional information was extracted from the child health records by the nurses. Data were collected in 2002–2003 and 2004–2005. <italic>Results</italic>: Compared to multiparous mothers, primiparous mothers had a higher utilization of child health services. Multiparous mothers scored higher on parental incompetence stress and felt that their work load was more demanding. Multiparous mothers reported less social support, particularly in practical respects such as baby-sitting. They considered their interaction with the child as less satisfactory than did primiparous mothers; their children participated less in shared reading and had a more restricted vocabulary. Fewer multiparous mothers assessed their own and their child’s total situation as very good. <bold><italic>Conclusions</italic>: The child health services should develop competence and methods to support multiparous mothers and alleviate their workload when caring for several children.</bold></p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Becoming a mother for the first time is a major life event with long-lasting emotional, practical and social implications. It is not surprising, therefore, that health care systems have generally given priority to first-time mothers.</p>
<p>The Swedish child health services (CHS) are organized in child health centres headed by nurses. The children are followed from 0–5 years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1403494813484397">1</xref>]. The CHS are widely appreciated and used by practically all parents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1403494813484397">2</xref>].</p>
<p>Already several decades ago, the traditional emphasis on almost exclusive support to primiparous mothers began to be questioned [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1403494813484397">3</xref>]. Authors have addressed the need for differentiated services for primiparous and multiparous mothers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1403494813484397">4</xref>].</p>
<sec id="section2-1403494813484397">
<title>Parity and utilization of services</title>
<p>More primiparous mothers are offered home visits by the nurse after childbirth, and are invited to parent groups; they also have a higher participation rate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1403494813484397">2</xref>]. The low frequency of home visits to multiparous mothers may not encourage breastfeeding. In a Danish study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1403494813484397">5</xref>], early postpartum home-visiting was studied in relation to mothers’ duration of breastfeeding. During a period of labour market striking, the nurses offered home visits only after individual risk assessment, instead of visiting all families as before the strike. Comparing the two time periods, the duration of full breastfeeding was shorter in both primi- and multiparous mothers when the home visits failed in the strike period.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1403494813484397">
<title>Parity and aspects of parenting</title>
<p>Primiparous mothers have been found to run a higher risk of <italic>postpartum depression</italic> than multiparous mothers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1403494813484397">6</xref>], but also the opposite [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1403494813484397">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1403494813484397">8</xref>] and about the same risk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1403494813484397">9</xref>].</p>
<p><italic>Parenthood stress</italic> has been reported to correlate with depression and with perceived child difficultness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1403494813484397">10</xref>]. Higher stress levels have been found among mothers with more children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1403494813484397">11</xref>]. A Swedish study of families with 1-year-old children found a significantly higher level of incompetence stress in multiparous than in primiparous mothers, and a similar tendency in role restriction stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1403494813484397">12</xref>]. However, this study suffered from a large drop-out rate. Higher role restriction stress in multiparous mothers has also been reported by Ackland [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1403494813484397">13</xref>].</p>
<p>Work in combination with household and child-caring tasks is a major cause of stress affecting parents’ total work load and leading to conflicting tasks. A comparison of aspects of paid and unpaid activities of male and female white collar workers revealed more work overload, stress and conflict in female than in male respondents; the number of children at home was a contributing factor to stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1403494813484397">14</xref>].</p>
<p><italic>Social support</italic> is favourable in many ways, e.g. in alleviating stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1403494813484397">10</xref>], mitigating punitive maternal attitudes to child rearing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1403494813484397">15</xref>] and influencing maternal satisfaction and interaction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1403494813484397">16</xref>]. Support is both quantitative and qualitative and may be different in content: practical, emotional or purely social. An important factor is the satisfaction experienced by the subject with the support [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1403494813484397">16</xref>].</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1403494813484397">
<title>Parity and child-related factors</title>
<p>A qualitative interview study found that primiparous mothers felt a lack of preparedness and got most information from family and friends, not from healthcare professionals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1403494813484397">17</xref>]. According to the study, the mothers felt overwhelmed, exhausted and isolated. It may therefore be assumed that they perceived more common problems with the child, e.g. concerning feeding and sleeping.</p>
<p>It has been difficult to find any relevant literature about possible correlations between parity and perceived <italic>child temperament and behaviour</italic>. Ackland [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1403494813484397">13</xref>] found no significant differences in ratings of child temperament between mothers of first-born and later-born children.</p>
<p>According to a Norwegian study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1403494813484397">18</xref>], first-time parents found their family dynamics more positive than did second-time parents. Primiparous mothers may have more time for interaction with their children. Parents have been found to read more with their first-born children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1403494813484397">19</xref>], and first-born children have been described as having a more advanced language than later-born children at the age of 18 months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1403494813484397">20</xref>]. The same associations have been identified in a previous paper from the present project [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1403494813484397">21</xref>]. The reason why we report these finding again is that in the former study our focus was on reading and language, whereas here it is on parity and mothers’ possibilities to stimulate their children.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1403494813484397">
<title>Aim</title>
<p>The aim of this study was to explore differences in utilization of child health services, aspects of parenting and some child-related factors between primiparous and multiparous mothers with about 18-month-old children.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1403494813484397" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>The study was cross-sectional. Our data were collected from a comprehensive Swedish intervention study with the aim to test new psychosocial methods for the child health centres. The intervention will not be described in the present paper [for details, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1403494813484397">22</xref>].</p>
<p>Since practically all parents avail themselves of the child health services, the study can be considered population-based. Eighteen child health centres in the county of Uppsala and 18 centres from five other counties were included in the study.</p>
<p>There were two waves of measurements on two different cohorts. Each cohort included both first-born and later-born children. The children were born September 2000–August 2001 and April 2003–March 2004. The child health nurses distributed questionnaires with prepaid envelopes to the mothers when the children came for their 18-month check-up. In order to eliminate possible influences from the intervention, all intervention children were excluded from the present study. Data were collected in the years 2002–2003 and 2004–2005. Twins and triplets were excluded.</p>
<p>There were 2291 eligible children. After exclusion of 189 children who moved out of the area before their 18-month check-up and 179 children of mothers who declined or were not asked to participate, 1923 children remained. The questionnaire was completed by mothers of 1493 children. After exclusion of 86 questionnaires with discrepant information as to parity and number of siblings, the final study sample consisted of 1407 children with questionnaires (73.2%). The nurses complemented the questionnaires with data from health records which were available for 1405 of the children.</p>
<sec id="section7-1403494813484397">
<title>Independent variables</title>
<p><italic>Parity</italic> (first-born yes/no) and the child’s <italic>gender</italic> were extracted from the questionnaire and the CHC record. The following were taken from the questionnaire: <italic>mother’s year of birth</italic> (age was dichotomized by the median into younger (18–32 years) and older (33–48 years); <italic>mother’s country of birth</italic> (Sweden/other); <italic>mother’s education: college or university; mother’s education: elementary or less; mother’s marital status</italic> (single/married or cohabiting); <italic>mother’s contact with a social worker during the last 12 months</italic> (e.g. for financial support) (no/yes).

<title>Parenthood stress (questionnaire)</title>
<p>Mean scores from the Swedish Parenthood Stress Questionnaire [SPSQ; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1403494813484397">10</xref>]. The SPSQ gives one total score and five sub-scores. The subscales are: Social isolation, Role restriction (giving up one’s own interests to meet the child’s needs), Incompetence, Spouse problems, and Health problems.

<p>Mean score from the Child difficultness scale by Bates et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1403494813484397">25</xref>]. The scale consists of nine items asking the mother to compare her child with an “average” child. The contents address fussiness, easiness to calm the child, irritability, temper, etc., with score 1 representing low difficultness, 7 high difficultness, and 4 “about average”.

<p>The SAS package, version 9.3 for personal computers, was used [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1403494813484397">28</xref>]. Crude differences between the two parity groups were tested for significance with the <italic>X</italic><sup>2</sup> test (percentages) and Student’s <italic>t</italic> test (means). <italic>P</italic> values below .05 were considered significant. All observations with missing values were excluded from the relevant computations.</p>
<p>Multiple logistic regressions with dichotomized variables were performed to control for possible confounders: maternal age, low maternal education, contact with a social worker, marital status (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1403494813484397">Table I</xref>). All scale variables were dichotomized into low/high by the medians. Example: number of nurse visits above the median (&gt;15) was coded 1, number below or equal to the median (≤15) was coded 0. Dichotomizations were required to have the results expressed as odds ratios.</p>

<title>Utilization of services</title>
<p>First-time mothers received more attention from the child health services than multiparous mothers. They made more visits to the nurse and received more home visits. They were invited to parent groups to a larger extent and participated more. Even among those invited by the nurse to a parent group, more primiparous than multiparous mothers accepted the invitation (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1403494813484397">Table II</xref>).</p>

<title>Aspects of parenting</title>
<p>Differences in parenting variables are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1403494813484397">Table III</xref>. As appears from the table, some originally significant differences were not significant according to the logistic regression. This was particularly the case for parenthood stress. Most significant differences were in favour of first-time mothers, that is, incompetence stress (and an adjusted tendency for role restriction), work load, social support (particularly practical) and mother’s perception of her total situation. The only exception was postpartum sadness, which was recalled less frequently by multiparous mothers.</p>
<p>In many respects, first-time mothers reported better social support than mothers with more than one child (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1403494813484397">Table IV</xref>). In particular, primiparous mothers had more access to practical help from baby-sitters and grandparents and were more satisfied in these respects. They also had more people to turn to for support if they felt “really angry or irritated”.</p>

<title>Child-related factors</title>
<p>With the exception of sleep and feeding problems, the children of first-time mothers were in an equal or better position than children of multiparous mothers (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-1403494813484397">Table V</xref>). The significant difference as to food refusal in favour of multiparous mothers diminished to just a tendency in the logistic regression analysis. First-time mothers rated their interaction with the children as better than did multiparous mothers, and they engaged their children in shared reading more frequently. Their children had a more extended expressive vocabulary, and the general situation of these children was rated as better, on average. There were no significant differences in perceived difficultness of the child.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>

<title>Study limitations</title>
<p>This study took place between 2000 and 2005, and the stability of the results over time may be questioned. However, our results can be assumed to be still contemporarily relevant. During later years, the services for multiparous mothers have become even more restricted than about a decade ago. The general trend in Sweden is shown in Annual Report Uppsala [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1403494813484397">29</xref>]. This means that the differences in utilization are increasing. Since our study was cross-sectional, no causal inferences can be drawn. Our findings about postpartum sadness may suffer from some recall bias, since the mothers were asked this question about 18 months after childbirth.</p>
<p>Our dichotomization into primiparous and multiparous mothers did not catch the possibility that most of the differences may have been accounted for by mothers with three or more children. The reason for not dividing the sample further was that we wanted reasonably large groups for the analyses. Only 23% had three or more children. However, the situation of mothers with several children is well worth of study.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section23-1403494813484397">
<title>Main findings</title>
<p>Our central finding was that mothers with two or more children had a much tougher life situation, in several respects, than first-time mothers. The work load of multiparous mothers was heavier than that of first-time mothers, and they felt more stressed due to perceived incompetence. This latter finding may sound surprising since experienced mothers could be expected to feel less incompetent than first-time mothers. As a matter of fact, they did not, possibly because of the heavier workload associated with having more than one child. Maybe they felt that they were able to stimulate the first child in various activities, but had less time to do the same when they had more than one. Furthermore, there was a tendency for multiparous mothers to feel more stress due to role restriction than primiparous mothers. Interestingly, we found the same association between multiparity and higher stress as other authors, who reported a significant difference between multiparous and primiparous mothers in incompetence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1403494813484397">12</xref>] and role restriction stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1403494813484397">12</xref> tendency, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1403494813484397">13</xref>].</p>
<p>The Swedish gender equality system seemed to be rather well established among the parents. Only a minority of mothers considered the child’s father as not being helpful with the child, and there was no parity-related difference. However, multiparous mothers had access to less social support in the form of baby-sitters and helpful grandparents than first-time mothers. They were also less satisfied with their possibilities to find support when they felt angry or upset. These findings point to the vulnerability of mothers with several children having to struggle for themselves in emotionally-trying situations. Our results are parallel to reports by Östberg [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1403494813484397">10</xref>] and Lavee et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1403494813484397">11</xref>].</p>
<p>There was one exception to the general picture, namely that more first-time mothers reported having felt sad after childbirth. Our study thus supported the findings of Glavin et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1403494813484397">6</xref>]. However, others have found more depression in multiparous mothers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1403494813484397">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1403494813484397">8</xref>], and parity-related differences in the development of adjustment problems over time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1403494813484397">30</xref>]. Our results mainly caught the first postpartum period, but the CHC professionals should be aware of the risk for depression in multiparous mothers and later than closely after childbirth.</p>
<p>First-time mothers reported a better interaction with their children, they involved their children in reading to a greater extent, and their children’s expressive vocabulary was larger. The fact that fewer multiparous mothers assessed their own and their children’s total situation as very good was a sad finding.</p>
<p>In view of the difficulties encountered by multiparous mothers, it could be expected that the child health services would give particular attention to these mothers. This was not the case. As we have reported, more services in terms of office visits, home visits and parent groups were offered to primiparous mothers. Thus the child health services still seem to adhere to the model of giving priority to first-time mothers. They have not followed the recommendations of Norr et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1403494813484397">3</xref>] to revise their traditional priorities and also look to the needs of mothers with more than one child.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section24-1403494813484397">
<title>Implications</title>
<p>Many studies concentrate on primiparous mothers and the unique situation to build a family, but for multiparous mothers, it is also a unique situation to incorporate a new baby into an existing family system.</p>
<p>We believe that one crucial point is lack of time. The fact is that mothers with several children really do have less time compared to primiparous mothers. Their lives are full of conflicting demands from the home and the labour market.</p>
<p>In Sweden, the parental assurance comprises a total of 480 days with 80% of the parent’s income up to a certain level. Both parents can stay home together for 30 days. Parents should be encouraged to avail themselves of these days, which would give them opportunities to concentrate on one child at a time.</p>
<p>The child health services could provide opportunities for parents to meet other parents and share their experiences. More services should be offered to families with more than one child in terms of parent groups, office visits and home visits. Home visits are important to get to know the family, build a working relationship, and may even affect the duration of breastfeeding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1403494813484397">5</xref>].</p>
<p>It is a challenge of considerable public health relevance for the CHC professionals to develop effective methods to meet the needs of all parents, first-time and experienced alike.</p>
