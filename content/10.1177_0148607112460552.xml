<p><italic>Background</italic>: Although home parenteral nutrition (HPN) is often indicated in cancer patients, many physicians are concerned about the risks potentially associated with the use of central venous access devices (VADs) in these patients. The aim of this prospective study was to investigate the actual incidence of VAD-related complications in cancer patients on HPN. <italic>Methods</italic>: All adult cancer patient candidates for VAD insertion and HPN were enrolled. The incidence of complications associated with 4 types of VADs (peripherally inserted central catheter [PICC], Hohn catheter, tunneled Groshong catheter, and port) was investigated, as well as the most significant risk factors. <italic>Results</italic>: Two hundred eighty-nine VADs in 254 patients were studied, for a total of 51,308 catheter-days. The incidence of catheter-related bloodstream infections (CRBSIs) was low (0.35/1000 catheter-days), particularly for PICCs (0/1000; <italic>P</italic> &lt; .01 vs Hohn and tunneled catheters) and for ports (0.19/1000; <italic>P</italic> &lt; .01 vs Hohn and <italic>P</italic> &lt; .05 vs tunneled catheters). Mechanical complications were uncommon (0.8/1000), as was VAD-related venous thrombosis (0.06/1000). Ultrasound-guided venipuncture was associated with a decreased risk of CRBSI (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .04) and thrombosis (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .001). VAD securement using sutureless devices reduced the risk of CRBSI and dislocation (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .001). Hohn catheters had no advantage over PICCs (higher complication rate and shorter dwell time; <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001). <italic>Conclusions</italic>: In cancer patients, HPN can be safely carried out with a low incidence of complications. Also, VADs are not equal in terms of complication rates, and strict adherence to meticulous insertion policies may effectively reduce catheter-related complications.</p>

<title>Clinical Relevancy Statement</title>
<p>Physicians are concerned about the risks potentially associated with the use of central venous access devices (VADs) in cancer patients requiring home parenteral nutrition (HPN). This study demonstrated that when optimally managed, HPN can be safely carried out in cancer patients, even in an advanced stage, with a low incidence of catheter-related complications (CRCs). The main finding of this study was that different VADs performed differently in terms of dwell time and incidence of CRCs. These findings are clinically relevant for guiding physicians in the proper choice of VAD and an insertion technique that can reduce the risk of CRCs and prolong the life of the device.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>In cancer patients, malnutrition is common<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0148607112460552">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0148607112460552"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0148607112460552">3</xref></sup> and is associated with reduced quality of life (QoL), increased incidence of complications, decreased efficacy of treatment, and reduced life expectancy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0148607112460552">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0148607112460552"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0148607112460552">6</xref></sup> Thus, nutrition support should always be considered, since—if started early—it may limit muscle loss, enhance patient activity improving the QoL, and reduce some treatment-related adverse reactions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0148607112460552">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0148607112460552"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0148607112460552"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0148607112460552"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0148607112460552"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0148607112460552"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0148607112460552"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0148607112460552"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0148607112460552">15</xref></sup> According to the current guidelines, home parenteral nutrition (HPN) is indicated in patients receiving anticancer treatments who are malnourished and/or are unable to ingest or absorb adequate nutrients due to a proven gastrointestinal (GI) tract failure.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0148607112460552">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0148607112460552">17</xref></sup> Patients with incurable cancer who are candidates for HPN have inadequate or no oral intake due to partial or complete obstruction of the GI tract, usually owing to peritoneal carcinomatosis or intra-abdominal recurrences.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0148607112460552">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0148607112460552">17</xref></sup> Although administration of parenteral nutrition (PN) delivers nutrients to the cancer cells, there is no evidence that this has harmful effects on the survival. This theoretical consideration should therefore have no influence on the choice to nourish an oncologic patient when contemplating the use of PN.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0148607112460552">16</xref></sup></p>
<p>A major concern in starting HPN is the high rate of catheter-related complications (CRCs) described in the literature, particularly with regard to catheter-related blood stream infections (CRBSIs). CRBSIs carry a high burden in terms of costs, morbidity, and mortality.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0148607112460552">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0148607112460552">19</xref></sup> The described CRC rates in overall HPN patients are between 0.94 and 5.56/1000 catheter-days, whereas CRBSIs range between 0.6 and 5.36/1000 catheter-days.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0148607112460552">20</xref></sup> These rates may be even higher in the neutropenic oncologic patient population.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0148607112460552">21</xref></sup> Prevention of the most common CRCs (ie, infection, malfunction, and thrombosis) requires strict adherence to well-known evidence-based protocols. Recent studies have described many relevant but less recognized potential risk factors for CRCs, such as choice of an inappropriate VAD, “blind” venipuncture, infraclavicular puncture of the subclavian vein, or use of sutures for securing the catheter.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0148607112460552">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0148607112460552">23</xref></sup> In the past decade, many technological innovations have significantly increased the safety of VADs (ultrasound-guided venipuncture, new biomaterials, peripheral insertion of central VADs, sutureless devices for securing the catheter, etc), whereas new strategies have successfully minimized the risk of infection (standardized “bundles” of evidence-based interventions, strict policies of hand washing, education of healthcare operators, use of appropriate skin antisepsis, etc).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0148607112460552">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0148607112460552">25</xref></sup></p>
<p>The aim of this study was to investigate the actual risk of CRCs in cancer patients on HPN and the incidence of such complications in relation to the type of VAD, as well as to the most significant risk factors.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<sec id="section4-0148607112460552">
<title>Study Design</title>
<p>Our study was a prospective, observational, single-center study carried out from June 1, 2008, through November 30, 2009, by the Division of Clinical Nutrition of a 1200-bed university hospital (Turin, Italy). The Ethics Committee approved our study protocol and required a written informed consent from each patient.</p>
<p>All adult cancer patients who were candidates for HPN and who had a medium- or long-term central VAD inserted during the study period were consecutively enrolled. Follow-up continued until the VAD was removed. Some of the patients who inserted a VAD during the study period had a history of a previous VAD inserted and removed before being enrolled in this study; these patients were included, but the previous VAD was considered as a potential risk factor for complications.</p>
<p>To avoid any potential impact on the choices and the behaviors of the healthcare professionals, all physicians, nurses, and dietitians directly involved in the care of the patients were not informed that the authors were collecting data for this observational study.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0148607112460552">
<title>VAD Insertion</title>
<p>Four types of central VADs were used: (1) 4 Fr single-lumen silicone peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs) with valved tip (Groshong PICC; Bard Access Systems, Salt Lake City, UT), (2) 5.5 Fr single-lumen silicone nontunneled catheters (Hohn catheter; Bard Access Systems), (3) 7 and 8 Fr single-lumen silicone cuffed/tunneled catheters with valved tip (tunneled Groshong catheter; Bard Access Systems), and (4) totally implanted, centrally inserted venous ports (standard and low-profile titanium reservoirs, connected to silicone catheters of different calibers [6.5–8 Fr] from different manufacturers: B. Braun [Melsungen, Germany], Smiths Medical [London, UK], and Bard Access Systems). These 4 types of VADs are considered medium-term or long-term catheters and thus appropriate for extra-hospital use (such as HPN), according to most recent guidelines and reviews in this field.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0148607112460552">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0148607112460552">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0148607112460552">25</xref></sup></p>
<p>PICCs were inserted exclusively via ultrasound-guided venipuncture of the brachial veins or the basilic vein at upper midarm by specifically trained nurses and surgeons. Hohn catheters, tunneled Groshong catheters, and ports were inserted either via ultrasound-guided venipuncture of the internal jugular, brachiocephalic, subclavian, or axillary vein or via blind venipuncture of the internal jugular or subclavian vein by specifically trained anesthesiologists and surgeons. The choice of the type of VAD in each patient was largely based on the provider’s preference, since at the time of this study, there was no official hospital policy or recommendation in this regard. All VADs were inserted with maximal barrier precautions and skin antisepsis with 2% chlorhexidine. The appropriate central position of the tip of the catheter (ie, close to the cavoatrial junction) was consistently verified, either by fluoroscopy during the procedure or by chest X-ray after the procedure. According to current guidelines,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0148607112460552">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0148607112460552">27</xref></sup> routine pharmacological prophylaxis of VAD-related venous thrombosis was not adopted.</p>

<sec id="section6-0148607112460552">
<title>HPN Policies</title>
<p>According to our regional policy, an oncologic patient should receive HPN when meeting all the following criteria: proven failure to meet nutrition requirements by the oral or enteral route, with impending risk of death due to malnutrition; life expectancy more than 2 months; Karnofsky performance status ≥50; control or absence of pain; absence of severe organ dysfunctions; written informed consent confirming that the patient will accept this modality of nutrition support; approval by the physician responsible for HPN, by the oncologist, and by the general practitioner; presence of environmental conditions compatible with HPN; availability of a dedicated in-home caregiver; and availability of a nursing team dedicated to the patient home care, as provided by the Regional Public Health Service.</p>
<p>The initial assessment of the patient was made by the physician responsible for HPN and by the dietitian, in a hospital setting. In all patients, HPN was carried out by specifically trained nurses, according to the recommendations of the international guidelines.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0148607112460552">28</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0148607112460552"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0148607112460552"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0148607112460552">31</xref></sup> A strict policy of hand washing and environmental hygiene was observed. Appropriate asepsis when preparing or adding preparations to the PN bag; a strict policy for flushing all VADs with normal saline before and after use, with the pulsating “push/pause” plus positive pressure method<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0148607112460552">31</xref></sup>; and the use of transparent dressings were adopted. PN was delivered on a 12- to 14-hour per day basis (preferentially during nighttime).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0148607112460552">
<title>Patient Follow-up</title>
<p>The occurrence of CRCs was closely monitored by the physician responsible for HPN through regularly scheduled and structured telephone interviews (at least every 15 days), in-hospital medical examinations (at least every month), and home visits by specifically trained nurses (initially every day for 2–3 weeks and at least every 7 days thereafter). Diagnosis of local infection and of CRBSI was carried out according to the guidelines issued by EPIC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0148607112460552">28</xref></sup> and Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America (SHEA)/Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0148607112460552">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0148607112460552">32</xref></sup> Management of CRBSI (by removal and/or systemic antibiotic treatment and/or antibiotic lock) followed closely the IDSA guidelines.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0148607112460552">32</xref></sup> Catheter-related venous thrombosis (either central, affecting veins distal to the infraclavicular tract of the axillary vein, or peripheral, affecting the deep veins of the midarm) was diagnosed and treated according to the guidelines issued by European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism (ESPEN),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0148607112460552">25</xref></sup> Gli Accessi Venosi Centrali a Lungo Termine (GAVeCeLT)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0148607112460552">26</xref></sup> and Standards, Options, and Recommendations (SOR)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0148607112460552">27</xref></sup>; only symptomatic thrombosis was considered (ie, local pain, edema, and signs suggesting thrombosis, later confirmed by ultrasound examination). Mechanical complications were managed according to current guidelines<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0148607112460552">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0148607112460552">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0148607112460552">31</xref></sup>: rupture of the external part of Groshong catheters was managed by direct repair, using the manufacturer’s repair kit; partial dislocation of PICC or Hohn was managed securing the catheter in the new position or removing the VAD; and partial or complete lumen occlusion—defined as persistent difficulty in withdrawing blood and/or infusing intravenous (IV) fluids—was managed by flushing/pumping with saline or by infusing either 10,000 U/mL urokinasis (for occlusion due to clots) or 50%–70% ethanol (for occlusion due to lipid aggregates). Causes of removal due to CRC included local infection; CRBSI with indication for VAD removal because of failure of or contraindication to conservative treatment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0148607112460552">32</xref></sup>; VAD-related venous thrombosis associated with catheter malfunction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0148607112460552">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0148607112460552">27</xref></sup>; rupture of the external segment of the catheter, if impossible to repair; complete or partial (&gt;4 cm) dislocation of nontunneled VADs; dislocation of tunneled catheters due to expulsion of the cuff from the tunnel; and lumen occlusion resistant to clearance techniques/treatments.</p>

<sec id="section8-0148607112460552">
<title>Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>Patient/VAD characteristics were presented as median (range). The duration of VADs was compared using the Kruskal-Wallis test, followed by the Dunn posttest. The rates of local infection and CRBSI were expressed per 1000 catheter-days and per 1000 HPN-days; all other complications were expressed as a percentage of total VADs. Complications rates were compared using Fisher exact or χ<sup>2</sup> tests adjusted for catheter-days. Ninety-five percent confidence intervals (95% CIs) were calculated using the Poisson distribution. Complication rates were also calculated after stratification for different patient or VAD characteristics. In the case of univariate Poisson regression analysis, variables potentially associated with an effect on complications (characteristics of the patient, type of VAD, use during HPN, history of previous VADs, use of ultrasound guidance, insertion site, technique of securing the catheter, location of the exit site, location of the cuff in the tunnel at the time of insertion) were considered independent variables. The crude and adjusted incidence rate ratios (IRRs) were calculated exponentiating the estimated parameters of the Poisson models. The covariates achieving statistical significance in the univariate analysis test were entered into the multivariate analysis. The level of significance was defined as a <italic>P</italic> value &lt;.05. All analyses were carried out using SPSS 17.0 (SPSS, Inc, an IBM Company, Chicago, IL).</p>

<title>Patients</title>
<p>Two hundred fifty-four cancer patients were consecutively enrolled in this study: all were followed up until VAD was removed or the patient deceased. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0148607112460552">Table 1</xref> shows the main characteristics of patients. Our population included patients with advanced disease (78% were stage IV according to TNM), although almost half had a Karnofsky performance status ≥70 and were still receiving chemotherapy or chemoradiation therapy. In this study population, incurable patients were candidates for HPN because of peritoneal carcinomatosis (47%), intra-abdominal recurrences (43%), and, less frequently, short bowel syndrome or high-output ileostomy or fistulas (10%). Some patients (22%) had a history of a previous VAD, which had been used—in half of the cases—for both chemotherapy and HPN (median dwell time: 112 days). PN was delivered (daily, in the vast majority of patients) using standard industrially assembled “all-in-one” bags in 95% and personalized bags in 5%. HPN was suspended in most cases because of worsening clinical state or death, but in 16%, it had been suspended because adequate nutrition intake by the enteral or oral route meeting had been restored.</p>

<title>VADs</title>
<p>Two hundred eighty-nine VADs (ie, 65 Groshong PICCs, 107 Hohn catheters, 45 tunneled Groshong catheters, and 72 ports) were studied, for a total of 51,308 catheter-days. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0148607112460552">Table 2</xref> summarizes relevant information related to the 4 types of VADs and the potential risk factors for infectious and noninfectious complications. Comparing the groups of patients with different VADs, we found no significant difference in terms of patients’ characteristics potentially associated with an increased risk of CRCs. The overall median duration of VADs was 4 months, although Hohn catheters had shorter dwell time than ports, PICCs, and tunneled catheters (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .001, <italic>P</italic> &lt; .01, and <italic>P</italic> &lt; .05, respectively). All the VADs placed in this study were used for HPN. No patient had multiple VADs or multilumen VADs. In those patients who were receiving HPN and chemotherapy, the VAD was used for both but never at the same time.</p>

<title>Catheter-Related Complications</title>
<p>In our study, none of the patients’ characteristics posed a significant risk for complications. The only relevant insertion-related complication was 1 pneumothorax after blind venipuncture of the subclavian vein while inserting a Hohn catheter.</p>
<p>Infectious complications and their risk factors are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0148607112460552">Table 3</xref>. The incidence of CRBSIs was low (0.35/1000 catheter-days for all VADs), particularly for PICCs (0/1000; <italic>P</italic> &lt; .01 vs Hohn and tunneled catheters) and for ports (0.19/1000; <italic>P</italic> &lt; .01 vs Hohn and <italic>P</italic> &lt; .05 vs tunneled catheters). In 18 episodes of CRBSI, both Gram-positive and Gram-negative organisms, but no fungi, were isolated (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0148607112460552">Table 4</xref>). There was no correlation between organism species and type of VAD. All CRBSIs were treated with at least 10–14 days of systemic antibiotic therapy, plus antibiotic lock therapy when recommended by IDSA guidelines.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0148607112460552">32</xref></sup> In 11 cases of CRBSI, the VAD was removed; in 7 cases, CRBSI subsided by antibiotic therapy only, with the bacterial clearance being documented by negative blood cultures and disappearance of systemic signs of infection. Because of CRBSI, 7 patients required hospitalization. Total hospital days due to CRBSIs were 108, corresponding to 3.6 days per 1000 HPN-days. There was 1 fatal episode of CRBSI (0.4%) due to methicillin-resistant <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> (MRSA) bacteremia from an infected Hohn catheter in a 69-year-old patient with an advanced hematologic malignancy. The incidence of CRBSIs was higher in those patients with a tunneled catheter or with a port who had had previous VADs (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .05). After VAD insertion, the probability of CRBSI was time dependent: CRBSIs tended to occur earlier for Hohn and tunneled catheters as compared with ports (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .002 and <italic>P</italic> &lt; .04, respectively) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0148607112460552">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

No evident cases of “pinch-off” syndrome were observed. Most lumen occlusions were successfully treated; a few cases of occlusion resistant to clearance techniques/ treatments required the removal of the VAD, after ruling out—by ultrasound examination—the possible presence of asymptomatic thrombosis. No correlation was found between lumen occlusion and VAD infection or thrombosis. VAD-related symptomatic thrombosis was rare (1%, 0.06/1000).</p>

Overall, VADs were removed because of complications only in 16% of cases (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-0148607112460552">Table 6</xref>). Hohn catheters had a higher occurrence of CRCs vs PICCs and ports (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .001 for both) and vs tunneled catheters (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .05), as well as a higher rate of removal because of complications vs ports and PICCs (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .001 and <italic>P</italic> &lt; .05, respectively). Some patients (12%) had a VAD—placed during the study period—that was used for chemotherapy before being used for HPN (median dwell time before use for HPN: 21 days), although this event did not significantly affect the risk of infectious complications.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>To the best of our knowledge, this is the first prospective study investigating the rate of CRCs in a vast population of cancer patients on HPN, comparing different types of VADs. If compared with previous studies in this field,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0148607112460552">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0148607112460552">33</xref></sup> our study has many original features: (1) data were collected through a clinical study and not from a questionnaire, (2) it was a prospective study, (3) only cancer patients were enrolled, (4) half of the enrolled patients were receiving active anticancer therapy during the course of the study, (5) the study was concluded in only 18 months, and (6) no patient was lost at follow-up. These features of the study design were possible because our Division of Clinical Nutrition is Italy’s largest center for HPN in cancer patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0148607112460552">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0148607112460552">35</xref></sup></p>
<p>HPN may be indicated both in the malnourished patient receiving chemotherapy and even in some patients in advanced stage of the disease, within the limits established by the current guidelines.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0148607112460552">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0148607112460552">17</xref></sup> In our study, the majority of patients had advanced disease: in 84% of cases, HPN was discontinued for worsening clinical conditions or death. As expected, the more favorable response to HPN (prolonged survival) occurred in those patients with less severe clinical conditions (Karnofsky score ≥70, patients receiving chemotherapy or chemoradiation therapy, stage II or III according to TNM, and absence of liver or lung metastases).</p>
<p>As previously described,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0148607112460552">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0148607112460552">36</xref></sup> this study demonstrated a positive correlation between HPN and occurrence of CRCs, although in our population of cancer patients, all types of VADs were associated with a low acceptable incidence of CRCs. At the same time, the main finding of this study was that different VADs had different performances in terms of dwell time and risk of complications.</p>
<sec id="section14-0148607112460552">
<title>PICCs</title>
<p>In the outpatient setting, PICCs are usually considered a medium-term VAD (ie, appropriate for 3–4 months of IV treatment).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0148607112460552">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0148607112460552">25</xref></sup> In our study, the median duration of PICCs was more than 5 months, with 62% of PICCs lasting more than 90 days and a few reaching 18–20 months. PICCs had a particularly low incidence of mechanical complications and, interestingly, no episodes of catheter-related thrombosis or of CRBSI. The risk of CRBSI for PICCs is usually considered to be lower than 1 episode/1000 catheter-days in the outpatient setting.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0148607112460552">19</xref></sup> A previous experience in a community-based medical center—adopting a specific “bundle” for infection prevention—has reported an incidence of 0 episodes/1000 catheter-days for a period of 15 months.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0148607112460552">37</xref></sup> It is noteworthy that in the latter study, as in our investigation, all PICCs were inserted at the upper midarm by ultrasound-guided venipuncture and secured to the skin by a sutureless device. All PICCs used in our study were silicone Groshong PICCs, which might explain the occurrence of dislocation and external rupture, as these complications are more likely to occur with silicone than with polyurethane PICCs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0148607112460552">38</xref></sup> In 2 recent studies,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0148607112460552">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0148607112460552">40</xref></sup> asymptomatic and symptomatic thrombosis have been described as not uncommon in PICCs used in the intensive care setting. However, the absence of symptomatic PICC-related thrombosis may be explained by the different setting (home care vs intensive care), by the consistent use of ultrasound guidance (with careful choice of the vein of an appropriate diameter), and by the consistent use of sutureless devices. Our study was not designed to investigate the incidence of asymptomatic thrombosis. In HPN, symptomatic catheter-related thrombosis is uncommon; European guidelines have reported in the HPN population an incidence of 0.05 episodes per catheter year.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0148607112460552">17</xref></sup></p>

<sec id="section15-0148607112460552">
<title>Hohn Catheters</title>
<p>In our study, the performance of Hohn catheters was relatively disappointing. Most Hohn catheters did not last more than 3 months, and 26% were removed because of complications; moreover, they had a significantly higher rate of CRBSIs vs PICCs and ports. The occurrence of CRBSIs was significantly correlated with blind insertion (more specifically with the blind insertion by infraclavicular puncture of the subclavian vein), as well as with the use of suture for securing the catheter. Symptomatic catheter-related venous thrombosis occurred only with this type of VAD. Moreover, Hohn catheters had a significantly higher rate of catheter dislocation as compared with other VADs in our study. The significantly higher incidence of complications in Hohn catheters may be explained not only by the specific features of the device (soft, fragile nontunneled catheter, secured to the infraclavicular or supraclavicular area) but also by the fact that most Hohn catheters were inserted without ultrasound guidance and sutured to the skin. In particular, there was a significant correlation between blind insertion and occurrence of thrombosis, as well as between use of suture and dislocation. Insertion on the left side was also a significant risk factor for thrombosis in these VADs.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section16-0148607112460552">
<title>Tunneled Groshong Catheters</title>
<p>Tunneled Groshong catheters, as compared with Groshong PICCs, were characterized not only by a similar dwell time and a similar incidence of mechanical complications but also by a significantly higher occurrence of CRBSIs. In our study, the presence of a cuff inappropriately close to the exit site (&lt;2 cm) was associated with a significantly higher incidence of CRBSIs and of catheter dislocation. Considering the higher cost of the tunneled Groshong catheter as compared with Groshong PICCs, the cost-effectiveness of the latter was relevant.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section17-0148607112460552">
<title>Ports</title>
<p>As expected, the median duration of totally implanted ports was quite high, and they were removed because of complications only in a few cases. The only relevant mechanical complication was occlusion, which is not surprising considering that they were infused with parenteral emulsions containing lipids; however, all occlusions were successfully treated by conservative treatment. The occurrence of CRBSIs was very low (0.19/1000), as already reported in the literature,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0148607112460552">19</xref></sup> but it must be stressed that ports were used for HPN only for 8800 catheter-days out of 21,600.</p>
<p>The skill and the experience of our home care teams played a pivotal role in the low incidence of CRCs. Since the institution of the HPN service in 2000, in our region, the quality of care has been guaranteed by a wide strategy of interventions, including well-defined management protocols, training programs, informative fliers for patient/caregivers, and an organized system for supplying the materials necessary for HPN directly to the patient’s home at the expense of the Public Health Service. Also, a tight and daily collaboration between the Divisions of Oncology and Clinical Nutrition has played a relevant role in improving the choice of VAD and more generally the management of cancer patients receiving HPN.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section18-0148607112460552">
<title>Limitations of the Study</title>
<p>First, this was a single-center study. Second, differences in the PN formulas or cancer treatments among the VAD types might have played a role in the outcomes. Also, our conclusions are applicable only to cancer patients receiving HPN and are not necessarily applicable to other HPN patients (such as patients requiring HPN for benign disease and for longer periods of time). Finally, being an observational study, there was no randomization of patients to the different VAD groups, although the characteristics of patients in the different VAD groups turned out to be not statistically different.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Although our study has some limitations, on the basis of these data, we may conclude as follows:</p>
<list id="list1-0148607112460552" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>If accurately managed, HPN can be safely provided for most cancer patients, even in an advanced stage, without expecting a relevant incidence of CRCs.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>When comparing the different VADs used in our setting, it appears that Hohn catheters had no advantage as compared with PICCs (higher incidence of complications and shorter dwell time). Also, tunneled Groshong catheters seem to be less cost-effective than Groshong PICCs (similar dwell time but higher incidence of CRBSIs).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Our data suggest that a proper choice of the VAD and a proper technique of insertion are of relevant importance in reducing the risk of CRCs and prolonging the life of the device. In particular, (a) the choice of a PICC or of a port is associated with a low risk of CRBSI and a low risk of removal of the device because of complications; (b) in Hohn catheters, ultrasound-guided venipuncture is associated with a decreased risk of CRBSI and of catheter-related thrombosis; (c) in Hohn catheters, securement using a sutureless device reduces the risk of CRBSI and of dislocation; and (d) in tunneled Groshong catheters, a proper technique of placement of the cuff (ie, at least 2 cm from the exit site) reduces the risk of CRBSI as well as the risk of dislocation.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>In conclusion, an appropriate choice of the VAD, an adequate insertion technique, and proper home care of the VAD may yield minimal CRCs, which is necessary to optimize the risk/benefit ratio of HPN in cancer patients.</p>
