The hypothesis that CSC activated focal adhesion kinase (FAK), mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), and paxillin in BEAS-2B cells was tested. When BEAS-2B cells were treated with 20 to 100 μg/mL CSC for 1 hour, FAK increased. The CSC caused F-actin disruption, while FAK inhibition alone caused actin aggregates to collapse to the cell periphery, but FAK inhibition combined with CSC caused actin aggregates to distribute throughout the cells. The CSC treatment of BEAS-2B cells showed a dose-dependent increase in the activation of the MAPKs, c-Jun, JNK, ERK, p38, and heat shock protein 27 (Hsp27) and paxillin. Focal adhesion kinase phosphorylation inhibition combined with CSC treatment increased p38 and ERK at 1 hour and 24 hours along with decreased cell number and motility compared with CSC treatment alone. CSC exerts changes in BEAS-2B cells by altering morphology and activating MAPK pathways.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>focal adhesion kinase</kwd><kwd>paxillin</kwd><kwd>human bronchial cells</kwd><kwd>F-actin</kwd><kwd>MAPKs</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="section1-1091581812440890"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cigarette smoke condensate (CSC) alters normal cellular structure, thereby altering cell function through alterations in cell signaling pathways.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1091581812440890">1</xref></sup> F-actin is a key cytoskeletal component that functions as a cellular sensor with reorganization and alterations in actin dynamics being a well-known consequence of signaling.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1091581812440890">2</xref></sup> Cigarette smoke exposure of BEAS-2B human lung epithelial cells caused actin filaments to collapse into punctate actin spots sometimes located in the perinuclear area concurrent with increased cell attachment and decreased cell migration.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1091581812440890">1</xref></sup> Tyrosine phosphorylation of the focal adhesion protein focal adhesion kinase (FAK) regulates actin polymerization and thereby cell function.

Briefly, smoke was drawn through a Cambridge filter pad. The Cambridge pad was extracted with dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO; Sigma, St Louis, Missouri) to give a final total particulate matter concentration of 40 mg/mL (w/v) of CSC. Aliquots of extracted condensate were stored frozen at −70°C until use.</p></sec><sec id="section5-1091581812440890"><title>Treatment With CSC and F-Actin Staining</title><p>BEAS-2B cells were plated onto Biocoat collagen I coated 96-well plates (Becton Dickinson, Bedford, Massachusetts) at 3000 cells per well and allowed to attach for 24 to 48 hours. Cells were left untreated (media controls) or treated with 20, 50, or 100 µg/mL CSC dissolved in 0.5% DMSO and diluted in the culture medium or treated with 0.5% DMSO in culture medium (vehicle controls) for 1 hour at 37°C. Some cells received either FAK inhibitor (1,2,4,5-benzenetetraamine, 4HCl, NSC 667249) alone (EMD, Calbiochem, Gibbstown, New Jersey) at 10 μmol/L or at a final concentration of 10 μmol/L FAK inhibitor in combination with 0.5% DMSO or CSC diluted in 0.5% DMSO. Following the treatment, cells were stained using reagents and protocols from a Cellomics Cytoskeletal Rearrangement HCS Reagent Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Rockford, Illinois) in which cells are stained with a Dylight 554 nm conjugated phalloidin combined with 4′-6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) and a whole cell stain after formaldehyde fixation, permeabilization, and blocking steps. Cells were observed and analyzed using a high-content analysis system (Cellomics Arrayscan V<sup>TI</sup>, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania), whereby cells are automatically imaged and analyzed using quantitative fluorescence microscopy. This instrument automatically focuses, exposes, and acquires images using bandpass emission filter and matched excitation filters selected for the fluorochromes used for each specific stain. For F-actin analysis, images were collected in 3 channels with the appropriate filter selected for the analysis of each fluorochrome. Channel 1 was used for the whole cell stain employing fluorescein isothiocyanate label, channel 2 for nuclear labeling (DAPI stain), and channel 3 using tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate for F-actin labeling. Channel 2 was used to establish the plane of focus for the cells, channel 1 was used to determine the edge of the cells, while channel 3 was used to identify actin filaments.</p></sec><sec id="section6-1091581812440890"><title>Staining of FAK and Paxillin</title><p>BEAS-2B cells were treated as described above, and after staining, using the Cytoskeletal Rearrangement Kit described above and 2 rinses with Dulbecco phosphate-buffered saline (DPBS; Thermo Fisher Scientific), the cells were stained for either tyrosine-phosphorylated FAK or phosphorylated paxillin as described below. Cells were incubated at room temperature with an anti-FAK Y397 monoclonal IgG antibody (Millipore, Billerica, Massachusetts) at 1:45 dilution or anti-phospho-paxillin polyclonal antibody Y118 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, California) at 1:1000 dilution for 1 hour in blocking solution of 0.5% bovine serum albumin and 0.5% nonfat dried milk. Following brief rinses with DPBS, cells were stained for 1 hour at room temperature with a 1:300 dilution of goat anti-mouse IgG or goat anti-rabbit Dylight 649-conjugated secondary antibody (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Following 3 rinses with DPBS, cells were left in DPBS and observed and analyzed with a Cellomics Arrayscan V<sup>TI</sup> and Morphology Explorer Bioapplication using a 20× objective. For this analysis, channels 1 to 3 were as described above for F-actin but either phosphorylated FAK or phosphorylated paxillin was added as channel 4. Ultimately, this analysis reports the average intensity of fluorescently labeled “spots” of phosphorylated FAK or phosphorylated paxillin within the cells, which is then averaged over all the analyzed cells in the well. A sufficient number of fields were imaged and analyzed to collect data from at least 400 cells per well and the mean and standard deviation among the replicate wells were calculated.</p></sec><sec id="section7-1091581812440890"><title>ERK, p38, JNK, c-Jun, Hsp27, pHsp27, and Caspase 3</title><p>BEAS-2B cells were plated at 10 000 cells per well onto Biocoat collagen I coated 96-well plates and allowed to attach for 24 to 48 hours and treated as described above for F-actin staining for 1 hour or 24 hours.

Immunoblotting was performed using 20 µg of detergent-solubilized lysate proteins. The Kinetworks analysis involved resolution of proteins by sodium dodecyl sulfate–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and subsequent immunoblotting overnight at 4°C with 2 primary phospho-site-specific antibodies. Phosphorylated paxillin 1 (Y118) was obtained from Invitrogen and phosphorylated FAK (Y397) was obtained from Upstate Biotechnology Inc (Waltham, Massachusetts). Membranes were later rinsed with TBST buffer and then incubated with the relevant horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody for 30 minutes at room temperature. The immunoblots were developed with enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) Plus reagent (Amersham, Arlington Heights, Illinois), and the signals were captured by a Fluor-S MAX MultiImager and quantified as counts per minute (CPM) using Quantity One software (Bio-Rad, Hercules, California).</p></sec><sec id="section9-1091581812440890"><title>Cell Spreading and Cell Motility</title><p>Cell spreading analysis was performed using a Cellomics Cell Spreading HCS Reagent Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific).

Analysis with the Cellomics Cell Spreading Bioapplication reported the mean cell colony nuclear area difference, which represents the cytoplasmic to nuclear area normalized per number of nuclei. For cell motility evaluation, 500 BEAS-2B cells per well were plated onto collagen coated 96-well plates prepared with a layer of blue fluorescent microspheres, using reagents and protocols from the Cellomics Cell Motility HCS Reagent Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The assay is based on the visualization of trails made by live cells plated on a lawn of microscopic fluorescent beads. Cells were allowed to attach for 4 hours, then treated as described above for F-actin evaluation except that the treatment was for 18 hours. Following formaldehyde fixation, cells were permeabilized and stained with rhodamine-phalloidin. Analysis was performed with a Cellomics Arrayscan V<sup>TI</sup> using the Cell Motility BioApplication (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and a 5× objective with 50 objects minimum per well collected.

Previous work showed that the IC<sub>50</sub> for CSC in BEAS-2B cells was 86 μg/mL for 1 hour and 19 μg/mL for 24 hours.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1091581812440890">1</xref></sup> Exposure of corneal epithelial cells to second-hand smoke inhibited cell migration, actin reorganization, and phosphorylation of FAK.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1091581812440890">18</xref></sup> CSC has been previously shown to cause actin filament disassembly into spot fibers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1091581812440890">1</xref></sup> FAK inhibition causes F-actin to localize only to the cell periphery but concurrent treatment of 50 μg/mL CSC changes this pattern to change to small, disrupted actin aggregates in the cells. This may be due to CSC-induced FAK activation. CSC plus FAK inhibition increases cell death and causes more pronounced decreases in cell motility. Activation of p38, ERK, and paxillin is associated with diseases such as cancer, but this activation correlates with increases in cell death in this study. This leads to the speculation that cells treated with designer drugs to inhibit FAK and exposed to toxins may be removed by apoptosis.</p><p>FAK regulates cell attachment to the substrate and multiple signaling pathways including the MAPKs. In this study, CSC activates FAK until a dose whereby cells die. While increasing doses of CSC cause Y397 FAK to increase then decrease at higher doses (100 μg/mL CSC), paxillin phosphorylation increases at 100 μg/mL CSC. When integrins bind to the extracellular matrix, they cluster on the cell surface resulting in the assembly of protein complexes, which include FAK, at these sites of adhesion. Cell adhesion induces FAK autophosphorylation at Y397, which creates docking sites for proteins with SH2 domains one of which is paxillin.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1091581812440890">19</xref></sup> Increases in Y397 FAK shown in this article correlate well with increased adhesion of BEAS-2B cells at 20 to 40 μg/mL CSC described earlier, while decreases in FAK at higher CSC doses correlate with rounding of cells and lack of adhesion.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1091581812440890">1</xref></sup> FAK signals to suppress anoikis using multiple pathways and distinct cell types use different subsets of these pathways.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1091581812440890">20</xref></sup> Increases in paxillin at higher CSC doses may be due to the role of paxillin in survival signaling.
