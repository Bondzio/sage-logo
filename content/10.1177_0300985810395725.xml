<abstract>
<p>Embryonic lethality is a common phenotype that occurs in mice that are homozygous for genetically engineered mutations. These phenotypes highlight the time and place that a gene is first required during embryogenesis. Early embryonic lethality (ie, before and up to mid-gestation) can be straightforward to analyze because the stage at which death occurs suggests why an embryo has failed. Here we summarize general strategies for analyzing early embryonic lethal phenotypes in genetically engineered mouse mutants.</p>

<p>The intrauterine development of mammals provides a protective, nurturing environment for the complex processes of embryogenesis but presents an obstacle to the observation and study of early acting mutations. Particularly in cases of lethality during gestation, analysis of a mutant phenotype may require specialized embryological and analytic tools stretching back to the time of fertilization. The earlier a mutant gene has its primary effect, the more likely the defect will ramify throughout development and lead to embryonic lethality. In addition, disruption of the early events of placentation can quickly lead to the demise of the embryo.</p>
<p>Although it may not always be the intended outcome, many mutations produced through genetic engineering affect developmental processes and compromise heterozygous or homozygous mutant embryos long before birth. A thorough understanding of the expression pattern of the gene in question is key to any analysis of the effects of a mutant gene; however, expression studies may not have extended to all embryonic stages, and thus some surprises may be encountered when a mutation is produced. In this article, we outline a general strategy for investigating embryonic lethality caused by genetically engineered mutations from fertilization to just beyond mid-gestation (∽12.5 days of gestation). It presupposes a general knowledge of mouse embryogenesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0300985810395725">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0300985810395725"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0300985810395725"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0300985810395725"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0300985810395725">5</xref></sup> and that a detailed expression analysis is available or will be done in conjunction with the phenotypic analysis to guide the investigation and to fully understand the etiology of a mutant phenotype. We make the further assumption that a robust genotyping assay is available and that heterozygous mice are viable and fertile. The special case of a dominant lethal mutation is very rare and requires a different approach for analysis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0300985810395725">6</xref></sup>

<title>Indications of Embryonic Lethality and Establishing the Time of Death</title>
<p>Usually the first indication that a genetically engineered mutation has an embryonic lethal effect is a modified mendelian ratio of genotypes among offspring born from heterozygous crosses, as well as a smaller litter size compared to controls. If the mutation is fully penetrant, there will be no homozygous mutant offspring and there will be a 2:1 ratio of heterozygotes to wild-type mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0300985810395725">Fig. 1</xref>
). However, if the phenotype is variable, some homozygous mutants may survive, but in lower than expected numbers. Once it has been established by observation that the homozygous mutants are not dying between birth and weaning, then the time of embryonic or fetal death of the mutants can be determined by examining key stages of gestation from timed pregnant females.</p>

<p>Embryonic day (E) 12.5 provides a useful starting point for analysis. Systematic dissection and examination of each implantation site and embryo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0300985810395725">Fig. 2</xref>), followed by genotyping each embryo, will reveal the time of death of homozygous mutants. If no homozygous mutants are detected and all implantation sites contain normal, wild-type, or heterozygous embryos, it is likely the mutants died some time during the 4 days prior to implantation and thus did not induce a decidual swelling in the uterus. Further analysis would then concentrate on pre-implantation stages (next section). If all the embryos are wild type or heterozygous but there are implantation sites with no embryonic remains or a small amount of degenerating tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0300985810395725">Fig. 2A, E, F</xref>), it is likely that the mutants died after implantation but prior to or shortly after establishment of the chorioallantoic placenta about E9.5 and thus are in the process of being resorbed. Finally, if it is confirmed by genotyping that the mutants are among the embryos present at E12.5, whether they are normal or not, their phenotype can be assessed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0300985810395725">Fig. 2B-D, G, H</xref>). If the mutants are indistinguishable from wild type at E12.5, a later time of death is indicated; if they are already dead or abnormal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0300985810395725">Fig. 2G, H</xref>), the condition and stage of development of the mutants will provide information about the time of death or onset of the mutant phenotype.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0300985810395725">6</xref></sup>

<p>It is essential to examine a sufficient number of embryos and to genotype each embryo to establish statistical significance of a correlation between genotype and phenotype. Variability in a phenotype requires a larger number of embryos for analysis to firmly establish the time or range of time of death. It should be noted that embryonic death is not uncommon among wild-type mice and may vary with genetic background. Consequently, not every empty decidua or abnormal embryo is necessarily attributable to the mutant effect.</p>

<title>Pre-implantation Lethality</title>
<p>The fertilized oocyte or zygote undergoes regular cleavage divisions to form the blastocyst during pre-implantation development, making the morphological assessment of pre-implantation stages straightforward. At E3.5, blastocysts flushed from the uterus, or earlier stages flushed from the oviduct, will still be enclosed within the zona pellucida and can be recovered, scored for viability and stage of development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0300985810395725">Fig. 3</xref>
), and genotyped by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Identification of the mutants by genotype will allow correlation with any developmental arrest, delay, or abnormality observed. Embryos recovered from the oviducts at E0.5 shortly after fertilization, or at later stages from the oviduct or uterus, can be cultured in vitro through all pre-implantation stages.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0300985810395725">7</xref></sup> Cultured embryos can hatch from the zona pellucida and will attach to a culture dish, a proxy for implantation, at the appropriate time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0300985810395725">Fig. 4</xref>
). Thus, for a dynamic picture of a pre-implantation defect, embryos can be recovered at the 1-cell stage at E0.5; observed during culture throughout pre-implantation development, hatching, attachment, and outgrowth; and then genotyped. In addition, proliferation, cell death, and expression of specific genes that are diagnostic of developmental stages or cell types can be assessed. Analysis of RNA, proteins, and histological and ultrastructural details is also possible.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0300985810395725">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0300985810395725"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0300985810395725">7</xref></sup> However, because destructive techniques may preclude subsequent genotyping of embryos, reliance on mendelian ratios may require a large number of embryos to accurately attribute any defects observed to a mutation. More sophisticated experimental approaches are also possible, including the use of fluorescent protein markers, which are becoming a more common element of many gene-targeting experiments for microscopic analysis of living embryos during culture.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0300985810395725">8</xref></sup>

<title>Peri-implantation Lethality, E4.5-E5.5</title>
<p>The detection of empty implantation sites upon dissection at E12.5, or sites with only trophoblast giant cells, indicates lethality shortly after implantation. Embryo implantation is accompanied by decidualization of the uterine tissue, which results in visible swellings or implantation sites as early as E5.0. This process occurs in response to the presence of an embryo but can be triggered by a highly compromised embryo, as long as it has shed the zona pellucida and has differentiated a trophoblast layer. Isolating living embryos from the uterus during the implantation process is possible but impractical, because they are small and becoming attached to the epithelial lining of the uterus. Consequently, assessment of a mutation causing lethality at this stage is best approached by examining embryos in the late pre-implantation period, as indicated in the previous section, to determine the phenotype of the embryos prior to implantation. In vitro culture starting at E3.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0300985810395725">Fig. 4</xref>) can be used to assess the implantation process itself; in addition, histological and immunohistochemical evaluation of the implantation site can be performed in serial sections of the uterus.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0300985810395725">6</xref></sup>

<title>Post-implantation Lethality, E5.5-E12.5</title>
<p>Successful development through implantation depends on the development of extraembryonic tissues, the trophoblast (also called trophectoderm or TE), primitive endoderm, and their derivatives, which mediate the initial communication between the fetus and the mother. At the same time, the embryo is proceeding through gastrulation, forming the primary germ layers (ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm) and mesodermally derived extraembryonic structures that will contribute to the yolk sac and chorioallantoic placenta (see article by Ward, this issue). Coordination of the establishment of the chorioallantoic placenta with the onset of fetal circulation (E8.5-E9.5) is a critical point in development. Failure results in degeneration of the embryo, although extraembryonic structures can persist for some time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0300985810395725">Fig. 2E, F</xref>). Because of the interdependence of embryonic and extraembryonic structures, a primary defect in one tissue can have secondary effects on other tissues and on embryo survival. Thus, knowing the normal expression pattern of the mutated gene will greatly simplify analysis of a lethal phenotype by pinpointing the tissue in which the mutation is likely to have its primary effect.</p>
<p>Morphological assessment of embryos during the post-implantation period can be accomplished by dissection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0300985810395725">Figs. 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0300985810395725">5</xref>) and by fixation and sectioning of embryos within the uterus.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0300985810395725">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0300985810395725">6</xref></sup> The trade-off is that integrity of the placental and extraembryonic structures is compromised by dissection and is best evaluated with the embryo in utero. However, dissection of embryos allows for the evaluation of features such as the presence or absence of a heartbeat, and the presence of blood, blood circulation, and extravascular blood. Features such as the direction of heart looping and embryo turning as well as the accurate assessment of developmental stage by somite number are more easily established in freshly dissected embryos than in sections.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0300985810395725">6</xref></sup> Following dissection, embryonic and placental samples can be fixed for further analysis either as whole mounts or sections for cell death and proliferation assays, gene or protein expression, or evaluation of detailed morphological and histological features. Samples for genotyping are easy to obtain during dissection, as even degenerating tissue will usually yield sufficient DNA for PCR analysis, whereas embryos sectioned within the uterus will have to be genotyped by recovery of embryonic tissue after sectioning. With either method, abnormal embryos can be assessed in comparison with their control littermates, which helps check for differences in developmental timing within and between litters.</p>

<p>The expression pattern of the gene will inform the detailed analysis of the mutant embryos, but there are several main causes of embryonic lethality during the early post-implantation period. Placental failure or placental insufficiency is primary among these causes and can lead to growth delays or death of the fetus. The underlying cause can be defects in the early functioning yolk sac placenta; defects in trophoblast differentiation, proliferation, or function; or failure of development or fusion of the allantois to the chorion to form the chorioallantoic placenta.</p>
<p>A second major cause of lethality is cardiovascular insufficiency, which can result from defects in development of blood, heart, or vessels. Hematopoietic defects may affect the earliest hematopoiesis, which takes place in the yolk sac, or later hematopoiesis in the fetal liver. Pale embryos or an obvious lack of blood or a small liver could indicate hematopoietic defects. Morphogenetic defects in the heart or abnormalities in vasculogenesis or angiogenesis can severely compromise development. Coordination of the extraembryonic circulation in the yolk sac and allantois with the developing fetal heart and circulation is essential to establish the fetal-maternal link to maintain the embryo.</p>
<p>Whatever the defect, there are a myriad of molecular markers available that can be used to define particular stages of development or specific tissue types. These are essentially changes in gene expression that represent signposts of development. Their identification supplements the morphological analysis with a molecular backup that defines developmental stages or the differentiation of specific cell types and the functioning of specific signaling pathways. The onset of a molecular phenotype will usually precede a morphological phenotype and can lead to a molecular understanding of the mutant effect. These markers can be detected using in situ hybridization for mRNA, immunohistochemistry for proteins, and genetic reporters, if available. Molecular marker analysis is second in importance only to morphological analysis for the characterization of developmental defects.</p>

<title>Beyond the Uterus: Circumventing a Lethal Phenotype</title>
<p>The foregoing analysis is aimed at pinpointing the time and cause of early embryonic death, but it will not necessarily provide complete information on gene function in all tissues. If, for example, a mutation compromises implantation through an effect on the trophoblast, but the gene is also expressed in the brain, peri-implantation death will preclude study of a potential later role in the brain. There are a number of ways of circumventing this type of problem to determine developmental potential of different embryonic tissues. Short-term culture of either whole embryos or organ rudiments can circumvent placental insufficiency or other early developmental problems such as hematopoietic defects by providing the fetus or organ with essential metabolic needs. Developmental potential of mutant tissue can be tested in vivo by transplantation into ectopic sites in histocompatible or immune-compromised hosts for the formation of teratomas.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0300985810395725">7</xref></sup> The composition of the resulting tumor growths provides an indication of the developmental potential of the mutant tissue, when compared with wild-type tissue, although the organization of the embryos will be lost. Cell lines, such as fibroblasts, embryonic stem cells, trophoblast stem cells, or primitive endoderm stem cells can be derived from mutant embryonic tissue to study the mutant effect outside the confines of gestational development.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0300985810395725">9</xref></sup> Finally, mutant cells can be tested in the context of a developing embryo by making chimeras with mutant and wild-type tissue.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0300985810395725">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0300985810395725">7</xref></sup> This technique may circumvent specific developmental problems if the wild-type tissue assumes critical functions, thus rescuing the mutant phenotype, while allowing mutant cells to be carried along to contribute (or not) to organs and tissues.</p>
