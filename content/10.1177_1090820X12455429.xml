<title>Background:</title>
<p>A growing body of evidence implicates subclinical (biofilm) infection around breast implants as an important cause of capsular contracture (CC).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1090820X12455429">
<title>Objectives:</title>
<p>The authors use an in vivo porcine model to investigate the potential of antibiotic-impregnated mesh as a prophylactic measure against biofilm formation and CC.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1090820X12455429">
<title>Methods:</title>
<p>A total of 28 implants (14 untreated controls, 14 treated with antibiotic mesh) were inserted into 5 adult female pigs. All implants and pockets were inoculated with a human clinical strain of <italic>Staphylococcus epidermidis</italic>. The implants were left in situ for 16 weeks and then analyzed for contracture using both Baker grading and applanation tonometry. The presence of biofilm infection was assessed by subsequent microbiological analysis of implants and capsules.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1090820X12455429">
<title>Results:</title>
<p>One untreated implant had extruded and was excluded from analysis. The tissue surrounding the 13 untreated control implants had Baker Grade III/IV CC, whereas no CC was identified around the 14 antibiotic mesh-treated implants. This difference was highly significant (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .001). Tonometry findings were consistent with the Baker assessments. Although bacterial biofilm was detected on all implants and capsules, the biofilms on the antibiotic-treated implants and surrounding capsules were generally single-layered or isolated in contrast to the multilayer biofilms found on untreated implants and capsules.</p>

<sec id="section5-1090820X12455429">
<title>Conclusions:</title>
<p>Based on the findings from this study of a porcine model, the use of antibiotic-impregnated mesh reduces bacterial access to breast implants at the time of surgical insertion and may subsequently protect against subclinical infection and CC.</p>

<p>Since the 1970s, capsular contracture (CC) has remained the most significant clinical complication of breast augmentation, with reported rates of 1.3% to 30%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1090820X12455429">1</xref></sup> Evidence from clinical studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1090820X12455429">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1090820X12455429"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1090820X12455429"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1090820X12455429"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1090820X12455429"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1090820X12455429"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1090820X12455429">8</xref></sup> and from in vivo porcine models of CC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1090820X12455429">9</xref></sup> supports the hypothesis that the majority of CC is due to subclinical infection around breast implants caused by bacterial biofilm. This hypothesis is further strengthened by early reports that antibacterial strategies can reduce the risk of implant infection.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1090820X12455429">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1090820X12455429"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1090820X12455429"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1090820X12455429">13</xref></sup> We have previously reported data from a prospective, blinded study that showed isolation of <italic>Staphylococcus epidermidis</italic> in 73% of samples obtained from capsules and implants of women with symptomatic contracture following augmentation mammaplasty.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1090820X12455429">4</xref></sup> This is consistent with a growing body of literature that has established the role of <italic>S epidermidis</italic> in contamination of urinary catheters, cardiac valves, orthopedic prostheses, vascular grafts, and contact lenses.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1090820X12455429">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>Using an established porcine model,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1090820X12455429">9</xref></sup> we tested the efficacy of placing antibiotic-impregnated mesh at the time of device implantation to prevent biofilm formation and subsequent contracture.</p>
<sec id="section6-1090820X12455429" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>Study approval was obtained from the University of Sydney Animal Ethics Committee. All pigs were housed as a group in designated animal care facilities at the University of Sydney Farms in Cobbitty, New South Wales, Australia.</p>
<p>Five adult, female, nonlactating, domestic Large White pigs (<italic>Sus domesticus</italic>) weighing approximately 350 kg each individually received up to 6 miniature, smooth, silicone gel–filled implants of 4 cm in diameter (TYRX, Inc, Monmouth Junction, New Jersey).</p>
<p>The implants were placed into submammary pockets that had been dissected under the cranial, middle or caudal sets of teats. Surgical methods were as described by Tamboto et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1090820X12455429">9</xref></sup> All implants and surrounding pockets were then inoculated with 10<sup>5</sup> colony-forming units (CFU) of a human clinical strain of <italic>S epidermidis</italic>, originally isolated from a contracted breast in a human patient. A total of 28 implants were implanted into the 5 pigs: 14 control implants (untreated) and 14 implants inserted with antibiotic-impregnated mesh (treated).</p>
<p>Implants were randomly selected by the investigators before implantation to be inserted either alone (untreated) or with a circular disk of antibiotic-impregnated polypropylene mesh (AIGISRx antibacterial flat sheet; TYRX, Inc) (treated), which was placed directly beneath the implant during surgery. Coated with a resorbable polymer carrying minocycline and rifampicin (which are released over 7 to 10 days), the mesh has previously been shown to be effective against <italic>S epidermidis</italic> for a period of at least 7 days (data on file, TYRX, Inc). The implants were left in situ for 16 weeks. They were then assessed for contracture and harvested with the capsule for additional contracture assessment and biofilm analysis.</p>
<p>Contracture of the implants was first assessed using the 4-grade Baker scale<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1090820X12455429">15</xref></sup> while the implants were in situ, with Grade I indicating a relatively normal breast and Grade IV indicating severe CC. Contracture was also assessed by applanation tonometry, as adapted from Minami et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1090820X12455429">16</xref></sup> For assessment by applanation tonometry, the implant and surrounding capsule were aseptically dissected and transported on ice to the laboratory, where they were overlaid with sterile foil. A 300-g weight coated in petroleum jelly was applied to the specimen, and the area of touch was outlined. The surface area of touch was then calculated using Adobe Acrobat X Pro software (version 10.0; Adobe Systems Incorporated, San Jose, California). All assessments of contracture were performed by an investigator (AKD) who was blinded to the original treatment status of the implant.</p>
<p>Biofilm presence on the implant and capsule was assessed with bacterial viability counts, total bacterial counts by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Quanti-tative aerobic cultures, viability counts, and bacterial identification were obtained following sample maceration and ultrasonication as described previously.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1090820X12455429">9</xref></sup> All laboratory assessments were performed by personnel blinded to the original treatment status of the implant.</p>
<p>The total number of bacteria was estimated using quantitative real-time PCR. For DNA extraction prior to qPCR, 50 to 100 mg of each pig capsule was added to 275 µL digestion buffer (50 nM Tris-HCl [pH 7.5], 150 nM NaCl, 2 mM EDTA, 1% sodium dodecyl sulfate) containing 400 µg proteinase kinase (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, Missouri) and incubated at 50°C overnight. The proteinase kinase was inactivated by boiling for 5 minutes, and lysozyme (Sigma-Aldrich) was added to give a final concentration of 0.5 mg/mL. Following 2 hours of incubation at 56°C, an additional 200 µg proteinase kinase was added, followed by another 2 hours of incubation at 50°C. DNA was extracted using the phenol-chloroform extraction technique followed by ethanol precipitation. Extracted DNA was resuspended in 200 µL of a Tris EDTA buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 1 mM EDTA), and the DNA concentration was quantified by a NanoDrop 2000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, Massachusetts).</p>
<p>Extracted DNA was subjected to qPCR using universal eubacterial primer 16S rRNA_341F 5′-CCTACGGGAGGCAG-CAG-3′ and 16S rRNA_534R 5′-ATTACCGCGGCTGCTGG-3′ to amplify all bacteria.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1090820X12455429">17</xref></sup> In addition, extracted DNA was subjected to amplification of the pig 18S rRNA gene, which was used as a reference gene to normalize the amount of pig tissue used in DNA extraction. The primer pair used in 18S rRNA gene real-time PCR was 18S rRNA_ 756F 5′-GGTGGTGCCCTTCCGTCA-3′ and 18S rRNA_877R 5′-CGATGCGGCGGCGTTATT-3′ to amplify a 122-bp amplicon based on the pig (<italic>Sus scrofa</italic>) 18S ribosomal RNA gene sequence (GenBank: AY265350.1).</p>
<p>The 25-µL reaction mix contained 1× Brilliant II SYBR Green qPCR Master Mix (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, California), 400 nM forward and reverse primer, and 20 ng DNA template. The mix was incubated at 95°C for 10 minutes, followed by thermal cycling (95°C for 15 seconds, 56°C for 30 seconds, and 72°C for 20 seconds, repeated 40 times).</p>
<p>The presence of biofilm in capsules was confirmed visually by SEM. Sections of implant and capsule were fixed in glutaraldehyde for 1.5 hours, dehydrated with ethanol, and immersed in hexamethyldisilazane (HMDS; Polysciences, Inc, Warrington, Pennsylvania) for 3 minutes before being aspirated dry and stored desiccated. The dried sample was coated with 20 nm gold film in a sputter coater and then examined in the SEM.</p>
<sec id="section7-1090820X12455429">
<title>Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>The χ<sup>2</sup> test was used to compare differences in contracture rates between treatment and control groups, and an unpaired <italic>t</italic> test was used to examine differences between treated and untreated contracted implants. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) with the Holm-Sidak method of multiple comparisons was performed to identify any variation in bacterial numbers or implant tonometry between multiple tests. All statistical analyses were conducted using the SigmaPlot version 11 statistical program (Systat Software, Inc, San Jose, California).</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>Of the 28 total implants (14 control; 14 antibiotic-impregnated), 1 untreated control implant was found to have been extruded and was excluded from analysis. No pigs exhibited any obvious systemic effects from bacterial inoculation and/or treatment with the mesh.</p>
<p>Assessment of contracture by Baker grading revealed that all 13 evaluable, untreated, control implants were contracted (graded III/IV). In contrast, the 14 implants treated with antibiotic-impregnated mesh remained noncontracted (graded I/II). This difference was highly significant (χ<sup>2</sup> = 23.14, <italic>df</italic> = 1, <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001).

<p>Tonometry confirmed the Baker assessment findings. Implants with a higher Baker grade (ie, untreated, control implants) had a reduced surface area, indicating greater capsule thickness compared with antibiotic mesh-treated implants (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1090820X12455429">Table 3</xref>).

<p>On enrichment culture, most implants grew coagulase-negative staphylococcus of pig origin, generally <italic>Staphylococcus simulans.</italic> Quantitative counts were generally low, with only 7 implants having more than 10 colonies. There was no relationship between quantitative counts and implant treatment.</p>
<p>The number of bacteria per milligram of pig tissue as measured by PCR was lowest from sites assessed as Baker Grade I (2.39 × 10<sup>5</sup> CFU/mg), gradually increasing nonsignificantly until Baker Grade III (2.68 × 10<sup>5</sup> CFU/mg) before decreasing slightly at Baker Grade IV (2.61 × 10<sup>5</sup> CFU/mg). However, the volume and mass of the capsules from noncontracted breasts were significantly less than the volume and mass of the capsules from contracted breasts, making the total number of bacteria in contracted breasts at least 10-fold higher.</p>
<p>As all implants were inoculated with 10<sup>5</sup> CFU at implantation, it was expected that some degree of biofilm would be present on all implants. Scanning electron microscopy confirmed the presence of bacterial biofilm on implant surfaces and capsules obtained from both untreated and treated breasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1090820X12455429">Figure 1</xref>). However, although multilayered biofilm was easily detected and present in 100% of SEM views on untreated implants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1090820X12455429">Figure 1A</xref>) and capsules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1090820X12455429">Figures 1B</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1090820X12455429">C</xref>), the biofilm was generally single-layered or composed of isolated bacterial cells and difficult to find on treated implants (not shown) and capsules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1090820X12455429">Figure 1D</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1090820X12455429">E</xref>).</p>

Implant pockets were inoculated with a serially diluted clinical sample of <italic>S epidermidis</italic> cultured from a contracted human breast. A total of 51 mammary augmentations were performed on 6 pigs. Pocket inoculation was strongly associated with biofilm formation (<italic>P</italic> = .0095); moreover, biofilms were significantly associated with CC (<italic>P</italic> = .0213), with 80.6% of biofilm-positive implants developing contracted capsules.</p>
<p>The current findings show that strategies to prevent bacterial attachment at the time of implantation can lead to a decrease in biofilm formation and subsequent contracture. The presence of antibiotic-impregnated mesh had a clear protective effect against the development of contracture when assessed using the Baker grading scale. In addition, the tonometry data indicated that antibiotic mesh-treated implants tended to have greater surface area compared with untreated implants, which was consistent with our findings upon palpation. These data are also supported by a recent study reporting a reduction in biofilm formation on breast implants by applying antibiotic coatings in vitro.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1090820X12455429">18</xref></sup> The use of antibiotic solution<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1090820X12455429">19</xref></sup> and betadine<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1090820X12455429">10</xref></sup> in the implant pocket has further been shown to significantly reduce the risk of subsequent implant infection and contracture.</p>
<p>The identification of endogenous porcine staphylococcus was consistent with our previous study,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1090820X12455429">9</xref></sup> in which contracture resulted from contamination with either human or endogenous bacteria. The causative organism in this study was porcine staphylococcus rather than the human staphylococcus inoculum. In our earlier study,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1090820X12455429">9</xref></sup> we showed that endogenous pig staphylococcus can form biofilms around implants, which subsequently leads to contracture. Interestingly, the original human inoculum was not recovered at implant harvest in this study. This may be due to the later sampling (at 16 weeks) than was undertaken previously (13 weeks). An alternative explanation is that the human inoculum initiates the development of a biofilm by overcoming local immunity. Endogenous porcine staphylococcus species, which are present in higher numbers, may then outcompete the original inoculated human strain.</p>
<p>The analysis of total bacterial counts showed that the number of bacteria within biofilms was consistently low. This finding is consistent with the understanding of biofilm structure. Although not statistically significant, the relationship between bacterial counts and Baker grade is an interesting finding. It is possible that in mature, thickened capsules, the bacterial numbers are reduced relative to connective tissue. Further evaluation of this finding is warranted. The SEM findings in this study reinforce the findings from microbiological analysis and show the presence of mature biofilm colonies attached to both capsule and surface of the implant.</p>
<p>There are some limitations to these findings. Although the 7- to 10-day drug diffusion activity of the antimicrobial mesh seems to be effective at reducing bacterial contact around the time of implantation, exposure of the implants to bacteria following this period, such as through bacteremia from other subsequent procedures, will not be prevented. In addition, the harvest of breast implants at 16 weeks in this study precluded longer follow-up to determine whether any of the treated implants would progress to contracture. In addition, we did not include analysis of the mesh alone (without antibiotic impregnation). We are therefore unable to exclude any local protective effects of a mesh barrier on the prevention of biofilm formation.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>This study demonstrates that strategies to reduce bacterial access to breast implants at the time of surgical insertion can protect against subclinical infection and subsequent CC. Anti-biofilm technologies should be further investigated as a means of preventing infections associated with implantable medical devices.</p>
