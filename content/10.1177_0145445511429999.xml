<abstract>
<p>Public speaking anxiety (PSA) is a common social phobia. Although cognitive-behavior therapy (CBT) is the treatment of choice, difficulties arise with both in vivo and in vitro exposure (lack of therapist control, patient’s inability to imagine, self-flooding, and a lack of confidentiality resulting from public exposure). Virtual reality CBT (VRCBT) enables a high degree of therapist control, thus overcoming these difficulties. In a previous publication, the authors reported on their findings that VRCBT (<italic>n</italic> = 28) and CBT (<italic>n</italic> = 30) groups were significantly more effective than a wait-list control (WLC; <italic>n</italic> = 30) group in anxiety reduction on four of five anxiety measures as well as on participant’s self-rating of anxiety during a behavioral task. No significant differences were found between VRCBT and CBT. However, twice as many clients dropped out of CBT (15) than from VRCBT (6). Results demonstrated that VRCBT is an effective and brief treatment regimen, equal to CBT. This brief report examined durability of these changes. They found that both VRCBT (25) and CBT (24) groups maintained their improvement from post treatment to follow-up, on all five measures. In addition, they found that the CBT group continued to improve from post treatment to follow-up on Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale (LSAS) fear. Thus, treatment gains were maintained at a 1-year follow-up.</p>

<p>Social phobia is a common and debilitating disorder that afflicts 13% of the population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0145445511429999">American Psychiatric Association [APA], 2000</xref>). Public speaking anxiety (PSA) is the most common social phobia, afflicting 40% of all those who suffer from social phobia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0145445511429999">Ruscio et al., 2008</xref>). This disorder leads to major difficulties in work, study, and social life, and often results in drug and alcohol addiction in an attempt to self-medicate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0145445511429999">Craske, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0145445511429999">Ruscio et al., 2008</xref>). The combination of cognitive-behavior therapies (CBT) has been found to be the treatment of choice for phobias (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0145445511429999">Heimberg et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0145445511429999">Hope &amp; Heimberg, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0145445511429999">Marks, 1990</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0145445511429999">1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0145445511429999">Otto, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0145445511429999">Silverman, McCarthy, &amp; McGovern, 1992</xref>). This combination is superior to other psychotherapeutic approaches, in the percentages of client improvement, degree of improvement, and long-term maintenance in follow-up (FU) studies. The exposure component of CBT may be performed in a natural setting (“in vivo”) or by imagination (“in vitro”). While in vivo exposure is superior to imagination, it is costly and time-consuming, and situational elements are difficult to control. An additional problem with in vivo exposure is the possibility of encountering people the client knows, thus revealing that she or he is in therapy. In vitro exposure can be difficult for people who are unable to vividly imagine or avoid imagining the situation or who tend to overwhelm themselves with images. This reduces therapy effectiveness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0145445511429999">Goldberg, Zwiebel, Safir, &amp; Merbaum, 1984</xref>). Thus, virtual reality (VR) exposure is an appealing alternative. VR is defined as a situation in which sensory information is generated by a computer rather than by the natural environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0145445511429999">Stever, 1992</xref>). Virtual reality CBT (VRCBT) has been employed with various disorders, primarily phobias (see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0145445511429999">Powers &amp; Emmelkamp, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0145445511429999">Wallach &amp; Bar-Zvi, 2007</xref>). Advantages of VRCBT over in vitro therapy are most relevant for people who have difficulty imagining situations vividly, for those who avoid remaining in the imagined fearful situations, and for those who are unable to control their imagination and flood themselves with extreme situations, resulting in even higher levels of anxiety. In contrast with in vivo and in vitro exposure, the therapist has full knowledge of and control over VR exposure. Thus, advantages of VR therapy over in vivo exposure include protecting the client’s anonymity, increasing therapist’s control over the environment, and great savings in time and expense. An additional advantage of VR therapy is higher acceptance of exposure through VR rather than in vivo, as well as lower drop-out rates using VR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0145445511429999">García-Palacios, Botella, Hoffman, &amp; Fabregat, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0145445511429999">Wallach, Safir, &amp; Bar-Zvi, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0145445511429999">Wilson, Onorati, Mishkind, Reger, &amp; Gahm, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Up to the present, we (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0145445511429999">Wallach et al., 2009</xref>) have conducted the only study with CBT VR therapy for PSA which included a large participant group, randomized assignment, and sufficient treatment length to be able to determine the advantage of VRCBT over no treatment, and the relative utility of VRCBT compared with CBT. We found that both VRCBT and CBT were superior to the wait-list control (WLC) group on three (Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale [LSAS] fear, LSAS avoidance, and Self-Statements During Public Speaking [SSPS] positive) of five measures. In contrast to our prediction, there were no significant differences between VRCBT and CBT. Treatment was successful for both treatment groups. In addition, clients’ posttreatment scores on two measures were within normal range (LSAS avoidance and SSPS positive). The VRCBT group posttreatment scores were within the normal range on one additional measure (SPSS negative). Thus, we were able to state that CBT and VRCBT are viable and effective treatments.</p>
<p>However, FU examinations were necessary to determine whether these treatment gains would be retained. An additional question was to determine whether there would be further gains resulting from participants’ increased performance and reduced avoidance. We deemed this necessary because some of the participants indicated that they would have liked to receive more practice during therapy.</p>
<p>The hypotheses examined in this FU study are as follows:</p>
<list id="list1-0145445511429999" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 1</italic>: VRCBT clients will maintain gains from pre therapy (PRT) to post therapy (POT) at FU and show additional improvement so that there will be a significant difference between pre scores and FU scores, and a significant difference between post scores and FU scores.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 2</italic>: CBT clients will maintain gains from PRT to POT at FU and show additional improvement, thus there will be a significant difference between pre scores and FU scores, and a significant difference between post scores and FU scores.</p></list-item>

<title>Participants</title>
<p>In all, 88 clients, who suffered from PSA, were recruited to participate in the original study. We accepted all participants who expressed a desire (self-diagnosis) to overcome their difficulties with PSA, therefore no cutoff scores nor diagnosis was used. Candidates suffering from a psychotic disorder, drug or alcohol abuse, or epilepsy were excluded. Participants were randomly assigned to one of three groups: VRCBT (28), CBT (30), and WLC (30). As WLC participants received treatment following their wait period, they were not included in the FU. We were unable to locate 9 participants who had completed treatment. However, all of the participants whom we succeeded in contacting agreed to participate; thus, FU data are available for 25 VRCBT (89% of the original group) and 24 CBT (80% of the original participants). Participants were young (average age = 27 years) and single (82%).</p>

<title>Measures</title>

<list-item><p>LSAS was developed by Liebowitz (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0145445511429999">Fresco et al., 2001</xref>), as a clinician-administered scale, and has been found to be valid and reliable when used as a self-rating questionnaire. The LSAS includes 24 questions. For each question, the participant rates the amount of fear experienced (answered on a 4-point Likert-type scale ranging from 1 = <italic>not at all</italic> to 4 = <italic>very much</italic>) and the amount of avoidance experienced (rated on a 4-point Likert-type scale ranging from 1 = <italic>never, 0%</italic> to 4 = <italic>usually, 68%-100%</italic>). The self-rating version has high reliability (Cronbach’s α = .90-.95). It also has good validity (high correlations with other anxiety measures, for example, Social Interaction Anxiety Scale—Fear scale = .72, Avoidance scale = .68; Social Phobia Scale—Fear scale = .64, Avoidance scale = .59).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>SSPS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0145445511429999">Hofmann &amp; DiBartolo, 2000</xref>). This 10-item measure assesses fearful thoughts during public speaking. It consists of two subscales: Positive and Negative Self-Statements. This scale has high reliability (.78-.80 and .80-.86, respectively). It also has good validity (discriminates between social phobics and the general population, correlates with other anxiety scales; for example, Personal Report of Confidence as a Speaker = .67, Fear of Negative Evaluation [FNE] = .49, Social Phobia and Anxiety Inventory = .48). For the positive scale, higher scores indicate less anxiety.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>FNE (Watson &amp; Friend, 1969, in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0145445511429999">Salaberria &amp; Echeburua, 1998</xref>) includes 30 yes/no questions. The questions relate to cognitive aspects of the phobic experience—fear of criticism or negative evaluation. FNE has high reliability (.78-.94), and good validity (e.g., correlations with Taylor’s Manifest Anxiety = .60, social and evaluative parts of the Endler-Hunt S-R = .47).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Behavioral Task: On completion of treatment, participants presented a 10-min talk on a topic they chose (standing and without notes) in front of a live audience made up of four or five staff members who served as observers and were unaware of treatment group placement. Participants were rated on 10 anxiety indicators. Nine indicators were rated on a 5-point Likert-type scale from <italic>very much</italic> to <italic>not at all</italic> (e.g., eye contact, stuttering), and 1 was a global fear assessment rated on a 0 to 10 scale from 0 = <italic>not at all anxious</italic> to 10 = <italic>very anxious</italic>. Observers were a psychiatrist, two clinical psychologists, and one or two clinical psychology students in the final stages of their clinical training. Prior to rating the participants, all observers underwent brief training, and training was continued until high interrater reliability was achieved. In addition, participants rated their anxiety at various points (waiting outside the room, giving the lecture, etc.) on 5-point Likert-type scales.</p></list-item>

<title>Procedure</title>
<p>There were two treatment groups in the original study: VRCBT and CBT, as well as a WLC group. Participants in both treatment groups received 12 individual 1-hr treatment sessions, administered according to protocols designed for this study. The VRCBT group received all exposures in the VR environment (developed by Virtually Better), and the CBT group received all exposures in vitro. The WLC group completed questionnaires at the beginning and end of a 12-week wait period, after which they were randomly assigned to one of the treatment groups.</p>
<p>Clients who participated in the original study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0145445511429999">Wallach et al., 2009</xref>) were contacted by mail and asked to complete FU questionnaires. Therefore, we were unable to repeat the behavioral task. We were unable to locate nine participants (three from the VRCBT group and six from the CBT group).</p>
<p>Treatment protocols, VR software, and therapist qualifications are described in length in the previous article (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0145445511429999">Wallach et al., 2009</xref>).</p>

<title>Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>Our previous article (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0145445511429999">Wallach et al., 2009</xref>) reported on comparison of treatment dropouts and completers on demographic variables and on PRT anxiety measures. No significant differences were found on demographic variables nor on four PRT anxiety measures. Only the FNE significantly differed among groups. Treatment completers in the three groups (VRCBT, CBT, and WLC) were compared on demographic variables and PRT anxiety measures. Again, no significant differences were found on demographic variables nor on four PRT anxiety measures. Only the SSPS negative significantly differed among groups. The three groups (VRCBT, CBT, and WLC) were compared on changes from pre- to post treatment on the five outcome measures. VRCBT and CBT participants did not differ significantly, and both were significantly superior to WLC participants on three measures (LSAS fear, LSAS avoidance, SSPS positive). The CBT group was superior to the WLC on one additional measure (SSPS negative). The posttreatment scores of both treatment groups were within the normal range on two measures (LSAS avoidance and SSPS positive). The VRCBT group posttreatment group scores were within the normal range on one additional measure (SPSS negative).</p>
<p>This article examined maintenance of these results at 1-year FU. The two treatment groups (VRCBT and CBT) were compared on the five anxiety measures (LSAS fear, LSAS avoidance, SSPS positive, SSPS negative, and FNE) at three time periods (PRT, POT, and FU) using MANOVA (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0145445511429999">Table 1</xref>). There were no significant differences between the two treatment groups, LSAS fear: <italic>F</italic>(1, 47) = 0.98, <italic>p</italic> = .33; LSAS avoidance: <italic>F</italic>(1, 46) = 0.45, <italic>p</italic> = .50; SSPS positive: <italic>F</italic>(1, 45) = 2.42, <italic>p</italic> = .13; SSPS negative, <italic>F</italic>(1, 45) = 3.07, <italic>p</italic> = .09; FNE: <italic>F</italic>(1, 47) = 0.56, <italic>p</italic> = .68. There was a significant time main effect for all measures, LSAS fear: <italic>F</italic>(2, 46) = 21.00, <italic>p</italic> ≤ .001; LSAS avoidance: <italic>F</italic>(2, 45) = 26.8, <italic>p</italic> ≤ .0001; SSPS positive: <italic>F</italic>(2, 44) = 34.52, <italic>p</italic> ≤ .0001; SSPS negative: <italic>F</italic>(2, 44) = 11.31, <italic>p</italic> ≤ .0001; FNE: <italic>F</italic>(2, 42) = 13.03, <italic>p</italic> ≤ .0005.</p>

<p>To examine treatment maintenance, <italic>t</italic> tests comparing FU scores on both PRT and POT scores were performed (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0145445511429999">Table 1</xref>). For four variables, LSAS avoidance, SSPS positive, SSPS negative, and FNE, FU measures differed significantly from PRT measures but not from POT measures, indicating maintenance of treatment gains, LSAS avoidance: FU versus PRT, <italic>t</italic>(48) = 7.70, <italic>p</italic> ≤ .001; FU versus POT, <italic>t</italic>(47) = 1.52, <italic>p</italic> = .14; SSPS positive: FU versus PRT, <italic>t</italic>(46) = 6.92, <italic>p</italic> ≤ .0001; FU versus POT, <italic>t</italic>(47) = 0.09, <italic>p</italic> = .93; SSPS negative: FU versus PRT, <italic>t</italic>(46) = 4.24, <italic>p</italic> ≤ .0001; FU versus POT, <italic>t</italic>(47) = 1.34, <italic>p</italic> = .19; FNE: FU versus PRT, <italic>t</italic>(48) = 5.14, <italic>p</italic> ≤ .0001; FU versus POT, <italic>t</italic>(46) = 3.23, <italic>p</italic> ≤ .005.</p>
<p>As the interaction on LSAS fear was significant, we examined the changes for each group separately. The VRCBT group FU scores differed significantly from PRT scores, but not from POT scores, indicating maintenance of treatment gains, FU versus PRT, <italic>t</italic>(24) = 3.75, <italic>p</italic> ≤ .001; FU versus POT, <italic>t</italic>(24) = 0.66, <italic>p</italic> = .51. FU scores differed significantly for the CBT group, from both PRT and POT scores. Examining the means (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0145445511429999">Table 1</xref>), it is clear that this group continued to improve from post treatment to FU, reducing their mean scores from 33.33 at PRT to 25.30 at POT to 20.63 at FU, FU versus PRT, <italic>t</italic>(23) = 5.36, <italic>p</italic> ≤ .0001; FU versus POT, <italic>t</italic>(23) = 4.50, <italic>p</italic> ≤ .0005.</p>
<p>We examined clinical significance of the changes in our original study. We found that the VRCBT group POT scores on LSAS avoidance, SSPS positive, and SSPS negative were now within the normative range, and the CBT group POT scores on LSAS avoidance and SSPS positive were also within the normative range. Although the reduction from PRT to POT of the remainder of the scores was statistically significant, this reduction was not clinically significant (normative level). We performed similar tests on the FU scores and found that both treatment groups maintained normative scores, thus the clinically significant changes from PRT to POT were retained at FU: LSAS avoidance—CBT: the difference between the FU mean and the nonclinical mean was smaller than 1 <italic>SD, t</italic>(22) = 3.56, <italic>p</italic> ≤ .001; there was no significant difference between the FU mean and the nonclinical mean, <italic>t</italic>(22) = 0.29, n.s.; VRCBT: the difference between the FU mean and the nonclinical mean was smaller than 1 <italic>SD, t</italic>(24) = 5.82, <italic>p</italic> ≤ .0001; there was no significant difference between the FU mean and the nonclinical mean, <italic>t</italic>(24) = 0.37, n.s.—and SSPS positive scores—CBT: the difference between the FU mean and the nonclinical mean was smaller than 1 <italic>SD, t</italic>(21) = 3.57, <italic>p</italic> ≤ .001; there was no significant difference between the FU mean and the nonclinical mean, <italic>t</italic>(21) = 0.73, n.s.; VRCBT: the difference between the FU mean and the nonclinical mean was smaller than 1 <italic>SD, t</italic>(24) = 2.92, <italic>p</italic> ≤ .005; there was no significant difference between the FU mean and the nonclinical mean, <italic>t</italic>(24) = 0.89, n.s. FU scores on the LSAS fear, were not clinically significant at posttest and were not clinically significant at FU, CBT—the difference between the FU mean and the nonclinical mean was smaller than 1 <italic>SD, t</italic>(23) = 1.88, <italic>p</italic> ≤ .05; however, there was a significant difference between the FU mean and the nonclinical mean, <italic>t</italic>(23) = 2.18, <italic>p</italic> ≤ .05. VRCBT—the difference between the FU mean and the nonclinical mean was smaller than 1 <italic>SD, t</italic>(24) = 2.20, <italic>p</italic> ≤ .05; however, there was a significant difference between the FU mean and the nonclinical mean, <italic>t</italic>(24) = 3.24, <italic>p</italic> ≤ .005. FNE scores were not clinically significant at POT nor at FU, CBT—the difference between the FU mean and the nonclinical mean was not smaller than 1 <italic>SD, t</italic>(23) = 0.38, n.s., and there was a significant difference between the FU mean and the nonclinical mean, <italic>t</italic>(23) = 3.01, <italic>p</italic> ≤ .005; VRCBT—the difference between the FU mean and the nonclinical mean was not smaller than 1 <italic>SD, t</italic>(24) = 0.39, n.s.; and there was a significant difference between the FU mean and the nonclinical mean, <italic>t</italic>(24) = 3.00, <italic>p</italic> ≤ .005. For the SSPS negative, the CBT group’s scores were not clinically significant at POT nor at FU, the difference between the FU mean and the nonclinical mean was not smaller than 1 <italic>SD, t</italic>(21) = 1.98, n.s., and there was a significant difference between the FU mean and the nonclinical mean, <italic>t</italic>(21) = 5.17, <italic>p</italic> ≤ .0001; however, the VRCBT group’s scores were clinically significant at POT and failed to meet clinical significance at FU, the difference between the FU mean and the nonclinical mean was not smaller than 1 <italic>SD, t</italic>(24) = 2.99, n.s., and there was a significant difference between the FU mean and the nonclinical mean, <italic>t</italic>(24) = 7.16, <italic>p</italic> ≤ .0001.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>PSA is a common and debilitating disorder. Treatment of choice has been CBT. However, exposure in CBT, whether in vivo or in vitro, presents difficulties for therapist and client. VR surmounts these difficulties and offers an attractive alternative therapy. A recent meta-analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0145445511429999">Powers &amp; Emmelkamp, 2008</xref>) demonstrated that VRCBT is as effective and perhaps even more effective than conventional CBT in treating anxiety disorders. Previous research on generalized social phobia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0145445511429999">Klinger et al., 2005</xref>) as well as in PSA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0145445511429999">Anderson, Rothbaum, &amp; Hodges, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0145445511429999">Anderson, Zimand, Hodges, &amp; Rothbaum, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0145445511429999">Harris, Kemmerling, &amp; North, 2002</xref>; North, North, &amp; Coble, 1998 cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0145445511429999">Wiederhold &amp; Wiederhold, 2005</xref>) found that VRCBT is an effective therapy for PSA. However, these studies employed small samples, nonrandom assignment, and/or lacked control groups. In our original study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0145445511429999">Wallach et al., 2009</xref>), we used large treatment groups (28-30 participants per group), with random assignment, a WLC group, and several measures of anxiety (subjective questionnaires as well as a behavioral task).We demonstrated that VRCBT was as effective as but not superior to CBT and that both treatments were significantly more effective than no treatment (WLC). Thus, we were able to demonstrate that VRCBT and CBT were effective treatments for PSA. Our results were statistically significant for both treatment groups on all of the self-rating questionnaires we used (LSAS fear, LSAS avoidance, SSPS positive statements, SSPS negative statements, FNE) and for self-rating of performance on the behavioral task, but nonsignificant on observer ratings of the behavioral task. In addition, in our previous article (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0145445511429999">Wallach et al., 2009</xref>), we reported large effect sizes for anxiety reduction following treatment (0.58-1.00). Examination of the clinical significance of the findings revealed that on the LSAS avoidance scale and on the SSPS positive statements of both treatment groups (VRCBT and CBT) and on the SSPS negative statements of the VRCBT group, participants significantly improved following treatment and now scored within the “normal” range on these measures. Unfortunately, our findings on the LSAS Fear scale for both treatment groups, and on the SSPS Negative Statements scale for the CBT group were unclear regarding clinical significance.</p>
<p>Notably, our FU results demonstrate that these effects were maintained on all measures at 1 year. Following treatment, we reported nonclinical significance on LSAS fear, while finding clinical significance on LSAS avoidance in both treatment groups. These findings suggested that treatment helped to reduce avoidance to a nonclinical level, whereas fear level had not as yet been reduced to a nonclinical level. Therefore, the 12-session treatment program we used enabled the participants to engage in tasks they previously avoided, with significantly lessened degree of fear, which was still higher than that of a nonclinical population. Perhaps fear reduction requires more than a 12-session program. We planned a FU study to examine fear levels to determine whether additional public speaking experiences would further reduce clients’ fear to nonclinical levels. We are pleased to report that, as predicted, additional experience reduced fear levels. In addition, the VRCBT group SSPS negative scores, which were clinically significant POT were no longer significant at FU. We may conclude that VRCBT is an effective alternative to CBT, and positive results were maintained for both treatment groups. In fact, the CBT group showed improvement on one measure (LSAS fear) from posttreatment to FU.</p>
<p>However, we should like to add a note of caution regarding generalizability of our findings. Our participants were predominantly young, single women, reflecting our university population, which is composed of 79% women. Although we have no reason to assume that the results would be different for men and/or married and/or older participants, it is important to extend this research using a more diverse participant group. As CBT and VRCBT entail effective and brief treatment regimens whose therapy protocols can easily be taught to trainee as well as experienced psychotherapists, we anticipate that our positive findings will encourage wider employment of CBT and VRCBT for PSA as well as for other anxiety disorders. The cost of a complete VR system has been drastically reduced as technology becomes readily available. PCs are available at most clinics, and a head-mounted display and software may be purchased for less than $3,000, easily enabling the adoption of VR techniques.</p>
