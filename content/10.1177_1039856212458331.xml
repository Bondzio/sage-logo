<p>Review of <italic>A Dangerous Method</italic>, released 2011, directed by David Cronenberg</p>
<p>Why did psychoanalysis emerge a century ago and why, as opposed to other ideas and movements of the time, was it so dominated by the personalities of its leading figures? If the carefully nurtured legend perpetuated by the Freud movement is accepted as canon, it was the Master’s courageous self-analysis, the first in history to examine the hitherto hidden aspects of the mind.</p>
<p>This myth we can safely put to rest. As Ellenberger and others have shown, the unconscious was an idea whose time had come. The fairest assessment would be that the concepts swirling in German Romanticism coalesced around the figure of Freud, a man who nurtured suitably messianic ambitions for such an enterprise.</p>
<p>Freud encountered all the difficulties expected for a prophet of a new church in launching such a radical new concept. While Freud succeeded in getting psychoanalysis to become a social and intellectual force <italic>sans pareil</italic>, its vulgarisation, notably in the American incarnation, was hardly desirable. The target audience was largely disdainful, if not hostile, and the first followers were a wild Bohemian group of misfits, ever scrapping among themselves and snipping at the Master’s heels. Like any charismatic leader, uneasily sat the head that wore the crown and challengers were always in the offing. Added to this was a special problem for the descendent of Galician shtetl dwellers – they were all Jews.</p>
<p>The enlistment of Eugen Bleuler and Carl Jung was an important step in breaking free of Viennese <italic>Schlamperei</italic>. Jung was regarded as the coming man of European psychiatry and Freud, who was not a psychiatrist, had no hesitation in declaring him the Crown Prince of the fledgling movement and new kingdom.</p>
<p>From the start, Jung and Freud needed each other: Jung was to provide credibility in the gentile world, and Freud to provide solutions to the cosmic ideas that he struggled to contain within himself. For Jung, notwithstanding his protestations of being no more than a simple Swiss bourgeois, carried heavy emotional baggage. His mother lived in a strange occult world of mysticism, telepathy, ESP, spiritualism and séances – issues that were transfused to her son in spades. Sex, too, troubled him and answers were unlikely to be found in strait-laced Calvinist Zurich. So what started off as a meeting of kindred spirits, if not like minds, was always bound to end in tears.</p>
<p>Which brings us to the movie, revolving around the unlikely protagonist, a disturbed Russian Jew, Sabina Spielrein. Her father was a wealthy businessman, which is why she could afford to go to the famous Burghölzli Hospital, where she came under the care of Jung. He used the new method of treatment, producing a remarkable improvement and, with his encouragement, Spielrein went to medical school with the intention of doing psychiatry. The relationship between the two deepened way beyond that of doctor and patient and a turbulent love affair developed, rumours of the affair soon reaching Vienna.</p>
<p>Jung consulted Freud about his patient and when she wrote to Freud about the affair, he first refused to believe her. As his relationship with Jung sped onto the rocks, Freud accepted that he had been wrong and agreed to take on Spielrein as a patient. Later she was to have an important influence on his concept of the death instinct.</p>
<p>At the tip of the iceberg of disturbed psychoanalysis was the short sharp explosion of Otto Gross, the original wild analyst. Gross was sent to the hospital by his father in the hope of controlling his excessive behaviour. Here he came under the care of Jung, or possibly the other way round. Gross’ idea of attaining freedom through a Dionysian existence, breaking every rule along the way, seemed to have tipped Jung off the last edge of any restraint. After Spielrein followed a long series of affairs with patients, notably Toni Wolff, whom he moved in under his own roof with his long-suffering wife.</p>
<p>After Jung left, Freud had to suffer a series of defections, heresies and tragedies, the breakaway of Alfred Adler and the suicide of Victor Tausk being just two examples. Free of Freud but not quite of Spielrein, Jung now broke away from his professional constraints, setting up in private practice, attracting a group of followers and establishing his own school – or rather church, noting his comment that he was glad to be Jung rather than a Jungian. He went through a psychotic episode of some severity, spending much of this time in the tower he had built on his estate. When he eventually emerged, his writing began to traverse ever wilder fields, including such recondite matters as astrology, mysticism, alchemy, mental telepathy and extra-terrestrial life. Another aspect of his beliefs came to the fore with the rise of the Nazis. He supported their leitmotif of Aryan racial superiority and joined the Quisling faux-psychoanalytic organisation set up under Herman Goering’s cousin. After the war, Jung succeeded in covering his tracks, although only a few of his followers would now believe that he was free of anti-Semitism.</p>
<p>In this fashion the two men went their own ways to their respective destinies. The only one of the three to come out of it with any credit was Spielrein, who returned to Russia where she became an influential figure in the psychoanalytic scene (one of her analysands had been Jean Piaget) before she was murdered by the Nazis in 1942, having earlier lost her husband and brother in the Stalinist purges.</p>
<p>Director David Cronenberg has gone to some effort to reduce a complex and protracted, if not confused, situation to manageable proportions. The usual lush scenes of Vienna and Zurich are kept to a minimum with the focus largely on interiors. Freud’s famous office, a glyptotheca of archaeological <italic>tzatzkes</italic>, seems more of a stage setting for his mental geography than ever. Viggo Mortensen does a fine job reprising his role as the Meshiach of Bergasse while Michael Fassbender is more than a match for the Jung character, although far too handsome – Jung at that stage had a faintly vulpine air about him. The same cannot be said about Keira Knightley, who appears to have decided to portray Spielrein as an encephalitis lethargica sufferer having an extended oculogyric crisis.</p>
<p>Freud’s women, the middle-class hysterics that he wrote up, all presented with dramatic symptoms we now enjoy diagnosing as anything from Tourette’s Syndrome to temporal lobe epilepsy. Of these, Spielrein and Bertha Pappenheim, whom we know as Anna O. (actually treated by Josef Breuer), show the most symmetry. Pappenheim, contrary to the legend, had a wretched time in treatment, eventually recovering largely through her own and others’ efforts and going on to become a pioneering social worker.</p>
<p>The same can be said for Spielrein once she extracted herself from the Mashiach of Vienna and the ür-Shaman of Zurich. All in all, the whole affair was an appalling business and, if nothing else, was to show that those who get caught in the headlights of warring cultic conquistadors are invariably brushed aside as collateral damage once their use-by date is achieved. But whereas Spielrein went on to grow the hair of the dog that bit her, Pappenheim utterly disavowed anything to do with psychoanalysis and was bitterly critical of it to the end of her life. You can take your pick as to who chose the better path.</p>
