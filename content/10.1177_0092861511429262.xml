            <p>The Prescription Drug User Fee Act of 1992 (PDUFA) established pharmaceutical review performance goals and authorized the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to collect user fees in conjunction with pharmaceutical marketing applications. There have been 3 subsequent reauthorizations of PDUFA; the most recent, referred to as PDUFA IV, was enacted with the Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007. PDUFA IV is set to expire on September 30, 2012, and it is expected that another reauthorization (herein referred to as PDUFA V) will be enacted before PDUFA IV expires. Industry and FDA, with stakeholder input, have held technical discussions to develop and agree upon performance goals for PDUFA V, which are proposed for congressional consideration. The discussions took place amid concerns that drug approvals were taking longer under PDUFA IV than under previous PDUFA programs. This article presents an analysis of the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research application approval data, assessing changes in time from submission to approval and identifying and addressing hypotheses regarding the causes of those changes. The analyses support the potential for the proposed goals and process changes in the PDUFA V agreement to lead to improvements in overall approval time.</p>

         <title>Introduction</title>
         <p>The Prescription Drug User Fee Act of 1992 (PDUFA) and its subsequent reauthorizations establish pharmaceutical review performance goals for the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and authorize the agency to collect user fees in conjunction with pharmaceutical marketing applications. In the 2 decades since PDUFA was originally enacted, the program has been successful in enhancing timely access to new drug and biologic therapies and strengthening the agency’s pharmaceutical review and safety programs. The PDUFA program has been reauthorized 3 times since the initial legislation: in 1997 (PDUFA II) in conjunction with the Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act, in 2002 (PDUFA III) as part of the Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response Act, and in 2007 (PDUFA IV) with the Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act (FDAAA). The FDAAA was signed by President Bush on September 27, 2007, and became operative on October 1 of that year.</p>
         <p>With each reauthorization, as with the initial statute, industry group representatives have met with FDA management to discuss the process and agree on potential improvements and new fees to propose for congressional authorization. More recently, other stakeholders have become more formally involved as well. PDUFA IV is set to expire on September 30, 2012, and members of the health care community, including the FDA, industry, and stakeholders, have been working toward the next reauthorization.</p>

      <sec id="section2-0092861511429262">
         <title>Evolution of the FDA-Managed Review Process Under PDUFA</title>
         <p>Performance goals in early PDUFA programs focused on the drug approval process. The goals require timely actions but never require approvals or other favorable actions. The principal goals require the FDA to complete a review and either approve or communicate any and all deficiencies within a defined period called a “review cycle.” Under certain circumstances, when additional information is submitted by the applicant, the cycle can be extended for 3 months. When the applicant responds fully to the deficiencies described at the end of the first cycle, a second cycle begins.</p>
         <p>As the program achieved early success and matured with each reauthorization, it expanded to address interactions between the FDA and industry, FDA facilitation of drug development, and the postmarket drug safety system.</p>
         <p>In 2007, in addition to authorizing PDUFA IV, Congress enacted Title IX of FDAAA, which gave the FDA several new authorities and responsibilities related to drug safety. Under FDAAA, the agency may require an applicant to undertake a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (REMS) if the agency determines that a REMS is necessary to ensure the benefits of the drug outweigh its risks.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0092861511429262">1</xref>
            </sup> In addition, FDAAA requires the agency to refer new molecular entities (NMEs) to an advisory committee (AC) prior to approval or state in the approval letter why the NME was not referred.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0092861511429262">2</xref>
            </sup> In response to FDAAA’s mandate and to make effective the intent of the provision, the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) implemented its current policy that most but not all NMEs, including new biologics license applications (BLAs), will be discussed at public AC meetings.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0092861511429262">3</xref>
            </sup>
         </p>
         <p>Throughout the PDUFA program, the FDA has updated its internal processes for review of applications. In PDUFA III, the agency agreed to develop guidance for both review staff and industry on good review management principles and practices (GRMPs)<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0092861511429262">4</xref>
            </sup> as they apply to the first cycle review of drug and biologic applications. The GRMPs describe best practices for review under PDUFA and outline the FDA’s review activities, including procedures and objectives for communicating with applicants, during each phase of the review cycle. During PDUFA IV, CDER also introduced the 21st-Century Review Process,<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0092861511429262">5</xref>
            </sup> which converts best practices into a more detailed guide for CDER review staff.</p>

      <sec id="section3-0092861511429262">
         <title>Review Metrics Under PDUFA IV and Planning for PDUFA V</title>
         <p>In 2010, preparations for negotiating PDUFA V recommendations began amid widespread concerns that drug review and approvals were taking longer under PDUFA IV. Indeed, citing workload and resource constraints in the face of growing demands, in November 2007, John Jenkins, MD, Director of the Office of New Drugs in CDER (OND), authorized OND managers to exercise greater flexibility regarding meeting PDUFA goals. This authorization was withdrawn in October 2009.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0092861511429262">3</xref>
            </sup>
         </p>
         <p>Even when PDUFA IV review goals were met, the evidence indicated that a smaller percentage of drugs were getting approved within the first cycle without extensions, and growing numbers required extensions or additional cycles. That in turn led to longer times from application submission to approval. The FDA and industry put forward many hypotheses to explain this phenomenon, including the following:</p>
         <list list-type="bullet">
            <list-item>
               <p>FDA resources: Many FDAAA mandates on the FDA did not come with additional resources. Although PDUFA IV provided additional user fee resources to meet new drug safety-related requirements on the FDA and increased appropriations in 2008 supplemented the agency’s budget, it takes time to recruit and train new personnel and have them mature into efficient reviewers.</p>
            </list-item>
            <list-item>
               <p>Advisory committee meetings: The FDAAA requirement for AC deliberations created timeline issues because the meetings must occur after reviews are largely complete and can add time to the approval process (eg, through scheduling delays or additional information requests).</p>
            </list-item>
            <list-item>
               <p>Risk evaluation and mitigation strategy: The process for developing REMS generally started late in the review process (ie, after safety issues were well reviewed and application approval was likely) and was time consuming for various reasons.</p>
               <list list-type="simple">
                  <list-item>
                     <p>Limited empiric experience and precedent existed to guide the design of REMS.</p>
                  </list-item>
                  <list-item>
                     <p>Establishing REMS required detailed negotiations that involved balancing desirable versus practical mitigation activities.</p>
                  </list-item>
                  <list-item>
                     <p>The FDA’s internal process for REMS, which required interactions among various units—Office of New Drugs, Office of Safety and Epidemiology, Office of Regulatory Policy, and Office of Chief Counsel—had not been optimized.</p>
                  </list-item>
               </list>
            </list-item>
            <list-item>
               <p>Inspections: The increasing globalization of drug manufacture and development led to increased FDA international inspections. Fitting foreign inspections within PDUFA timelines was said to be even more challenging because of State Department foreign travel clearance processes and budgetary considerations.</p>
            </list-item>
            <list-item>
               <p>Food and Drug Administration practices: The review practices outlined in GRMPs were inconsistently followed; the 21st-Century Review Process was not implemented for all applications.</p>
            </list-item>
            <list-item>
               <p>Poor communication and collaboration: Some FDA reviewers, under pressure to meet timelines and perhaps to avoid appearing too close to industry, were reluctant to communicate deficiencies during the review and more likely to communicate them only after completing the review. This strategy often led to the agency meeting PDUFA timelines but at the cost of subsequent review cycles and applicants submitting extra data or analyses for review.</p>
            </list-item>
            <list-item>
               <p>Complex applications: Drug development is more complex, increasingly involving biomarkers, meta-analyses, adaptive trial designs, patient-reported outcomes, noninferiority trials, and other aspects that increase review demands and time.</p>
            </list-item>
            <list-item>
               <p>Application quality: In some applications, important information is incomplete, difficult to locate, or not well analyzed, increasing review demands.</p>
            </list-item>
            <list-item>
               <p>Lack of standardization: Electronic submissions are not well standardized, thus requiring inordinate amounts of time to navigate and review.</p>
            </list-item>
            <list-item>
               <p>Risk aversion: Some argued that growing safety concerns and risk aversion subsequent to some well-publicized specific drug safety concerns have led to more data demands prior to approval.</p>
            </list-item>
         </list>
         <p>Entering the PDUFA V negotiations, the FDA suggested that extending the duration of the initial review cycle would, paradoxically, shorten the overall times to approval. The logic in such an approach is that various factors in review, including inspections, REMS, complex applications, and AC meetings, led to the resolution of many issues late in the first cycle, leading in most cases to cycle extensions or second cycles, which added several months to the process. The FDA asserted that more time in the first cycle, if appropriately managed, potentially could lead to resolution of those issues in the first cycle and earlier final decisions, including faster approvals. The FDA also believed that further standardization of electronic filings and REMS, as well as further resourcing of regulatory science, could improve the process and speed of review.</p>
         <p>Industry entered negotiations with the perception that a key to facilitating earlier completion of review—and thus faster approvals—would be earlier communication of potential issues and deficiencies by the FDA reviewer to the applicant. Earlier communication would allow the applicant to clear up misunderstandings, assist the reviewer in finding and assembling relevant data, and give the applicant a head start in providing additional data and information to address concerns not adequately addressed in the application.</p>
         <p>To design and implement improvements to the PDUFA review processes that would improve times to drug approval while ensuring quality review, one must understand what factors truly have been drivers of time to approval. In this article, we explore available data with regard to how the PDUFA process has functioned with regard to time from submission to approval, with emphasis on comparing data from the first 2 years of PDUFA IV, during which concerns about slower times to approval arose, with those from PDUFA III. Those data address several of the hypotheses listed above and thus shed light on some of the proposals for improving the PDUFA process. Our analyses provide rationale and support for the proposed review process modifications in the PDUFA V agreement reached between industry and the FDA with input from other stakeholders.</p>

               <title>Submission Cohorts</title>
               <p>We analyzed review and approval data for groups of products whose applications were submitted within a specific federal FY or years (referred to as submission cohorts). The FY of submission determines the PDUFA process that applies and reflects staffing and relevant policies. Each submission cohort included all NMEs, including new BLAs, for which an application was received and filed by CDER during the specified period.</p>
               <p>The PDUFA IV processes took effect for all applications submitted on or after October 1, 2007. Some FDAAA provisions (eg, new AC requirements) applied to any application under review at the FDA as of October 1, 2007. Still other FDAAA provisions (eg, REMS) applied to any application under review at the FDA (or already approved) as of March 25, 2008. As a result of the evolving regulatory requirements and landscape, the FY 07 submission cohort was a transition cohort, partially affected by new FDAAA requirements and resourcing changes due to PDUFA IV. To assess the impact of FDAAA and PDUFA IV process changes and associated staffing changes on review performance, we excluded the transitional FY 07 cohort and defined 2 cohorts for comparison: (1) the PDUFA III submission cohort, comprising the FY 03 through FY 06 submission cohorts, and (2) the PDUFA IV submission cohort, comprising the FY 08 and FY 09 submission cohorts.</p>

               <title>Approved Submission Cohorts</title>
               <p>Whereas our data were primarily obtained from review of published CDER approval packages, most data were available only for those applications ultimately approved. As a result, we defined for analysis “approved submission cohorts” (ie, cohorts of NME and new BLA applications that had been received by the FDA in a specific FY and approved). To ensure comparability of such cohorts over time, we used a fixed period, 2 years from date of receipt, to qualify for being in the approved submission cohorts. We chose 2 years because it comprised the amount of follow-up available for our most recent cohort, FY 09, which includes submissions received in September 2009. Also, applications approved within 2 years are less likely to have included major defects requiring time-consuming generation of new data (ie, new clinical trials) and thus are a more fruitful place to look for how aspects of the PDUFA process might accelerate approvals.</p>

            <p>It is possible that the increased times to approval seen early in PDUFA IV were a transient phenomenon related to lag times in implementing new processes, staffing increases, and training needed to address the new requirements imposed by FDAAA. To assess this possibility, we compared the times to approval within the PDUFA IV approved submission cohort for the FY 08 cohort and FY 09 cohort for priority (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0092861511429262">Table 4</xref>) and standard (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0092861511429262">Table 5</xref>) applications and found only minor differences. CDER significantly increased staffing in FY 08 and 09,<sup>

            <title>Assessment of Factors Possibly Affecting Times to Approval</title>
            <p>Many have asserted that approvals occur more rapidly when FDA reviewers communicate deficiencies to applicants during their review so applicants can begin to address the issues or correct misunderstandings. One communication tool in the PDUFA process specifically designed to facilitate communications when one discipline (eg, clinical, toxicology, chemistry, and manufacturing controls) has completed its review before others is the discipline review letter. In our analysis of the PDUFA IV approved submission cohort, discipline review letters were issued for only 6 of 20 (30%) priority applications and 4 of 24 (17%) standard applications. In the corresponding PDUFA III cohort, the frequencies of 1 or more discipline review letters were 8 of 47 (17%) for priority applications and 5 of 25 (20%) for standard applications.</p>
            <p>In looking at PDUFA IV approval timing by individual CDER divisions, we found that the majority of divisions reviewed 4 or fewer applications in the approved submission cohort and thus could not be meaningfully analyzed separately. However, the 2 divisions with the largest numbers of approvals had 5 of 6 (83%) and 3 of 6 (50%) approvals occurring by the original PDUFA goal date. In contrast, for all other divisions pooled, only 8 of 32 applications (25%) in the approved submissions cohort were approved by the original PDUFA goal date.</p>
            <p>As noted above, FDAAA implementation created new demands on the FDA by requiring more AC meetings and requiring REMS. To assess the relationship of AC meetings and REMS to approval times, we analyzed the PDUFA IV approved submission cohort by the presence or absence of AC meetings or REMS (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-0092861511429262">Tables 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table7-0092861511429262">7</xref>). The presence of an AC meeting was associated with over 6 months longer times to approval for priority applications, over 4.5 months longer times to approval for standard applications, and very low frequency of approval by initial PDUFA goal date (13% priority applications, 18% standard applications). The presence of REMS was also associated with over 6 months longer times to approval for priority applications, over 3.5 months longer times to approval for standard applications, and very low frequency of approval by initial PDUFA goal date (0% for priority applications, 27% for standard applications). The presence of both AC meetings and REMS was associated with longer times to approval than the presence of either (data not shown).</p>

            <p>For priority applications, the 6-month review cycle can make accommodation of ACs and REMS particularly challenging. Of note in this regard, of the 10 applications in the PDUFA IV approved submission cohort that received extensions of the first cycle goal date, 9 (90%) were discussed at an AC meeting and 7 (70%) had REMS. Incidences of AC meetings and REMS were higher in applications that received first cycle extensions than for applications not receiving such extensions.</p>
            <p>The FDA has also identified the increase in global pharmaceutical sourcing and development programs as a factor leading to increased time to approval because of the demand on the FDA to perform international inspections. The FDA states that State Department clearance processes plus FDA resource constraints create difficulties in scheduling inspections early enough in the review cycle to allow for the resolution of issues identified by the inspections. We do not have data directly examining the relationship of inspections to approval time, but the total numbers of good clinical practice (GCP) and good manufacturing practice (GMP) inspections conducted by the FDA rose substantially, nearly doubling between the time of the PDUFA III and IV cohorts (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table8-0092861511429262">Table 8</xref>). It is not possible to distinguish preapproval inspections from other types of inspections; however, published FDA data indicate the majority of foreign GMP inspections are preapproval related.<sup>

         <title>Discussion</title>
         <p>Our analyses support various insights regarding times from submission to approval as the PDUFA process has evolved. The data show that times to approval were longer for the PDUFA IV approved submission cohort than for the PDUFA III cohort. This trend was most clearly apparent for priority applications but also true for standard applications. Although the increased FDA hiring in FY 08 and 09 and FDA processes described in the GRMPs and 21st-Century Review Process may yet improve times to approval, no clear trend for faster approvals was seen in the FY 09 approved submission cohort compared with the FY 08 cohort.</p>
         <p>In contrast with the PDUFA III cohort, only a minority of applications in the PDUFA IV approved submission cohort was approved by the original first cycle goals established in PDUFA; most applications required cycle extensions or second cycles to allow resolution of issues identified by the FDA during review. Median and mean times to approval were well in excess of the original PDUFA review goal. The implications of these findings for redesigning the PDUFA process are substantial. They suggest that length of time to the first cycle review deadline is a less important driver of the time to approval than the frequency of cycle extensions and second cycles. As extensions and second cycles occur when issues arise during the review that are not resolved in the first cycle, process enhancements that expedite identification, communication, and resolution of issues might decrease the numbers of extensions and extra cycles, thereby shortening time to approval. Although discipline review letters were implemented to facilitate timely communication of issues, they are applicable only under limited circumstances, and our analysis found they were used in a rather small proportion of applications.</p>
         <p>The informally noted experience of many in industry that some FDA divisions have more timely approvals than others is grounded in fact. The 2 divisions with the largest number of approvals in the PDUFA IV cohort each had significantly more approvals by the original PDUFA goal date than did other divisions. These differences could result from a variety of factors, including the nature and amount of workload and staffing. Nonetheless, this finding suggests there may be an opportunity for identifying and generalizing best practices across divisions. Similarly, FDA officials have noted variability in application completeness and quality as factors contributing to time to approval, so adoption of best practices by applicants with regard to preparing complete, clear, readily reviewable applications would likely also improve the review process.</p>
         <p>Notwithstanding the potential value of adoption of best practices within the current PDUFA process, our data suggest that specific causes of prolonged times to approval might be addressed through changes to the PDUFA process. The FDA hypothesized that the added responsibilities in FDAAA—specifically, the need to hold more AC meetings and the advent of REMS—could be major drivers of lengthening application approval time. Our findings are supportive of this argument in that the presence of an REMS and/or an AC meeting for an application was associated with a substantially longer time to approval and a substantially lower likelihood of approval by the original PDUFA goal date. A number of factors may explain this observation, including the following: (1) because AC meetings and advanced REMS negotiations require a significant amount of time and resources and can take place only after the FDA has completed much of its review, fitting them into the current initial review cycle may be challenging; (2) issues, concerns, and data requests may emerge at an AC meeting or in REMS planning at a point too late to allow resolution within the first cycle, thereby leading to an extension or another cycle; and (3) the need for AC meetings and/or REMS may act as surrogates for other aspects of application complexity that drive longer approval times.</p>
         <p>The FDA performed far more foreign inspections per year during PDUFA IV than during PDUFA III, consistent with the possibility that the scheduling and conduct of foreign inspections may account for some of the trends with regard to approval times. Although we could not access data regarding the specific process for scheduling foreign inspections and the impact of such inspections on timeliness of approvals, the growing number of foreign inspections supports agency assertions that this is a factor in approval timeliness. Inspections occurring late in the first cycle may give rise to observations that, even if readily addressable, cannot be resolved within the cycle.</p>
         <p>Improved processes and staffing may accommodate somewhat earlier AC meetings, development of REMS, and completion of foreign inspections in some cases. However, there is a limit on how early some of these activities can occur because the FDA must substantially complete its review to conduct a useful AC meeting and, in many cases, to progress toward completion of an REMS. When REMS, AC meetings, or inspections lead to issues requiring time to resolve late in the process, the only options allowing the FDA to meet its PDUFA goals under the current process are to complete its review, notify the applicant of all deficiencies, and reserve resolution until the next review cycle or, if major amendments have been received late in the cycle, to extend the cycle.</p>
         <p>The limitations of the current process to address issues within the first cycle, particularly late emerging issues and issues identified early by the FDA but not communicated to the applicant, appear to be a major driver of longer times to approval. Completion of a review cycle and issuance of letters describing all deficiencies in an application are time-consuming in their own right. Once a cycle is completed, no deadline remains to drive issue resolution; even after the applicant responds, the new deadline is months away. Deadline-driven urgency drops, and work on other projects may take priority over resolution of remaining issues. A process that enables early identification and communication of issues with an objective of resolving issues within the first cycle could result in earlier approvals.</p>
         <p>The analysis presented here suggests that shorter first cycles might not lead to more rapid reviews but instead might lead to more pressure to minimize communication and issue resolution within the review cycle, leading to greater use of extensions or second cycles. A modified PDUFA process that acknowledges and accommodates the growing complexity of applications and growing demands on the review process while providing incentive and opportunity for early communication and rapid resolution of issues would be more apt to lead to more timely approvals.</p>

         <title>Conclusion</title>
         <p>In conclusion, we find that approval times were indeed longer under the initial years of PDUFA IV than PDUFA III, and fewer applications were approved by the initial PDUFA review cycle deadlines. Although almost certainly room exists in some cases for both improved application quality and standardization and improved FDA processes, our analyses have identified factors in the PDUFA process that could drive time to earlier approvals.</p>
         <p>Our data and analyses suggest that shorter PDUFA review cycles might not lead to more rapid approvals. Instead, they might lead to more pressure to minimize communication and issue resolution within the first cycle, thereby leading to greater use of extensions or second cycles, which add time to approval. In contrast, a process that enables and provides incentives for early identification and communication of issues; that allows sufficient time within the first cycle to accommodate resolution of issues that might arise from AC meetings, REMS, foreign inspections, and other sources; and that has a shared objective of issue resolution within the first cycle would hold promise for shortening time to approvals.</p>
         <p>Industry and FDA representatives, with input from other stakeholders, have negotiated a proposal<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0092861511429262">11</xref>
            </sup> for a PDUFA V process for NMEs, including new BLAs, that is intended to accomplish exactly this—rapid identification, communication, and resolution of issues within the first cycle. It provides various avenues for communication of FDA concerns in writing and at meetings sufficiently early in the first cycle to allow resolution of many types of issues. First cycle duration would be lengthened to accommodate some of the challenges, such as those posed by AC meetings, REMS, and foreign inspections, but would remain well below the PDUFA IV median times to approval. Under the proposed process, the FDA and applicants would share intentions of using the time and communications to resolve deficiencies wherever possible; a third party would monitor and publish data on the impact of the new process on times to approval, first cycle approvals, and other important parameters; and the FDA would provide industry and the public the opportunity to analyze and engage in discussion of how well the process is working.</p>
         <p>This agreement has received the endorsement of regulatory experts and leaders within industry and the FDA. Our analyses strongly support the underpinnings of the agreement that we believe can be a critical component of efforts to shorten times to approval while maintaining or improving review quality.</p>
