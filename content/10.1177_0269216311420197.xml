<title>Background:</title>
<p>Advanced cancer patients often experience multiple concurrent symptoms, which can have prognostic effects on patients’ quality of life. Including patients who did not experience all of the symptoms measured by an assessment tool may interfere with accurate symptom cluster identification. Varying statistical methods may also contribute to inconsistencies of cluster results.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0269216311420197">
<title>Aims:</title>
<p>To compare symptom clusters in a subgroup of patients reporting exclusively non-zero ESAS scores with those in the total patient sample. To examine whether using different statistical methods results in varied symptom clusters.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0269216311420197">
<title>Design:</title>
<p>Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Hierarchical Cluster Analysis (HCA) and Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) were performed on the ‘non-zero’ subgroup and the total patient sample to identify symptom clusters at baseline and weeks 1, 2, 4, 8 and 12 following palliative radiotherapy.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0269216311420197">
<title>Setting/participants:</title>
<p>A previous single-centre study used Principal Component Analysis to explore symptom clusters in 1296 advanced cancer patients. The present study analyzed this previously reported data set.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0269216311420197">
<title>Results:</title>
<p>Notably different symptom clusters were extracted between the two patient groups regardless of the statistical method at baseline, with the exception of a cluster composed of drowsiness, fatigue and dyspnea using Principal Component Analysis and Hierarchical Cluster Analysis. At follow-ups, different statistical methods yielded significantly varied symptom clusters.

<title>Conclusions:</title>
<p>The composition of symptom clusters varied depending on if patients with non-zero scores were excluded at baseline and on the statistical method employed. Identifying valid clusters may prove useful for bettering symptom diagnosis and management for cancer patients.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Advanced cancer patients are often poly-symptomatic, experiencing on average 11 to 13 symptoms at a time.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0269216311420197">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0269216311420197">2</xref></sup> Concurrent symptoms can jointly compromise the quality of life (QoL) of these patients in a multiplicative manner.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0269216311420197">3</xref></sup> In recent years, this concern has instigated symptom experience research to shift from the traditional single symptom approach to a more inclusive method focusing on symptom clusters.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0269216311420197">4</xref></sup> A symptom cluster is described as two or more interrelated symptoms that present simultaneously.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0269216311420197">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0269216311420197">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>Currently, there is a wealth of research in the field of oncology either identifying or verifying the presence of symptom clusters.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0269216311420197">4</xref></sup> Clusters can be empirically derived through clinical or statistical means. To date, the majority of studies statistically identifying symptom clusters have involved all eligible consenting patients that provided necessary data. However, including patients whom experienced less than all of the symptoms measured by the initial assessment tool, as indicated by severity ratings of zero, may interfere with accurate symptom cluster identification. Patients whose symptom experience lacks one or several symptoms evaluated are not representative of the entire range of symptoms of the assessment tool. This is especially problematic when using brief questionnaires as symptom data collection tools. Another issue in research statistically defining symptom clusters is the use of varying statistical methods that may contribute to inconsistencies of cluster results between studies. The primary objective of this study was to examine whether different symptom cluster findings are observed in the subgroup of patients whom reported only non-zero Edmonton Symptom Assessment System (ESAS) scores at baseline. A secondary objective was to investigate whether symptom clusters are the same when examined using three different commonly applied statistical methods.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0269216311420197" sec-type="methods">
<title>Patients and methods</title>
<p>In a previous study, we explored symptom clusters in 1296 advanced cancer patients receiving palliative radiation treatment using Principal Component Analysis at baseline.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0269216311420197">7</xref></sup> The present exploratory study analyzed the previously reported data set, which had accrued patients between January 1999 and January 2002. Employing the same data set compensates for possible inconsistencies due to factors such as different assessment tools or varied sample population characteristics. ESAS questionnaires were administered as part of routine clinical monitoring at baseline and weeks 1, 2, 4, 8 and 12. The ESAS is an 11-point scale which evaluates the following nine symptoms on a scale of zero to ten (0 = absence of symptom and 10 = worst possible symptom): pain, fatigue, nausea, depression, anxiety, drowsiness, appetite, sense of well-being, and dyspnea.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0269216311420197">8</xref></sup> This tool has been successfully validated in the cancer population.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0269216311420197">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0269216311420197">10</xref></sup> Patient demographics, cancer history, analgesic intake, and disease status were also recorded. All primary assessments were completed before radiotherapy treatment. Ethics approval was obtained from Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre. Guidelines on conduct and reporting of survey research were followed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0269216311420197">11</xref></sup> A trained research assistant administered the questionnaire and collected all other required information.</p>
<sec id="section9-0269216311420197">
<title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p>Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) and Hierarchical Cluster Analysis (HCA) were employed in the present study to identify symptom clusters.</p>
<p>PCA with varimax rotation was performed on the nine ESAS items to examine whether any interrelationships existed between symptoms at each follow-up time point. This statistical method identifies which variables (symptoms) correlate with each other in a unique stable pattern and groups them together forming a ‘component’ (cluster).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0269216311420197">12</xref></sup> The assignment of symptoms to a cluster was predicted by the highest factor loading score. A significant cluster was defined as one with an eigenvalue higher than 0.9 and explaining almost 10% of the total variance. The Cronbach’s alpha was calculated to indicate the internal consistency and reliability of the derived clusters.</p>
<p>EFA is the most commonly used statistical method in oncology symptom cluster research. Unlike the other methods, EFA assumes symptoms in a cluster share a common underlying dimension, called a latent factor, which binds these symptoms together.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0269216311420197">13</xref></sup> The factors (clusters) with eigenvalue greater than 0.9 were retained, indicating that almost 10% of variance in the symptom is shared with the latent factor after controlling for the correlation between factors. The maximum likelihood method followed by the <italic>varimax</italic> orthogonal rotation method was then applied to approximately multivariate normal data to assess covariance between symptoms. Together these two methods identify and finalize the items (symptoms) that belong to each cluster. The PROC FACTOR procedure in Statistical Analysis Software (SAS version 9.2) was conducted for this analysis. Again, the Cronbach’s alpha was generated to measure the internal consistency of clusters extracted.</p>
<p>HCA extracted clusters using average linkage between groups. Clusters were formed according to the distance between symptoms severities that was determined using Euclidian distances. This method is centered on classification, grouping similar entities together in a cluster and separating this cluster from others.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0269216311420197">14</xref></sup> HCA is also commonly employed to assort groups of individuals with similar symptom profile. HCA generates a visual diagram, or dendrogram, of clusters identified. Symptoms that join together earlier on the dendrogram are more similar and closely related than those that converge later. The PROC VARCLUS runs clusters on the basis of <italic>centroid</italic> components.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0269216311420197">
<title>Subgroup analysis of patients with non-zero baseline ESAS scores</title>
<p>Only patients who reported severity scores greater than 0 for all nine ESAS symptoms at baseline were included in the ‘non-zero’ subgroup. This resulted in a smaller sample composed of 261 patients. PCA, EFA and HCA were used to identify symptom clusters in this subgroup. Clusters extracted in the non-zero subgroup were compared with those identified in the original general sample at baseline. The same three statistical methods were then applied on follow-up data compiled from this subgroup to observe the temporal pattern of symptom clusters in patients who experienced all nine ESAS symptoms at baseline.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0269216311420197" sec-type="results">
<title>Results</title>
<p>Symptom clustering was observed in both patient samples, except in the non-zero subgroup at baseline using EFA. Symptom clusters determined using PCA, EFA and HCA at baseline in the total advanced cancer patient sample were comparable. Two to three clusters consisting of two to seven symptoms each were identified depending on the statistical method used. In the non-zero subgroup, clusters identified with PCA and EFA methods at baseline and weeks 1, 2, 4, 8 and 12 were highly diversified. One to three clusters composed of two to seven symptoms were extracted at varying time points using these two statistical methods. The symptom clusters derived are summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0269216311420197">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0269216311420197">Appendix 1</xref>.</p>

<title>Baseline symptom clusters in the total advanced patient sample versus non-zero subgroup</title>
<p>We previously performed PCA with varimax rotation on the nine ESAS symptoms in all 1296 patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0269216311420197">7</xref></sup> At baseline, three symptom clusters were identified. Cluster 1 included poor appetite, nausea, poor sense of well-being and pain. Cluster 2 consisted of fatigue, drowsiness and dyspnea. Cluster 3 was composed of anxiety and depression. In the non-zero subgroup, PCA extracted only two clusters that collectively accounted for 53% of the variance (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0269216311420197">Table 2</xref>). The first cluster composed of fatigue, drowsiness and dyspnea was identical to previously derived cluster 2 and accounted for 11% of the total variance. The second cluster, consisting of depression, anxiety, nausea, poor appetite and poor sense of well-being, bore little resemblance to the clusters previously identified in the total patient sample. The new cluster accounted for 42% of the total variance. Interestingly, the symptom ‘pain’ was not associated with any of the clusters extracted. The Cronbach’s alphas for the first and second cluster are 0.68 and 0.79 respectively.</p>
<p>The number and composition of symptom clusters identified using HCA mirrored that of PCA in both patient samples. The final three cluster solution in the total 1296 patient sample explained 61% of the total variation. The tree diagram in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0269216311420197">Figure 1</xref> is a visual representation of the three clusters identified. The final two-cluster solution in the non-zero subgroup (<italic>n</italic> = 261) explained 52% of the total variation. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0269216311420197">Figure 2</xref> shows the tree diagram illustrating the two symptom clusters identified.

<title>Temporal pattern of symptom clusters in the non-zero subgroup</title>
<p>Among the 261 eligible patients at baseline, there were 80 patients at week 1, 109 patients at week 2, 90 patients at week 4, 87 patients at week 8, and 69 patients at week 12. The temporal pattern of symptom clusters identified was highly unstable in the non-zero subgroup regardless of the type of statistical analysis employed. The number and composition of symptom clusters identified using HCA and PCA varied significantly over time. With the exception of findings at baseline, two symptom clusters were identified at each follow-up using EFA. While the quantity of clusters derived remained constant, the symptom constituents of the clusters differed considerably over time. In fact, rarely were the clusters identified by PCA, EFA or HCA at the various time points identical. The cluster findings over time are detailed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0269216311420197">Appendixes 1</xref><xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-0269216311420197"/>–<xref ref-type="table" rid="table7-0269216311420197">3</xref>.</p>
<p>While the temporal pattern of symptom clusters determined using PCA, EFA and HCA were incongruent, the findings of all three methods are in agreement regarding the variable nature of clusters over time.</p>

<sec id="section14-0269216311420197">
<title>Consistency of symptom cluster findings using the three statistical methods</title>
<p>In general, there were significant variations in symptom cluster number and composition extracted using the three different statistical methods at each time point. Occasionally, cluster findings using PCA were analogous to those employing HCA at baseline and week 1. Similarities are also briefly noted between the findings of EFA and HCA at weeks 4 and 8. While whole cluster composition varied over time, some core symptoms within clusters consistently occurred in conjunction regardless of the shifting of other symptoms. With a single exception at week 1 using HCA, the symptoms anxiety, depression and poor sense of well-being consistently presented in the same cluster. Also notable was the symptom pair of fatigue and drowsiness that frequently presented together at most time points and across different statistical methods.</p>

<sec id="section15-0269216311420197" sec-type="discussion">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This is the first study to identify symptom clusters over time using PCA, EFA and HCA in a subgroup of advanced cancer patients reporting non-zero severity scores for all nine ESAS symptoms. Uniquely, the finding as assessed by three different statistical methods were compared with the clusters previously identified in the total patient sample at baseline. In the present study, as with many previous studies statistically determining symptom clusters, clusters were derived according to their severity ratings at a point in time or according to their developmental patterns over time.</p>
<p>The present study revealed that clear distinctions existed between the symptom clusters identified in the non-zero subgroup and those extracted in the total sample population at baseline. As cluster discrepancies are markedly present at baseline between the two patient groups, we would reasonably expect disparities along the treatment trajectory as well. This indicates patients in the non-zero subgroup are not randomly distributed in such a way that their symptom experience is representative of those in the original sample population. Rather, the non-zero patients are distinct and experience unique symptom clusters that bear little resemblance to those in the entire patient population. The observed discrepancy between the non-zero subgroup and total patient sample findings highlights the value of screening patients based on their reported symptoms, especially when using short assessment tools such as the ESAS.</p>
<p>While it is common practice to include all the eligible consenting patients who have provided complete symptom data, this may limit and distort the extraction of complete symptom clusters. A severity score of zero, as reported by the majority of the original patient sample population regarding at least one ESAS symptom, indicates the absence of a particular symptom. This is of concern because the definition of symptom clusters necessitates symptoms to co-occur, and therefore requiring their presence, to be considered a part of the same cluster. Including patients who experienced less than all symptoms evaluated in the initial assessment tool of choice may be restrictive because they do not provide a full overview of the associations among all nine ESAS symptoms.</p>
<p>Several limitations of this study need to be addressed. As previously mentioned, the utilization of a brief assessment tool, such as the ESAS, in collecting symptom data may lead to the extraction of oversimplified clusters. The heterogeneous sample of advanced cancer patients examined is likely to experience a wide range of symptoms that could not be comprehensively captured using the ESAS alone. A longer and more representative range of symptoms is critical for the context and validity of symptom cluster research, as the omission of key symptoms may result in under-identification of clusters. Also, given that this study focused on patients experiencing all nine ESAS items, the patient sample assessed likely experienced more symptoms than the general advanced cancer patient population. Therefore, the symptom cluster results may be more reflective of patients with poorer prognosis. The findings of our study should be interpreted with consideration.</p>
<p>Our findings demonstrated that when symptom and consequently patient inclusion criteria were slightly modified, cluster results varied considerably. This raises another interesting question of by what standard a symptom is considered notable and should be included in symptom cluster analysis. Clusters in the present and many previous studies were identified based on the interrelationships among symptoms as represented by their numeric severity scores.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0269216311420197">6</xref></sup> The ESAS, employed in this study, allows patients to rate nine symptoms on a scale of 0 to 10. Previous studies have stratified ESAS severity ratings into mild, moderate and severe categories based on the degree of interference with the cancer patient’s function.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0269216311420197">15</xref></sup> Ratings of 1 to 3 correspond to mild, 4 to 6 to moderate and 7 to 10 to severe symptoms. A symptom with a severity rating of 0 should rationally not be considered as it is absent in the patient. Along the same lines, it may be proposed that mild symptoms should also be excluded, as ‘symptoms’ only become concerning to the patient when they perceptibly limit the individual’s functioning. Further investigations are warranted to assess any symptom clusters discrepancies in patients reporting exclusively moderate or severe symptoms.</p>
<p>The symptom experience is dynamic and therefore will trigger different symptoms to cluster over time.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0269216311420197">16</xref></sup> In examining the longitudinal patterns of symptom clusters in the total patient population, it was evident that the composition of many clusters derived at baseline, regardless of statistical method, did change at subsequent follow-ups. This may mean that latent factors do in fact change over time and in response to treatment. Symptoms in a cluster are interrelated; therefore the resolution, improvement or exacerbation of one symptom over time may explain the transforming symptom cluster results at follow-ups, or even the complete dissolution of a cluster. In the current study, however, at certain time-points one symptom was excluded from all symptom clusters. For instance, pain did not cluster with any symptoms at baseline using PCA and HCA. At further follow-ups, dyspnea and pain also tended not to cluster with other symptoms using HCA. Pain has been known to commonly cluster with fatigue and depression,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0269216311420197">17</xref></sup> whereas the exclusion of dyspnea from clusters may in fact be a true clinical representation at that time-point. Discrepancies in symptom clusters derived clinically and statistically therefore need to be critically reviewed in order to optimize symptom management.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0269216311420197">17</xref></sup></p>
<p>Although few symptom clusters were found to be identical over time, the symptoms of depression–anxiety and fatigue–drowsiness consistently clustered together in the present study, regardless of statistical method. These have been commonly deemed as clinically determined clusters in the literature,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0269216311420197">17</xref></sup> and their reproducibility in appearing in conjunction statistically suggests that these symptoms may be clinical targets for symptom management. As the current state of symptom cluster research is unable to determine the mechanism of symptom clustering, or whether symptoms share a common etiology versus a common variance, the clinical approach to utilizing symptom cluster information likely depends on the specific cluster. Thus, all symptoms within a cluster may be targeted simultaneously or only one symptom (i.e. pain), which is the latent factor, may be targeted in order to lessen other associated symptoms.</p>
<p>A commonly discussed source of inconsistency between symptom cluster studies lies in the use of different statistical methods. However, study results in the literature regarding this notion are conflicting. In fact, a few previous studies have noted similar, yet not completely identical, cluster findings across different statistical methods.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0269216311420197">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0269216311420197"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0269216311420197">20</xref></sup> In the current study, however, symptom clusters identified using PCA, EFA and HCA at each time point were rarely comparable. While the symptom clusters identified using HCA occasionally resembled those from PCA and EFA, no significantly consistent pattern of analogy emerged. The presence of notable variations in symptom cluster findings between these three statistical methods indicates that the type of statistical method employed directly shapes the characteristics of the clusters identified. High discrepancy among the majority of clusters extracted between studies limits the applications of these findings to aid in developing symptom management strategies. To minimize inconsistencies due to statistical methods, clinicians and statisticians must come to terms with the optimal method that should be implemented to yield results with the most clinical significance.</p>
<p>Symptom cluster identification in oncology is an important but complex area of ongoing research. Our findings point to two issues that need to be investigated before studies in this area may conclude valuable clusters that prove useful for bettering symptom diagnosis, treatment and management for cancer patients. The inclusion criteria for symptoms and therefore patients in symptom cluster analysis require further investigation and clarification. Additional studies employing various statistical methods are also warranted to determine the optimal analytical method that should be implemented to identify clinically relevant clusters and reduce inconsistency. As evidenced by the numerous previous studies reporting the prognostic effect of multiple simultaneous symptoms on functional status and QoL,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0269216311420197">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0269216311420197">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0269216311420197">22</xref></sup> increasing precision in symptom cluster studies is promising for developing innovative cancer treatment strategies.</p>
