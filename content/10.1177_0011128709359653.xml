<abstract>
<p>Beginning in fiscal year 1994, the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention included, as a requirement for a state to receive Federal Formula Grants, the determination of whether disproportionate minority confinement existed in its juvenile justice system, the identification of its causes, and the development and implementation of corrective strategies. The current study examined the extent to which U.S. juvenile justice systems have been successful in reducing disproportionate minority confinement—specifically, disproportionate African American incarceration—since the implementation of the office’s initiative. The findings suggest that, on average, there has been a reduction of nearly one fifth in the disproportionate Black:White ratio of juvenile placements, controlling for the groups’ rate of arrests during the past decade.</p>

<p>The issue of disproportionate minority confinement (DMC) in the juvenile justice system had been a growing concern since the 1960s. When the deinstitutionalization movement swept the nation in the 1970s, Whites accounted for 75% of the reduction in incarcerated status offenders; when incarceration rates began to rise again during the early 1980s, minority youth bore 93% of the increase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0011128709359653">Krisberg, Schwartz, Fishman, Gutman, &amp; Joe, 1987</xref>). The first legislative reference to DMC came with the June 1986 testimony of Ira Schwartz of the Center for the Study of Youth Policy before the House Subcommittee on Human Resources. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0011128709359653">Schwartz (1986)</xref> stated that minority youth accounted for more than half of juveniles in custody despite research showing that they did not disproportionately commit crimes. Explanations for the overrepresentation of minorities in the justice system have traditionally focused on minorities’ level of differential involvement in crime or selection bias by the justice system. Either explanation may have deserved further investigation; however, because of the rhetoric of advocates such as Schwartz, the legislative lens focused on selection bias—specifically, the inequitable use of confinement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0011128709359653">Leiber, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>Two years later at the 1988 conference of the National Coalition of State Juvenile Justice Advisory Groups, the national policy and advocacy body concentrated on DMC. That same year, an amendment to the Juvenile Justice and Prevention Act was authorized requiring states to study and address efforts to reduce overrepresentation of minority youths if the portion of minority youth detained or confined exceeded the proportion of such groups in the general population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0011128709359653">Feyerherm, 1995</xref>). Beginning in fiscal year 1994, the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention (OJJDP) included, as a requirement for a state to receive Federal Formula Grants, the determination of whether DMC existed in its juvenile justice system, the identification of its causes, and the development and implementation of corrective strategies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0011128709359653">Hsia, 1999</xref>). In response to the DMC mandate, researchers undertook serious investigation of the issue, and states began to document DMC results and progress, in the way of internal investigations and reports filed with the OJJDP in the mid- to late 1990s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0011128709359653">Leiber, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>Subsequent to the mandates, an explosion in DMC research was seen in the 1990s, which raised a question of whether the increase was “a chance convergence of research and policy interests” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0011128709359653">Feyerherm, 1995</xref>, p. 15) that would eventually dissipate or actually culminate in improvement of the juvenile justice system. City-, county-, and state-level assessments continued throughout the ensuing years with varying results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0011128709359653">Leiber, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0011128709359653">Pope, Lovell, &amp; Hsia, 2002</xref>). These studies inspected different stages of processing and locations, employed various methods, and included legal and extralegal factors (e.g., seriousness of crime and criminal history, for the former; single-parent-headed households and average income of neighborhood, for the latter) that may have affected minority overrepresentation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0011128709359653">Huizinga et al., 2007</xref>). After briefly reviewing the existing literature, we examined the combined extent to which research, initiatives, mandates, and policies may have affected levels of DMC in state juvenile justice systems across the nation during the past decade.</p>
<sec id="section1-0011128709359653">
<title>Prior Studies</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0011128709359653">Feyerherm (1995)</xref> summarized the complexity of studying disproportionate minority contact in the juvenile justice system. He stated that complying with the OJJDP mandate and producing change could not “be met by the simple elimination of a type of treatment or confinement, nor one that for which success (compliance) [could] be measured in a simple counting operation” (p. 6). Subsequently, the production of a large body of literature has resulted in mixed outcomes. Examinations of each stage of juvenile justice processing produced results indicating no evidence of racial disparity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0011128709359653">Barrett, Katslyannis, &amp; Zhang, 2006</xref>), results finding disparity at one stage and no race effect at another (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0011128709359653">DeJong &amp; Jackson, 1998</xref>), and consistent discrimination throughout the system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0011128709359653">Bishop &amp; Frazier, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0011128709359653">Conley, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0011128709359653">Leiber, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>One of the main findings from this body of research is that racial disparities that were present later in the system often resulted from decisions made during the early stages of case processing. As expected, researchers found that legal factors significantly influenced secure detention and referral decisions; that is, juveniles with more extensive prior offense histories and those charged with more serious crimes, those involving weapons, and drug offenses received less favorable decisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0011128709359653">DeJong &amp; Jackson, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0011128709359653">Wordes, Bynum, &amp; Corley, 1994</xref>). Independent of offense seriousness and other legal matters, race affected the likelihood of detention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0011128709359653">DeJong &amp; Jackson, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0011128709359653">Wordes et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0011128709359653">Wu, Cernkovich, &amp; Dunn, 1997</xref>) and differential processing of minority youth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0011128709359653">Bishop &amp; Frazier, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0011128709359653">Leiber, 2002</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0011128709359653">Huizinga et al. (2007)</xref> studied self-reported delinquency data in three cities from 1985 through 1988 and official contact/arrest/referral data for the juvenile justice system to uncover the magnitude of racial effects on juvenile justice decision making, after controls were added. They found that DMC at the initial stages of juvenile justice decision making could not “be fully explained by level of involvement in delinquency nor by delinquency level and risk factors combined” (p. 42).</p>
<p>Another major finding from this body of research is that small racial differences in decision making may accrue throughout the process. Researchers have well documented this cumulative effect wherein racial disparities build up as a result of decisions made at various stages during case processing. Detained juveniles, for instance, were twice as likely to be adjudicated delinquent in comparison to youths who were not detained before adjudication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0011128709359653">Wu et al., 1997</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0011128709359653">Bishop and Frazier (1996)</xref> found that because of a cumulative effect of many case processing decisions, minorities making up 29% of cases referred to delinquency intake but 44% of incarcerated or transferred youth.</p>
<p>In addition to individual studies, analyses of previous work have been undertaken to summarize the empirical research on minority representation in the juvenile justice system. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0011128709359653">Pope and Feyerherm (1995)</xref> reviewed publications regarding minority youth in the juvenile justice system from 1969 through 1989. They found racial effects generally present at some stages of processing but not others, although bias could occur at any stage of case processing. They also noted that when it did exist, racial disparity tended to accumulate as youths were processed through the system. No relationship was found between rigor of methodology or data quality and disparity, although controlling for legal and extralegal factors tended to reduce observed level of disparity. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0011128709359653">Pope et al. (2002)</xref> conducted a review of research literature from 1989 through 2001. They concluded that race effects continued to be evident in the juvenile processing system. However, compared to prior research, the latter studies tended to use complex statistical designs and were more likely to result in mixed findings.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0011128709359653">Leiber (2002)</xref> reviewed state assessment studies to determine the extent of racial disparities when relevant legal and extralegal factors were taken into consideration. The report examined studies from 43 states where data were collected in the mid- to late 1990s. Leiber found that at the identification stage, minority youth overrepresentation was evident in every state reviewed, existed at all decision-making points, and was greater in states with smaller minority populations. African American youths were the most disproportionately represented minority group. The assessment reports that attempted to determine the reasons for the overrepresentation were more difficult to compare because the states’ assessment procedures and levels of methodological sophistication varied substantially. However, Leiber found “overwhelming evidence to support the presence of race effects in juvenile justice decision making” (p. 13), with 32 states unable to account for racial disproportionality by minority youths’ differential involvement in crime.</p>
<p>An effort was undertaken herein to review current state DMC assessments since Leiber’s work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0011128709359653">2002</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0011128709359653">1</xref></sup> The 13 states identified in the studies represent all regions of the United States and include diverse demographic characteristics, particularly with regard to minority populations. The results from these studies are mixed. The outcomes indicate that DMC was present for many states and at various decision points; however, no state showed consistent DMC for any minority group throughout all decision-making points. For minorities, higher odds of being negatively affected at any particular stage of processing in the juvenile justice system were evident in some studies, but this seemed to be the exception instead of the rule. However, owing to the attrition of studies in analyzing stages throughout the decision-making process, it is difficult to say for certain if it occurred and to what extent DMC arose during various stages of case processing across studies and cumulatively within studies.</p>
<p>From the state-level studies, it is difficult to make generalizations about the level of DMC over the course of time in the United States because these studies were jurisdiction specific and relied on cross-sectional designs. They employed vastly different analytic techniques and varied in their degree of methodological sophistication while relying on samples from various locales and including a variety of decision points and control variables. Without standardization, it is difficult to determine whether any perceived changes occurring in DMC over time were simply due to measurement artifact or actual differences in justice system processing.</p>
<p>By reviewing prior studies, one can easily get mired in their details and lose sight of the larger picture. Although each is important in identifying and assessing DMC and evaluating the effectiveness of reduction strategies at the jurisdictional level, the focus of the current research is broader in scope. It has been more than a decade since the announcement of the OJJDP mandate for states to reduce DMC in their juvenile justice systems. The purpose of the current study was to determine the extent to which U.S. juvenile justice systems have been successful overall in reducing DMC—specifically, disproportionate African American placement—since the implementation of the OJJDP initiative.</p>

<title>Considering a National Systemic Measure of Racial Disproportionality</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0011128709359653">Blumstein (1982)</xref> pioneered the methodology used to disentangle the expected portion from the unexpected portion of the total overrepresentation of adult African Americans in U.S. prisons vis-à-vis Whites relative to their representation in the population. He proposed that if no discriminatory practices existed in the criminal justice system after arrest, then the racial distribution of prisoners incarcerated for a particular crime type would equal the racial distribution of persons arrested for that crime type. By comparing crime-specific race ratios at arrest to the distribution of prisoners by crime of conviction in prison, he was able to estimate the expected racial distribution of incarcerated prisoners (see formula in the Method section). Any differences between the estimated racial distribution (based on arrest) and actual racial distribution of incarcerated prisoners had to be accounted for by factors other than differences in Black–White arrest rates, one of which could be bias in the justice system.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0011128709359653">Blumstein (1982)</xref> noted that, compared to their representation in the population, African Americans were overrepresented in the prison system relative to Whites by a ratio of nearly 7:1. He found that 80% of the disproportionality witnessed in incarceration during 1974 was accounted for by differential arrest rates and was thus expected. Although Blumstein noted that the remaining 20% of the original disproportionality (not accounted for by differential arrest rates) could be partially due to differences in criminal record or seriousness of the crimes within offense categories, he acknowledged that some portion was undoubtedly due to bias in the processing of cases by the justice system. In a later study, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0011128709359653">Blumstein (1993)</xref> found that a similar portion of the disproportionality in incarceration rates in 1991 was expected, given Black–White arrest differentials. But he noted that the surge in the sentencing of drug offenders to prison (a nearly fourfold increase) was having much more of an impact on disproportionality in the latter study as compared to the earlier one. The percentage of disproportionality in incarceration rates explained by Black–White arrest differentials increased from 76% to nearly 94% when those incarcerated for drug offenses were removed from the equation using the 1991 data set.</p>
<p>Blumstein’s work spurred other efforts to gauge the level of racial disproportionality in adult incarceration rates. Two studies using a similar methodology but less sophisticated formula attempted to account for differences in racial disproportionality among individual states and regions of the country (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0011128709359653">Crutchfield, Bridges, &amp; Pitchford, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0011128709359653">Hawkins &amp; Hardy, 1989</xref>). Although these studies controlled for the level of index crime arrests overall by race, they did not specify the mixture of offenses. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0011128709359653">Austin and Allen’s study (2000)</xref> of racial disproportionality in Pennsylvania during the 1990s demonstrated the importance of disaggregating arrest data by offenses when estimating the expected ratios of incarcerated prisoners, finding that only 42% of racial disproportionality in court commitments to prison was predicted by racial differences in crime-specific arrest rates.</p>
<p>One study examined differences in regional incarceration rates for 1997 using Blumstein’s formula to account for crime-specific arrest rates in their measure of disproportionality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0011128709359653">Sorensen, Hope, &amp; Stemen, 2003</xref>). Initial observed Black–White disproportionality in prison admissions varied regionally, from 7:1 in the South to 16:1 in the Midwest; that is, for every newly admitted White prisoner in the South, 7 Black prisoners were admitted, whereas for every newly admitted White prisoner in the Midwest, 16 Black prisoners were admitted. The results showed only small differences in the portion of disproportionality explained by arrest rates across regions: 67% on average.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0011128709359653">2</xref></sup> The authors noted that the percentage of disproportionality accounted for by racial differences in arrest rates was an inadequate figure for describing remaining unexpected differences by race across regions owing to vast differences in initially observed levels of disproportionality among the regions. By applying the portion of variance not accounted for by arrest differentials to the initially observed level of disproportionality, an adjusted ratio of disproportionality was calculated for each region (one that controlled for race-specific arrest rates). Although less dramatic, the initial pattern noted among regions remained similar after controlling for arrests, with the adjusted ratio ranging from 3.5:1.0 in the South to 6.5:1.0 in the Midwest.</p>
<p>Blumstein’s methodology has never been applied to an analysis of racial disproportionality in incarceration in the juvenile justice system; yet, its applicability to the current research strategy is clear. The analytic method for the current study is one that provides a national systemic measure capable of discerning incarceration trends across the United States. It roughly partitions variance in confinement by race into that which is accounted for by differences in group arrest rates and that which remains unaccounted for by arrest rates and therefore conceivably results from improper factors working within the juvenile justice system. Because the analysis of data spans several years with varying levels of initially observed disproportionality, the adjusted ratios are employed to provide a summary measure of disproportionality in the Black:White ratio of institutional juvenile placements, after controlling for race-specific arrest rates across the studied period.</p>

<title>Data Sources</title>
<p>The OJJDP provided the necessary data on incarcerated juveniles. The OJJDP has administered the Census of Juveniles in Residential Placement (CJRP) on a biennial basis since 1997 when it replaced the former Children in Custody Census, conducted since the early 1970s. Whereas the Children in Custody Census collected only aggregate data on juveniles held in facilities, the CJRP collects individual-level information regarding the juvenile’s gender, date of birth, race, placement authority, most serious offense charged, court adjudication status, date of admission, and security status. The CJRP requests data from 4,000 public and private residential facilities on each youth assigned to a bed on the last Wednesday of October.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0011128709359653">3</xref></sup> From these data, race of juveniles was disaggregated to find the actual number of Black and White juveniles in secure confinement by offense of adjudication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0011128709359653">Sickmund, Sladky, Kang, &amp; Puzzanchera, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Race and offense figures for arrests were collected through the Federal Bureau of Investigation from the Uniform Crime Reports (UCR), Crime in the United States series (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0011128709359653">Federal Bureau of Investigation, 2005</xref>). We used these figures to calculate the expected racial distribution of incarcerated juveniles by crime type. UCR data on ethnicity were invalid because of underreporting. Because <italic>Hispanic</italic> is an ethnic designation instead of a race, most Hispanic arrestees were classified as White (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0011128709359653">Snyder, 2006</xref>). To maintain consistency with racial arrest designations, Hispanics in the CJRP placement data set were combined in the White racial category.</p>
<p>Relying on arrest rates to calculate expected incarceration rates does not take into consideration the potential for bias at the point of contact with the justice system. National self-report surveys have called into question official statistics’ portrayal of the extent of criminal involvement by Black youth vis-à-vis White youth. Results from the National Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System, Monitoring the Future, and the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth have indicated small or nonexistent racial disparities in overall self-reported delinquent behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0011128709359653">Campaign for Youth Justice, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0011128709359653">Morenoff, 2005</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0011128709359653">Huizinga et al. (2007)</xref> found that although self-reported delinquency was somewhat higher for minorities in comparison to Whites, the contact/arrest/referral frequency was disproportionately higher for minorities. Specifically, African American reported delinquency was 1.1 to 1.5 times higher than that of Whites, but the contact/arrest/referral rate was 1.5 to 3.4 times as high.</p>
<p>Research comparing official sources and victim accounts yields conclusions opposite those based on self-reports. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0011128709359653">Hindelang (1978)</xref> compared UCR arrest statistics with the victimization results of the National Crime Survey (a predecessor to the National Crime Victimization Survey) to uncover differences between race of arrestees and race of perpetrators as reported by victims. He found a high degree of correspondence in the race of perpetrators between the two sources. Although he noted some discrepancies in race identification between the sources for the crimes of rape and assault, most of the disproportionality in arrests was accounted for by racial differences in crime involvement. A recent analysis of National Crime Victimization Survey data found Black involvement in serious violent crime to be 4.6 times higher than that of Whites, close to their arrest rates, which were 4.9 times higher (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0011128709359653">Lynch, 2002</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0011128709359653">D’Alessio and Stolzenberg (2003)</xref> used the National Incident-Based Reporting System to investigate offender’s race in relation to probability of arrest where the victim was able to identify the offender’s race. For offenses of forcible rape, robbery, aggravated assault, and simple assault, the authors found “little empirical evidence of systematic racial bias against blacks” (p. 1392) and considered their findings to “refute the argument that racial bias in policing [was] affecting the arrest rate for blacks” (p. 1393).</p>
<p>Different explanations have been offered in an attempt to reconcile discrepancies in findings between research relying on self-report and victimization surveys. Some studies suggested that these differences result from African Americans’ underreporting their involvement in criminal activity on self-report surveys (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0011128709359653">Kirk, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0011128709359653">Thornberry &amp; Krohn, 2003</xref>). Others suggested that differences lie primarily in the aggregation of offender and offense types. In examining self-reported arrests and official arrest records among a sample of serious adolescent offenders, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0011128709359653">Piquero and Brame (2008)</xref> found little evidence of racial differences between the reporting sources. Monitoring the Future results show that whereas White youth were more likely to report involvement in more common delinquency, such as committing petty theft, breaking into buildings, and damaging property, Black youth had higher self-reported rates of crimes against persons and more serious forms of offending (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0011128709359653">Morenoff, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>The purpose of this article is not to debate the accuracy and validity of one data source over another. It remains clear that discrepancies among sources exist. Yet, arrest statistics provide the only national longitudinal data source measuring the types of serious crimes necessary for calculating expected racial differences in incarceration rates. Nevertheless, in relying on arrest data, this study is limited in its ability to detect selection bias resulting from changes in law enforcement practices over the past decade. As examined herein, Black–White disproportionality in juvenile placements should be viewed as a cumulative measure of the level of systemic bias resulting from decisions made after juveniles have been taken into custody.</p>
<p>Case processing from arrest to final decision can take several months. As with previous studies, the UCR data from a year before the CJRP data were used to allow for a 1-year lag period between arrest and placement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0011128709359653">Austin &amp; Allen, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0011128709359653">Sorensen et al., 2003</xref>). For example, arrest data from 2002 were used to estimate placement data for 2003. Although CJRP data are available for 1997, 1999, 2001, 2003, and 2006, national arrest data coverage for 1996 are incomplete. Florida, a substantial contributor of juvenile arrests, did not report arrest statistics through the UCR. Florida’s 1996 juvenile arrests by offense were, however, available via the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0011128709359653">Florida Department of Law Enforcement (n.d.)</xref>.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0011128709359653">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>In some instances, categories of offenses for incarcerated juveniles in the CJRP are broader than categories for juvenile arrests in the UCR. Where possible, we directly matched UCR categories to incarceration offenses by CJRP definitions. In cases where the CJRP did not include an offense category outlined in the UCR, we included UCR categories under the CJRP offense categories that were the closest definitional match.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0011128709359653">5</xref></sup> Some categories of incarcerated juveniles had to be excluded from the analysis because their institutional categorization (e.g., technical violators) did not allow a match with the UCR arrest database. In all, 86.3% of the incarcerated juveniles had offense types that were identified in the UCR data and, as such, could be used in the calculation of disproportionality.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0011128709359653">6</xref></sup></p>

<p>With Blumstein’s formula, the percentage of racial disproportionality left unexplained by differences in arrest is easy to calculate: 1 − <italic>X.</italic> As noted earlier, Blumstein’s original analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0011128709359653">1982</xref>) found that 80% (<italic>X</italic>) of the racial disproportionality in incarceration rates was accounted for by differential arrests, while 20% (1 − <italic>X</italic>) of the racial disproportionality in incarceration rates could not be accounted for by differential arrests. This interpretation is interesting in itself. But as noted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0011128709359653">Sorensen et al. (2003)</xref>, when Blumstein’s formula is used for comparative purposes across time or geographical areas, the interpretation will be incomplete without applying these figures to the actual observed Black:White incarceration ratios. In Blumstein’s case, this means applying the 20% of the unexplained disproportionality to the actual Black:White ratio of 6.9:1.0, as done using the simple formula described by Sorensen et al.:</p>

</disp-formula></p>
<p>where <italic>B<sub>r</sub></italic> is Black ratio of incarceration.</p>
<p>By multiplying the proportion of unexplained disproportionality by the actual observed Black ratio of incarceration, this formula converts the percentage (proportion) into a ratio, which in the Blumstein example would be (1 − 0.8) × 6.9 = 1.4. As pointed out by Sorensen et al., to set the White side of the ratio to 1, it is necessary to set the Black side to its expected ratio—that portion of the Black incarceration rate that is to be expected for every point in the White incarceration rate, the <italic>X</italic> value. This is done by simply adding <italic>X</italic> back into the Black side of the ratio. In Blumstein’s example, the final tally would be calculated as such: [(1 − 0.8) × 6.9] + 0.8 = 2.2. This means that, after controlling for arrests, Blacks were incarcerated at a rate 2.2 times that of Whites.</p>
<p>We began the following analysis of juvenile disproportionality with a look at the unadjusted levels of racial disproportionality by comparing Black:White ratios of placement using baseline population data for 1997, 1999, 2001, 2003, and 2006.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0011128709359653">7</xref></sup> Then we applied Blumstein’s analytic method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0011128709359653">1982</xref>) to the most recent year in which the CJRP was available (2006), providing intense scrutiny of how the approach breaks racial disproportionality into its two major components—that which was explained by differences in arrests versus that which was not (unexplained). We subsequently made the same calculations so that we could examine each year in the CJRP data series in a longitudinal analysis. In relation to the longitudinal analysis, we calculated adjusted ratios (controlling for rates of arrests) as the most refined measure of changes in the level of DMC over time. Finally, we disaggregated crime-specific racial differentials in incarceration rates, then longitudinally compared the level of disproportionality explained by arrest.</p>

<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0011128709359653">Table 1</xref> combines population and placement data to present placement rates per 100,000 by race and the corresponding unadjusted Black:White ratios. The first column includes data for both races (Blacks and Whites combined). What is immediately apparent is that over the decade (1997 to 2006), total placement rates fell, as did rates for both Whites and Blacks. There are several ways to interpret the rates of incarceration for Blacks relative to Whites. One way is to simply calculate the percentage decline in incarceration rates for each group over the decade. On this measure Blacks fared better, with a nearly 30% decrease in placement rates from 1997 to 2006, compared to the 25% decrease in placement rates for Whites during the same period. The final column provides another way of looking at the relative rates, providing the Black:White ratios for each year. There again the pattern shows one of Black placements decreasing relative to White placements throughout the decade for all but the last census, dropping from nearly 3.7:1 in 1997 to 3.1:1 in 2003. Note that the slight upturn in 2006 was not due to an increase in Black placements but rather a marginally larger decrease in White placements from 2003 to 2006 than that experienced by Blacks during the same period.</p>

<p>The figures in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0011128709359653">Table 1</xref> suggest a decline in Black–White racial disproportionality in juvenile placement rates in the United States over the past decade. One positive aspect of the table is that the figures have been standardized by the size of the population at risk; that is, the rates of placement per 100,000 are presented rather than raw numbers. These rates are still considered unadjusted because they do not take the groups’ rates of arrest for particular crimes into consideration. The presumed target when such raw figures are presented is a ratio of 1:1, wherein Blacks are placed at a rate commensurate with their representation in the population. This would be an inappropriate baseline if Black juveniles’ rate of arrest for serious and violent crimes was higher than that of White youth. What is needed then is a more realistic baseline measure to use as an estimate of what one should expect each racial group’s rate of placement to be so that the actual figures can be matched against those expectations. Without such information, it is simply not possible to discern the portion of the ratio of disproportionality that is unaccounted for and possibly unwarranted versus that which is expected given differences in arrest.</p>
<p>For the current analysis, it is important to have a measure of the groups’ arrest rates over the course of the time series because trends by race could otherwise act as potential confounds when we attempt to measure the influence of DMC initiatives on placement trends during the past decade. Arrest rates for young Black males peaked in the early to mid-1990s just before the beginning of the data series analyzed herein and advent of the DMC movement across the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0011128709359653">Snyder &amp; Sickmund, 2006</xref>). Afterward, arrests—particularly for violent crimes such as murder, robbery, and aggravated assault—declined to prepeak levels. As such, one should expect substantial decreases in Black juvenile placement rates owing to decreases in arrests since that time. What appears to be positive system responses to DMC initiatives could be broader social, political, and economic factors or even systemic factors operating contemporaneously that have driven down crime and subsequent arrest rates for Blacks more than Whites, hence lowering their incarceration rates independent of the OJJDP DMC initiative. Although Whites experienced a decrease in arrest rates during this same period, their initial rates of arrest were lower, the mix of offenses was less severe, and consequently, their likelihood of ending up in placement for such offenses was lower. The only way to determine whether racial disproportionality in placement may have been influenced by systemic responses resulting from the DMC movement (rather than from changing rates of arrest) is to examine placement data in conjunction with the relative changes in the level of arrest and the mixture of offenses for which Blacks were arrested vis-à-vis Whites during that period.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0011128709359653">Table 2</xref> provides the figures used in estimating the Black percentage of juvenile placements for 2006 based on their group arrest rates assuming no postarrest discrimination. The expected percentage of Black juveniles in placement by most serious offense (<italic>R<sub>j</sub></italic>) was determined by multiplying the percentage of Black arrestees for each offense (<italic>B<sub>j</sub></italic>) by the percentage of juveniles placed for a particular crime type (<italic>F<sub>j</sub></italic>). For example, because Blacks made up 68.7% of juveniles arrested for robbery and because 7.1% of juveniles in placement were serving time for robbery, it was expected that 4.9% of all juvenile placements would be Black juveniles placed for robbery offenses: 4.9 = (.687 × .071) × 100. The expected percentage of all Black juvenile placements (<italic>R</italic>) is the sum of the expected percentage of Black juveniles placed for each offense, as shown in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula4-0011128709359653">Equation 2</xref>. For 2006, the expected percentage of Blacks in juvenile placements was 34.1%. Assuming no postarrest discrimination, the actual percentage of Black juveniles in placement should be the same.</p>

<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0011128709359653">Table 3</xref> illustrates crime-specific measures of racial disproportionality in placements. As the percentage of expected disproportionality nears 100% (<italic>X<sub>j</sub></italic>), parity is approached in placement rates between the races for particular offense types based on arrest rates. For some offense types, <italic>X<sub>j</sub></italic> exceeds 100%, as is the case in 2006 for homicides, sexual assaults, and auto thefts, indicating reverse racial disproportionality. For homicides, it appears that Whites were more likely to be placed in juvenile institutions vis-à-vis Blacks given their relative arrest rates. Rather than from reverse discrimination, this could likely result from a host of factors, such as the greater likelihood of charging Black juveniles in, or transferring them to, adult court for homicide. These differences could also stem from different circumstances surrounding Black versus White homicides. For instance, whereas Black youths were more likely to be arrested in cases involving multiple perpetrators (wherein charges may have been later reduced for those who were less culpable), White juveniles were more likely to have been lone offenders and therefore held fully accountable for their offenses. Overall, the violent crime types had the highest percentage of Black–White disproportionality in placement accounted for by arrests (all above 80%), whereas certain property crimes, drugs, and public order crimes had much lower percentages of Black–White disproportionality in placement accounted for by arrests.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0011128709359653">Figure 1</xref> examines trends in the level of explained disproportionality by crime categories over time. Overall there appears to have been one major shift in explained disproportionality by crime category during the decade examined (1997-2006). The level of explained disproportionality for property offenses dropped precipitously from 2001 (where it was over 90%) to 2003 (just over 60%) and remained near that level in 2006. Although violent offenses experienced a slight dip in the middle of the series and a rise at the end, the overall level of disproportionality accounted for by arrests among violent offenses was consistently high, around 80%. Juxtaposed, placements for drugs and status/public order offenses fell below the overall explained level of disproportionality for juvenile placements throughout the series. Consistent with prior adult studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0011128709359653">Austin &amp; Allen, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0011128709359653">Blumstein, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0011128709359653">Sorensen et al., 2003</xref>), drug placements had the least amount of disproportionality accounted for by arrest rates (with the exception of 2006), although the upturn at the end of the series provides a glimmer of hope. Because only juveniles can be charged with status offenses, this category could not be compared to similar adult studies. Interestingly, this category, when combined with public order offenses, can be described as the least harmful to others; however, next to drug offenses, it had the highest percentage of unexpected disproportionality. Therefore, it appears that the categories of crime with the greatest amount of potential discretion also had the highest percentage of Black–White disproportionality in residential placement not accounted for by arrests.</p>

</fig>
<p>The final analysis looks at the interpretation of the overall level of disproportionality not accounted for by arrests across the time series. The most appropriate interpretation for this longitudinal data given various starting points in the observed Black:White placement ratios over time is the adjusted ratio—that is, the percentage of disproportionality in placements that remains unaccounted for after that expected by arrest is applied to the initial unadjusted Black:White ratio using <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula6-0011128709359653">Equation 4</xref>. With the figures for 1997 from <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0011128709359653">Table 1</xref>, the calculation shows the adjusted ratio to be 1.84 = [(1 − .683) × 3.66] + .683. What this means is that in 1997, the initial 3.66:1.00 disproportionate Black:White ratio of juvenile placements decreased to 1.84:1.00 after controlling for the groups’ differential rates of arrest. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0011128709359653">Figure 2</xref> presents the results for the series.</p>

</fig>
<p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0011128709359653">Figure 2</xref>, the adjusted ratio for 1997 serves as the baseline, about the time that states were beginning to evaluate and implement DMC initiatives in their juvenile justice systems. The next two points in the series are quite close to the baseline, but the adjusted ratio drops more than 20% from the baseline ratio in 2003, a drop that holds nearly steady into 2006. What this suggests is that across the United States, there was, on average, a reduction of nearly one fifth in the disproportionate Black:White ratio of juvenile placements, controlling for the groups’ rate of arrests during 1997 to 2006. The drop therefore cannot be attributed directly to Blacks’ lower rates of arrest relative to Whites or even the mix of the crimes for which they were arrested, nor can it be indirectly due to political, economic, social, or system-level factors aimed at lowering Blacks’ crime rates before arrest. Rather, the factors influencing the reduction of Black–White disproportionality occurred postarrest in the juvenile justice system, indicating a systemwide reduction in the level of DMC across the nation during the previous decade.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>At midyear 2007, adult African American males were incarcerated at a rate 6 times that of White males—4,618 versus 773 per 100,000. The Bureau of Justice Statistics estimated that 33% of all Black males born in 2001 will spend some time in prison during their lifetime, compared to 6% of White males (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0011128709359653">Bonczar, 2003</xref>). Time spent in prison entails a host of obvious and subtle, immediate and long-term, personal, psychological, and financial burdens to the individual, family, neighborhood, and society. The prison cycle is intergenerational, and the pathway to prison often begins at the juvenile institution, wherein Blacks are overrepresented at a margin of more than 3 to 1 when considering their representation in the population.</p>
<p>Using arrest rates to calculate expected placement rates among racial groups, this study roughly separated the observed disproportionality in Black:White placement ratios into that which could be expected given their rates of arrest and that which was unaccounted for by arrests. Some portion of the latter was presumed to result from biased case processing in the juvenile justice system following arrest. Remember that some portion of the DMC unaccounted for by arrests could have resulted from factors other than discriminatory processing by the system, such as Blacks’ lengthier records of prior arrests or their commission of more serious offense types within the broader offense categories captured herein. Although the rate of unexplained disproportionality was found to be far less than the unadjusted ratios based on population figures in the denominator, the adjusted ratios still show that Blacks were placed at rates nearly 70% higher than those of Whites after controlling for arrest since 2003. Although the evidence suggests that the DMC initiative may be making headway, this level of disproportionality is still unacceptable.</p>
<p>The results show a decrease in the disproportionate Black:White ratio of juvenile placements, controlling for the groups’ rate of arrests from the baseline in 1997, which indicates partial support for the effectiveness of the federal DMC initiative. However, other possible explanations for this reduction are not completely ruled out by the research design. Because of vague language employed in the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act amendment, there were no clear provisions for steps required of states in reducing racial disparities, no oversight of reduction efforts, and no assurance of accurate collection of data or regular monitoring, evaluation, and reporting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0011128709359653">Bilchik, 2007</xref>). As a result, the level of implementation and commitment to reducing DMC varied greatly by jurisdiction. With the broad stroke employed in this research design, the current study was not able to determine the extent to which improvements to legal defense systems, investments in alternatives to incarceration, and other local initiatives not spurred by the OJJDP mandate contributed to the national reduction in DMC.</p>
<p>Another limitation to the current study was its inability to separate Hispanic from White arrests. Including Hispanics in the White racial category is less than optimal. Recent research has shown that Hispanics offend at a slightly higher rate than do Whites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0011128709359653">Felson, Deane, &amp; Armstrong, 2008</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0011128709359653">Leiber (2002)</xref> found that Hispanics have been subjected to confinement for their offenses at intermediate levels in comparison to those of White and Black juveniles. These findings suggest that including Hispanics in the White racial category in the current study likely increased the White arrest and placement rates and, most important, biased the adjusted Black:White ratios downward from what it would have been if Hispanics had been analyzed separately.</p>
<p>A further limitation was that some of the most serious juvenile offenders were no longer controlled by the juvenile justice system but had been waived or transferred to the adult corrections system. The primary goal of judicial waiver is the ability to impose more severe sanctions for serious juvenile offenders than are available in the juvenile system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0011128709359653">Fritsch, Caeti, &amp; Hemmens, 1996</xref>). Although only a small percentage of juveniles are waived or transferred to the adult system each year, race has been found to influence such decisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0011128709359653">Fagan, Forst, &amp; Vivona, 1987</xref>). Furthermore, because Blacks have higher rates of arrest for the most serious crimes, which are typically dealt with in adult courts, Blacks are disproportionately handled in adult courts. Thus, failing to include in the current study those juveniles sentenced to adult institutions likely had a downwardly biasing impact on the level of Black–White racial disproportionality observed.</p>
<p>Consistent with previous studies, the crime-specific analyses in the current study show that cases that allow the greatest degree of discretion in processing, such as those involving drugs and public order offenses, result in the highest level of disproportionality unaccounted for by arrest. Further assessment of how these low-level, low-visibility, high-discretion cases are treated at point of contact through case processing in particular jurisdictions is one of the primary policy implications suggested by the current research findings. Without attaining near levels of parity in these sorts of cases, an appearance of fairness in the system is difficult to achieve. However, these cases are the same sort in which the resources of the family and the community may be confounding the effects of race. In these cases, children from more affluent families and neighborhoods that have the resources available for treatment or community alternatives may be able to avoid placement, whereas for those from poorer families and neighborhoods (variables highly correlated with race), juvenile placements may be serving more of a social welfare function.</p>
<p>Finally, the analyses presented herein show that eliminating postarrest bias in the justice system will not completely eradicate DMC. Only when Black youths’ arrest rate for serious crimes of violence has been reduced to a level on par with White youths’ can one expect their rates of placements to be similar. In this regard, preventive efforts aimed at reducing Black delinquency are also important in solving the problem of disproportionately higher rates of placement and incarceration of Blacks in the United States.</p>

<p>To include Florida’s juvenile arrests, race had to be estimated using national racial distributions for arrest. For each offense, arrest percentages for White and Black offenders were calculated from UCR juvenile arrest data.
