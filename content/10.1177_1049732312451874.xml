<abstract>
<p>Our purpose was to investigate health care professionals’ beliefs about effective teamwork in medical emergencies based on their experiences. We used framework analysis of interprofessional focus groups in four secondary and tertiary maternity units. The participants were randomly selected senior and junior doctors, senior and junior midwives, and health care assistants, in five groups of 5 to 7 participants each. We found that optimal teamwork was perceived to be dependent on good leadership and availability of experienced staff. The participants described a good leader as one who verbally declares being the leader, communicates clear objectives, and allocates critical tasks, including communication with patients or their family, to suitable individual members. We triangulated the results with evidence from simulation to identify convergent findings and issues requiring further research. The findings will inform the development of teaching programs for medical teams who manage emergencies to improve patient safety and experience.</p>

<p>Efficient teamwork is key to successful management of emergencies that require a rapid multiprofessional response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1049732312451874">Bates, Larizgoitia, Prasopa-Plaizier, &amp; Jha, 2009</xref>). Desire for good outcomes, together with the threat of complaints and litigation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1049732312451874">Hanscom, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1049732312451874">Neale, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1049732312451874">White, Pichert, Bledsoe, Irwin, &amp; Entman, 2005</xref>), has made emergency team training a priority for health care organizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1049732312451874">Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1049732312451874">King’s Fund, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1049732312451874">Smith, Dixon, &amp; Page, 2009</xref>). There is a lack of evidence to inform the implementation of teamwork training (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1049732312451874">Merien, van de Ven, Mol, Houterman, &amp; Oei, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1049732312451874">Salas, Wilson, Burke, &amp; Wightman, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1049732312451874">Siassakos, Crofts, Winter, Weiner, &amp; Draycott, 2009</xref>). Much of the literature on teamwork draws on assumptions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1049732312451874">Mann &amp; Pratt, 2008</xref>) rather than scientific evaluations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1049732312451874">Merien et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1049732312451874">Siassakos, Crofts, et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>The aviation industry has used crew resource management (CRM) programs to improve team working, but when isolated CRM training was introduced in obstetrics, it did not improve outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1049732312451874">Nielsen et al., 2007</xref>). Moreover, a systematic review showed that in other health care settings and high-risk industries the only definite beneficial outcome from CRM team training was a positive reaction from trainees. Even this reaction could be negative when training was out of context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1049732312451874">Salas et al., 2006</xref>), for example, when trainees were asked to assume different roles and perform tasks outside their domain. Teamwork training that is independent of task and context might therefore have limited benefit.</p>
<p>At the same time, research has shown that variation in clinical performance of ad hoc teams is not explained by differences in the aggregated knowledge, skills, or attitudes of individual members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1049732312451874">Siassakos, Draycott, Crofts, et al., 2010</xref>), indicating that there is something about the way multiprofessional teams interact and work together (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1049732312451874">Baggs &amp; Schmitt, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1049732312451874">Siassakos, Fox, Crofts, et al., 2011</xref>) and team members behave (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1049732312451874">Siassakos, Bristowe, Draycott, et al., 2011</xref>) that enhances outcomes. If we could identify the specific behaviors of more effective teams through context-bound research, rather than drawing on teamwork taxonomies that might or might not be relevant, the information would be useful for the development of evidence-based training programs. The objective was to investigate health care workers’ opinions of teamwork, leadership, and team training, with the aim of determining aspects of team working that are perceived as beneficial or detrimental to the effectiveness of emergency teams.</p>
<sec id="section1-1049732312451874" sec-type="methods">
<title>Method</title>
<p>This is a report of a qualitative study with thematic analysis of interprofessional focus groups. We conducted focus groups during 2010 in four large secondary and tertiary maternity units in southwestern England, where embedded clinical team training was shown to be associated with improvements in clinical process and outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1049732312451874">Draycott et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1049732312451874">Draycott et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1049732312451874">Siassakos, Hasafa, et al., 2009</xref>). For each unit, we randomly selected eligible participants after excluding staff on long-term leave. Each of the following professional categories was represented in every focus group: doctor with more than 3 years of experience in maternity care (senior doctor, SD), doctor with less than 3 years of experience in maternity care (junior doctor, JD), midwife with more than 3 years of work experience (senior midwife, SM), midwife with less than 3 years of work experience (junior midwife, JM), and health care assistant (HCA). The random selection from within each professional group mirrored real-life circumstances; the acute phase of obstetric emergencies is usually managed by ad hoc teams of random composition. Many medical emergencies require critical initial management by teams of similar composition (nurses replacing midwives). We thus purposively included in our focus groups the three professions usually involved in this acute phase (anesthetists are often summoned afterward).</p>
<p>The participants were given an information sheet at recruitment that described the aim of the study and the members of the research team. A language and communication specialist (first author) conducted the focus groups with the help of a second social scientist (third and fourth authors). The cofacilitator’s aim was to monitor and modulate group dynamics, for example, by helping the facilitator bring in individuals who might have been less vocal and keep control of those who might have dominated discussion. None of the study participants knew any of the facilitators. The setting was a quiet, private space within each group’s unit, typically a meeting room. There were no other staff or researchers present, other than the two facilitators, but a research midwife was available at a room nearby in case of any distress to participants.</p>
<p>The focus groups followed a planned schedule and were audio-recorded with two solid state digital recorders. In brief, the sessions started with the facilitators asking the participants in turn about the last emergency they were involved in, what they felt had worked well, and what had not worked so well. The groups discussed at length these narratives. The second stage of the focus group involved a brainstorm session, in which participants identified the characteristics they associated with good teams and bad teams, focusing on teamwork, leadership, and team communication. The facilitators asked participants their opinions about the behaviors that might make leaders and teams more effective. Finally, the facilitators asked the participants about any training they might have had, what they felt was missing, and ways to improve it. Questions were context bound and anchored to the participants’ experiences. The facilitator (first author) kept field notes and an observational log for each focus group session, describing the location, the seating of the participants, the flow of the focus group discussions, the topics covered, contextual factors, and personal reflections. We held a pilot focus group first to refine the schedule of the discussions.</p>
<p>We transcribed, summarized, and analyzed the recordings after each focus group session, using framework analysis, a process with five distinct but interconnected stages: familiarization with the data (recordings, transcripts, notes), identifying a thematic framework by writing memos next to the transcripts, indexing by sifting and sorting quotes, charting, and mapping and interpretation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1049732312451874">Pope, Ziebland, &amp; Mays, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1049732312451874">Rabiee, 2004</xref>). After this process was completed for each focus group session, we followed a constant comparative iterative process of abstraction: a continuous comparison of concepts to check for validity and comprehensiveness of the themes that were generated, even before running the next focus group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1049732312451874">Pope et al., 2000</xref>). Two researchers carried out the coding (first and second authors) identifying the key themes, and another two researchers cross-checked the results (third and fourth authors). We circulated summaries of the transcripts and the analysis to participants for internal validation. Through constant comparison and theoretical coding to develop the conceptual analysis, we grouped the themes and developed a framework that more clearly demonstrates their interaction. Finally, all authors discussed the findings in a multiprofessional meeting aiming to integrate language, communication, psychological, and clinical perspectives.</p>
<p>We triangulated the findings from the focus groups with data from simulation—the SaFE Study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1049732312451874">Siassakos, Bristowe, Draycott, et al., 2011</xref>). By design, composition of the focus groups was similar to the composition of teams in the SaFE Study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1049732312451874">Ellis et al., 2008</xref>). In the SaFE Study, participants were recruited from six maternity units. A total of 24 participants were randomly selected from staff lists of each unit and then allocated to one of four simulation teams. Teams were video-recorded within their own unit managing simulated obstetric emergencies with standardized scenarios that included a trained patient actor. Two researchers (first and second authors) assessed the teams for teamwork and patient interaction behaviors using a validated tool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1049732312451874">Siassakos, Bristowe, Draycott, et al., 2011</xref>). Patient actors also assessed the teams for their care and interaction with them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1049732312451874">Siassakos, Bristowe, Hambly, et al., 2011</xref>) using a validated tool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1049732312451874">Crofts et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1049732312451874">Siassakos, Clark, et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1049732312451874">Siassakos, Draycott, O’Brien, et al., 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>To triangulate the findings from the two data sets at the interpretation stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1049732312451874">O’Cathain, Murphy, &amp; Nicholl, 2010</xref>), the first and second authors examined for corroboration and developed two convergent matrices. The full interdisciplinary research team discussed the findings and reached final decision. The two data sets were described as showing “convergence” when they generally agreed, “complementarity” when they described complementary information or perspectives of the same issue, “dissonance” when they had contradictory findings, and “silence” when issues discussed in the focus groups were not tested in the simulation study because of its design (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1049732312451874">O’Cathain et al., 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Approval was granted from the local Research Ethics Committee. This study was conducted in accordance with the Research Governance Framework for Health and Social Care and Good Clinical Practice. Data storage and protection were in accordance with the research governance framework and the Data Protection Act. The study protocol was approved by the ethics committee, the funder, and the sponsor. All participants gave informed written consent to participation and publication. We followed published guidelines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1049732312451874">Elliott, Fischer, &amp; Rennie, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1049732312451874">Tong, Sainsbury, &amp; Craig, 2007</xref>) to plan and report the study.</p>

<title>Descriptive Data</title>
<p>All professional categories were represented in each group. There were 28 participants (26 women, 2 men) in five groups of 5 to 7 participants each. The age of participants ranged from 23 to 64 years. The participants had graduated from several colleges and universities in four countries. None of the participants declared a history of work-related stress. There were no requests for withdrawal after recruitment or for retraction of data after the focus group discussions. There were no overly dominant speakers in any of the groups and no arguments. None of the participants were overtly affected by emotional distress. There were brief disruptions for clinical calls made to participants in every focus group session, typically once or twice for a few seconds. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1049732312451874">Table 1</xref> shows the codes and themes, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1049732312451874">Figure 1</xref> details the thematic framework.

<title>Characteristics Thought to Enhance Effective Teamwork</title>
<p>Clear understanding of the nature of the emergency, the management plan, and the required tasks (clinical situation awareness), as well as awareness of the team members’ names and abilities (team awareness) and the patient’s needs (patient focus/involvement) were all central in the focus group discussions. They were described as necessary for all team members, not just the leader. Declaring (stating) the emergency promptly was perceived as a critical step. For most participants it was considered important to know other team members and their abilities, which was seen as especially difficult for ad hoc hospital teams, particularly because of frequent external staff rotations: “Come August [when new team members arrive] you don’t know what anybody’s called” (JD). Awareness of the patient and the patient’s companions was a common theme in all five focus group discussions (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1049732312451874">Table 2</xref>): “When it’s an emergency you’ve got to get everything done that’s safe for the patient but it’s quite easy to forget them [patients and/or companions]” (JM).</p>

<p>A number of issues were raised about the influence of leadership on teamwork (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1049732312451874">Table 3</xref>). Participants agreed that it is necessary for somebody to both lead in an emergency and make that leadership explicit. It was felt that good leaders communicated a clear objective to the team and delegated roles and tasks clearly. Equally, the importance of team members being able to challenge seniors when necessary was emphasized in all but one focus group. A particularly important factor was said to be the presence of senior clinicians—the emotional maturity needed to lead an acute event was seen as requiring experience:
<disp-quote>
<p>Somebody can be calm and quiet and give directions and manage an emergency situation very well, and you come out thinking it didn’t seem like an emergency because it was so calm; so the way that the event is managed reflects on how people feel about it afterwards. (SM)</p>

<p>The value of clarity in communication was identified repeatedly in the focus group discussions. This was explained in terms of projection of the utterance (loud enough for all to hear), direction to a particular recipient (preferably using their name), and content (structured communication and information). Verbal reporting of task completion was described as reducing the likelihood of tasks being unnecessarily duplicated. Finally, although praise was discussed as being potentially useful, the participants commented that it is not common in emergencies. In one group praise was discussed as a sign of weakness: “[I]t’s not always appropriate because the relatives are in the room; it almost makes them feel a bit less confident in you, doesn’t it, if somebody’s going, ‘Well done, you’re doing really well’” (SM).</p>

<sec id="section5-1049732312451874">
<title>Characteristics Thought to Undermine Effective Teamwork</title>
<p>Four interconnected individual and team characteristics emerged that were thought to threaten effective teamwork: assumptions, haste, panic, and noise. Assumptions were said to be the result of a lack of clear communication of information, leading to incorrect care. Panic was particularly emphasized and was described as leading to excessive noise, oversights, and a loss of patient focus: “It was a bit noisy and I thought we lost the patient focus; so the husband was talking to his wife explaining to her what’s happening” (JD). Two external threats to effective teamwork were described: logistical issues and team sizes. The participants explained that the variation between different hospital wards and rooms, in terms of layout and the type of equipment present, resulted in time lost looking for and understanding equipment, and ultimately in delay in treatment: “It’s like trying to cook dinner in someone else’s kitchen” (SD). With regard to team size, the participants described instances where small teams were calm and composed, whereas larger teams could get disorganized and noisy. However, they also described emergencies where more “hands” would have been useful to make the team more efficient.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1049732312451874">
<title>Group Proposals for Improving Team Working</title>
<p>The participants commented on current provision of teamwork training, and suggested ways to improve it. Because on-the-job teaching can be extremely difficult during clinical duties, it was suggested that a team training element could be included in the induction process for new staff before they have to manage actual emergencies. Regular formal familiarization was suggested to avoid poor communication and role confusion, whereby team members explain roles, abilities, and responsibilities in advance of emergencies, for example, during handovers. There were differing opinions, within the focus groups, about the best methods to practice and improve teamwork skills. Some participants advocated the use of video-recorded role play to stimulate self-reflection:
<disp-quote>
<p>Simulated scenarios; it makes you think on your feet and work out what you might say if you were in that situation; and being able to have some feedback about that would be quite useful because that’s often what is lacking in an emergency. (JD)</p>
<p>You can be quite objective when you’re watching yourself on a video, even though it’s horrendous. (JD)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Participants also recommended structured feedback after real-life events to enhance learning, but stated that the opportunity was often not taken, possibly because of clinical workload: “Sometimes it’s nicer to go through something that has happened and just bring out good ideas or things that worked well and reflect on what happened” (JM). It was mentioned that training with agreed clinical algorithms for each emergency was beneficial: “It’s much easier to be the leader of an algorithm because everybody knows what the plan is and everybody knows where you’re going” (JD). Such systematic approaches were deemed useful not only for compliance with clinical guidance but also for limiting the emotional impact of emergencies. In contrast, complex mnemonics and acronyms were criticized as being themselves sometimes difficult to remember. Some participants suggested that mnemonics should be very simple and accessible, for example, in laminated form, and should include aspects of communication such as handover or task delegation. Developing the ability to remain composed was another area perceived as important yet not covered by curricula:
<disp-quote>
<p>People respond very differently—emotionally and physically to an emergency situation—and if you’re not one of those people that automatically feels very calm, when the pressure’s on, then, a more structured way of dealing with that emergency would be very useful. (SD)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Some groups felt that training was particularly important for rarer emergencies that might be less familiar. Structured team communication and leadership were viewed as especially important for these situations: “But if you do train in one way then the problem is if you’re faced with a circumstance that doesn’t quite fit your training. But that would be quite useful, learning how to manage the team, how to communicate” (JM). Two participants in different focus groups believed that juniors or nonmedical staff should train alone to allow experience in either speaking up or acting up, but some participants questioned the value of cross training (trainees adopting alternative professional roles in simulation). Finally, some participants described a potential solution for communication with patients and relatives by allocation of a specific team member, for example, an HCA: “We’re nonmedical but we could be trying to reassure somebody about a situation so I’d like a bit more training from a communication point of view.” Triangulation of the findings from the focus groups with evidence from simulation demonstrated convergence and complementarity for several findings; however, there were also some expected and surprising silences and dissonant findings (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1049732312451874">Tables 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1049732312451874">3</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Changes in practice should be grounded in research and developed in conjunction with practicing clinicians (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1049732312451874">Siassakos, Fox, Hunt, et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1049732312451874">Snell, Briscoe, &amp; Dickson, 2011</xref>). In this study of representative interprofessional groups, we elicited their opinions, derived from experience, about factors that might influence teamwork during clinical emergencies, and teamwork skills that were desirable but had been largely missing from their training or development as individuals or teams. The focus groups were highly productive, and the participants were able to suggest several novel means of enhancing the management of clinical emergencies (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1049732312451874">Tables 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1049732312451874">3</xref>). Clear leadership, communication, and patient-centered care were seen as important to the majority of participants, who described practical ways to “do leadership,” communicate critical information, delegate tasks, or maintain a patient focus during the emergency.</p>
<p>The facilitation of the focus groups by two nonclinical researchers, who did not know any of the participants, reduced the risk of familiarity influencing the behavior of the participants. The design was semistructured, which allowed participants to raise unanticipated yet important issues. The use of narrative in the focus groups stimulated discussion, recall, and reflection on individual clinical experiences. Another strength was the inclusion of participants from different professions and experiences. It was important that they were recruited across a large health region and had graduated from several institutions in different countries. We had been concerned that some participants might feel uncomfortable raising issues in front of other colleagues from other professions; the (logged) level of support and encouragement during the focus group discussions suggests that this was an unwarranted concern.</p>
<p>A possible limitation could be that the findings represent opinions based on recounted experience rather than direct observation. However, we were able to triangulate the findings with observations from simulated emergencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1049732312451874">Siassakos, Bristowe, Draycott, et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1049732312451874">Siassakos, Bristowe, Hambly, et al., 2011</xref>) to enhance construct validity (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1049732312451874">Tables 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1049732312451874">3</xref>). The use of mixed methods by multiprofessional researchers does not necessarily guarantee the validity of conclusions because the same biases might affect all the data sets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1049732312451874">O’Cathain et al., 2008a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1049732312451874">2008b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1049732312451874">2010</xref>), but the similar composition of groups in the two studies (SaFE simulation—focus groups) made comparisons easier and relevant. We also followed an explicit interdisciplinary process for analyzing and reporting convergent or dissonant findings in accordance with published guidance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1049732312451874">O’Cathain et al., 2008a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1049732312451874">2008b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1049732312451874">2010</xref>). We acknowledge that further study is required for all the findings, not just those where there was silence or dissonance, for example, using data sets from observed or recorded real-life emergencies.</p>
<p>In the focus groups, participants used the term <italic>awareness</italic> often (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1049732312451874">Table 2</xref>). Situational awareness is considered a key factor in the development and maintenance of effective teamwork (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1049732312451874">Clay-Williams &amp; Braithwaite, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1049732312451874">Guise et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1049732312451874">Hicks, Bandiera, &amp; Denny, 2008</xref>) but is often used loosely, offering little in the way of interpretation of the intricacies. In this study we were able to break the concept of awareness down and identify the important components (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1049732312451874">Figure 1</xref>) and elicit practical means of enhancing each one. A strong theme in all focus groups was the retention of awareness of patients, who are often fully conscious during the emergency, and their companions. Patients have specific needs, but they could be invited to give feedback to individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1049732312451874">Joshi, Ling, &amp; Jaeger, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1049732312451874">Siassakos, Draycott, O’Brien, et al., 2010</xref>) and teams (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1049732312451874">Siassakos, Bristowe, Hambly, et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1049732312451874">Siassakos, Clark, et al., 2009</xref>) after real or simulated emergencies. In this study, findings from the focus groups were corroborated with data from simulation, indicating that brief verbal communication of specific information items to the patient is likely to be associated with better patient experience, but further research is also necessary into nonverbal interaction. Patient focus during emergencies is an appealing concept because both psychological and physical outcome are important, but it should not get in the way of critical clinical interventions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1049732312451874">Nolan et al., 2010</xref>) and should be integral to awareness of the clinical situation.</p>
<p>It is not surprising that experience was reported in the focus groups as a valuable asset to improving both physical and psychological outcome. Where experience was lacking, the participants described how this could be partly overcome by simple measures, for example, by placing laminated, large-print algorithms in clinical areas to reduce reliance on simple recall in the heat of the emergency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1049732312451874">Nolan et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1049732312451874">Soar et al., 2010</xref>). Equally, participating frontline clinicians, recalling their own experiences, noted the difficult problem of managing an emergency when it does not fit into well-known algorithms. In such situations, clear leadership and effective team communication were seen as particularly valuable. Coaching juniors how to remain composed while coordinating teams might be one way to improve the initial management of emergencies until a more senior clinician is able to attend. It will also be useful for when they become seniors themselves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1049732312451874">Olsen &amp; Neale, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>The availability of senior doctors, particularly at night, has long been identified as both critical to outcomes and at the same time inadequate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1049732312451874">Andersen, Jensen, Lippert, &amp; Ostergaard, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1049732312451874">Cullinane, Findlay, Hargraves, &amp; Lucas, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1049732312451874">de Graaf et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1049732312451874">Minkoff &amp; Fridman, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1049732312451874">Pasupathy, Wood, Pell, Fleming, &amp; Smith, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1049732312451874">Siassakos, Fox, Hunt, et al., 2011</xref>). Although previous studies have identified leadership as pivotal in maintaining effective teamwork (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1049732312451874">Berlin &amp; Carlstrom, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1049732312451874">Clay-Williams &amp; Braithwaite, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1049732312451874">Cole &amp; Crichton, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1049732312451874">Hicks et al., 2008</xref>), there has not been evidence to show how to establish leadership and make it effective in the midst of clinical emergencies, and how to move from an abstract concept to a context-bound interpretation and practical application. The findings suggest that it might be necessary that somebody experienced, who knows the team, is available to take the lead, but also that leadership is made explicit by the verbalization of objectives followed by questions to understand the situation and the allocation of critical tasks to specific team members. Further study is necessary into the value of praise and the use of supportive gestures.</p>
<p>The means of inculcating positive cultural and personal attributes might not be immediately evident or straightforward. CRM, for instance, has been specifically developed to train teams in using teamwork skills but has not shown yet any extra benefit over clinical training for maternity teams (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1049732312451874">Ellis et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1049732312451874">Nielsen et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1049732312451874">Siassakos, Crofts, et al., 2009</xref>), perhaps because CRM was originally developed for the aviation industry rather than for health care. Although lessons regarding teamwork from other industries are undeniably useful, improvement in outcomes of real-life emergencies might require customized training (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1049732312451874">Baker, Day, &amp; Salas, 2006</xref>) based on evidence from experiences of real-life emergencies. It is possible that the improvement of teamwork requires approaches that are sophisticated in their development yet simple to apply to practice. More sophisticated teamwork training would have to address different learning styles and needs, using several different teaching methods rather than a one-size-fits-all approach, including but not limited to role play, structured feedback after real-life events, personal coaching, and case discussions. It might also have to address other aspects, often ignored, such as the handling of emotions and nonverbal communication.</p>
<p>In this study we also identified the possible influence of external factors on effective teamwork, including an adverse effect from excessive variation in facilities, for example, the layout of emergency rooms. The standardization of rooms and equipment, including emergency boxes, to make equipment and cognitive aids quick to find and transport might be desirable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1049732312451874">Draycott, Broad, &amp; Chidley, 2000</xref>). The improvement of teamwork in institutional settings requires a strong commitment from all involved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1049732312451874">Mann &amp; Pratt, 2008</xref>), and staff can be a rich source for identifying and resolving local issues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1049732312451874">Siassakos, Fox, Hunt, et al., 2011</xref>), including the optimization of facilities and equipment.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the need to improve our understanding of teamwork in medical emergencies has been recognized, not least because of the risk of adverse outcomes, complaints, and litigation. Simply importing training techniques from nonmedical disciplines has not resulted in improved care. In this multisite study of interprofessional focus groups, we identified some intricacies of effective teamwork, as perceived by frontline staff, while forming identifiable elements suitable for educational trials and possible dissemination through training programs. Triangulation with findings from a large multisite simulation study improved our understanding and enhanced their validity and clinical utility, as well as their potential for stimulating research. Further research should address novel issues described in this study, integrate the perceptions of staff with the perceptions of patients and their relatives, and ideally obtain evidence from the direct observation of real-life emergencies, to improve their management with better teamwork training.</p>
