<p>Spironolactone (SPR), a mineralocorticoid receptor blocker, diminishes hyperglycemia-induced reduction in glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) activity, improving oxidative stress damage. This study investigated whether SPR ameliorates nephropathy by increasing G6PD activity and reducing oxidative stress in spontaneously hypertensive diabetic rats (SHRs). The streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats received or not SPR 50 mg/kg per day, for eight weeks. A human mesangial cell line was cultured in normal or high glucose conditions, with or without SPR, for 24 h. Plasma glucose levels and systolic blood pressure were unaltered by diabetes or by SPR treatment. Albuminuria, fibronectin expression, 8-OHdG urinary levels, lipid peroxidation and p47phox expression were higher in the diabetic rats compared with the control and were reduced by SPR. The antioxidant GSH/GSSG ratio was reduced in the diabetic rats and the treatment reestablished it. Diabetes-induced SGK1 up-regulation was inhibited by SPR. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) and superoxide production induced by NADPH oxidase were increased by hyperglycemia and high glucose, in vivo and in vitro, respectively, and were reduced with SPR. Hyperglycemia and high glucose decreased G6PD activity, which was restored with SPR. These results suggest that SPR ameliorates nephropathy in diabetic SHRs by restoring G6PD activity and diminishes oxidative stress without affecting glycaemia and blood pressure.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Despite better management, particularly in the last two decades, diabetic nephropathy remains the leading cause of end-stage renal disease in most parts of the world. Strict glycemic management, control of blood pressure, and use of drugs that interfere with the renin–angiotensin system (RAS) are the most effective interventions for preventing and treating diabetic nephropathy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1470320311422581">1</xref></sup> In addition, recent clinical trials have suggested that adding an inhibitor of the aldosterone system to an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor-based regime in patients with diabetic nephropathy may further reduce proteinuria and thereby provide additional renal rotection.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1470320311422581">2</xref></sup> The beneficial effects of aldosterone blockade in diabetic nephropathy seem to be independent of blood pressure reduction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1470320311422581">2</xref></sup> and renin–angiotensin blockade in diabetic nephropathy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1470320311422581">3</xref></sup> However, the mechanism by which aldosterone blockade improves diabetic nephropathy is poorly defined.</p>
<p>Studies in animal models have demonstrated that aldosterone can promote proteinuria, glomerular, and tubular sclerosis independent of angiotensin II.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1470320311422581">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1470320311422581">5</xref></sup> In this setting, inflammation and oxidative stress have been suggested as possible mediators of renal injury.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1470320311422581">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1470320311422581">5</xref></sup> Investigators have shown that administering spironolactone, a mineralocorticoid receptor blocker, has beneficial effects on renal lesions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1470320311422581">4</xref></sup> In type 1 (streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats) and in type 2 diabetic rats, aldosterone blockade improves renal function probably through an anti-inflammatory mechanism.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1470320311422581">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1470320311422581">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>Oxidative stress (due to increased oxidant production and/or decreased antioxidant activity) has been seen as a critical underlying mechanism for microvascular complications of diabetes, including diabetic nephropathy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1470320311422581">8</xref></sup> Although angiotensin II has been proposed as an upstream mediator of hyperglycemia-induced oxidative stress and renal disease,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1470320311422581">9</xref></sup> aldosterone’s partial contribution to kidney injury has been well documented.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1470320311422581">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1470320311422581">10</xref></sup> In fact, investigators have suggested that spironolactone ameliorates renal injury and attenuates oxidative stress<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1470320311422581">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1470320311422581">12</xref></sup> in humans and in experimental animals with diabetes mellitus (DM), and that this, in turn, reduces inflammation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1470320311422581">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD), the first and rate-limiting enzyme in the pentose phosphate pathway, is the principal intracellular source of the reduced form of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1470320311422581">14</xref></sup> NADPH is the main intracellular reductant for all cells. Consequently, a decrease in G6PD activity leads to decreased NADPH and makes cells very sensitive to oxidant damage.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1470320311422581">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1470320311422581">16</xref></sup> In addition, since the glutathione (GSH) antioxidant system relies on a sufficient amount of NADPH for normal function, a decrease in the NADPH supply leads to a decrease in GSH levels, aggravating oxidative stress.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1470320311422581">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1470320311422581">16</xref></sup> Interestingly, researchers have demonstrated that G6PD activity is inhibited in endothelial cells exposed to high glucose.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1470320311422581">17</xref></sup> This observation in vitro was confirmed in vivo with a demonstration of rats rendered diabetic by streptozotocin (STZ) displaying reduced kidney cortex G6PD via activation of protein kinase A and consequent oxidative stress.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1470320311422581">18</xref></sup> The observation that G6PD-deficient mutant mice had increased renal oxidative stress and increased albuminuria showed that G6PD deficiency might lead to increased oxidative stress and nephropathy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1470320311422581">19</xref></sup> Finally, a seminal work demonstrated that aldosterone induces a G6PD-deficient phenotype that can be improved by aldosterone antagonists or gene transfer of G6PD.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1470320311422581">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>Based on the above published information, a mineralocorticoid receptor blocker, spironolactone, would improve nephropathy in hypertensive diabetic rats by restoring G6PD deficiency and improving oxidative stress, independently of spironolactone’s effects on blood glucose and blood pressure. To assess this hypothesis, an experimental model combining genetic hypertension (spontaneously hypertensive rats, SHRs) with STZ-induced DM and cultured immortalized human mesangial cells exposed to medium with normal or high glucose was used. Genetic hypertension in diabetic rats leads to early and more severe signs of nephropathy, an increase in kidney pro-oxidant generation, and a decrease in antioxidant defense.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1470320311422581">20</xref></sup></p>

<title>Methods</title>
<sec id="section3-1470320311422581">
<title>Design</title>
<p>This study is in agreement with the Ethical Principles for Animal Research established by the Brazilian College of Animal Experimentation (COBEA) and was approved by the Institutional Committee for Ethics in Animal Research (State University of Campinas – UNICAMP), protocol number 1406-1. All reagents were purchased from Sigma, St Louis, MO, USA, unless otherwise stated. SHRs derived from animals supplied by Taconic (Germantown, NY, USA) were used in this study. Diabetes was induced in four-week-old male SHRs with an injection of streptozotocin (STZ; 60 mg/kg) dissolved in sodium citrate buffer (0.5 M; pH 4.5). The control group received only vehicle (citrate buffer). Blood glucose levels were measured using an enzymatic colorimetric GOD-PAP assay (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) 48 h after STZ or citrate buffer was injected. Rats with plasma glucose concentrations of &gt;15 mM/L were considered diabetic for these experiments. The diabetic rats were randomly assigned to receive no treatment or treatment with spironolactone (SPR) (Pfizer SRL, Buenos Aires, Argentina) 50 mg/kg per day diluted in drinking water. Rats were sacrificed using CO<sub>2</sub> gas eight weeks after diabetes was induced. Investigators have previously demonstrated that this duration of diabetes is enough to induce oxidative stress and renal damage in diabetic SHR.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1470320311422581">20</xref></sup> The kidneys were removed, decapsulated, weighed, and cut longitudinally into two halves. One half was fixed in a 4% paraformaldehyde solution. Some pieces of the cortical tissue of the other half were homogenized and processed for Western blot, and other pieces were frozen in liquid nitrogen and preserved at -80°C for subsequent assays.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1470320311422581">
<title>Blood pressure determinations</title>
<p>Systolic blood pressure was obtained with tail-cuff plethysmography (three to five determinations per rat) in non-anesthetized rats using an MK III physiograph (Narco Bio-System, Houston, TX, USA) before and during the fourth and eighth weeks after diabetes was induced. Rats were habituated to the procedure before blood pressure readings were taken.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1470320311422581">
<title>Albumin excretion rate (AER)</title>
<p>Before DM was induced and the day before the end of treatment, urine samples were collected by placing the rats in individual metabolic cages for 24 h. The AER was determined with an ELISA kit (Nephrat II, Exocell, Philadelphia, PA, USA), according to the manufacturer’s instructions.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1470320311422581">
<title>Determination of urinary 8-OHdG</title>
<p>The urinary concentrations of 8-hydroxy-2′-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG, a DNA-modified product) were determined using an ELISA kit (Japan Institute for the Control of Aging, Nikken Seil Co., Shizuoka, Japan), according to the manufacturer’s instructions, and the concentrations were normalized with urine creatinine.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1470320311422581">
<title>Determination of TBARS levels</title>
<p>Lipid peroxidation was evaluated by measuring the TBARS content according to the thiobarbituric acid (TBA) test as previously described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1470320311422581">21</xref></sup> with slight modifications. A solution of 10% saline, 3% BHT, and 1 ml TBA 1% in PBS was added to the renal cortex homogenate, and incubated at 60°C for 2 h, in a boiling water bath. After cooling, the solution was centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 10 min. The absorbance of the supernatant was determined at 532 nm using a spectrophotometer against the blank. The TBARS content was expressed in nanomoles per milligram of tissue and was calculated by using an extinction coefficient of 1.56 × 10<sup>5</sup> M<sup>-1</sup> cm<sup>-1</sup>.</p>

<sec id="section8-1470320311422581">
<title>Determination of the GSH/GSSG ratio</title>
<p>The ratio of GSH and GSSG was estimated using the kit Bioxytech GSH-GSSG-412 enzymatic method (Oxis International, Foster City, CA, USA), according to the manufacturer’s instructions.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1470320311422581">
<title>Western blotting</title>
<p>Renal cortical homogenate was used to quantify fibronectin, NADPH oxidase subunit p47phox and SGK1 proteins with Western blot analysis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1470320311422581">20</xref></sup> The primary antibodies were a rat anti-fibronectin (Calbiochem, La Jolla, CA, USA), mouse anti-p47phox (BD Transduction Laboratories, BD Biosciences Pharmingen, NJ, USA), and rabbit anti-human SGK1 (Upstate, Billerica, MA, USA). To verify the uniformity of the protein load and transfer efficiency across the test samples, the membranes were re-probed for actin (goat polyclonal anti-actin antibody, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, USA).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1470320311422581">
<title>Human mesangial cell culture</title>
<p>Immortalized human mesangial cells (iHMCs) (kindly provided by Dr Nestor Schor, Department of Medicine, Nephrology Division, Federal University of São Paulo, Brazil) were grown in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM, Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA) containing 5 mM glucose, 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Sigma Chemicals, St Louis, MO, USA), and 10,000 U/L of penicillin/streptomycin (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA). Cells were maintained in a humidified incubator at 37°C and 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. At the semi-confluence stage, trypsin was used to detach the cells from plastic flasks (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA). The cells were centrifuged at 1200 rpm for 5 min, resuspended in DMEM, and subcultured in a 25 cm<sup>2</sup> culture plastic flask.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1470320311422581">
<title>Cytotoxicity assay</title>
<p>The viability of the mesangial cells after they had been treated with different concentrations of SPR (100 µM, 10 µM, 1 µM, 100 nM and 10 nM, dissolved in ethanol) was analyzed with an MTT colorimetric assay (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide, a tetrazole), which assesses mitochondrial damage. The concentration that kills less than 10–20% of the cultured cells was chosen.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-1470320311422581">
<title>Exposure of iHMC to high glucose (HG) and/or SPR</title>
<p>Before the experiments were conducted, the cells were transferred to a plastic plate and maintained under culture conditions for 48 h. At 70–80% of the confluence stage, the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS 1X, pH 7.4) and pretreated for 1 h with 10 µM of SPR. Then, the cells were kept in a HG medium (30 mM glucose) for 24 h. Experiments were conducted on iHMC from passages 10–20.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-1470320311422581">
<title>Determination of G6PD activity</title>
<p>G6PD activity was determined, as previously described, by measuring the rate of NADPH production.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1470320311422581">22</xref></sup> A small piece of frozen kidney cortex was homogenized in 1 ml lysis buffer (PBS, aprotinin, and protease inhibitor cocktail). Mesangial cells were seeded in a 100 mm dish (5 × 10<sup>5</sup> cells/ml) and homogenized in 130 µl of lysis buffer (30 mM Tris-HCl, 10 mM EGTA, 5 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT, 250 mM sucrose, protease inhibitor cocktail). About 50 µl of renal cortex cell lysates or 50 µl of whole cell lysates were added to a cuvette with buffer (50 mM Tris, 1 mM MgCl, pH 8.1). Enzyme activity was determined in a spectrophotometer by measuring the rate of the increase in absorbance at 341 nm due to the conversion of NADP+ to NADPH by either G6PD or 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase. To obtain the total dehydrogenase activity, substrates for both dehydrogenase enzymes were added to a cuvette containing 1 ml of buffer. The rate of change was measured over a 5 min observation period. In another cuvette, substrates for the second enzyme, 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase, were added to obtain the rate for this enzyme. Subtracting the activity of 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase from the total dehydrogenase activity provided the activity of the rate-limiting enzyme, G6PD. The protein content of each sample was measured using the Bradford method. The substrate concentrations were glucose 6-phosphate (200 µM), 6-phosphogluconate (200 µM), and NADP<sup>+</sup> (100 µM).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-1470320311422581">
<title>Competition assay</title>
<p>G6PD activity was also evaluated in mesangial cells after they had been treated with SPR and a dose-curve of G6PD antibody (Bethyl Laboratories, Montgomery, TX, USA). iHMCs were pretreated for 1 h with 10 µM of SPR, with or without a growing concentrations-curve of the G6PD antibody (2 µg, 4 µg, 6 µg, and 10 µg, with final concentration: 0.4 µg/ml, 0.8 µg/ml, 1.2 µg/ml, and 2.0 µg/ml, respectively), and then incubation continued with HG medium for 24 h.</p>

<sec id="section15-1470320311422581">
<title>DCF measurement of ROS</title>
<p>The ﬂuorogenic substrate DCFDA, a cell-permeable dye that is oxidized to highly ﬂuorescent DCF by H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, has been commonly used to monitor intracellular generation of ROS. To measure ROS, cells were grown on 24-well plate, pretreated with SPR and kept for 24 h with HG medium. Then, iHMCs were incubated for 30 min with 10 µM DCFDA (Sigma Chemicals, St Louis, MO, USA) diluted in Hank’s buffer. At the end of the incubation period, the cells were washed twice with PBS and imaged using a fluorescence microscope. To quantify the ROS levels, the cells were seeded on a 96-well plate and treated as described above. Relative ﬂuorescence was measured using a ﬂuorescence plate reader at excitation and emission wavelengths of 485 and 528 nm, respectively.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Blood glucose management, blood pressure control, and use of drugs that interfere with the renin–angiotensin system are effective maneuvers for treating and preventing diabetic nephropathy. However, the number of patients with diabetic nephropathy who reach end-stage renal disease continues to rise.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1470320311422581">25</xref></sup> This observation suggests that new therapeutic interventions that can be used in addition to the classical treatment are necessary to reduce the epidemic of diabetic nephropathy.

<p>In the present study, spironolactone improved the parameters of nephropathy, namely, albuminuria and renal expression of fibronectin. Since a hypertension and diabetes model was used, these effects were independent of the reduction in blood pressure or blood glucose. In addition, spironolactone treatment increased G6PD activity in diabetic rats and in human mesangial cell cultures exposed to HG, and this may have led to improvement in the antioxidant system (glutathione) with a consequent reduction in oxidative stress, a process at the center of the pathogenesis of diabetic nephropathy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1470320311422581">8</xref></sup> To our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate that mineralocorticoid receptor blockade improves nephropathy, and that this is associated with an increase in G6PD activity and a reduction in oxidative stress in hypertensive diabetic rats.</p>

Investigators have suggested that the primary effect of aldosterone blockade was reduced oxidative stress where reduced inflammation was a secondary effect.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1470320311422581">5</xref></sup> However, since these two phenomena, oxidative stress and inflammation, are closely related, and one can lead to the other and vice versa, the issue of which is the primary event in the action of aldosterone blockade is open to further investigation. Other studies have suggested that aldosterone blockade reduces transforming growth factor ß-1 (TGFß-1), plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), and type IV collagen in an in vivo and in vitro model of HG.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1470320311422581">6</xref></sup> However, these findings do not exclude that these effects were secondary to a reduction in oxidative stress, an upstream event in hyperglycemia-induced TGFß-1, and extracellular matrix accumulation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1470320311422581">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>Researchers have shown that diabetic conditions lead to local activation of aldosterone within podocytes and this phenomenon is involved in apoptosis of these cells.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1470320311422581">27</xref></sup> These observations were recently confirmed and extended by the demonstration that in diabetes podocytes injury is mediated by hyperglycemia-induced mineral receptor activation and oxidative stress with consequent proteinuria.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1470320311422581">28</xref></sup> This study also demonstrated that these alterations were reversed by a mineralocorticoid receptor blocker, spironolactone.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1470320311422581">28</xref></sup></p>
<p>Oxidative stress is the main determinant of diabetic nephropathy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1470320311422581">8</xref></sup> However, so far, demonstrating the beneficial effect of an antioxidant in diabetic nephropathy in a clinical setting has been difficult.

<p>Understanding how an antioxidant works is of great interest. In addition, since oxidative stress has many important functions in the body, including defense against different pathogens, improving the antioxidant defense would be better than using a compound that reduces superoxide production. To this effect, recent publications have described a reduction in G6PD activity as a critical step in hyperglycemia-induced oxidative stress.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1470320311422581">19</xref></sup> G6PD is the main enzyme involved in NADPH production.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1470320311422581">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1470320311422581">15</xref></sup> NADPH is the principal intracellular reductant, and the entire antioxidant system relies on an adequate supply of NADPH for its action.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1470320311422581">17</xref></sup> The importance of G6PD for controlling oxidative stress has been demonstrated by the observation that complete or partial inhibition of G6PD activity significantly increased oxidative stress compared with results shown in wild-type cells.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1470320311422581">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1470320311422581">15</xref></sup> More importantly, investigators have shown that endothelial cells exposed to HG displayed inhibited G6PD activity, which was probably dependent on the protein kinase A phosphorylating G6PD.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1470320311422581">16</xref></sup> Similarly to these in vitro observations, researchers have shown that rats with streptozotocin-induced DM displayed inhibition of G6PD, which contributed to oxidative stress in these rats.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1470320311422581">18</xref></sup> Considering these published data, aldosterone blockade may be a good alternative for reducing oxidative stress and improving nephropathy in DM.</p>
<p>The mechanism by which treatment with spironolactone restores G6PD activity is not totally clear, but it is likely to include a reversion in aldosterone-induced G6PD-deficient phenotype. It has been demonstrated that aldosterone decreased G6PD expression by increasing expression of cyclic AMP-response element modulator (CREM) to inhibit cyclic AMP-response element binding protein (CREB)-mediated G6PD transcription.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1470320311422581">14</xref></sup> In vivo, infusion of aldosterone decreased vascular G6PD expression and impaired vascular reactivity. Spironolactone or vascular gene transfer of G6PD abrogated these effects.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1470320311422581">14</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-1470320311422581">Figure 10</xref>).</p>

<p>In summary, this study has shown that aldosterone blockade with spironolactone improves nephropathy in diabetic hypertensive rats. This effect could not be attributed to better glycemic management or blood pressure reduction since spironolactone did not affect these parameters. However, the spironolactone-treated rats displayed an increase in G6PD activity accompanied by an elevation in antioxidant system (glutathione) and a consequent reduction in oxidative stress. Therefore, in a diabetic hypertensive model, spironolactone improves nephropathy by reducing oxidative stress and improving the antioxidant system.</p>
