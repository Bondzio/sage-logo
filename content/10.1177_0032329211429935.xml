<abstract>
<p>The existence of cooperative labor relations within leading firms in South Korea (hereafter Korea), amid unfavorable national-level economic and political institutions, merits study by comparative political economists. Late industrializing Korea lacks the conditions that sustain cooperative labor relations in other nonliberal capitalist countries like Germany and Japan. More relevant, therefore, are debates over the emergence and practice of “high performance work systems” (HPWS) in the unfavorable environments of advanced liberal and developing country capitalism. As a successful late industrializing country that combines both advanced and developing capitalism characteristics, Korea represents a useful testing ground for ideas about HPWS. This article will examine cooperation in four leading Korean firms and use the findings to advance key HPWS debates about the possibilities of participation and the conditions under which cooperation can emerge and be sustained.</p>

<p>The term “cooperative labor relations” (also referred to as partnership, mutual gains, and win-win labor relations) describes the readiness of labor and management (and the owners that the managers represent) to jointly accept short-term costs in exchange for long-term benefits. Cooperation is characterized by the following elements: a commitment to the pursuit of common company objectives among labor and management; the prioritizing of long-term over short-term interests; and the existence of consultation mechanisms between labor representatives and management whereby their goals and the means to attain them can be jointly established. The term “high performance work systems” (HPWS) is commonly used to denote the human resource practices that underpin the most successful examples of cooperation (e.g., teamwork, job rotation, etc.). In spite of their apparent benefits to economic performance and labor relations, HPWS have not been widely diffused. To explain the rise (or absence) of HPWS, two broad explanations have arisen. One stresses the enabling or constraining role of structural factors such as institutions, social structures, and technology. The other stresses the role of strategic choice and contingency in showing how HPWS can arise despite the presence of structural constraints.</p>
<p>As a leading Asian market democracy, Korea provides an ideal setting in which to study comparative labor relations. Korea is also an exemplar of late industrialization, meaning that it combines structural characteristics of both advanced and developing countries. As such, it possesses conditions favorable to both HPWS and alternative (so-called hybrid) forms of work organization that can deliver high performance but without the inclusiveness promised by HPWS. As an economy characterized by high levels of business concentration, Korea also provides a promising context for the study of leading firms.</p>
<p>My discussion examines how the interaction between structural constraints (cooperative and confrontational initial conditions) and strategic choice (collaborative and coercive transition strategies) shapes labor-relations outcomes among leading Korean firms. Using case studies, I focus on how coercive and collaborative strategies can bring about the <italic>transformation</italic> of confrontational initial starting points toward cooperation. Although both coercive and collaborative strategies can bring about such a transformation, collaborative strategies are more consistent with motivational <italic>and</italic> behavioral change on the part of workers. The cooperative labor-relations outcomes that result from collaborative strategies in Korea are characterized by employment security and participation that falls short of strategic partnership. As such, they are more inclusive than hybrids but do not match all the conditions of HPWS. Where coercive strategies fail to transform, they are liable to create starting points where confrontation is more deeply entrenched.</p>

<title>The Debate Over High Performance Work Systems</title>
<p>Pioneered by Japanese firms,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0032329211429935">1</xref></sup> HPWS or “high road” production came into prominence during the 1980s-90s when a number of leading U.S. firms assimilated it. HPWS emphasized the interdependence of high remuneration, high skill, and workforce participation. According to Kochan et al., the latter “involves informal and continuous negotiation, and the deep involvement of union representatives in business and strategic decisions.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0032329211429935">2</xref></sup> Appelbaum and Batt used the term “American team production” to refer to the organization of workers into teams with scope for autonomy at the production level and to union input into the strategic decisions previously not subject to consultation.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0032329211429935">3</xref></sup> “Low-road” strategies, by contrast, are based on hierarchical, coercive management that constantly seeks to minimize costs (especially by relocation). Although they are desirable, HPWS are difficult to adopt and maintain and are thus unevenly distributed across firms and economies. This is especially the case in late-developing countries. This section will explore the structural and choice perspectives on this dilemma.</p>
<p>HPWS emerged against the background of the decline (1970s) and recovery (1980s-90s) of U.S. manufacturing competitiveness. This decline was said to be symptomatic of the crisis of the Fordist production system (price competitiveness based on high-volume production of standardized goods) and its associated hierarchical social relations in advanced capitalist countries. By combining quality production with high-value jobs, HPWS represented a viable response to the crisis. It had parallels with quality production in advanced countries such as Germany, Japan, and Sweden—all of which practiced participatory labor relations to some extent.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0032329211429935">4</xref></sup> Pioneered by Japanese auto plants in the early 1980s,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0032329211429935">5</xref></sup> high-road strategies were also developed by prominent domestic firms such as GM-Saturn,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0032329211429935">6</xref></sup> Chrysler,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0032329211429935">7</xref></sup> and Xerox. In terms of scope, Appelbaum et al. showed that HPWS could thrive in sectors as diverse as iron and steel, chemicals, and medical instruments.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0032329211429935">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>In spite of their apparent advantages, however, HPWS failed to take root across U.S. industry beyond a limited number of high-profile cases. Some sectors also appeared to be less receptive to HPWS than others. For instance, Kenney and Florida found that Japanese managers promoted cooperation in their U.S.-based auto plants but not in the electronics facilities.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0032329211429935">9</xref></sup> Bailey and Bernhardt showed the difficulties of achieving high-road employment practices in traditionally low-road service industries.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0032329211429935">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>Another factor that impeded the establishment of HPWS was the potential of alternative or “hybrid” work systems. These hybrids were capable of melding high-road cooperative attitudes and productivity levels with low-road forms of social organization based on coercion and insecurity. Appelbaum and Batt identified “American lean production” as a system whereby efficiency principles could be introduced without correspondingly benign social relations.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0032329211429935">11</xref></sup> Thus the emulation of Japanese production methods could result in a meaner form of lean production in which U.S. workers suffer the worst of both intensification <italic>and</italic> insecurity.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0032329211429935">12</xref></sup> Knauss showed how in even the most traditional of industries (using the case of small gasoline-powered engines), production could be made more flexible (or “modular”) through piecemeal cost-cutting measures. This was achieved without any weakening of traditional managerial prerogatives.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0032329211429935">13</xref></sup> And enhanced participation and responsibility for core production workers went hand-in-hand with the expansion of the peripheral workforce and insecurity among lower managerial ranks (whose supervisory roles became less essential).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0032329211429935">14</xref></sup> These accounts suggested that the decline of Fordism in the liberal capitalist institutional environment could generate competitive hybrid alternatives to HPWS that were not socially benign—or were benign for some at the expense of others.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, the variations in labor-relations outcomes between firms operating in the same industry highlight the influence of firm-level factors as well as broader structural ones. In their seminal discussion of the transition of U.S. labor relations, Kochan et al. identified three firm-level factors for explaining the rise of HPWS among U.S. firms. First, in the presence of inhospitable macro institutional conditions, the introduction of participatory initiatives depends on <italic>managerial strategic choice</italic>, that is, management’s calculations of the likely benefits from participation. The readiness of management to <italic>initiate</italic> is very important given the tendency of labor unions to be defensive or <italic>reactive</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0032329211429935">15</xref></sup> Second, <italic>union bargaining power and leverage</italic> affects the ability and readiness of management to introduce participatory initiatives.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0032329211429935">16</xref></sup> Paradoxically, while the absence of labor-union vetoes may ease the <italic>introduction</italic> of participatory initiatives, management’s <italic>willingness</italic> to embrace collaboration (especially collaboration involving strategic-level labor input) depends on the presence of strong labor unions. At General Motors (GM), for example, the United Auto Workers secured management’s abandonment of the anti-union “Southern strategy” in exchange for collaboration in the late 1970s and 1980s.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0032329211429935">17</xref></sup> Strong labor unions that possess representational autonomy are also capable of selling collaborative agreements to their members.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0032329211429935">18</xref></sup> Third, a <italic>historical background</italic> of trust facilitates the introduction and consolidation of collaborative initiatives.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-0032329211429935">19</xref></sup></p>
<p>The debate about HPWS and their alternatives also has relevance for developing capitalist countries. In contrast to advanced capitalism, the weakness of labor (including the frequent prohibition of unions) under developing-country capitalism usually allows little opportunity for HPWS. Based on eight Asia-Pacific country case studies,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-0032329211429935">20</xref></sup> Gough et al. concluded that “multi-skilling” tended to “provide efficiencies through cost cutting rather than skill development.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-0032329211429935">21</xref></sup> Even transnational companies (TNCs) with progressive reputations at home tend to prioritize low labor costs in developing countries (e.g., see Kenney and Florida on Japanese <italic>maquiladoras</italic> in Mexico).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-0032329211429935">22</xref></sup> Hence they have difficulty in stimulating “affective attachment” from their employees, irrespective of claims about inclusive practices (e.g., see Caspersz on TNCs in Malaysia and Sri Lanka).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-0032329211429935">23</xref></sup></p>
<p>However, TNCs may also experience competitive pressures that demand more sophisticated forms of labor control based on consent. These forms of control parallel the hybrid forms of management-dominated work organization. McKay illustrated this phenomenon by examining three TNC-owned high-tech enterprises in the Philippines. Under pressure to deliver cheap <italic>and</italic> high-quality products, some enterprises went beyond the typical developing country “despotic” factory regime based on strict discipline and intrusive monitoring (low road), and toward a “hegemonic” regime based on consent (hybrid). Commitment and low turnover (indicators of consent) were fostered by the provision of material rewards (bonuses, fringe benefits) and, in the most sophisticated case (an advanced semiconductor plant owned by a U.S. firm), orchestrated forms of participation that preempted the formation of independent labor unions. Crucial to this hegemonic regime was political support from the export zone authorities (especially in recruitment, selection, and dispersal of workers) and toleration by the national government.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-0032329211429935">24</xref></sup> In short, the structural constraints that impede the diffusion of HPWS in developed market economies are even more powerful in developing countries that are burdened by pervasive hierarchy, mistrust, and power asymmetries.</p>

<title>The Potential for HPWS in Korea</title>
<p>Korea provides a suitable environment for exploring the potentials of HPWS. Its contemporary labor-relations environment was shaped by three salient legacies of late-industrialization. First, Korea’s rapid industrialization (1960s-80s) was based on state planning and the provision of incentives to a small number of family-controlled, diversified business groups or conglomerates (known as <italic>chaebŏl</italic> in Korean). Most of these groups were either already established on the eve of the early 1960s economic takeoff, or were subsequently founded by state-favored entrepreneurs. The state deliberately concentrated incentives in order to achieve economies of scale and to promote intra-business and government-business coordination. From the early 1970s, a more select group of <italic>chaebŏl</italic> was entrusted with carrying out the state’s ambitious heavy industrialization policies. The success of these policies enabled this select group to achieve a dominating economic position through ownership of leading sectors. This ownership became the basis of further diversification into promising sectors. Within the groups, the founding families perpetuated their autocratic governance. Crucially, the economic liberalization from the late 1980s weakened the state’s direct control without introducing effective market discipline (by competition, shareholder power, etc.).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-0032329211429935">25</xref></sup> Thus Korea entered the advanced industrial ranks with a very concentrated and nonaccountable big-business sector that was distinct from the private sectors found in core industrial powers like the United States, Japan, and Germany.</p>
<p>Second, successful industrialization and its repressive methods created the potential for powerful and hostile labor unions. This was an unintended but logical consequence of concentrating production at giant plants owned by the <italic>chaebŏl.</italic> Conditions of mass production were conducive to labor solidarity and independent organization. Concentration of production meant the whole export economy could be susceptible to disruption at a few key plants. Labor-union power came to mirror the concentration of business power. Thus the relatively low rates of unionization achieved after democratization (never exceeding 18.6 per cent [in 1989]) understated labor-union power. The potential for hostile labor relations was inherent in the authoritarian state’s policy of repressing labor claims for redistribution and representation for the sake of promoting faster growth in a context of concentrated mass production. Fast wage growth by international standards was achieved at the cost of long hours, high intensity, and poor safety. Apart from state prohibition of independent activity at the national level, government agencies intervened on behalf of employers at the enterprise level. As a result, labor had little trust in employers or the state. This was especially so in the vital heavy industries such as autos and shipbuilding, sectors made up predominantly of male workforces doing arduous physical work. After democratization, these sectors developed strong enterprise unions that were also receptive to the progressive national federation, the Korean Confederation of Trade Unions (KCTU).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-0032329211429935">26</xref></sup> Accustomed to state support, employers were not receptive to negotiation and compromise either. Given these attitudes, it was not surprising that democratization in 1987 would usher in an era of confrontational and deadlocked labor relations.</p>
<p>Third, late industrialization meant that unlike post-1945 Japan and many continental European countries, democratic Korea would not enjoy the long period of employment stability and prosperity that provided the basis for what Jeong called “the long period of stable union activity seen in advanced nations.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn27-0032329211429935">27</xref></sup> During the first democratic decade (1987-97), before labor claims for redistribution and representation could be settled, the Korean economy was already being confronted with the problem of declining competitiveness. Labor and business held divergent views. Labor unions attributed declining competitiveness to the neglect of investment in favor of unproductive activities (such as land speculation) by the <italic>chaebŏl</italic> and the effect of maintaining over-valued exchange rates in the rush for Organisation for Economic and Co-operation and Development (OECD) status in 1996. Accordingly, they continued to press for pay increases commensurate with the rate of economic growth and for correction of past injustices. In contrast, business organizations stressed high unit labor costs in comparison with rising Asian competitors and attributed these to inflexible labor-market conditions (especially the restrictions on hiring and firing according to market fluctuations). Against this background of declining competitiveness and divergent views, attempts by democratic governments from 1988 to construct national-level corporatist institutions (via tripartite negotiations) were not very successful.</p>
<p>Before these contending claims could be satisfactorily reconciled, the economy was plunged into the 1997 financial crisis. This led to the adoption of liberalizing reforms focused on finance, trade, investment, and labor markets that were mandated by the International Monetary Fund (IMF). The government attempted to facilitate these reforms with corporatist consensus by establishing a tripartite forum in 1998 (Tripartite Commission for Fair Burden Sharing). The institution of social dialogue was not successful, as it was subjected to repeated boycotts by both national labor federations. The labor unions perceived the payoffs (moderate but inadequate increase in state social welfare, participation in a policy discussion forum lacking actual power) to be incommensurate with the costs of cooperation (giving de facto support to increased unemployment and employment insecurity).</p>
<p>Although macro labor relations stalled as a result of the above structural constraints, interesting developments occurred at the firm level. In particular, there was variation in labor-relations outcomes between leading firms operating in the same sector or in different time periods. Some firms followed collaborative strategies, while others did not. Collaborative strategies differed, and some were more successful than others. These variations in the application and consequences of collaborative strategies at the firm level merit further explanation.</p>
<sec id="section3-0032329211429935">
<title>HPWS in Korea: From Potential to Reality?</title>
<p>Existing studies of collaborative strategies in Korea reveal a mixed picture in terms of their role in transforming worker attitudes and in facilitating economic adjustment. In a study based on developments in the period before the 1997 financial crash, Lee showed how three leading export firms (LG Electronics, Hyundai Motors, and Daewoo Shipbuilding) transformed their labor relations from confrontational to cooperative.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn28-0032329211429935">28</xref></sup> The transformation was based on the introduction of four types of collaborative initiative: private provision of welfare; managerial practice based on partnership; informal and partial participation in decision making; as well as education, training, and other company-sponsored activities that raised “enterprise consciousness.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn29-0032329211429935">29</xref></sup> As a result of the introduction of these collaborative mechanisms, and the concomitant emergence of pragmatism within the labor unions themselves, labor relations were transformed from confrontational to cooperative (i.e., control became more hegemonic). The turn toward cooperation was most evident at LG Electronics where it facilitated post-Fordist “flexibility” reforms such as core labor-force reductions (achieved through the freezing of new regular hires rather than redundancy) and outsourcing designed to preserve the viability of the enterprise as a whole. In return, the company ensured that pay and conditions of remaining core workers would keep pace with those of the principal rivals. The success of LG Electronics and the nonunion Samsung Electronics in overcoming post-democratic labor tensions and achieving smooth adjustment in response to the 1997 crisis has also been documented elsewhere.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn30-0032329211429935">30</xref></sup></p>
<p>Subsequent studies of heavy industry, where independent labor unions were well established (and affiliated with the progressive KCTU), however, revealed ongoing confrontation elsewhere in Korea. Kwon and O’Donnell found that management at Hyundai (the leading heavy industry group) tried the whole panoply of collaborative initiatives without success.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn31-0032329211429935">31</xref></sup> Jiman Lee’s survey of unnamed Korean auto company D found that the company and labor union competed for the loyalty of workers. Workers experienced tension between commitment to both union and company.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn32-0032329211429935">32</xref></sup> These observations suggested that it was difficult for collaborative initiatives to succeed in major heavy industrial enterprises where confrontational legacies and structural conditions had given rise to independent labor unions. For example, the transition at Hyundai Motors optimistically described in Lee’s 1998 study proved to be quite fragile when management and union clashed over compulsory redundancies in response to the 1997 crisis (i.e., when the costly incentives for cooperation could no longer be sustained). Subsequent recovery did not repair relations at that company. In the post-crisis era, Korean corporations have emphasized “human resources management” as a vital source of competitiveness.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn33-0032329211429935">33</xref></sup> Two firms have stood out as exemplars of HPWS and hegemonic control, respectively, in Korea. Yuhan-Kimberly (YK),<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn34-0032329211429935">34</xref></sup> Korea’s leading maker of domestic hygiene products, has been highly commended by both government and media for its progressive labor relations.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn35-0032329211429935">35</xref></sup> Its explicit commitment to HPWS is manifested in high wages, employment security (without the buffer of casual labor), strategic consultation with the labor union, financial disclosure, and skill development through continuous training. These practices facilitated YK’s pioneering use of the high-productivity four-crews, two-shifts system (the norm in Korea is three-crews, three-shifts) in which two inactive crews concentrate on skill development.</p>
<p>By contrast, the Samsung group, Korea’s leading <italic>chaebŏl</italic>, is representative of hegemonic (or hybrid) control. While other <italic>chaebŏl</italic> reluctantly accepted unionization, Samsung adhered to its established nonunion form of representation, the legally mandatory labor-management committee. This form of representation was reinforced by the introduction of further practices (often inspired by nonunionized companies overseas) for improving communication between labor and management (e.g., IT-based “open-door” policy, Employment Satisfaction Index, and bimonthly Management by Objective meetings between management and labor representatives). Remuneration at Samsung was also the highest among the <italic>chaebŏl</italic>. As a result, Samsung was able to combine labor-force enthusiasm with a high degree of managerial discretion (including the use of compulsory redundancies),<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn36-0032329211429935">36</xref></sup> hallmark features of hegemonic control (or hybrid systems).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn37-0032329211429935">37</xref></sup> As with the hegemonic model elsewhere, the viability of the nonunion participatory structures was underpinned by negative sanctions against would-be independent unionists.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn38-0032329211429935">38</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0032329211429935">
<title>Selecting Further Cases</title>
<p>The examples above indicate that firms in light industrial sectors (such as electronics) and nonunionized firms have been more successful at developing cooperative labor relations than unionized firms in the heavy industrial sectors. This leaves scope for further research. First, how does one account for variation within sectors? For example, some unionized heavy industrial firms have also managed to develop cooperative labor relations while labor relations in others have remained adversarial. Among the cooperative firms, what accounts for the degree of closeness between management and union? Second, how do successful firms sustain their cooperative labor relations? What maintains the parties’ commitment to sustaining cooperation under conditions of intense market competition? Third, in the decade since the Korean government reversed its previous opposition to foreign direct investment (FDI), what has foreign management contributed to Korean labor relations? In particular, have TNCs with progressive reputations at home introduced similar practices to Korea? These questions point to further investigation of the interplay between local (firm-level) factors and structural (industrial and national-level) factors.</p>
<p>While Yuhan-Kimberly and Samsung are exemplars of HPWS and hegemonic control, respectively, they do not indicate how adversarial relations involving powerful unions can be transformed and consolidated. Samsung never had an independent union. Despite a dispute in 1996, the labor union at Yuhan-Kimberly, historically did not pose a serious challenge to management.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn39-0032329211429935">39</xref></sup> To understand <italic>transformation</italic>, it is necessary to examine cases of more contentious labor relations. The experiences of four leading companies stand out, namely, Hyundai Motors, GM Daewoo, Hyundai Heavy Industries, and LG Electronics. As representatives of Korea’s three leading export sectors (autos, electronics, ships), these companies exhibit instances of turnaround from dire confrontation between management and well-organized heavy industry unions toward more cooperative outcomes (Hyundai Heavy Industry, GM Daewoo); transformation from confrontation to a very tight relationship between union and management (LG Electronics); labor relations influenced by foreign owners noted for cooperation on their home turf (GM Daewoo); and the emergence of a non-inclusive model amid persisting adversarial relations (Hyundai Motors). The workforce profiles of the case companies and their labor relations characteristics are summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0032329211429935">Table 1</xref> (columns A and B). “Type of labor-management outcome” (column C) denotes the type of cooperative outcome created by collaborative and coercive strategies. The principal features of labor relations are described in the following columns (D and E) in accordance with the criteria (“participation and consultation” and “remuneration and employment security”) commonly used to assess HPWS and their hybrid alternatives.</p>

<p>Each case discussion will elaborate on these criteria to reveal the distinctive patterns and pathways toward cooperation. The case studies all represent examples of transformation of labor relations from confrontational starting points. But transformations occur in different ways and with different effects in different firms. Transformation achieved from the top down through high dependence on coercive mechanisms (coercive transformation) tends to produce cooperative outcomes that fall short of hegemony, where behavioral change is not matched by motivational change. At worse, failed coercive strategies can produce outcomes of stalemate. On the other hand, though falling short of HPWS, transformation achieved through less coercive and more collaborative mechanisms (collaborative transformation) tends to produce more genuinely cooperative outcomes. Both outcomes may be represented as in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0032329211429935">Table 2</xref> with the case studies located in the left cells. The shadow cases in the right-hand cells (Yuhan-Kimberly, Samsung Group) illustrate the much less contentious process of maintaining already existing cooperative starting points, whether through coercion, which yields hybrid outcomes, or collaboration, which yields authentic cooperation.</p>

<title>General Motors Daewoo: The Impact of TNC Ownership</title>
<p>General Motors Daewoo Automotives and Technologies (GMDAT) was formed when the automobile division of the bankrupt Daewoo conglomerate, Daewoo Motor Company (DMC) was sold to General Motors for $400 million in October 2002. As the most expensive acquisition by a foreign company, the Korean authorities hailed GMDAT as a flagship for future foreign investment. It is also an important case of transformation given the firm’s troubled background prior to the acquisition by GM, the presence of a well-organized union (born out of the first auto strike of 1985) that was hostile to foreign ownership, and GM’s involvement in partnerships with labor unions at home (notably Saturn). It can be shown that transformation at GMDAT was driven by the employer’s economic leverage. The change in labor behavior arose from its weak position (and resulting pragmatism). Management introduced inclusive initiatives after the union changed its orientation under severe economic pressure (hence the union respondents’ claim to having played an active role in achieving mutuality).</p>
<p>GMDAT was formed against an extremely troubled labor-relations background. Labor relations had deteriorated in 2001 when the court-appointed receivers (the government-owned Korea Development Bank (KDB) implemented redundancies in order to make DMC more attractive to foreign buyers. The DMC labor union strongly opposed the sale to GM; it doubted GM’s long-term commitment to Korea (in its previous collaboration with DMC, GM had been unwilling to transfer advanced technology). For example, GM did not fully integrate the largest plant at Pup’yŏng (near Inch’ŏn) into the GM group. Pup’yŏng employed 5,000 regular workers (as of April 2006; the other plants are at Kunsan and Changwon). In place of full integration, the Pup’yŏng plant was renamed as the Daewoo Inch’ŏn Motor Company (DIMC) whose majority stake was held by the KDB. GM set out four conditions for integration: improved quality; shorter dispute periods; annual productivity growth; and the operation of a two-shift system for six months of the year. Having borne the brunt of the redundancies, this site had been the focus of long-running protests prior to the GM takeover. Of the three production sites, it is the one most revealing about the forces of transformation.</p>
<p>An impressive transformation in business performance occurred under GM. By 2005, profitability had returned and expansion was again underway. After a period of restraint, wages were beginning to catch up with those of competitors. More than 1,000 of the workers who had been dismissed in 2001 had been rehired. The introduction of new models demonstrated GMDAT’s commitment to independent production in Korea (versus simple assembly). The successful transformation was symbolized by the full integration of the Pup’yŏng plant into GMDAT in October 2005. The labor-relations environment had also changed. For the first time in the company’s history, the labor union accepted pay restraint for the sake of recovery. Annual wage negotiations now occurred without strikes. Together with the agreement to shift from annual to biannual negotiation of the collective bargaining agreement (CBA), these developments seemed to mark the emergence of consensus.</p>
<p>The CEO attributed this turnaround to improved communication through which the labor union became convinced of GM’s commitment to the long-term viability of its Korean operation and of the necessity of short-term sacrifices (especially wage restraint) for securing the future. Reciprocity was enhanced by dialogue mechanisms at all levels, which included regular meetings between senior management and the union executive; twice-a-year meetings of the workforce with the CEO; departmental-level meetings; and electronic communications (e.g., in-house magazines, surveys of workforce opinions). By sharing selective financial data with the union executive, the management built trust among the union leadership. Although it acknowledged that economic insecurity had made workers more receptive to cooperation, the GMDAT management claimed that the consensual atmosphere could not have been achieved on the basis of economic interest alone. The material motivations (especially wage catching-up and enhanced job security) came only <italic>after</italic> the new sense of understanding had been successfully nurtured. Moreover, management also made material concessions in the cause of reciprocity. For example, DIMC was integrated into the GM group ahead of schedule in recognition of progress, even though not all the conditions (such as the introduction of the two-shift system) had been fulfilled.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn40-0032329211429935">40</xref></sup></p>
<p>By contrast, labor representatives emphasized the impact of economic insecurity rather than managerial inclusiveness as the cause of cooperation.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn41-0032329211429935">41</xref></sup> One GMDAT union official pointed out that the participatory structure hardly differed from what existed under DMC. The formal channels of dialogue (the biannual CBA and the quarterly Labor-Management Committee) remained unchanged. The informal labor-management cooperation teams that met occasionally also existed under DMC. He contended that there was no email system for communicating rank-and-file views and he cast doubt on management claims of enhanced transparency. For example, the source of GMDAT’s 60 billion <italic>won</italic> profit in 2005 was unknown. Instead, the official traced improved labor relations to efforts from the <italic>union</italic> side. Calls for greater dialogue and information sharing came from the moderate union leadership (elected in October 2004) as part of its initiative for transforming the relationship from confrontation to mutuality (<italic>sangsaeng</italic>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn42-0032329211429935">42</xref></sup> The truth probably lies somewhere between the management and union accounts, but the expression of dissenting views indicates that consensus has not been established. In companies renowned for cooperation the views of management and union tend to be closely synchronized (as in the LG group affiliates).</p>
<p>The transition toward moderate unionism was driven more by job insecurity than by management’s collaborative initiatives. Employment insecurity forced the union to accept pay restraint under the 2003 agreement (whereby the pay gap with other automakers would be closed in three years). Workers at Pup’yŏng, the biggest plant, were particularly restrained by the need to achieve full integration into GM. The absence of real consensus was indicated by the different benchmarks used on the crucial issue of pay (the union cited competitors’ wages and living costs, but management cited productivity). Even the CEO tacitly admitted that integration had been a powerful negotiation lever in the hands of management (“we don’t need that lever any more”).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn43-0032329211429935">43</xref></sup> Far from being a goodwill gesture, integration was offered in exchange for wage moderation (the unions had demanded a monthly increase of 60,000 <italic>won</italic> as part of a three-year catching up process with their counterparts at Hyundai) in the 2005 wage negotiations.</p>
<p>GMDAT exhibits the interaction between a well-organized enterprise union and a powerful TNC. Apart from requiring improvements in productivity and smoother labor relations in return for integration of Pup’yŏng (see above), GM also revised other aspects of labor relations to come in line with GM standards. Most significantly, it amended the collective bargaining agreement (CBA), which it considered to be too favorable to the labor unions (like the CBA at Hyundai Motors). These amendments symbolized GM’s determination to reassert management authority the previous Korean owners had conceded. Articles of the CBA like outsourcing, disclosure of documents, transfer of personnel, and disciplinary process were rebalanced in favor of management (by changing management’s obligation from “consent” to “discuss”). To underline the company’s new transnational status, the company deleted from the CBA the article on “national development,” which reflected Daewoo’s former status as a national champion. Although it accepted the necessity of consultation with the union, GM did not establish the partnership based on strategic consultation for which it was noted in some of its home plants. GMDAT suggests the primacy of coercive mechanisms in driving transformation. Collaborative mechanisms played a secondary role, as management used them to reinforce its authority after it had already gained the upper hand by coercion.</p>

<title>Hyundai Heavy Industries: From Political to Pragmatic Unionism</title>
<p>Hyundai Heavy Industries (HHI) consists of six industrial divisions, at the center of which is the world’s premier shipbuilder. The sequence of change and the type of cooperative relationship that subsequently emerged is distinct from that of GMDAT. Whereas cooperation at GMDAT was driven by managerial leverage based on employment insecurity, the turn from bitter confrontation towards cooperation at Hyundai Heavy Industries <italic>preceded</italic> the financial crisis of 1997. Cooperation was sustained during the post-1997 economic downturn (while labor relations at many other firms deteriorated) and has been maintained ever since. Unlike GMDAT, at HHI there is closer harmonization between union and management viewpoints; the case illustrates how cooperation can be sustained through a crisis. It also illustrates how collaborative managerial strategies can effectively capitalize on internal union transitions (exhaustion of political unionism) in transforming labor relations from confrontational to cooperative.</p>
<p>HHI was founded as a nonunion enterprise in 1972. As a result of job insecurity (all work was casualized during the 1970s) and repressive management, the new union emerged as one of the most militant and politicized in Korea after democratization in 1987 (even more so than the Hyundai Motors union). Between 1987 and 1994, a total of 288 workdays were lost through strikes (including a 128-day strike in 1988-89 and a sixty-three-day strike in 1994). Kwon and O’Donnell’s study concluded that measures such as consultation, surveillance, cultural activities, and material benefits had all failed to pacify labor at the Hyundai group.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn44-0032329211429935">44</xref></sup> Nowadays, however, the HHI union enjoys a reputation for being highly cooperative. A remarkable transformation occurred from 1994 onward and the company has been strike-free. The extent of this transformation was demonstrated by the HHI union’s disaffiliation from the progressive KCTU in 2004.</p>
<p>Management and union interviewees attributed the transformation to mutual learning and the improved communication structure. On the learning side, both management and labor unions realized the negative effects of constant dispute on company performance by the mid-1990s. The effect on the union was particularly pronounced. After the failed 1994 strike, moderates increasingly dominated the union representative congress as rank-and-file workers became disillusioned with political unionism, which demanded constant sacrifices in the pursuit of what seemed like impractical objectives. The emerging majority mood in the union favored economic unionism that was focused on furthering labor interests within the enterprise (over the class interests promoted by the political unionists). For example, 5,000 workers signed a petition in favor of no-strike labor negotiations in 1995.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn45-0032329211429935">45</xref></sup> This represented the beginning of <italic>sangsaeng</italic> (mutual existence) or the recognition of interdependence between company and labor. For its part, management continued to employ strict measures against the increasingly isolated political unionists (for example, through the use of lawsuits for lost production). In 2002, the moderates won the elections for the union executive and in 2003, captured the union presidency itself.</p>
<p>But how was “mutuality” actually achieved? How was the union transformed from exhaustion with political unionism into willing cooperation with management? Why did economistic unionism not take the confrontational form that prevailed at Hyundai Motors (where strikes normally accompanied annual wage negotiations)? Management interviewees pointed out that the shipbuilding industry had some inherent advantages for the stabilization of labor relations. Sustained long-term overseas demand for high-quality Korean ships enabled the company to improve wage and welfare conditions. Improved conditions led to better labor relations and products in a sort of virtuous circle effect. The long-cycle production of shipbuilding made it less susceptible to strike disruption than the conveyor-belt, short-cycle production of the auto industry. These factors, however, cannot explain how cooperation was maintained through the 1997 crisis when company benefits were severely curtailed. The long-cycle structural characteristic prevailed at HHI <italic>before</italic> 1994 but did not prevent disruption when workers felt sufficiently aggrieved. A more important factor in convincing workers of management’s goodwill was the avoidance of job losses during the 1997 crisis when employment was most insecure. Employment security for union members was no doubt facilitated by the cushioning effect of the nonunionized nonregular labor force (which accounted for almost one-third of the entire HHI labor force as of 2005).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn46-0032329211429935">46</xref></sup> However, this cannot fully explain cooperation at HHI either, given that peripheral labor is a characteristic of other companies with less successful labor relations (and of the Korean labor market in general).</p>
<p>The weaknesses of economistic explanations point to the importance of the system of communication introduced after 1994. Known as <italic>kwa-ch</italic>ŏ<italic>ng kwalli</italic> (“process management”), this was an active human resources policy designed to forestall dispute through improved communication. Previously, management had only <italic>reacted</italic> to the symptoms of discontent emanating from the shop floor, but it was relatively remote from the causes. Management–labor union contact was conducted through the mandatory channels of annual wage negotiations, biannual CBA negotiations, and quarterly labor-management committees (LMCs). These channels did not enable management to be sufficiently sensitive to conditions at the shop-floor level. Remoteness meant that management could only <italic>manage</italic> the symptoms of discontent but it could not <italic>prevent</italic> discontent from arising in the first place.</p>
<p>By contrast, the post-1994 system allows for effective microintervention <italic>before</italic> problems can reach the LMC level. The aim of process management is the harmonization of views between management and labor at all levels or <italic>ilwon hwa</italic> (“monism”). The point of process management is the resolution of problems at the shop-floor level before they escalate. Close contact between management and the shop floor is based on the existence of a dense network of labor representatives. Each of the 300 departments has one elected worker representative. There is also trade union coverage of one representative per 100 workers. Through regular contact with this network of representatives, management is well placed to anticipate and prevent the escalation of problems at the shop-floor level. As a result, the focus of labor-management contact has shifted from the divisional and company levels to the departmental level.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn47-0032329211429935">47</xref></sup> Although there is no strategic participation on the part of the union, the sharing of financial information conveys to the union leadership<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn48-0032329211429935">48</xref></sup> that it is taken seriously and enhances its authority with the rank-and-file union members.</p>
<p>HHI tells a story of how improved communication and commitment to employment stability enabled union pragmatism to be transformed into a lasting cooperative relationship. Timing of these developments proved to be crucial. The establishment of some degree of trust prior to a major crisis meant that both sides were ready for a compromise solution (stable employment in return for wage and benefits cuts) when the crisis came in 1997. By contrast, such compromise in the auto sector was more difficult because there was no cooperative structure in place. HHI did not practice strategic participation, but the internal communications system (which included financial disclosure to the union leadership) created enough of a sense of inclusion for the union membership to be won over. Finally, when HHI management introduced its new communications system, it aspired not toward HPWS but rather toward <italic>ilwon hwa</italic> or “monolithism” as inspired by Samsung’s effective early warning system that was based on nonunionization. This supports the view that it takes a powerful but moderate union to encourage an authoritarian company toward sharing.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0032329211429935">
<title>LG Electronics: Model Cooperative Union</title>
<p>LG Electronics (LGE) is also renowned for having transformed its labor relations from confrontational to cooperative. Its collaborative features exhibit similarities to those of HHI: a partnership that includes financial disclosure but stops short of strategic participation; existence of a dense network of communication that acts as an effective early warning system; and the early promotion of collaborative initiatives that facilitated effective adjustment in response to the 1997 crisis. LGE also exhibits some distinctive features. LGE management was inspired by progressive foreign models of partnership (notably GM Saturn) in the development of its collaborative strategy. And the presence of a union distinguishes LGE from its main rivals, Samsung and Sony, both of which operate nonunion policies.</p>
<p>LGE also began as a nonunion company. It experienced severe labor disputes (albeit less severe than HHI) after democratization. The beginning of cooperation was symbolized by the conclusion of the “Resolution for Coexistence and Co-Prosperity” in 1993.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn49-0032329211429935">49</xref></sup> The strength of the partnership was demonstrated when the company coped with the 1997-98 crisis without major disturbance. In contrast to HHI, cooperation has not resulted in the disaffiliation of the LGE union from the national umbrella organization. It remains affiliated with the moderate Federation of Korean Trade Unions (FKTU)—of which it is the largest member (the LGE union president also served as the FKTU vice president). The LGE union, however, is strongly enterprise–focused (e.g., there are no agreements between LGE and national labor organizations).</p>
<p>Both management and labor representatives identified the loss of market leadership to Samsung in the early 1990s as the starting point of improved labor relations. This blow to prestige caused both sides to realize the consequences of confrontation. Management interviewees said that the onus was on the management side to break the deadlock.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn50-0032329211429935">50</xref></sup> To do this, it first had to reappraise the role of the labor union. Instead of regarding the union as a necessary evil to be marginalized, management came to see the union as a partner whose support had to be nurtured. This change is encapsulated in LGE’s usage of the term <italic>no-ky</italic>ŏ<italic>ng</italic> to describe labor-management relations, instead of the standard term <italic>no-sa</italic>. Management interviewees said the standard <italic>no-sa</italic> (labor-capital), derived from 1930s-40s Japan, implies hierarchical separation between owner and employee. <italic>No-ky</italic>ŏ<italic>ng</italic> (labor-management) does not carry the same hierarchical connotations; instead it implies (and helps to foster) shared interest. Union leaders also stressed the importance of the change of managerial attitude, especially after 1993, saying they responded positively to the new style.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn51-0032329211429935">51</xref></sup> This marked the beginning of the transition from confrontation to partnership.</p>
<p>Management interviewees acknowledged the influence of successful foreign companies in the making of LGE’s own partnership strategy.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn52-0032329211429935">52</xref></sup> General Motors’ Saturn Plant was an influential example in demonstrating how high productivity could be underpinned by partnership between management and a powerful labor union. LGE also studied the HR strategies of nonunionized U.S. companies such as Motorola and Federal Express but concluded that unionized companies had distinct advantages over nonunionized ones. In particular, by allowing the voices of employees to be heard, unionization enabled problems to be resolved early. And because employees felt comfortable with labor unions (given their connotation with employment protection), they would be more receptive to initiatives endorsed by their unions. For LGE management, the union became a facilitator rather than an obstacle to cooperation (as in the traditional Korean managerial perspective).</p>
<p>Partnership works through an elaborate system of contact between management and labor. At the mandatory quarterly LMC meeting (the committee consists of eleven labor leaders and nine senior managers), the agenda includes performance issues, quality, safety, educational programs, and social activities. During these mini-negotiations management shares business data with union leaders (transparency). The Annual Council of Compensation (i.e., collective bargaining agreement) exists for the negotiation of wages and working conditions. Plant-level mechanisms also exist to complement the mandatory company-level ones. These include the monthly plant labor-management committee (between the head of the plant, plant union leader and other key plant personnel) and the plant Supervisory Board (in which the plant supervisor and union members discuss work conditions). At the informal level, a weekly time exists when union leaders meet with the management, an idea initially proposed by the union.</p>
<p>LGE points to the importance of plant-level and informal communication mechanisms for forging the sense of mutuality. As at HHI, most problems are resolved <italic>before</italic> they reach the company-level forums. The union leader emphasizes the importance of the weekly meetings in building trust between the two sides.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn53-0032329211429935">53</xref></sup> As at GMDAT, this collaborative initiative emerged from the labor union leadership, and it demonstrates the importance of management receptiveness to union suggestions for communication. Transparency, often regarded as the decisive collaborative innovation in trust building, is shown in the LGE case to be interdependent with plant and informal communication mechanisms. The senior manager said that employees initially did not trust the company data released at the quarterly company-level LMC. They had to be gradually convinced of management’s sincerity. In other words, the credibility of the <italic>source</italic> of the information was as important as the information itself.</p>
<p>Internal company findings reveal moderate satisfaction with remuneration, in contrast to the high level of pride in the company. This points to the motivating effect of nonmaterial factors. However, the reinforcing effect of employment security should be taken into consideration. Like Hyundai Heavy Industries, LGE management avoided compulsory redundancies during the 1997 crisis. Instead there were some “honorary retirements” of older workers and wage concessions (by 5-20 percent). The 1997 crisis also brought about changes in union attitude. Management interviewees said the management-union agenda shifted from remuneration toward performance, quality control, and adaptability to globalization. The concept of <italic>lifetime</italic>-<italic>employment</italic> was replaced by one of <italic>lifetime-employability</italic>. The union came to accept the inevitability of restructuring and subcontracting, including relocation of low-cost production to China. The union representative said that LGE should follow the “blue ocean strategy,” which emphasizes innovation and specialization in top-end products. The management regularly reminds the union of the competitive environment by means such as benchmarking visits to rivals like Haier Electronics (a dynamic low-cost Chinese competitor). By the time of the 1997-98 financial crisis, the union-management partnership had matured to the extent that an adjustment policy was implemented smoothly. Smooth adjustment, in turn, encouraged the union to think constantly about the demands of the competitive environment. The effects of the collaborative initiatives and employment security became mutually reinforcing.</p>

<title>Hyundai Motors Group: Impasse and the Advent of a New Model?</title>
<p>Started in 1967 by Korea’s most famous entrepreneur, Chŏng Ju-Yŏng, the Hyundai Motor Company (HMC) is Korea’s leading exporter and premier auto producer.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn54-0032329211429935">54</xref></sup> Chŏng’s decisive and autocratic style facilitated the pioneering moves into new industries for which the Hyundai conglomerate became renowned. Autocratic governance and wage repression, however, also sowed the seeds of labor unrest in the post-authoritarian era. The Hyundai Motors Workers Union (HMWU), Korea’s most powerful labor union, emerged amid management hostility and obstruction. As a result of post-democratization labor strife and competition from Daewoo and Kia, HMC’s market share deteriorated during the early 1990s. In response, the company launched initiatives to globalize production<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn55-0032329211429935">55</xref></sup> and to improve labor relations. The spell of successful labor incorporation described in Lee’s 1998 study was brought to a halt by the 1997 financial crisis and the subsequent conflict over layoffs. Rapid recovery from crisis was not matched by recovery in labor relations, which remained adversarial. HMC experienced annual strikes over pay and the gains made by the Hyundai Motors union made it the benchmark for heavy industry workers. For example, after forty-seven days of on-and-off strike action, the union achieved the forty-hour, five-day working week in 2003.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn56-0032329211429935">56</xref></sup> Affiliated with the progressive Korean Federation of Trade Unions (KCTU), the HMWU is also the leading affiliate of the industry-level Korean Metal Workers Union (since June 2006). The collective bargaining agreement requires a labor-management committee to discuss the introduction of new technology and relocation and it limits the proportion of casual workers to 16.9 percent.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn57-0032329211429935">57</xref></sup></p>
<p>Hyundai Motor Company is interesting because of the persistence of its confrontational labor relations. It contrasts with other leading <italic>chaebŏl</italic> affiliates that have found solutions to confrontational labor relations through exerting stronger managerial control (Daewoo) or accommodation (HHI, LGE). Hyundai management could not achieve dominance, but it was not active in promoting cooperation either. It has not followed the experiences of Japanese and U.S. auto companies in the pursuit of partnership with the labor unions. The culture of resistance has also persisted on the union side. Apart from the background of hostility, the managerial choice to accept adversarial relations can also be traced to HMC’s recovery from the 1997 downturn. By ensuring a healthy bottom line, domestic monopoly and the success of globalization makes the costs of confrontation tolerable to both parties. But it does not ensure a stable situation. Pessimistic about its labor relations, HMC is pursuing a productivity-growth model that is focused on automation and engineering, rather than on the production line (cooperation). Because it evolved in response to unfavorable local labor conditions, this productivity model works particularly well in HMC’s rapidly expanding (and nonunionized) overseas plants.</p>
<p>Lee’s 1998 study of HMC found that by enhancing the material conditions and status of the blue-collar workforce, management succeeded in weakening radical union leaders. However, that goodwill was undermined by management’s swift move to impose 1,538 redundancies (on top of 6,100 early retirements) in 1998.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn58-0032329211429935">58</xref></sup> This decision sparked an all-out strike that affected labor relations for a decade. It was also indicative of the limits of the previous incorporation strategy in which management improved material conditions but did not seek a genuine dialogue with the labor union. Put another way, management could not accept the labor union as a partner. Most importantly, management did not seem concerned about employment security. In line with its tradition of decisive, top-down leadership, the company opted for a speedy adjustment to protect its bottom line rather than more gradual alternatives. In contrast, both Hyundai Heavy Industries and LG Electronics managed to weather the 1997 crisis by cutting wages and benefits rather than jobs. Even though HMC management interviewees subsequently acknowledged the redundancy policy to have been mistaken, their pessimism about the possibilities for developing a more consensual relationship with labor differentiated them from their counterparts at other <italic>chaebŏl</italic>.</p>
<p>Interviews revealed that senior HMC managers believed confrontational labor relations to be unavoidable.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn59-0032329211429935">59</xref></sup> The implication from these perceptions was that partnership or close collaboration with the union was unworkable. They attributed the impracticality of partnership to the nature of the auto sector and its particular characteristics at HMC. As to the nature of the auto sector, they cited the profile of the workforce (dominated by men under the age of 40 doing arduous physical work) and the immediate effect of stoppages on the conveyor-belt production system—in contrast to industries with long production time frames such as shipbuilding. In other words, the effectiveness of strikes encouraged union militancy in the auto sector. HMC was characterized by the vast size of its production facilities. The company also said this was a source of labor-union fragmentation and competitive bidding for support between the leaders of rival union factions. For example, eight factions existed at the main production plant at Ulsan (34,000 workers as of 2005).</p>
<p>The orientation of the union also helps to explain the persistence of confrontation. Although the Hyundai Motors union had a reputation for militancy, it did not make the strategic mistake of alienating its membership through the pursuit of political strikes. Unlike the Hyundai Heavy union, the Hyundai Motors union membership was not ready for an overhaul of its relationship with management. The union’s historical suspicion of management was reinforced by the moves to implement layoffs in 1998. The union doubted management’s trustworthiness in respecting agreements.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn60-0032329211429935">60</xref></sup> The presence of factionalism and reduced cohesion did not result in the weakening of the union. Rival factions focused on making economic gains, meaning that factional competition tended to bid up rather than moderate demands. In the end, the factions united behind a common platform for negotiation with management. Thus, management had no moderate or compromise faction leaders to forge alliances with. Despite its progressive sympathies, the Hyundai Motors union struck a pragmatic balance between economic and political objectives. The union’s ability to deliver economic benefits meant that the union avoided the pitfalls of demoralization caused by excessive politicization. There were few opportunities for incorporation.</p>
<p>If the deterioration of the bottom line led HMC toward speedy implementation of redundancies in 1998, the impressive recovery enabled it to live with assertive unions by reaching financial accommodation. As a result of the absorption of Kia, the group regained its dominance of the domestic market (with a 70 percent share). And the company reduced production costs by establishing new (nonunionized) plants overseas. In effect, union militancy was symptomatic of a distributional struggle over the monopoly rent. The economic cushion of monopoly rent enabled both sides to avoid the sacrifices associated with the pursuit of cooperation. Managers avoided dilution of authority and disclosure of financial details (HMC’s leadership was notorious for its autocratic governance and secretive financial dealings); and union leaders avoided governance responsibilities. It made cooperative reform appear unnecessary to both sides.</p>
<p>The status quo was not stable, however, as the company has increasingly looked toward internationalization. Over the past decade, output from HMC’s foreign plants has grown steadily.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn61-0032329211429935">61</xref></sup> Management interviewees identified the absence of adversarial labor relations as one major advantage of overseas location. Internationalization represents another strategy management implements to adapt to adversarial labor relations without reaching a consensus with the union. Lee and Jo<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn62-0032329211429935">62</xref></sup> and Jo<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn63-0032329211429935">63</xref></sup> argue that labor-management distrust encouraged HMC to develop its own “labor exclusivist” model, which is distinct from the Toyota “lean” model. Both HMC and Daewoo tried and failed to exclude active unions from their new “lean” plants built at green-field sites during the 1990s;<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn64-0032329211429935">64</xref></sup> while Kia’s attempt to introduce “lean production” also failed because of resistance from the powerful enterprise unions.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn65-0032329211429935">65</xref></sup> In contrast to the Toyota model (and its derivatives such as Saturn), the productivity of this model does not depend so much on the participation and initiative of front-line production workers. Problem solving instead occurs mainly at the pilot production stage. Accordingly, investment in automation and engineering takes precedence over partnership with production-line workers. Consistent with HMC’s top-down leadership style, this model is ideal for nonunion conditions (using low-skilled labor that can easily be dismissed) of the overseas plants like the one in Chennai, India.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn66-0032329211429935">66</xref></sup> Even in the presence of powerful labor unions at home, it is productive enough for management to avoid the difficult institutional change (and redeployment of resources and priorities) that labor-management consensus would entail.</p>

<title>Implications</title>
<p>Our case studies focused on labor-relations outcomes at firms with confrontational starting points in order to understand how labor relations could be transformed (or stalemated) under the most inhospitable conditions. They revealed three types of outcome. First, the pathway of <italic>coercive transformation</italic> is represented by GM-Daewoo. Here cooperation was achieved on the basis of enhanced managerial authority after the coercive strategy had first forced the labor union into a more compliant position. Collaborative mechanisms that were subsequently introduced played a secondary or reinforcing role. Second, Hyundai Heavy Industries and LG Electronics represent the path of <italic>cooperative transformation</italic> where collaborative strategies helped transform confrontational starting points into cooperative outcomes. These outcomes also differ in the extent of cooperation achieved. In the case of coercive transformation (GM-Daewoo), cooperation is more pragmatic amid persistence of divergent outlooks on substantive issues. Cooperative transformation (Hyundai Heavy Industries, LG Electronics), on the other hand, achieves closer harmonization of views on substantive issues between union and management. It brings about a change in <italic>motivation</italic> as well as behavior on the part of labor. Third, the path of <italic>stalemate</italic> as represented by Hyundai Motors demonstrates what happens when coercive mechanisms fail to subdue a powerful union. By aggravating distrust, the reliance on coercive mechanisms ensured that the adversarial relationship would persist into the future.</p>
<p>The interaction of the cooperative starting point and the extent of management dependence on coercive or collaborative transition strategies also enables us to identify the paths of <italic>cooperative preemption</italic> and <italic>coercive preemption</italic>. Here, the effect of collaborative or coercive strategies is to maintain initial starting situations of cooperation whether these are essentially hierarchical or genuinely cooperative. Yuhan-Kimberly, commonly cited as an exemplar of management-led transformation of labor relations, is actually an example of cooperative preemption. Management’s task was facilitated by the absence of a hostile labor union, which meant that the effect of the collaborative strategy was more to maintain a favorable starting point than to transform a confrontational one. The Samsung group, Korea’s leading conglomerate, with its nonunion policy, exemplifies coercive preemption where the cornerstone of hegemonic control (the non-union policy) is maintained by coercive means. Here, collaborative mechanisms (the various forms of dialogue) are secondary because their workings are predicated upon the prohibition of independent labor organization.</p>
<p>How do our Korean cases stand in relation to the HPWS and hybrid types previously identified? Yuhan-Kimberly and Samsung correspond with the HPWS and hybrid (hegemonic control) types, respectively. Yuhan-Kimberly explicitly articulates the HPWS philosophy (reflected in employment security, strategic consultation based on transparency and continuous training) as its guiding principle. Samsung parallels the hegemonic control type firm as identified by McKay<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn67-0032329211429935">67</xref></sup> in terms of its goals (quality and price competitiveness) and instruments (coercive preemptive measures, nonunion forms of representation, and good remuneration). As for our three cooperative cases that started with a confrontational starting point (GM-Daewoo, Hyundai Heavy Industries, LG Electronics), they do not correspond so neatly with the HPWS/hybrid types. All three practice some form of dialogue, yet none practice strategic participation (and it is not sought by the labor unions either). Two cases (Hyundai Heavy Industries and LG Electronics) practice transparency (where it is acknowledged by the union), and in another (GM-Daewoo), management is officially committed to some degree of financial disclosure. In these three cases, management has demonstrated its commitment to employment maintenance but without absolute guarantees. The presence of independently elected unions, participation, financial disclosure, and employment maintenance (albeit imperfectly) at these three firms means they show more regard for labor interests than the employer-dominated forms of cooperation such as the “lean and mean” model described by Fairris and Tohyama,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn68-0032329211429935">68</xref></sup> or “forced commitment” or “hegemonic control” as described by McKay.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn69-0032329211429935">69</xref></sup> In contrast with the other cases, Hyundai Motors stands out in that management has decided to circumvent the problem of adversarial relations by stressing technical improvement and internationalization (invest where labor organization is weak) in its pursuit of high performance.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The legacies of late industrialization (concentrated business power, labor empowerment against a background of repression) and the globalization environment of the 1990s meant Korea could not develop the institutional complementarities or supportive political alliances needed at the national level to underpin cooperative labor relations at the firm level. Lacking these conditions, Korea was unable to emulate the relatively smooth labor relations of advanced nonliberal capitalist countries such as Germany and Japan. Because these conflicting demands prevent successful late developers such as Korea from retracing the steps of advanced nonliberal capitalism, the phenomenon of cooperation is most suitably situated in the literature about high performance work systems (HPWS) and their hybrids. This literature is focused on advanced liberal capitalism and developing world capitalism, contexts in which the national-level conditions are unfavorable to firm-level cooperation. It identifies two broad types of labor-management relationship: one where high performance, labor motivation, and inclusiveness are closely related (HPWS); and another where performance and motivation can be achieved without inclusiveness (hybrids). In contrast to the settings of advanced liberal and developing world capitalisms (where unionized labor tends to be weak), the Korean case poses the question of how cooperation can be achieved against the more challenging background of empowered (and often highly politicized) labor.</p>
<p>This article examined the effectiveness of management strategies in realizing labor-relations outcomes akin to HPWS or their hybrids. To test the effect of managerial strategies under the most difficult conditions, it focused on case studies of attempted <italic>transformation</italic> of confrontational labor relations rather than <italic>maintenance</italic> of cooperative ones (preemption). The case studies reveal that it was possible for <italic>both</italic> coercive and collaborative strategies to transform confrontational labor relations into a win-win situation, characterized by mutuality. It demonstrated that such a transformation could be achieved in sectors with different structural characteristics (i.e., autos, shipbuilding, electronics). It was more difficult to achieve win-win by means of coercive strategy because effective labor resistance threatens reversion to a confrontational situation more severe than the starting point, whereas the material weakening of labor by coercion may encourage management to seek dominance instead of compromise.</p>
<p>As for the characteristics of cooperation, the Korean cases exhibit similarities and differences from the HPWS/hybrid types identified from the study of advanced liberal and developing country capitalisms. Where cooperation was achieved by <italic>preemption</italic> (maintenance of an existing cooperative starting point) the Korean types conformed more closely to the characteristics of the HPWS/hybrid types. Where cooperation was achieved by <italic>transformation</italic>, however, the Korean cases exhibited a <italic>mix</italic> of HPWS and hybrid features (for example, employer commitment to employment security for core workers, financial disclosure, and management consultation with an independent union but no strategic participation). Where the transformation was coercion-driven, the cooperative settlement was more favorable toward management and the cooperative mindset less deeply ingrained (involving behavioral rather than motivational change). With the failure of coercion, Hyundai has developed a strategy of high performance based on technical improvement and international investment that points away from the assumption of HPWS and their hybrid derivatives (namely that there is a close link between high performance and the enthusiasm of front-line workers).</p>
<p>This article provided analytical frameworks for classifying managerial strategies (coercive/collaborative) and their effects (transformation/preemption), and for identifying the pathways from confrontation toward win-win labor relations (and the possible pitfalls along the way). Further questions can be raised. How influential are external actors to coercive transformation? In our case study, coercive transformation (at GM-Daewoo) was facilitated by such influence (government-appointed receivers, foreign purchaser) at key points. Given that less coercive (more collaborative) strategies of transformation are more conducive to win-win outcomes, how can management be influenced toward such a course of action? How can the commitment to cooperation be sustained in the face of globalization? For example, the firm commitment to employment security potentially conflicts with the imperatives for internationalization, casualization, and the maximization of shareholder value that arise out of globalization. These questions provide the basis for further research in Korea and beyond.</p>
