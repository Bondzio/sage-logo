<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Native Americans rank poorly on many indicators of health and social well-being including disproportionate rates of diabetes, tuberculosis, suicide, and alcohol-related problems. In recent decades, cancer has also become a significant concern for Native Americans. Indeed, Native Americans experience some of the highest risk factors for cancer such as high rates of smoking, poor dietary practices, and an increasingly sedentary lifestyle. While Native people have many risk factors for health problems, they also have significant strengths and resilience that can balance risks. It is important that prevention efforts be developed that increase resilience through incorporation of culture and promotion of healthy behaviours. In order to develop meaningful prevention efforts, it is important to gather high-quality data on risk factors.</p>
<p>The project described in this article collected baseline data on cancer risk factors among Native American youth for the purpose of informing the development of an intervention to increase knowledge, modify attitudes, and change behaviours related to the cancer risk factors of poor diet, recreational tobacco use, and limited physical activity. This project took a particularly important step in that it targeted two often-neglected segments of the Native American population: urban Native Americans and those residing in the northeastern United States (US). As a reflection of the ultimate goal of developing culturally-relevant prevention efforts for urban Native populations the project was called ‘Healthy Living in Two Worlds’.</p>

<title>Literature review</title>
<sec id="section9-0017896911422773">
<title>Cancer prevalence</title>
<p>During the past 20 years cancer has become one of the leading causes of death among Native Americans. Cancer is currently the second leading cause of death for Native American men and women and Native Alaskan men and the leading cause of death for Native Alaskan women.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0017896911422773">1</xref></sup> Mortality and incidence of cancer has increased significantly over the past decade among urban Native Americans.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0017896911422773">2</xref></sup> Between 1990 and 1998 the death rate from lung cancer among Native Americans increased by 28%; up from 19.6 to 25.1 per 100,000, while rates among African Americans, Latinos, Asian Americans, and Whites declined.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0017896911422773">3</xref></sup> In particular, Native Americans experience significantly higher mortality rates than Whites due to cancer of the stomach, gallbladder, and cervix.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0017896911422773">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>Native Americans experience the poorest five-year cancer survival rates of all ethnic groups in the US. Native Americans have a 35.2% five-year relative survival rate from cancer compared to a 50.3% survival rate for Whites.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0017896911422773">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0017896911422773">5</xref></sup> The actual toll of cancer in Native American communities may be even higher since cancer is under reported on the death certificates of many Native Americans due to racial misclassification;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0017896911422773">1</xref></sup> Indian health service databases do not include many urban areas where most Native Americans reside,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0017896911422773">6</xref></sup> and Native Americans have a shorter lifespan, thus their stated cause of death (i.e. homicide, motor vehicle crash) often coexists with symptoms of late stage cancer.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0017896911422773">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>Little research has examined prevalence or risk factors for cancer in northeastern Native American populations; thus we can only make guesses based on Native populations in other regions or non-Natives in the northeast. The western New York (NY) regions targeted in this project are Erie and Niagara counties, home to the cities of Buffalo and Niagara Falls. While rates of lung cancer in New York State (excluding New York City) declined from 60 to 58.7 deaths per 100,000 between 1997 and 2000, rates in western New York are rising. Niagara county has the highest mortality rate from lung cancer at 80.5 deaths per 100,000 followed by Erie county at 73 deaths per 100,000.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0017896911422773">8</xref></sup> Rates of cancer are increasing on the west side of Buffalo, where the majority of the urban Native American population in western New York reside.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0017896911422773">9</xref></sup></p>

<sec id="section10-0017896911422773">
<title>Cancer risk and lifestyle choices of Native American youth</title>
<p>Native American and Alaska Native teens consistently have the highest rates of smoking of any ethnic group.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0017896911422773">10</xref></sup> In a western sample, the Voices of Indian Teens Project found 50% smoked and 21% used smokeless tobacco.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0017896911422773">11</xref></sup> Another study of Native youth found that 48% had smoked at least once and 27% were current smokers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0017896911422773">12</xref></sup> For 12th graders the 30-day prevalence of smoking is 46.1%, compared to 34.3% for the overall population. They also have the highest rate of smoking half a pack or more a day: 17.1% compared to 12.7% of the general population.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0017896911422773">13</xref></sup> Between 1997 and 2003 the percentage of adult smokers in western New York dropped slightly from 29% to 27% but it remains higher than statewide or national rates (22%). The percentage of 9th graders in Erie county who report that they smoke daily has dropped dramatically in recent years but remains highest (9%) among Native American students.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0017896911422773">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>Along with cigarette smoking, dietary practices are the most significant cause of cancer for Native Americans,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0017896911422773">14</xref></sup> yet there is limited data regarding the current dietary habits of Native Americans.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0017896911422773">15</xref></sup> A search of research published between 1980–97 found no studies on the nutritional intake of Native youth under age 10 and only three studies on Cherokee, Hopi, and Navajo children over age 10.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0017896911422773">16</xref></sup> A subsequent study documenting dietary intake of Native children age 10 and younger took place during the school year when school lunch and breakfast programmes constitute a significant part of diets.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0017896911422773">15</xref></sup> Even less is known about dietary practices when youth are not in school.</p>
<p>Inadequate physical activity is a significant problem for Native youth.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0017896911422773">17</xref></sup> A study of 3rd- and 5th-grade Native children revealed their sedentary lifestyle contributes to obesity and other health problems. Nearly 86% of children in the study watched television (TV) after school rather than engaging in physical activity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0017896911422773">18</xref></sup> A study of urban Native youth (primarily Anishinaabe) ages 5–18 found 63% were overweight or at risk for being overweight and 59% were sedentary.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0017896911422773">19</xref></sup> Participation in physical activities is associated with a decreased risk of colon cancer.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0017896911422773">20</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0017896911422773">
<title>Family influences</title>
<p>Family influences effect youths’ attitudes and behaviours toward physical activity, diet, and tobacco use. Involving family and community in promoting healthy behaviour is more effective than simply targeting youth.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0017896911422773">14</xref></sup> Health promotion that involves community leaders and elders has been effective in modifying high-risk behaviours in Native youth. These youth showed a 19% higher improvement in behaviours than youth who received the same programme without community participation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0017896911422773">21</xref></sup></p>
<p>Parental influences can be either protective factors or risk factors for youth tobacco use.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0017896911422773">11</xref></sup> Families and communities give powerful messages to Native youth about what behaviours will be tolerated. A study of households where parents smoke found that parents can be guided to socialize their children against smoking.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0017896911422773">22</xref></sup> Likewise, parents can play a key role in influencing the attitudes and behaviours of youth related to diet and physical activity.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0017896911422773">
<title>The Native American cultural context</title>
<p>The primary Native American population in the western New York region is Haudenosaunee, a confederacy of six nations: the Seneca, Cayuga, Onondaga, Oneida, Mohawk, and Tuscarora. Their traditional way of life, beliefs, and values are centred around the Longhouse. Longhouse teachings include healthy eating practices, use of tobacco for ceremonial purposes rather than recreation, and avoiding the use of alcohol. These traditional beliefs and practices can be directly related to general wellness and cancer prevention.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-0017896911422773" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>Interviews were used to collect information from Native American youth on their health behaviours with particular attention to diet, tobacco use, and physical activities. Interviews were also conducted with a subsample of their caregivers in order to gain an understanding of the context for the youth’s behaviours (i.e. smoking in the household may be related to an individual young person’s decisions about smoking). The primary goal of collecting this information was to inform the development of a curriculum to be used in a prevention initiative. The interviews provided information on risk behaviours prevalent in this regional population, thus giving the curriculum writers specific areas to target as they moved forward with programme development. The project was overseen by two advisory boards: one consisting of senior researchers who had conducted work with Native Americans and cancer; and the other Haudenosaunee people with specialized cultural knowledge. The guidance of these two boards assured that the methodology and instruments were sound from a research perspective and respectful from a cultural perspective.</p>
<sec id="section14-0017896911422773">
<title>Instruments</title>
<p>During the first phase of the project a significant amount of time and effort was put into adapting measures that would be reliable and valid in gathering information from urban Native American youth and their caregivers. During the spring and summer of 2005, existing instruments were gathered, reviewed for relevance, and modified for use in this project. The finalized instruments were then submitted to and approved by the Social and Behavioural Sciences Institutional Review Board at the University at Buffalo, State University of New York.</p>
<p>The primary instrument adapted for use in the ‘Healthy Living in Two Worlds’ project was the Youth Risk Behaviour Survey (YRBS).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0017896911422773">23</xref></sup> This instrument assesses health risk behaviours including: (1) those that contribute to injuries and violence; (2) tobacco use; (3) alcohol and other drug use; (4) sexual behaviours; (5) dietary practices; and (6) physical activity. Mean kappas (two week test–retest) were 68.8% for tobacco use items, 55.2% for physical activity items, and 50.0% for dietary behaviours. Kappas did not differ by gender, grade, or race/ethnicity of the respondents.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0017896911422773">24</xref></sup></p>
<p>The instrument was revised by a research team consisting of the principle investigator (PI; a Native American social worker) a methodologist with a doctorate in psychology, a social work doctoral candidate with a background in working with diverse populations, and a Native American prevention specialist. Questions related to diet, recreational tobacco use, and physical activity were included in the modified instrument while questions targeting behaviours not directly related to the topic under study were excluded. In the past there have been significant problems in validating brief instruments to assess dietary intake in Native American youth.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0017896911422773">25</xref></sup> These concerns were considered during the process of modifying the YRBS for use with this Native American population and Native specific questions (i.e. questions about consumption of common Native American dietary items such as fry bread) were added.</p>
<p>The modified instrument included a five-item cultural identification questionnaire developed by the Tri-Ethnic Centre for Prevention Research which has been used with youth across the country to measure identification with Native American and other cultural groups. This measure has internal consistency reliability in the high .80s.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0017896911422773">26</xref></sup> The modified instrument was tried with several Native American youth in the target age range to ensure that it was clear, understandable, and covered all relevant areas. Information gathered through this process was used to make final modifications in the instrument.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-0017896911422773">
<title>Subjects and recruitment</title>
<p>The subjects were 41 Native American youth ages 9–13 (21 males, 20 females) living in Buffalo and Niagara Falls, NY, US. The data gathered informed the development of a culturally-grounded programme designed to encourage healthy behaviours. Youth in the 9–13 age range were selected in order to target youth who have not yet initiated high-risk behaviour or who are currently faced with making such choices.</p>
<p>Recruitment was initiated through two mailings to families of Native American youth in the target age range residing in Buffalo, NY (a target population of approximately 234). It was hoped that the mailings would generate a sufficient pool to randomly select youth for interviews. These mailings were done by the Native American Resource Programme (a unit of the Buffalo school district) which has a list of all Native American youth in the district. These mailings resulted in limited responses. Subsequently, it came to light that many recruitment letters had not actually been mailed. Further attempts to work with the Native American Resource Programme were not productive. Given the problems with the original sampling plan, the project expanded to include advertising by using fliers at Native American community events and recruiting via a local Native American newsletter and Native American radio programme. Additionally, recruitment efforts expanded beyond Buffalo to include Native American youth in Niagara Falls, NY, a similar Haudenosaunee Native American population 15 miles from Buffalo.</p>
<p>All Native American youth who met study criteria and expressed an interest in participating were scheduled for an interview. Unfortunately problems arose with many of the scheduled interviews. Some weeks most or all of those who agreed to be interviewed were not home at the time of the scheduled interview, did not have guardians present who could sign a consent form, or had home addresses that could not be located. For example, in one instance the interviewer arrived and was admitted to the home by the youth but the custodial grandmother had just been taken to the emergency room. In other instances doorbells were inoperable and the interviewer was unable to ascertain if anyone was home. For reasons like these, the number of interviews conducted was far fewer than the number of interviews scheduled.</p>
<p>Prior to interviews with youth both parents and the youth were read and provided with a description of the study and what participation would entail. After any questions were answered, parents/guardians and youth were presented with consent and assent forms for their signatures. Questions were read to the youth and responses recorded by the interviewer on a questionnaire. Youth interviews were conducted by the Native American prevention specialist and the social work doctoral candidate in the homes of youth, in private areas adjacent to Native American community events, and at a Native American human service agency. At the end of each interview youth were asked to rate their level of honesty in answering the survey questions. Youth reported an average of 9 out of 10 on the honesty scale with 10 meaning ‘completely honest’ and 1 meaning ‘not honest at all’.</p>
<p>Seventeen caregivers were interviewed about their youth's home context with respect to study objectives. Caregivers were selected for interviews based on their availability. Prior to caregiver interviews, respondents were read and provided with a description of the study and what participation would entail. Caregivers were asked questions about behaviours related to diet, recreational tobacco use and physical activity. This data provides information about the context that the youth live in, including influences related to their own choices about diet, recreational tobacco use, and physical activities. All caregiver interviews were conducted by a Native American prevention specialist well known for his work in the Buffalo and Niagara Falls, NY, Native American communities for more than 10 years. Caregiver interviews were conducted at the homes of respondents or at a local Native American human service agency.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<sec id="section17-0017896911422773">
<title>Demographics</title>
<p>Of the 41 youth surveyed, 20 (48.8%) were female and 21 (51.2%) were male. All subjects were Native American, although 12 youth (29.3%) reported that they identified with at least one additional race/ethnic group. The average age of the youth was 11.6 years (range 9–13) and the average grade was 6th grade.</p>
<p>Of the 17 caregivers surveyed 15 were female and two were male. Fifteen of the caregivers identified as Native American (88.3%) and two of these (11.8%) identified with at least one additional race/ethnic group. The average age of the caregivers was 38.5 years with a range of 23–69 years old. Most of the caregivers (<italic>n</italic> = 12, 70.6%) had earned a general education degree (GED) or a high school degree. The average household size for these families was 5.4 people.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section18-0017896911422773">
<title>General health statistics</title>
<p>When asked about their general health status, 10 youth (24.4%) reported having some type of health issue or limitation. Half of the youth reporting a health issue stated that they had asthma and two (20%) reported having allergies. More than half the youth (56.1%) reported that someone in their family had a health issue or limitation. The most common family health concerns reported were diabetes (29.3% of the entire sample) and asthma (22% of the entire sample).</p>
<p>Youth respondents were asked for their height and weight. Nineteen (46.3%) did not know their height and 10 (24.4%) did not know their weight. Of those who did know their height, the average height was 5’2.6”. Of those who did know their weight, the average weight was 114.2 pounds.</p>
<p>The caregivers were also asked about their health status and that of other household members. On average, caregivers were 5’6” inches tall and weighed 182 pounds. Thirteen of the caregivers (76.5%) reported no personal health issues or limitations. The four caregivers who report personal health concerns mentioned problems with arthritis (<italic>n</italic> = 1), asthma (<italic>n</italic> = 1), bad back (<italic>n</italic> = 2), and knee injury (<italic>n</italic> = 1). One caregiver reported two health issues. The majority of caregivers (<italic>n</italic> = 11, 64.7%) reported health issues in their family. The primary issues reported were diabetes (<italic>n</italic> = 7; or 63.6% of the 11 who reported health problems); and asthma (<italic>n</italic> = 6 or 54.5% of the 11); other issues listed included cancer (<italic>n</italic> = 4; 36.3%), hepatitis C (<italic>n</italic> = 2), and heart murmurs (<italic>n</italic> = 2).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section19-0017896911422773">
<title>Tobacco and/or other drug use</title>
<p>The survey instrument differentiated between ceremonial and recreational tobacco use and inquired about both. Ten youth (24.4%) reported being present at a ceremony where tobacco was used. Only two youth (5%) reported ever smoking a cigarette and none had used chewing tobacco or smoked cigars. Two youth also reported using drugs or alcohol and one of these reported drinking beer in the last 30 days.</p>
<p>Although most of the youth were not using tobacco in a recreational manner themselves, many of the youth were exposed to the smoking of others. While 44% reported that none of their friends smoked, seven youth (17.1%) did have some friends who smoke, one reported that most of his/her friends smoke, and one reported that all of his/her friends smoke.</p>
<p>The caregivers were also asked about tobacco use in the household. Thirteen caregivers (76.5%) reported a family member who smoked or used smokeless tobacco. Of those who smoked, six (35.3%) reported smoking in the house including when the child was around. Twelve caregivers (70.6%) did not allow visitors to smoke within the home. Most of the caregivers (<italic>n</italic> = 16; 94.1%) reported speaking with the youth about recreational tobacco use with seven caregivers (41.2%) having talked to their child about smoking within the last week and an additional three (17.6%) having done so in the last two weeks. Of the 13 caregivers who reported a household member who smoked, 29.4% (<italic>n</italic> = 5) reported that a household member had tried to quit. Seven caregivers (41.2%) had used tobacco in a ceremonial context.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section20-0017896911422773">
<title>Weight/body image</title>
<p>Youth were asked questions that reflected how they felt about their weight and body image. These questions produced some contradictions. Nineteen youth (46.3%) described their body weight as ‘about right’, 12 (29.3%) reported being ‘slightly overweight’ and six (14.6%) reported being ‘slightly underweight’.</p>
<p>Even though only 29.3% identified as overweight, 46.3% (19 youth) reported wanting to lose weight. Twenty eight (68.3%) have exercised to lose weight, and 20 (48.8%) have eaten less to lose weight including four who have gone without eating for 24 hours. Two reported going so far as to vomit or use laxatives in order to lose weight. Two youth (5%) reported wanting to gain weight, 10 (24%) reported that they were trying to stay the same weight, and nine (22%) were not trying to do anything about their weight.</p>
<p>When asked about weight, the majority of caregivers (<italic>n</italic> = 9; 52.9%) reported one person within their household who was overweight. Additionally, four caregivers (23.5%) reported having two people in their household who were overweight and three caregivers (27.7%) reported having three or more family members in their household who were overweight. Of the 26 people identified as overweight, 19 were female (73.1%). Only three caregivers reported family members who were underweight and of these, two were males.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section21-0017896911422773">
<title>Diet</title>
<p>In order to gain an understanding of the dietary practices of this population, youth were asked about their food consumption during the previous seven days.

<p>When asked about their own dietary practices caregivers reported that a typical breakfast consisted of eggs and meat (bacon <italic>n</italic> = 7; corned beef <italic>n</italic> = 2; <italic>n</italic> = 9 or 53%), followed by cereal (<italic>n</italic> = 4; 23.5%). Eleven caregivers (62.5%) reported drinking fruit juice with their child for breakfast. Among the caregivers the most frequently reported lunch foods were sandwiches (<italic>n</italic> = 7; 41.2%).

The caregivers reported drinking mostly juice (<italic>n</italic> = 4), pop (<italic>n</italic> = 3), water (<italic>n</italic> = 2) and milk (<italic>n</italic> = 2) for lunch. At dinner time four caregivers (23.5%) reported eating some form of fast food such as pizza, hotdogs, cheeseburgers, or fried chicken. Three caregivers (17.6%) described having a dinner that included a meat (chicken, beef, or pork), potatoes (mashed) and vegetable (corn) for dinner. For dinner, caregivers reported drinking mostly water (<italic>n</italic> = 5; 29.4%), pop (<italic>n</italic> = 4; 23.5%), Kool Aid (<italic>n</italic> = 3; 17.6%), and Ice Tea (<italic>n</italic> = 3; 17.6%).</p>

<title>Physical activity</title>
<p>Youth were asked about their physical activities. On average, youth reported exercising about three out of the last 7 days. Six youth (14.6%) report exercising every day. On a typical school day the average youth spent about two hours per day sitting still. On the weekend the average youth spent about four hours per day sitting still. Thirteen youth (31.7%) reported sitting still for five or more hours on a weekend or vacation day. When school was in session most youth reported having gym class 2.5 days per week. Most, however, did not participate in any extracurricular physical activities. Twenty-eight youth (68.3%) did not participate in sports teams or dance groups. The caregivers reported exercising on average 3.4 days a week.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The data collected in this project yields important information on urban Native American youth in the northeast. A large percentage of these Native youth identify with more than one racial group. Additionally, these youth do appear to have a number of risk factors for cancer and other chronic diseases. These facts are important when designing multicultural wellness curricula for urban Native American youth.</p>
<p>Most youth and their caregivers reported health problems among family members. Diabetes and asthma were of particular concern. This confirms previous findings from studies conducted with Native groups in other regions of the country which found that Native Americans experience significant health concerns.</p>
<p>Smoking did not appear to be a problem for the youth in this study, most likely because of the age of the respondents. It is clear, however, that many of their family members and some of their peers smoke, thus exposing them to increasing temptation and pressure to initiate smoking as well as the effects of second hand smoke. Even though many of the caregivers report talking to the youth about the dangers of smoking, not all gave this message consistently, especially if they themselves were smokers. For instance, one caregiver when confronted by a youth about smoking who said, ‘pew, that stinks’ replied ‘don’t smoke then’ – hardly a convincing anti-smoking message.</p>
<p>A combination of poor dietary choices and a sedentary lifestyle does not bode well for these Native youth. For instance, eating a diet that is high in foods that cause a rapid rise in blood sugar such as refined carbohydrates (i.e. candy, soda, and refined grains like white rice and white flour) may increase a child’s risk of developing health problems such as diabetes and/or heart disease in later life.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0017896911422773">27</xref></sup> In particular, it appears that Native American youth are eating more sweets, salty snacks, soda, and fast food on a regular basis than eating vegetables and green salad. Household members also appear to have poor dietary practices and many of the youths’ family members are overweight. Youth appear concerned about their weight and are either trying to maintain their current weight or lose weight.</p>
<p>Youth are not exercising daily and are not participating in sports teams and/or dance groups. This may be related to the sports restrictions in most urban schools and the money needed to participate in dance class or sports outside of a school setting. Youth who are sedentary and do not participate in sports and exercise are at an increased risk of developing serious illnesses such as high blood pressure, diabetes, and heart disease.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0017896911422773">28</xref></sup> An increase in physical activities could prove positive for both physical well-being and self-esteem.</p>
<p>This study has a number of key strengths that make it a meaningful addition to the literature. The study was done with full involvement of the Native American community in the planning and implementation process with oversight of cultural and research advisors knowledgeable about Native American issues. It is also a strength that data were gathered from a non-clinical sample, thus being more likely to represent the health status and behaviours of the population of urban Native American youth in western New York. Additionally, the interviews with caregivers gave a fuller perspective and shed light on the home context of these youth.</p>
<p>The study also contains a number of limitations. Most notably, the sample is small and non-random; thus the project did not produce large-scale, generalizable knowledge. Given, however, that this is the only study of its kind with this population it still gives important information that can be built upon in the future. Additionally, it is important to note that the data collection was designed for the specific purpose of informing curriculum development efforts as part of creating a culturally-grounded wellness initiative. The information gathered in this study was well suited to that purpose.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>This study takes an important step in collecting preliminary information on the health behaviours of urban Native American youth in the northeast. Prior to this study, little data had been collected on the cancer risk factors of urban Native Americans and no data existed on dietary practices or physical activity levels of Native Americans in the northeast. This study takes a first step in addressing those gaps and providing information which informs prevention initiatives.</p>
<p>Of the three primary cancer risk factors examined in this study, diet and a sedentary lifestyle seem to be of particular concern. Smoking or other recreational tobacco use did not appear to be an issue for most of these youth but there is still substantial concern that they may initiate these behaviours later given the prevalence of smoking among family members and peers. The glimpse of the home context illustrates what type of lifestyle is being modelled for these youth. While caregivers do not appear to have a sedentary lifestyle, poor dietary practices and obesity do seem to be concerns in these households.</p>
<p>The information gathered in this project served as the foundation for developing a wellness curriculum designed to decrease cancer risk in this population. Subsequent articles report on development and testing of this wellness curriculum disease.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0017896911422773">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0017896911422773">30</xref></sup> While this is only a beginning, it is an important step in addressing an increasing concern with this often-neglected population of urban northeastern Native Americans.</p>
