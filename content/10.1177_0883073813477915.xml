<p>Epilepsy is a common disorder affecting approximately 1% to 1.5% of the world’s population. Therefore, the field of epilepsy is ever expanding and growing. Knowledge of epilepsy is being updated on a regular basis. Therefore, new textbooks about epilepsy are a welcome addition to the vast information currently available. People are constantly searching for textbooks that can easily be read. Understanding of the many facets of epilepsy can be difficult to place in one book.</p>
<p>This first edition textbook edited by Gonzalo Alarcón and Antonio Valentín provides 139 separate brief chapters and more than 600 pages covering most topics from the history of epilepsy to sudden unexplained death in epilepsy. The textbook covers the many facets of epilepsy from basic science topics to clinical presentation and treatment.</p>
<p>Because several textbooks are currently available in the field of pediatric epilepsy, this textbook is not as applicable in the field of child neurology. However, it does contain pertinent information about pediatric epilepsy and epilepsy in general. It is a good basic review of epilepsy without depth of detail. Specifically, the information of the new International League Against Epilepsy classification is useful and easy to read. One aspect covered is the psychosocial aspects of having and treating patients with epilepsy. Few introductory textbooks mention and cover these important aspects of epilepsy. Further, one could want to use this textbook if preparing for the upcoming new board certification examination in Epilepsy being provided by the American Board of Psychiatry and Neurology. In addition, the brief overview provided on all topics in epilepsy is useful for a quick reference.</p>
