<abstract>
<p>In the United Kingdom, Prime Minister’s Questions (PMQs) are a weekly 30-minute parliamentary session, in which the prime minister (PM) responds to questions from both government and opposition members of parliament (MPs). In this study, 18 PMQs (April-November, 2007) were analysed, 9 with Labour PM Tony Blair, 9 with his successor Gordon Brown; in all 18 sessions, their opponent was Conservative Party leader David Cameron. In PMQs, MPs are expected to converse through questions and replies, while refraining from “unparliamentary language” (e.g., direct insults to another MP). However, within these constraints, PMQs are notorious for adversarial discourse, analysed in this study through the concept of face-threatening acts (FTAs). Six distinctive ways in which FTAs are performed by the leader of the opposition in questions and five distinctive ways in which the PM may counter FTAs in replies were identified. Overall, it is proposed that face aggravation in PMQs is not just an acceptable form of parliamentary discourse, it is both sanctioned and rewarded, a means whereby MPs may enhance their own status through aggressive facework.</p>

<p>Prime Minister’s Questions (PMQs) are a constitutional convention in the United Kingdom whereby every Wednesday during parliamentary sittings, the prime minister (PM) responds to questions that may be posed by any member of parliament (MP). PMQs are sometimes likened to the knockabout comedy of the traditional popular British puppet show “Punch and Judy,” which features domestic strife and violence between the two central characters, Mr. Punch and his wife Judy. Notably, David Cameron (current British PM since 11 May, 2010) pledged to put an end to “the Punch and Judy politics of Westminster, the name calling, backbiting, point scoring, finger pointing,” after his election as Conservative Party leader (6 December, 2005). Subsequently (29 April, 2008), he admitted that he had not kept this pledge, blaming the adversarial nature of PMQs. Investigating the adversarial discourse of PMQs was the purpose of this study.</p>
<sec id="section1-0261927X11425034">
<title>The Social Frame of Prime Minister’s Questions</title>
<p>The tradition of PMQs dates right back to the 18th century, to the era of the first British prime minister, Sir Robert Walpole (1721-1742). In its present form, PMQs are a relatively recent innovation, dating from 1961, when Harold Macmillan was the Conservative PM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0261927X11425034">Harris, 2001</xref>). The procedure was changed in 1997 by Tony Blair (Labour PM, 1997-2007) from twice a week to just one weekly session every Wednesday, lasting for 30 minutes. Notably, the tradition of question time is not confined to the United Kingdom. In Canada, this convention is known as Question Period, in Australia and New Zealand as Question Time, in India as Question Hour. However, the ensuing discussion is based on British parliamentary procedure.</p>
<p>In the United Kingdom, backbench MPs who wish to ask a question to the PM must enter their names on the Order Paper. The names of entrants are then randomised in a ballot to produce a list in which they will be called by the Speaker of the House of Commons. (The Speaker presides over the House’s debates, determining which members may speak. The Speaker is also responsible for maintaining order during debate, and may punish members who break the rules of the House.)</p>
<p>PMQs always begin with the same tabled question to the PM, asking if he or she will list his or her official engagements for the day. At this point, the called member can put as a supplementary question (termed a <italic>supplementary</italic>) almost any question that relates to the PM’s general responsibilities or to some aspect of government policy. The MP is limited to this one supplementary and cannot follow up the PM’s response with any further utterance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0261927X11425034">Harris, 2001</xref>). However, this is permissible for the leader of the opposition (LO; currently the leader of the Labour Party), who is allowed up to six questions. These questions may be posed all in one bloc, or in more than one bloc (e.g., in two groups of three questions). Only the initial question regarding the PM’s engagements is tabled. Because MPs have the advantage of putting supplementaries to the PM without notice, PMQs have the important elements of unpredictability and surprise.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0261927X11425034">
<title>Question–Response Patterns</title>
<p>Like a broadcast political interview, PMQs take the form of question–response sequences. The principal difference is that the questions in PMQs are posed by opposing politicians, not by a professional political interviewer. As journalists, interviewers are expected to be impartial. For example, according to the editorial guidelines of the BBC, “impartiality lies at the heart of the BBC’s commitment to its audiences.” In contrast, politicians are restricted by no such constraints. They can be as partial and as unashamedly partisan as they choose. Criticisms and accusations are permitted in the House. Furthermore, MPs are protected by parliamentary privilege, which allows them to speak freely in the House of Commons without fear of legal action on grounds of slander. However, they are expected to observe certain traditions and conventions regarding what is termed <italic>unparliamentary language</italic>. Specifically, they should not be abusive or insulting, call another member a liar, suggest another MP has false motives, or misrepresent another MP. These conventions are enforced by the Speaker of the House, who may ask a member to withdraw an objectionable utterance. Over the years, Speakers have objected to the use of abusive epithets such as blackguard, coward, git, guttersnipe, hooligan, rat, swine, traitor, and stoolpigeon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0261927X11425034">House of Commons Information Office, 2004</xref>). A member who refuses to comply with the Speaker may be suspended from the House (referred to in parliamentary procedure as “naming”).</p>
<p>Thus, in PMQs, MPs must orient both to the expectation that the dialogue should follow a question–response pattern and refrain from unacceptable unparliamentary language. Within these constraints, they are still allowed a great deal of scope to attack and criticize their fellow MPs. In doing so, they may use considerable ingenuity to remain within the conventions of acceptable parliamentary language. For example, Winston Churchill once famously substituted the phrase “terminological inexactitude” for the unacceptable term <italic>lie</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0261927X11425034">House of Commons Information Office, 2004</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section3-0261927X11425034">
<title>Face and Face Management</title>
<p>In this article, the discourse of PMQs is considered in terms of face and face management. Most research on face takes as its starting point <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0261927X11425034">Brown and Levinson’s (1978</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0261927X11425034">1987)</xref> highly influential theory of politeness. According to Brown and Levinson, face is important in all cultures; it can be lost, maintained, or enhanced. Thus, face preservation is a primary constraint on the achievement of goals in social interaction. “Some acts are intrinsically threatening to face and thus require ‘softening’” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0261927X11425034">Brown &amp; Levinson, 1987</xref>, p. 24). Communicative actions such as commands or complaints may be performed in such a way as to minimise the threat to positive and negative face, where positive face is defined as “the want of every member that his wants be desirable to at least some others,” and negative face is defined as “the want of every ‘competent adult member’ that his actions be unimpeded by others” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0261927X11425034">Brown &amp; Levinson, 1987</xref>, p. 62). So, for example, a request to do something may threaten someone’s negative face (by restricting their freedom of action), whereas disagreements may threaten positive face (by showing a lack of approval).</p>
<p>Politeness theory itself was based on a highly influential article “On Face-Work” by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0261927X11425034">Goffman (1955/1967a)</xref>. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0261927X11425034">Goffman (1955/1967a</xref>, p. 5), face is “the positive social value a person effectively claims for himself by the line others assume he has taken during a particular contact.” From this perspective, face can be seen as the successful presentation of identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0261927X11425034">Holtgraves, 2002</xref>):</p>
<p><disp-quote><p>To fail to have one’s identity ratified is to lose face in an encounter, to have one’s identity ratified is to have face, to maintain an identity that has been challenged is to save face. Face, then, is something that resides not within an individual but rather within the flow of events in an encounter. (p. 39)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Goffman regarded face as salient in virtually all social encounters, and facework as the means whereby threats to face could be minimised. He specified three kinds of facework: an avoidance process (avoiding potentially face-threatening acts), a corrective process (performing a variety of redressive acts), and also what he called “making points” (the aggressive use of facework). The latter is elaborated in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0261927X11425034">Goffman’s (1967b)</xref> extended essay: “Where the Action Is,” in which he discussed incidents in which adversaries deliberately antagonize one another; the focus is on who will back down in such situations, and on what counts as backing down.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0261927X11425034">
<title>Rudeness</title>
<p>Interestingly, although <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0261927X11425034">Brown and Levinson (1978</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0261927X11425034">1987)</xref> were indebted to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0261927X11425034">Goffman’s (1955/1967a)</xref> analysis, they overlooked such instances of deliberate face aggravation. Within the framework of politeness theory, rudeness is envisaged simply as a deviation from or violation of rules of cooperative/polite communication. In fact, rudeness can be deliberate and motivated, if not calculated and strategic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0261927X11425034">Kienpointer, 1997</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0261927X11425034">Lakoff (1989)</xref>, in her article on “the limits of politeness,” observed that politeness is primarily associated with ordinary conversation. She proposed that theories of linguistic politeness must be extended to discourse in professional and institutional contexts. She further proposed that linguistic behaviour can be subdivided into three rather than two types (polite, nonpolite, and rude), and that this subdivision becomes much more visible in institutional settings. Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0261927X11425034">Kasper (1990)</xref> distinguished between motivated and unmotivated rudeness. Whereas unmotivated rudeness refers to violations of the norms of polite behaviour because of ignorance, motivated rudeness refers to deliberate norm violation—in the sense that the speaker intends to be heard as rude, and to hurt the other person. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0261927X11425034">Culpeper (1996)</xref> has argued that in some contexts (e.g., army training and literary drama) impoliteness is not a marginal activity, but central to the interaction that takes place, which he represents in his model of impoliteness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0261927X11425034">Culpeper, 1996</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0261927X11425034">2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0261927X11425034">Culpeper, Bousfield, &amp; Wichmann, 2003</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0261927X11425034">
<title>Face-Threatening Act Tactics</title>
<p>In the context of political discourse, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0261927X11425034">Ilie (2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0261927X11425034">2004)</xref> has studied rudeness by focussing on the use of insults in parliamentary debates in both the United Kingdom and Sweden. In the context specifically of PMQs, a study of adversarial discourse was conducted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0261927X11425034">Harris (2001)</xref>, titled, “Being politically impolite.” She analysed 12 sessions of PMQs, recorded between March and November 2000. Harris argued that much of the discourse of PMQs is composed of intentional and explicitly face-threatening acts (FTAs). She further argued that systematic impoliteness is not only sanctioned in PMQs but also rewarded in accordance with expectations of the members of the House of Commons, through an adversarial and confrontational political process. Hence, even the most serious FTAs rarely, if ever, result in a breakdown in interpersonal relationships; nor are they intended to. MPs clearly perceive that the main role of the political opposition is to oppose, that is, to criticize, challenge, subvert, and ridicule the policies and positions of the government. Nowhere is this more evident than in these weekly exchanges between the PM and the LO. Indeed, the latter is likely to regard his or her reputation as a skilful and effective adversary as a significant measure of his or her success as a leader, whereby he or she can best enhance his or her own “face” by undermining that of the PM. Arguably, this adversarial and confrontational process has only been heightened by the televising of the House of Commons (since November 1989).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0261927X11425034">Harris (2001)</xref> identifies a number of techniques whereby FTAs may be performed. For example, one strategy is to ask a question that contains a request for highly specific information, which the PM may not have to hand, or may not wish to publicize. If the PM declines or fails to answer the question, the LO may then subsequently provide the information in order to embarrass or attack the PM. Also common are questions that build in presuppositions or construct implicatures that are face-threatening to the PM. The question “Doesn’t he find it deeply disturbing that the Trade Secretary is a classic example of this all mouth and no delivery Government” presupposes that the government is “all mouth and no delivery.” Again, the question, “Will the PM promise straightforwardness and honesty in future health announcements” carries the implicature that past announcements have not been honest and straightforward. Harris observes that the latter example is particularly interesting, since conventions regarding unparliamentary language prohibit MPs from explicitly accusing each other of lying. A direct accusation will result in severe sanctions, with the MP being expelled from the Chamber by the Speaker unless she or he immediately retracts the accusation.</p>
<p>Thus, in contrast to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0261927X11425034">Brown and Levinson (1978</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0261927X11425034">1987)</xref>, who were principally concerned with the avoidance or mitigation of FTAs, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0261927X11425034">Harris (2001)</xref> argues that in the discourse of PMQs, face threats are intentionally intensified. At the same time, Harris also notes other discursive features that may co-occur with FTAs, and may be used to soften the full force of FTAs. For example, MPs use distancing strategies, such as addressing their remarks to the Speaker of the House rather than directly to the PM, referring to MPs in the third person (rather than as “you”), and using formal and honorific titles (e.g., the Right Honourable Gentleman, the Foreign Secretary). Although in other situational contexts, such practices might suggest a high degree of formality and deference, in PMQ discourse Harris observes that they are often combined with intentional FTAs. In this context, they arguably serve to mitigate FTAs, thereby keeping the discourse within the bounds of acceptable parliamentary language.</p>
<p>Whereas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0261927X11425034">Harris’s (2001)</xref> article was based on the use of illustrative examples, the aim of this study was to conduct a more systematic investigation of PMQs. Specifically, the aim was to develop a conceptual framework for analysing PMQs by identifying specific techniques for posing and countering face-threatening questions in this context. Attention was also given to Harris’s concept of mitigating techniques. As noted above, MPs are expected to observe a question–response dialogue in PMQs, while refraining from “unparliamentary language.” Thus, although MPs may not directly insult one another, if the insult is couched in the form of a question or included within a response, it may be regarded as acceptable.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0261927X11425034">
<title>Sequential Interaction</title>
<p>In practice, however, it is not questions and responses that form the interactional units of PMQs but speaking turns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0261927X11425034">Harris, 2001</xref>). Prototypically, these take the form of a series of propositions followed by an interrogative (e.g., is the PM aware that, will he assure the House that), plus a final information-seeking or action-seeking summarising proposition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0261927X11425034">Harris, 2001</xref>). However, Harris also observes a number of variations on this basic prototypical theme. For example, MPs may ask more than one question, in the form of either several coordinating or independent interrogative clauses. Again, they may preface their questions with one or more propositions, or with attacks on other politicians. They may also make jokes or asides. Notably, through these kinds of discursive action, FTAs may be performed, which are part of the wider speaking turn but do not necessarily constitute interrogatives as such.</p>
<p>Overall, this study focuses specifically on interchanges between the LO and the PM. Given that the LO is allowed to ask up to six questions, these interchanges have the advantage for the analyst that it is possible to focus on sequential interchanges. For example, if the PM equivocates in response to a question, the LO has the opportunity to pose the question again, or to pose it in a slightly different form, or to draw attention to the PM’s equivocation through various forms of FTA.</p>
<p>Eighteen PMQ sessions were analysed from 2007, when the Labour government was still in power. It was during this year that Tony Blair resigned as PM (27 June), so that it was possible to sample PMQ performance from two different PMs. Accordingly, the study focussed on the last nine sessions leading up to Tony Blair’s resignation (18 April to 27 June) and the first nine sessions of Gordon Brown’s premiership (4 July to 21 November). In summary, the main aim of the study was to identify different techniques whereby questioning turns are used by the LO to attack the PM, and how the PM uses his response turns to counter these attacks, while both politicians orient to the conventions of acceptable parliamentary language. Techniques for mitigating FTAs were also identified.</p>

<title>Participants</title>
<p>The participants in this study were PMs Tony Blair and Gordon Brown, and the leader of the Conservative opposition, David Cameron. An analysis of 18 sessions of PMQs from 2007 was conducted. Nine featured Tony Blair, the last nine PMQs before his resignation as PM on 27 June (18, 25 April; 2, 9, 23 May; 6, 13, 20, 27 June, 2007). The other nine featured Gordon Brown, his first nine PMQs as PM (4, 11, 18, 25 July; 10, 17, 24 October; 14, 21 November, 2007). During all 18 sessions, they responded to questions from David Cameron (LO).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0261927X11425034">
<title>Apparatus</title>
<p>Video recordings of PMQs are available from the Downing Street website (<italic><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://Number10.gov.uk">Number10.gov.uk</ext-link> logo: The official site of the PM’s Office</italic>; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.number10.gov.uk/">http://www.number10.gov.uk/</ext-link>). Transcripts are available from Hansard, the written record of parliamentary debates in the House of Commons (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm/cmhansrd.htm">http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm/cmhansrd.htm</ext-link>).</p>
<p>Hansard, it should be noted, is not a full verbatim record of parliamentary proceedings. It is intended to be “substantially the verbatim report, with repetitions and redundancies omitted and with obvious mistakes corrected, but which on the other hand leaves out nothing that adds to the meaning of the speech or illustrates the argument” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0261927X11425034">May, 2004</xref>, p. 260). Hence, in this study, verbatim transcripts were made directly from the video recordings, not from Hansard. Using this procedure, all the questions from David Cameron to both Tony Blair and Gordon Brown were transcribed, as were the responses from both PMs.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0261927X11425034">
<title>Procedure</title>
<p>The verbatim transcripts were then used as the basis for identifying FTAs in questioning turns, techniques whereby the PM countered FTAs in his response turns, and mitigating techniques. Transcripts were analysed by the first and second author independently, who then met on a regular basis to discuss their analyses. Disagreements were resolved by discussion.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>The results are presented in the form of three subsections: (a) questioning turns, (b) response turns, and (c) mitigating techniques. Questioning turns identify different techniques whereby the LO performs FTAs. Response turns identify different techniques whereby the PM counters FTAs in questioning turns. Mitigating techniques identify means whereby the participants soften the full force of FTAs. Notably, whereas question–response sequences form the basic interactional units of PMQs, mitigating techniques may occur in both question and response turns. An illustrative example is presented for each category.</p>

<title>Preface</title>
<p>According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0261927X11425034">Harris (2001)</xref>, questions prototypically take the form of a series of propositions followed by an interrogative (e.g., is the PM aware that, will he assure the House that). These propositions which preface the interrogative may be used to perform FTAs.</p>
<p>For example, the following extract (18 April) comes after a previous question to Tony Blair in which he was asked to endorse Gordon Brown (the then Chancellor of the Exchequer) as his successor, but he declined to do so. David Cameron commented on this: “The interesting thing is that the Prime Minister will not endorse the Chancellor.” David Cameron then launched a wholesale attack on Gordon Brown:</p>
<p><disp-quote><p>We know why we do not want the Chancellor—he has complicated the tax system and virtually bankrupted the pensions system, he is impossible to work with and he never says sorry. That is why we don’t want the Chancellor.</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Finally, David Cameron posed his next question: “What does he [i.e., Tony Blair] think is wrong with him [i.e., Gordon Brown]?”</p>

For example, David Cameron posed the following question to Tony Blair regarding the size of the prison population (20 June):</p>
<p><disp-quote><p>This week we have the scandal of the PM, in his last few days in office, opening the prison gates and releasing 25,000 prisoners on to our streets. Can he tell us when he was first warned that the prison population would go over 80,000?</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Tony Blair equivocated at length in response to David Cameron’s question, who then in his next turn supplied the answer to his own question:</p>
<p><disp-quote><p>I asked the PM a very simple question: When did he first know that the prison population would exceed 80,000? The truth is that the PM was told by the Home Office in 2002, five years ago, by the Home Office that the prison population this year was projected to be not 80,000 but 88,000. That was five years ago. Why did the Government so comprehensively fail to act in response to that warning?</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Overcrowding in British prisons has long been recognised as a serious problem. David Cameron’s question regarding the size of the prison population was clearly disingenuous, given that in his next turn, he answered his own question. The first question implicitly threatened the face of both Tony Blair and his government, because if Tony Blair had known about the projected rise in the prison population 5 years previously, then the government should have taken action earlier. In his follow-up question, David Cameron made this face-threat explicit, by specifically asking, “Why did the government so comprehensively fail to act in response to that warning?”</p>

<sec id="section15-0261927X11425034">
<title>Contentious presupposition</title>
<p>Presuppositions are often considered as involving some notion of what is “given” in an utterance, the assumed knowledge a speaker takes for granted which she or he shares with the addressee. In the context of broadcast interviews, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0261927X11425034">Harris (1986)</xref> pointed out that interviewers by no means confine themselves to presuppositions that contain shared or “given” knowledge; they may indeed be highly controversial or open to dispute. Similarly in PMQs, questions may be based on presuppositions that are in themselves highly face-threatening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0261927X11425034">Harris, 2001</xref>). A particularly striking example of this is the use of insults. To directly insult another member of the House of Commons is not acceptable, it is regarded as a form of “unparliamentary language.” However, this convention may be circumvented by embedding insults in the presuppositional content of the question.</p>
<p>In the following example (2 May), David Cameron asked Tony Blair for further information about his successor as PM, Gordon Brown:</p>
<p><disp-quote><p>David Cameron: Why is the PM so coy? Why will he not tell us a bit about the man who will be our PM and how he managed to get the better of him? Given that the PM said that he would serve a full third term, does that mean that when he walks out of No. 10 Downing Street, this Parliament is at an end, or was that the last of his broken promises?</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Thus, rather than explicitly accusing Tony Blair of “breaking promises,” for which David Cameron would almost certainly have been pulled up by the Speaker, David Cameron presupposed that Tony Blair breaks promises by asking “. . . was that the last of his broken promises?”</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section16-0261927X11425034">
<title>Conflictual question</title>
<p>According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0261927X11425034">Bavelas, Black, Chovil, and Mullett (1990)</xref>, equivocation occurs in response to questions that create a communicative conflict (CC), where all the possible replies have potentially negative consequences, but nevertheless a reply is still expected. In the context of broadcast political interviews, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0261927X11425034">Bull, Elliott, Palmer, and Walker (1996)</xref> argued that a prime cause of such conflicts is “threat to face.” If all the possible replies to a question will make the politician look bad and/or constrain his or her future freedom of action, then the most likely response is to equivocate. Thus, conflictual questions create pressures towards equivocation, which in itself can also be face-damaging, because it makes the politician look evasive. However, it is typically less face-damaging than 18 other forms of face-threat, specified in a typology of questions devised by the senior author and his colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0261927X11425034">Bull et al., 1996</xref>).</p>
<p>The following example refers to the loss of two computer discs holding the personal details of all families in the United Kingdom with a child 16 years and younger (announced by the government, 20 November, 2007). The Child Benefit data on them included name, address, date of birth, National Insurance number and, where relevant, bank details of 25 million people. This was the latest in a series of such data losses. At PMQs the next day (21 November), David Cameron asked Gordon Brown, “Does the government accept systemic failure in this department?” (i.e., of Revenue and Customs). Thereby, David Cameron created a classic CC. A reply in the affirmative would be openly to acknowledge government incompetence. A denial of any failure would lack all credibility, given the magnitude of the loss of sensitive data. Just as equivocation theory would predict (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0261927X11425034">Bavelas et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0261927X11425034">Bull et al., 1996</xref>), Gordon Brown failed to reply to David Cameron’s question, avoiding any mention of the phrase “systemic failure,” proposing instead to conduct a review of procedures at Revenue and Customs.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section17-0261927X11425034">
<title>Invitation to perform a face-damaging response (FDR)</title>
<p>Another way of using questions to perform FTAs is to invite the respondent to perform some kind of face-damaging act (e.g., by apologising, by criticising a member of his or her own party, by admitting that a particular policy has been a complete failure, or that a government department has been incompetent). Thus, in a further question about prisoner releases (20 June, see “Detailed Question” subsection above), David Cameron invited Tony Blair to apologise for the early release of prisoners:</p>
<p><disp-quote><p>Ten years ago, he told us that he would be tough on crime; now he is releasing 25,000 criminals on to our streets. Shouldn’t he, just this once, apologise for what can only be described as an abject failure to deliver?</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>The early release scheme (whereby prisoners were released from prison before completing their sentence in full) was announced on 20 June, 2007 by Lord Falconer (the then Secretary of State for Justice) as a means of reducing prison overcrowding. Arguably, this scheme was tantamount to a government admission that it had failed to make adequate provision for the increase in the prison population. Notably, David Cameron combined his invitation to perform an FDR with a contentious presupposition: The use of the term <italic>just this once</italic> implied that Tony Blair never apologises.</p>
<p>Another important feature of David Cameron’s question is that it creates a CC. Thus, whatever response Tony Blair chose is potentially face-damaging. If on the one hand, he had apologised, it would have been tantamount to an admission that government policy on the prison population had been a failure. If on the other hand, he refused to apologise, it might make him sound arrogant, given that the early release scheme could be readily understood as a failure by the government to make adequate provision for the increase in the prison population. In fact, as equivocation theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0261927X11425034">Bavelas et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0261927X11425034">Bull et al., 1996</xref>) would predict, Tony Blair avoided this dilemma by not directly addressing David Cameron’s question as to whether he should or should not apologise. Instead, he stated, “I entirely regret, as I have said, I regret very much having to take the measures on early release.” Arguably, the use of the term <italic>regret</italic> does not have the full pragmatic force of an apology (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0261927X11425034">Kampf, 2009</xref>), in that it attenuates any sense of government responsibility for prison overcrowding. This equivocal response may also be regarded as face-damaging, since it makes the PM look evasive.</p>
<p>Arguably, it is not merely the invitation to perform an FDR that is face-threatening. For example, if the PM were asked to apologise for some action for which no apology seems necessary, the question could easily be refuted with a refusal to apologise, or simply ignored. Indeed, if the demand for an apology is patently absurd or ridiculous, it will be face-damaging to the questioner, not to the PM. But if the invitation to perform an FDR were also to create a CC, this would put pressure on the PM to perform the FDR, to refute the need to perform it, or to equivocate. Any of these responses would be potentially face-threatening.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section18-0261927X11425034">
<title>Aside</title>
<p>Speakers may depart from the question format to make asides, which may be used to perform FTAs. Asides may occur in either the preface or the interrogative. In the following example (17 October), David Cameron used an interruption from a Labour MP to make an aside attacking the Labour government for its lack of discipline. In attempting to put his question, David Cameron was interrupted twice by shouting; the Speaker then reprimanded the Labour MP: “Order order. I hope the Honourable Gentleman Mr. Austin you’re not going to keep shouting again. You’re a difficulty in PM’s questions because you keep shouting. You shouldn’t do it.” David Cameron then used this reprimand to quip in an aside: “It comes to something when you have to tick off the PM’s own PPS” (Ian Austin was Parliamentary Private Secretary [PPS] to Gordon Brown). David Cameron’s aside was greeted by laughter, before he continued with the main body of his question concerning the National Health Service (NHS).</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section19-0261927X11425034">
<title>Responses</title>
<p>A number of different ways are distinguished, whereby the PM can respond to FTAs in questioning turns: talk up positive face (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0261927X11425034">Brown &amp; Levinson, 1978</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0261927X11425034">1987</xref>), rebut, attack, ignore, and self-justify. These different tactics are not necessarily alternatives: They may be used singly or in any combination.</p>
<sec id="section20-0261927X11425034">
<title>Talk up positive face</title>
<p>Shortly before Tony Blair’s retirement, David Cameron attacked him by saying, “This is the Government of the living dead. Why do we have to put up with even more paralysis?” (9 May). Tony Blair made no attempt directly to answer the question, but responded by talking up the positive face of the government:</p>
<p><disp-quote><p>The government have run the strongest economy that the country has seen in 10 years. Just last week, health service waiting lists again down. The best school results that the country has ever seen, and living standards for every section of the population are up.</p></disp-quote></p>
<p><italic>Rebut</italic>. In a rebuttal, the PM explicitly refutes the FTA performed by the questioner. For example, in the following sequence (17 October), Gordon Brown extensively rebuts David Cameron’s charge that he is not listening to people in the NHS in the context of hospital-acquired infections (MRSA and C difficile):</p>
<list id="list1-0261927X11425034" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p>David Cameron: . . . If we’re going to deal with hospital acquired infections, doesn’t the Prime Minister understand, he has got to listen to the people who work in the NHS?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The PM (Gordon Brown): Mr. Speaker, it is precisely because I have been listening to the British people [shouting], that we’ve put an extra £100 million into tackling MRSA and C. difficile. It is precisely because we are listening that, since I took over this job, we are now insisting that every patient who comes to hospital is going to be screened against the possibility of MRSA. It is precisely because we’re listening that we’re going to do a deep clean of hospital wards. And it is precisely because I’m listening that we’re going to double the number of matrons. Now, none of that extra expenditure would be possible if we accepted the Conservative Party plans on spending.</p></list-item>
</list>
</sec>
<sec id="section21-0261927X11425034">
<title>Attack</title>
<p>A third way of responding to an FTA is to attack. In September 2007, following Gordon Brown’s appointment as PM (27 June, 2007), there was intense speculation that he would call a general election. Gordon Brown failed to rule out the possibility of a general election until Saturday, 6 October, following a surge in Conservative Party support in the opinion polls after their annual conference that week (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0261927X11425034">Webster &amp; Riddell, 2007</xref>). David Cameron took the opportunity at the next PMQs (10 October) to pose the following question, to which Gordon Brown notably made no attempt to reply; he simply launched into an attack on David Cameron:</p>
<list id="list2-0261927X11425034" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p>David Cameron: The big question this week is: can we believe what the PM says? So let us start with his credibility gulf over the election. The PM was asked, “Hand on heart, if the polls showed a 100-seat majority, would you still have called off the election?” and he said yes. Does he expect anyone to believe that?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The PM (Gordon Brown): I will take no lectures from the leader of the opposition. This summer he was for grammar schools, against them and then for them again. He was for VAT on air fares and then against it. He was for parking charges and then against it. He was for museum charges and then against it. I will take no lectures from the leader of the opposition about that [VAT—Value Added Tax, an indirect tax on goods and services].</p></list-item>
</list>
</sec>
<sec id="section22-0261927X11425034">
<title>Ignore</title>
<p>Another way of dealing with an FTA is simply to ignore it. In the previous example, Gordon Brown ignores the attack on his credibility by David Cameron, and responds with an attack of his own. In the following example (17 October), David Cameron challenged Gordon Brown to hold a referendum on the amending treaty to the European Union (EU) which David Cameron claimed fundamentally changed the constitutional position of the United Kingdom in the EU. Gordon Brown ignored David Cameron’s accusation of cowardice, and the charge that no one will trust him ever again, arguing that the amending treaty is not a fundamental change to United Kingdom’s position in the EU, and therefore did not require a referendum:</p>
<list id="list3-0261927X11425034" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p>David Cameron: People, people will look at him and just say, here is a man who breaks his promise [cheering]. Why doesn’t he admit the reason he won’t have a referendum is that he’s scared of losing it? [cheering] And doesn’t he understand that if he breaks his promise on this, no one will trust him on anything else [cheering and shouting].</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The PM (Gordon Brown): Mr. Speaker, if we were deciding to join the euro, we would have a referendum. If it was the old constitutional treaty, we would have a referendum. Because it is an amending treaty that is not fundamental change, we have managed to negotiate red lines in Europe which mean that the national interests is protected, and Britain will decide on justice and home affairs, Britain will decide on foreign policy, where it’s multilateral, Britain will decide on social security, and Britain will decide on national security. And we will, at all times, stand up for the British national interests [cheering and shouting].</p></list-item>
</list>
</sec>
<sec id="section23-0261927X11425034">
<title>Self-justify</title>
<p>A fifth strategy for dealing with an FTA is that of self-justification, whereby the PM offers reason, explanations, or excuses for the actions he has taken. In the example above (17 October), the whole of Gordon Brown’s turn can be seen as elaborate justification for his decision not to call a referendum on the EU amending treaty.</p>
<p>Notably, all these strategies can be used in combination. In the example quoted above (“Preface” subsection), in which David Cameron asked what did Tony Blair think was wrong with Gordon Brown, Tony Blair used four identifiable strategies in his response:</p>
<p><disp-quote><p>Let me tell the right hon. Gentleman what is right with the Chancellor <italic>[Ignore (does not say what is wrong with Gordon Brown); positive face (talks up the Chancellor)]</italic> The right honourable Gentleman has some experience of the economy, has he not? He had something to do with the British economy once hasn’t he? Back in 1992, did he not? He was the special adviser to the Chancellor of the time—we remember Black Wednesday. <italic>[Attack]</italic> The Chancellor has delivered the strongest economic growth that this country has ever seen, interest rates half what they were under the previous Conservative Government, the highest employment, the lowest unemployment for years and rising living standards. <italic>[Talk up positive face &amp; rebut]</italic> What’s he delivered for the British economy? A bit part on Black Wednesday [<italic>Attack using a joke at David Cameron’s expense]</italic>.</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>(It should be noted that Black Wednesday refers to the events of 16 September, 1992 when the Conservative government was forced to withdraw the pound sterling from the European Exchange Rate Mechanism. In 2005, under the Freedom of Information Act, the loss to the United Kingdom Treasury was revealed as £3.3 billion. David Cameron was working at that time as special adviser to the then Chancellor of the Exchequer, Norman Lamont).</p>

<title>Mitigating Techniques</title>
<sec id="section25-0261927X11425034">
<title>Third party language</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0261927X11425034">Harris (2001)</xref> notes the use of distancing strategies, such as addressing remarks to the Speaker of the House rather than directly to the PM, and referring to MPs in the third person (rather than as “you”). In the following example (10 October), David Cameron launched a wholesale attack on Gordon Brown, while still addressing his remarks to Mr. Speaker, and referring to the PM as “he”:</p>
<p><disp-quote><p>What we won’t forget—and what the British people will not forget—is that the PM made a promise and he has broken it. We have a PM who will not talk straight about the election, who will not own up on inheritance tax and who will not keep his promises on an EU referendum. Never have the British people been treated with such cynicism. Mr. Speaker, for 10 years the PM plotted and schemed to have this job—and for what? No conviction, just calculation; no vision, just a vacuum. Last week he lost his political authority, and this week he is losing his moral authority. How long are we going to have to wait before the past makes way for the future?</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>If David Cameron’s comments were addressed more directly to the PM (e.g., “<italic>you</italic> have plotted and schemed to have this job . . . <italic>you</italic> have lost <italic>your</italic> political authority, and this week <italic>you</italic> are losing <italic>your</italic> moral authority”), it would make the attack much more personal, and might be regarded as beyond the bounds of acceptable parliamentary language. Certainly, he would be corrected for not addressing his remarks to the Speaker. The use of third party language arguably softens the force of the attack, and indeed is a requirement according to the conventions of parliamentary discourse (although of course politicians do not always follow the rules).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section26-0261927X11425034">
<title>Humorous discourse</title>
<p>Humorous discourse is another way of mitigating the full force of an FTA. In the following example (17 October), Gordon Brown mocked David Cameron’s pretensions by using one of his own quotes against him, in which David Cameron had compared himself to Arnold Schwarzenegger (the Hollywood action-film icon, Austrian American bodybuilder, and former governor of the state of California). In this way, Gordon Brown could imply that David Cameron has ridiculous delusions of grandeur without ever explicitly saying so:</p>
<p><disp-quote><p>. . . I know that the leader of the opposition likes pre-rehearsed soundbites. I know that I know that he is good at PR. I acknowledge that the leader of the opposition is good at PR, but did he not go too far last weekend when he went to California and said in a newspaper interview: “Look at me” he said, “look at me” he said “and think of Arnold Schwarzenegger”? That is the last thing on anybody’s mind [Laughter].</p></disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section27-0261927X11425034">
<title>Quotation</title>
<p>In the above example, Gordon Brown quoted from a newspaper interview with David Cameron to ridicule him. Quotations are another technique used in PMQs to mitigate FTAs. In the following extract (10 October), David Cameron mocked Gordon Brown’s timidity in not calling a general election in the autumn of 2007 (see the “Attack” subsection above) by quoting from Gordon Brown’s own book on Courage. Rather than directly calling Gordon Brown a coward, David Cameron can use Gordon Brown’s own words to imply this insult:</p>
<p><disp-quote><p>He is the first PM in history to flunk an election because he thought that he was going to win it. Does he, does he remember writing this? It is in his best-selling book about Courage: “As far back as I can remember, I have been fascinated by men and women of courage. Stories of people who took brave decisions in the service of great causes . . . especially when more comfortable and far less dangerous alternatives were open to them”. Does he realise what a phoney he now looks? Has he found a single person who believes his excuses for cancelling the election?</p></disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section28-0261927X11425034">
<title>Opponent’s mistake</title>
<p>If a speaker makes a mistake or a slip of the tongue, this may give an opposing politician the opportunity for an FTA. As with quotations, it is a way of using another politician’s words against them, thereby mitigating the full force of the FTA. For example, in responding to a question on the EU (17 October), Gordon Brown mistakenly referred to William Hague, the then Shadow (opposition) Foreign Secretary, as Foreign Secretary: “In 1992, every member of that Shadow Cabinet refused a referendum on a far more significant treaty. The Foreign Secretary voted against a referendum on Maastricht.” (The Maastricht Treaty of 1992 led to the creation of the euro, the European common currency.) David Cameron was quick to pounce on this mistake, observing that “The PM called my Right Honourable Friend the Member for Richmond, Yorkshire, Mr. Hague, the Foreign Secretary. I have to say to him that it is just a matter of time.” Thereby, David Cameron was able to imply that the Labour Party would soon be out of office, and the Conservative Party in government. (Subsequently, William Hague was appointed Foreign Secretary by David Cameron in May 2010.)</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The aim of this article has been to present a conceptualisation of facework in PMQs, based on the identification of techniques of face threat and face management used by both the PM and LO. This analysis further substantiates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0261927X11425034">Harris’s (2001)</xref> proposal that face aggravation is a salient feature of PMQ discourse. As such, PMQs may be regarded as another exemplar of situations described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0261927X11425034">Culpeper (1996)</xref>, in which impoliteness is not a marginal activity, but central to the interaction that takes place.</p>
<p>Notably, adversarial discourse finds no place in the politeness theory formulated by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0261927X11425034">Brown and Levinson (1978</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0261927X11425034">1987)</xref>. Their focus is on the strategic avoidance of FTAs. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0261927X11425034">Brown and Levinson (1987</xref>, p. 60), “It will in general be in the mutual interest of two MPs (Model Persons) to maintain each other’s face.” But in PMQs, not only are FTAs not avoided, face threats are also intentionally intensified. Indeed, systematic impoliteness is not only sanctioned but also rewarded (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0261927X11425034">Harris, 2001</xref>). Such face aggravation is not just a deviation from the norms of politeness, but an active strategy, which needs to be incorporated into any theoretical conceptualisation of face and facework.</p>
<sec id="section30-0261927X11425034">
<title>Face Concerns</title>
<p>According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0261927X11425034">Goffman (1955/1967a)</xref>, concerns with face are salient in virtually all social encounters. Arguably, face and facework are of particular importance for politicians, especially in an adversarial political system such as that in the United Kingdom, which is dominated by party politics. But the way in which face and facework function in political discourse will vary according to genre of communication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0261927X11425034">Bull &amp; Fetzer, 2010</xref>). For example, a political speech (monologue) gives the politician the opportunity to enhance positive face through displaying rhetorical skill, presenting new policies, celebrating past achievements, and talking up his or her own political party. It also gives the politician the opportunity for face aggravation, by attacking and criticising his or her political opponents. In broadcast interviews, politicians must defend themselves against questions which pose a threat to face (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0261927X11425034">Bull et al., 1996</xref>). That is to say, politicians will avoid responding to questions in ways which may make them look bad or circumscribe their future freedom of action. Politicians also run these risks in PMQs, but in addition, there is the further risk from insults and derogatory remarks from opposing politicians, who use face aggravation as a deliberate strategy, as shown both by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0261927X11425034">Harris (2001)</xref> and by the results presented here.</p>
<p>The analysis presented in this article is intended to provide guidelines for future research on PMQs, and an overall conceptual framework for investigating particular communicative strategies. For example, one strategy of interest is that of inviting the PM to perform an FDR. It has been hypothesised above that it is the packaging of an FDR as a CC that makes it face-threatening, not just the invitation to perform an FDR alone. This hypothesis could be investigated through the detailed analysis of a sample of such questions, which could be drawn from further analysis of the database reported here. Another strategy of interest is that of asking disingenuous questions, specific questions to which the questioner already knows the answer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0261927X11425034">Harris, 2001</xref>). Detailed analysis of a sample of such questions might illuminate in what ways they are used to embarrass or attack the PM, and also how they may be used to set up further attacks on the PM in subsequent questions by the LO.</p>
<p>It would also be of interest to investigate different strategies for countering FTAs in questions. Is it best to rebut such threats, or just to ignore them, to present positive face, or to attack? Notably, Tony Blair was widely regarded as much more effective at PMQs than Gordon Brown. Whereas Gordon Brown was described as “. . . charmless, with an alarming inability to come up with a witty riposte,” Tony Blair was said to be “. . . master of the quick quip, which could disarm an opponent, or better still, appear self-deprecatory, in order to win public sympathy” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0261927X11425034">Ashley, 2010</xref>). The conceptualisation presented in this article provides a means not only for a more detailed comparison of Gordon Brown’s and Tony Blair’s relative skills in handling PMQs but also at a more abstract level a means for evaluating the relative effectiveness of different techniques for responding to FTAs in questions.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section31-0261927X11425034">
<title>Alternatives to Face Aggravation</title>
<p>Although the focus of this analysis was specifically on face aggravation, this is not the only form of facework which may occur in PMQs. The PM does not receive questions just from opposition MPs; throughout each session, the Speaker tries to alternate between opposition questioners and supporters of the government. Notably, MPs from the PM’s own party are notorious for asking “toadying questions,” which may be totally disingenuous, intended not only to ingratiate the individual MP with the PM but also to give him or her the opportunity to put the government in the best possible light. Such questions can readily be understood in terms of face enhancement, and would certainly merit detailed analysis as an example of another kind of facework in PMQs. Again, it might be of interest to examine those rare occasions on which both PM and LO do enhance one another’s positive face, in contrast to the incidences of face aggravation considered above. Furthermore, it would also be of interest to investigate how the mitigating techniques (described in the “Mitigating Techniques” subsection) map on to both questioning and response turns (“Questioning Turns” and “Responses” subsections).</p>
<p>The analysis presented in this article shows that politicians have an extensive armoury of devices for performing FTAs in PMQs. How well the democratic process is served by these techniques is quite another issue. That the leader of the government is open to question in Parliament from any MP once a week is undoubtedly an important democratic principle. Furthermore, the entitlement of the LO to pose up to six questions is also important; it allows him or her to challenge obvious equivocation by the PM, to follow up particular issues, and to press home a particular point. At the same time, there are many people who find the ensuing party political dogfight distasteful, perhaps because it is such a blatant violation of the rules of cooperative/polite communication described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0261927X11425034">Brown and Levinson (1978</xref>/<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0261927X11425034">1987)</xref>. It may be that face aggravation is systemic and unavoidable in PMQs, and that alternative forms of discourse are also possible. In future research, this might be investigated by analysing those questions in which politicians do not use face aggravation as a strategy.</p>
<p>Notionally, PMQs are constrained by conventions that dialogue should adhere to a question–response pattern, and that participants should refrain from unacceptable unparliamentary language. But from the analysis presented here, it can be seen how participants actively use those constraints and conventions to perform acts of face aggravation. Whereas facework is typically conceptualised as form of politeness, this analysis shows how it may be used for discourse that is anything but polite. Figuratively, PMQs may be likened to a form of verbal pugilism, conducted under arcane conventions resembling the Queensbury rules of boxing (so-called because they were originally publicly endorsed by the Marquess of Queensbury). As such, PMQs represent a rich data source for the analysis of techniques of face aggravation, which we propose needs to be represented in any comprehensive conceptualisation of verbal aggression.</p>
