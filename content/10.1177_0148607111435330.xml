<body>
<p>The National Board of Nutrition Support Certification (NBNSC) is an independent credentialing board responsible for administering certification examinations for multidisciplinary healthcare professionals who specialize in nutrition support therapies. The NBNSC has offered certification programs in nutrition support to nutrition support professionals (NSPs), including nurses (since 1985), dietitians (since 1988), and physicians (since 1996). The goal was to enhance the delivery of safe and effective nutrition support for the protection of the public. The NBNSC’s certification program was designed to (1) establish the body of knowledge necessary for certification, (2) test through examination the common body of knowledge necessary to deliver parenteral nutrition (PN) or enteral nutrition (EN) support, (3) recognize specialty knowledge by granting certification to successful candidates, and (4) promote continual professional development of individuals delivering nutrition support services.</p>
<p>A well-constructed practice audit is the foundation of a valid, reliable, and legally defensible professional certification program that represents clinical practice and is considered the highest level of supporting evidence. The practice audit is used to determine the specific content of practice, the frequency with which these functions are performed, and importance of the function by the professional. Furthermore, establishing the link between test scores and competency supports the inference that the scores achieved on the certification examination are content valid and reflect practice and that pass or fail decisions correlate with competent performance.</p>
<p>In 2005, the NBNSC conducted a practice analysis of all NSPs, including dietitians, nurses, pharmacists, physicians, and physician assistants. On the basis of the results of the practice analysis, the NBNSC determined that a single multidisciplinary examination should be administered to all disciplines.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0148607111435330">1</xref></sup> To date, the multidisciplinary examination continues to be administered to dietitians, nurses, pharmacists, physicians, and physician assistants as a single examination. The purpose of the present practice analysis was to define current practice in terms of the tasks that would be performed and the knowledge base that would be used by NSPs, as well as to provide the foundation of the content outline (test specifications) for the multidisciplinary examination.</p>
<sec id="section1-0148607111435330" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>The Standards for Educational and Psychological Testing served as the standards for development of all aspects of the test, including test development, passing score, administration of tests, and reporting of results.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0148607111435330">2</xref></sup> The NBNSC enlisted the psychometric services of Comira (Folsom, CA) to assist with the design and implementation of the survey.</p>
<sec id="section2-0148607111435330">
<title>Survey Instrument Development and Construction</title>
<p>To ensure that the examination reflected the actual tasks performed by NSPs, a content validation strategy was employed to establish the link between the job tasks and the content of the examination. The development of the survey tool was achieved in 3 phases. In the first phase, a conceptual understanding of the profession was obtained by conducting a thorough review of available published literature, guidelines, standards, and relevant resource textbooks and manuals in the field.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0148607111435330">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0148607111435330"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0148607111435330"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0148607111435330"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0148607111435330"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0148607111435330"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0148607111435330"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0148607111435330"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0148607111435330"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0148607111435330"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0148607111435330"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0148607111435330"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0148607111435330"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0148607111435330"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0148607111435330"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0148607111435330">18</xref></sup> References were searched until no new references could be identified. Data were also obtained by conducting background research and interviews for the practice analysis until no new tasks or knowledge were identified.</p>
<p>In the second phase, subject matter experts (SMEs) from all disciplines with varying degrees of experience in nutrition support, practicing in a variety of settings and geographic locations, were used to provide content expertise. The SMEs were asked to identify major subject matter areas of their practice and the job tasks performed in each subject matter area. They were also asked to identify specific knowledge and abilities necessary to perform each job task safely and competently. The information gathered from the interviews was transcribed and combined with information from background materials to develop a preliminary list of job tasks and knowledge statements with a consistent format and language (see the appendix online at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jpen.sagepub.com/supplemental">http://jpen.sagepub.com/supplemental</ext-link>).</p>
<p>In the final phase, the preliminary list of job tasks and knowledge was critically reviewed by an independent focus group of SMEs to provide the depth and breadth in the tasks and knowledge such that they were sufficient to develop items for an examination. The task and knowledge statements were refined until each was the same conceptual size, structured in a consistent format, and phrased in consistent technically and conceptually accurate terminology. Every task was associated with at least one knowledge statement. Likewise, every knowledge statement was associated with at least one task. The task statements were used as the basis of the survey questionnaire; the knowledge statements were linked to the task statements when the content outline was developed (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0148607111435330">Table 1</xref>).</p>

<p>Two rating scales were used in the survey to determine the frequency with which the task was performed and the significance of that task to patient safety and welfare (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0148607111435330">Table 2</xref>). The behavioral descriptors on the anchors of the rating scales were constructed to ensure that there were equal intervals between descriptors (eg, slightly significant, somewhat significant, quite significant, extremely significant). Practitioners were asked to consider the relative importance of tasks. The mean frequency and significance for patient safety and welfare ratings were then calculated for the tasks. The average of the weights for the tasks in each subject matter area was then used to determine the percentage of items to be developed for each subject matter area.</p>

<title>Sample Population</title>
<p>The sample population was derived from all members in the American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (A.S.P.E.N.) database. The survey questionnaire was made available to 5100 multidisciplinary clinicians via an Internet link provided by Comira between December 2010 and February 2011. Reminder e-mails were sent periodically throughout the study period to encourage participation from nonresponders.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0148607111435330">
<title>Data Analysis</title>
<p>To achieve adequate power, an a priori analysis was conducted. The minimum number of completed surveys required to represent a statistically valid sample was ≥357 (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .05). Demographics provided by the survey were used to determine whether the sample was reflective of the NSP population (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0148607111435330">Table 3</xref>). Element analysis was performed on the total sample as well as the following subgroups: years of experience, geographic region, and discipline. The internal consistency of the reliability of the respondents’ ratings of job tasks and knowledge was evaluated with a standard index of reliability, coefficient α. Coefficient α for task ratings was highly significant (α &lt; 0.01; tasks: <italic>r</italic><sub>freq</sub> = 0.97; <italic>r</italic><sub>significance</sub> = 0.97). The overlap in job tasks across the professions and similarities in their profiles of task ratings were analyzed using correlational methods. Data were analyzed using SPSS version 18 (SPSS, Inc, an IBM Company, Chicago, IL).</p>

Dietitians reported the highest perceived percentage overlap (38%), followed by physicians (31%), pharmacists (26%), physician assistants (22%), and nurse practitioners (22%), whereas nurses reported the lowest percentage overlap (14%). These results come entirely from the judgments of the respondents and not directly from their ratings of task frequencies and significance to patient safety/welfare.</p>
<p>To further explore the overlap in duties across the professions, we analyzed similarities in their profiles of task ratings using correlational methods. First, mean ratings of frequency and significance were computed for each of the 6 professions. The mean frequency and significance ratings of each group for each of the 60 tasks were then used as the groups’ profile. The correlations between these profiles were then computed to evaluate the consistency in patterns of the profiles, and they were also evaluated with principal component analysis to determine whether the professions would divide into distinct clusters with different profiles.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0148607111435330">Table 4</xref> presents the correlation matrix among frequency rating profiles between the 4 professions that had sufficient sample sizes to assume the profile was stable and representative. Nurse practitioners (n = 4) and physician assistants (n = 2) were excluded. Although the correlations in the matrix were moderate to large, consistent with the previous analysis of ratings of the respondents’ perception, the nurses appeared to have the relatively more distinct profiles as indicated by the fact that the 3 lowest correlations (<italic>r</italic> = .361, <italic>r</italic> = .510, and <italic>r</italic> = .518) involved nurses.

<p>This pattern was further explored by conducting a principal component analysis to this correlation matrix. Eight-five percent of the variance was explained by the first 2 components. The varimax-rotated component loadings, plotted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0148607111435330">Figure 1</xref>, indicate that the first component was made up of dietitians, pharmacists, and physicians, whereas the second component was defined primarily by the nurses.

<p>There was overall agreement among the disciplines with regard to the frequency of job tasks and the significance of the tasks for patient safety and welfare. However, the respondents’ estimates of overlap and the analysis of correlations among profiles of task ratings in the different professional specialty areas both support the conclusion that the duties of nurses tend to diverge slightly from a relatively homogeneous cluster of dietitians, pharmacists, and physicians. The latter specialties, on the other hand, appear more similar in the duties they frequently perform and the tasks they feel are most significant to patient safety/welfare. The slight differences in the nurses’ responses may reflect that they are often in positions that are skill related (eg, feeding tube placement, central line access and care, patient education) rather than prescribing nutrition support.</p>

<title>Element Analysis</title>
<p>The 60 identified elements were evaluated based on mean frequency, mean significance rating, mean criticality rated by role (dietitian, nurse, nurse practitioner, pharmacist, physician, or physician assistant), and the years of experience of the NSP (≤5 years or &gt;5 years). Overall, the tasks were considered to be “quite significant” (≥3) and “often performed” (≥3). In addition, the mean critical value (∑ [frequency × significance]) was calculated for each element with the majority being &gt;10. None of the elements had to be excluded due to low frequency or lack of importance, thus reflecting 100% agreement among the disciplines of the importance of each element to nutrition support practice, even if they did not perform the element directly. There were some minor differences in reported importance based on the role of the NSP. Dietitians rated the evaluation of tolerance to EN support therapy and modification of nutrition support therapy based on changes in the patient’s clinical status and medical plan of care higher than did other NSPs. Psychosocial, economic, developmental, functional, and behavioral factors related to food and/or nutrition support therapy, as well as the development of a plan to educate patient, caregivers, and healthcare professionals regarding nutrition support therapy, were rated higher by nurses and nurse practitioners.</p>
<p>Pharmacists rated recommending use of pharmacologic adjunctive agents and reevaluation of adjunctive drug therapy to increase efficacy of nutrition support therapy higher than the other disciplines. Establishing and confirming access for nutrition support therapy was rated higher by physicians and nurse practitioners than the other NSPs. Even though evaluation of the status of enteral or vascular access devices and consideration of legal issues in the application of nutrition support therapy were not performed routinely by NSPs, these elements were rated as very important (mean score of 3.39 and 3.30, respectively) to the safe and effective performance of an NSP.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Nutrition support therapy is complex and is best performed by clinicians who have specialized training and experience. As noted by the responses to this survey, additional training beyond the entry-level status of a professional degree is usually required. Specialty certification provides a means to assess whether an individual has attained sufficient knowledge to provide safe and effective care. It provides a means by which the public and the scientific community can identify qualified nutrition support clinicians. For patients, the designation of the specialty credential in nutrition support provides assurance that the clinician is uniquely qualified to provide the therapy safely and effectively with improved outcomes. From the employer perspective, it provides assurance that the knowledge base and skill level of the certified specialists they hire have been thoroughly tested through a standardized validated examination. There are also benefits to the clinician. Respondents from the survey used the Certified Nutrition Support Clinician (CNSC) credential to obtain a position for which it was required, advance in position, and attain a salary increase. For many clinicians, successful achievement of the CNSC credential provided personal validation of their knowledge. The CNSC is a highly visible credential and provides instant recognition of a defined level of learnedness.</p>
<p>All 60 elements examined in the survey were determined to be important to safe nutrition support practice by respondents and were actually performed by NSPs. There were some minor differences in importance rating for some functions based on professional role, yet there was general agreement of the importance and need to perform all of the NSP functions surveyed. The results of this study continue to support a multidisciplinary test as there was considerable overlap in functions, meaning that more than one NSP of differing professional backgrounds could perform the function.</p>
<sec id="section11-0148607111435330">
<title>Other Nutrition Support Certifications</title>
<p>The NBNSC currently offers the only scientifically validated multidisciplinary nutrition support exam to test safe and effective nutrition support practice (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table9-0148607111435330">Table 9</xref>). Two other examinations are discipline specific and test certain aspects of nutrition support practice. The Board of Pharmacy Specialties (BPS) offers an examination to credential pharmacists who practice as nutrition support specialists and confers the credential of Board Certified Nutrition Support Pharmacist (BCNSP) to those who meet the requirements. It is cosponsored by A.S.P.E.N. and the American Society for Health-System Pharmacists. The difference with the certification process between BPS and NBNSC is the objective for certification and candidate eligibility. BPS measures what is considered in pharmacy practice to be maximal competence in nutrition support. The test contains elements that are specific to pharmacy practice. Whether the examination actually assesses the current practice of nutrition support pharmacy needs to be determined.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0148607111435330">19</xref></sup> The NBNSC validates, based on scientifically predetermined standards, an individual’s knowledge of safe and effective multidisciplinary practice in nutrition support. A practice audit is performed every 5 years to ensure the examination reflects current practice. Eligible candidates for the NBNSC exam include dietitians, nurses, nurse practitioners, pharmacists, physicians, and physician assistants. Two years of experience in nutrition support is highly recommended as data from previous test results indicate that the percentage of candidates passing increases significantly at the 2-year mark.</p>

<p>The American Board of Physician Nutrition Specialists (ABPNS) offers a nonvalidated empirically conceived examination to physicians, which covers general aspects of clinical nutrition. The test contains some components of nutrition support practice but is not specific to nutrition support. Unlike NBNSC and BPS, which confer credentials to successful candidates, the ABPNS does not award any acronym to a physician who has passed its examination. There are also differences with regard to the recertification and maintenance of these various credentials. The NBNSC confers the CNSC credential to the successful candidate for a 5-year period based on the premise that nutrition support knowledge advances at least every 5 years. Recertification is accomplished by examination to ensure continued competence. Recertification for BCNSP is based on earning a minimum of 30 hours of continuing education in nutrition support with no less than 10 hours earned every 2 years and recertification by examination every 7 years. The ABPNS certification is valid for 10 years, at which time recertification is necessary. From the results of this survey, many clinicians reported obtaining multiple credentials, not only in nutrition support but also in related clinical specialties.</p>

<sec id="section12-0148607111435330">
<title>Specialty Certification vs Advanced-Level Practice</title>
<p>The distinction between specialty certification and advanced-level professional practice deserves mention. Specialty certification recognizes technical knowledge beyond entry level in focused areas of practice (eg, nutrition support, pediatrics, diabetes, oncology). The assessment tool is generally an examination and may include a requirement for continuing education credits. Some advanced specialty certifications test for a higher level of knowledge in a particular field. For example, the American Association of Diabetes Educators sponsors an examination that, when successfully passed, leads to the Board Certified in Advanced Diabetes Management (BC-ADM) credential. Other programs provide recognition of exceptional professional characteristics, commitment, leadership, sustained contributions, and achievements in practice that are advanced and highly developed. These credentials are often awarded through programs within discipline-specific, restricted associations and societies. The successful candidate is awarded the title of “Fellow” (eg, FACS, FACG, FASCP, FCCP, FAAN). The requirements for fellow status vary depending on the discipline and the awarding society. The assessment tool may include examination but is generally a portfolio appraisal by peer review, which evaluates professional activities such as publication history, clinical experience, research, teaching, and contributions to the profession.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0148607111435330">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0148607111435330"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0148607111435330"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0148607111435330">23</xref></sup></p>

<p>The results of this study define the tasks and knowledge required for safe nutrition support practice from which the examination content outline is developed. The findings also continue to support a common core of practice across nutrition support disciplines, as well as a common core of elements believed to be important for competent nutrition support practice. Accordingly, the NBNSC will continue to offer 1 examination to all disciplines both nationally and internationally and confer the credential, CNSC, to all individuals who successfully pass this validated examination.</p>
