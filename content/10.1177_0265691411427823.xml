<p>War has moulded Russia in the twentieth century, not only its boundaries, but also its polity, society and culture. The conflict with Japan from 1904 to 1905 provoked the first revolution – the ‘dress rehearsal’ as Lenin called it. The First World War brought the Bolshevik leader to power as the tsarist empire was imploding, while the Second extended the influence of his successor Stalin westwards. Then, the Cold War raised the Soviet Union to superpower status before contributing to its collapse. Each of the books under review makes a significant contribution to our understanding of this process, while the personal experiences of some of the authors are illuminating, too. For example, let us hope that nobody will have to repeat the experience of Anna Krylova during the years of <italic>perestroika</italic>, when her high school education came to an odd end with the cancellation of an exam in history, depriving her and her classmates of a coherent view of the Soviet past at the same time as stressing through its absence the necessity of the subject for personal as well as national identity, however prone to varied, even contradictory, accounts. And let us recall that, during the years of the Cold War, pressure for conformity was not exerted exclusively from the Kremlin: Sergei Kudryashov relays a telling anecdote from the late John Erickson about a visit by members of British intelligence wanting him to explain his favourable attitude to some Soviet works on the High Command.</p>
<p>The vantage point of the early twenty-first century encourages the search for some form of objectivity back beyond the twentieth. In one of the first Russian secular works to touch on international relations, V.N. Tatishchev wrote in 1730 that ‘Great and spacious states with many envious neighbours’ could not be governed by aristocracy nor democracy but only by autocracy, ‘particularly where the people is insufficiently enlightened by education and keeps the law through terror, and not from good conduct, or knowledge of good and evil’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0265691411427823">1</xref></sup> By the end of the eighteenth century, the autocratic Russian Empire had consolidated its hold on Ukraine and the Baltic provinces by participating in the partitions of Poland. After the defeat of Napoleon in 1812, it was ready to participate fully in the councils of Europe while poised to push further into Asia. The situation of Western empires in general was well expressed by Chancellor Gorchakov in 1864: ‘The United States in America, France in Africa, Holland in her colonies, England in India, were all forced to take the road of expansion dictated by necessity rather than ambition, a road on which the chief difficulty is to know where to stop’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0265691411427823">2</xref></sup> Nearly a century on, after 1945, while old empires declined, even collapsed, the two superpowers continued to grow.</p>
<p>Pushed back by China in the Treaty of Nerchinsk in 1689, Russia had recovered enough ground for the foundation in 1860 of the coastal city of Vladivostok – ‘Ruler of the East’. To fight a modern war in the Far East in 1904–5, however, Russia had to reach it via railways, the Trans-Siberian and the Chinese Eastern (CER). As Patrikeeff and Shukman point out, the development of this means of communication and transport was both an advantage and a disadvantage for the central government in faraway St Petersburg. Without the ‘iron road’ (as it is called in Russian), the army could not have fought the battle of Mukden in such large numbers. To transport 370,000 troops such a vast distance was a great achievement, yet the loss of so many of them provoked disturbances back in Moscow and in other cities. Then, in the aftermath of war, Russia faced a dilemma in Manchuria: either to stand its ground and thus create a precedent for Japan, or to unite with China against their offshore rival. Much of the problem stemmed from the nature of the railways. The Trans-Siberian failed to meet targets of colonial expansion, leading to little more than a ribbon or corridor development close to the line. Moreover, by 1918, an additional 15,600 kilometres of trunk line were deemed necessary for increases in freight and production. Back in 1904, there was little or no local backup for the armed forces. The railway itself was incomplete, particularly at Lake Baikal. A temporary track collapsed when the ice supposed to support it gave way; men and materiel alike sank to the depths. Thereafter, hungry soldiers had to go by frostbitten foot, while supplies alone were carried across the lake. Nearer to the field of conflict, the Chinese Eastern Railway was in a position to make a formidable contribution, but its dutiful personnel were subject to ‘the knee-jerk requirements of Russian officers who saw the CER as little more than a service, rather than as an integrated element of their strategy-making’ (Patrikeeff and Shukman, 89). Patrikeeff and Shukman conclude with the observation that both Britain and Japan in China put the failure of Russian imperialism in clear relief, the former by skilful bureaucratic organization and acculturation of elites, the latter by a prodigious capacity for long-term planning and provision.</p>
<p>An example of Japanese foresight was the secondment of officers to spy out the military capabilities of the Far Eastern empire of Nicholas II in 1894, the year of his succession. The tsarist secret service was of older provenance, and became more active in the period after 1869, following an attempt on the life of Alexander II, although his assassination in 1881 indicated that there was ample room for further improvement. Then, at the beginning of the twentieth century, along with other European powers, Russia improved the organization of its Military Intelligence (MI). At first, however, perhaps sharing their sovereign's disdain for Orientals, Nicholas's MI underestimated Japanese war potential in almost every aspect. In the estimation of Evgeny Sergeev, whose book is founded on a widespread investigation of archival sources, this underestimation set Russia on course for defeat even before hostilities began. To be sure, he continues, the military intelligence machine soon cranked up several gears, improving its organization and employing foreign as well as domestic operatives, in particular Frenchmen and Germans. There was at least one Englishman, Collins by name, formerly a jockey at the court of the Mikado and fluent in Chinese as well as Japanese. He was soon caught and given a hefty sentence of penal servitude, only to be given amnesty after the war at the request of the British Foreign Office. During the war, Russian MI swiftly moved from underestimation of its Japanese counterpart to overestimation. Indeed, Japanese MI made several important contributions, for example to the victory at Mukden. But, after the notorious Dogger Bank incident, enemy agents were suspected of lurking in every shoal, even though the Japanese plan was to await the Russian fleet in domestic waters. In spite of all its shortcomings, Russian military intelligence would not have been ready for the First World War without the previous conflict with Japan, in Sergeev's view. Technical improvements included telegraph and radio stations, searchlights and balloons, even an early attempt at the construction of a helicopter. Data cross-checking and the use of coded names also marked steps forward, altogether enough for the Chief of the German General Staff to observe already in a secret memorandum of 1908 that ‘the Russian intelligence machinery comprises a well-ordered, widely dispersed system, which has considerable funds’ (Sergeev, 185).</p>
<p>German apprehension regarding tsarist modernization was one of the reasons for the First World War, which led to the downfall of the Central and East European empires and the making of many new boundaries for the successor states. Then, Germany and Russia made an accommodation at Rapallo in 1923, leading in turn to one of most significant questions of interwar history – the nature of Nazi–Soviet relations. No definitive answer can be given, partly because of the paucity of sources on key aspects of the subject or the laconic style of those that are available. However, collaboration between the German Historical Institute in Moscow and the Archive of the President of the Russian Federation via the journal <italic>Rodina</italic> has produced a collection of documents that goes a considerable way towards filling the gap. In their introduction, Berndt Bonwetsch and Sergei Kudryashov remind us that Rapallo became less important for the Soviet Union in the later 1920s than broader concepts of non-aggression and collective security. How important now was the commitment to world revolution represented by the Third International? Certainly, Stalin's aversion to social democracy was ideologically driven, but on other aspects of policy, he appears more pragmatic to Bonwetsch and Kudryashov. They do not share the view that he went as far as to consistently favour collaboration with Nazi Germany from the first: recognizing that he saw distinct commercial and strategic advantages in the relationship, they also assert that negotiations with Britain and France in 1939 were not just for show or tactical reasons. However, the Soviet government was not prepared to act unilaterally any more than these other powers in defence of the status quo, and gave way to Nazi pressure for renewed collaboration which von Papen went as far as to call a reversion to the friendship of the Bismarckian period. According to Khrushchev's memoirs, Stalin believed that he had outsmarted Hitler in 1939. Possibly, overconfidence led to his refusal to accept the reality of the threat in 1941. He also appears to have considered that Hitler wanted to concentrate on the defeat of Britain, was anxious lest the flight of Rudolf Hess to Scotland was aimed at rapprochement and did not want to provoke the Nazi leader into an attack on the Soviet Union. However, although several documents illustrate the rundown to Barbarossa, Bonwetsch and Kudryashov readily concede that much concerning the policies of Stalin as well as Hitler remains a matter of speculation.</p>
<p>In his book, entitled ‘<italic>On the Eve of Tragedy</italic>’, Academician A.O. Chubar’ian focuses on Stalin and the international crisis during the period from September 1939 to June 1941. Some British readers would want to insist no doubt that the tragedy of war was already entering its first act rather than its prologue in September 1939. There will also be differences of viewpoint regarding other aspects of the conflict. But herein lies some of the great value of this book, which considers the period from the Soviet point of view. This is not to say that it is an apology for Stalin, far from it – however difficult it is to separate the ideological presuppositions and personal inclinations of the leader and his henchmen from other considerations besides <italic>Realpolitik</italic>. As Chubarian reminds us, this is a subject additionally complicated by a number of antitheses: totalitarianism and democracy, nationalism and internationalism, compassion and cruelty, achievements and errors, loyalty and treachery. In his account there are no heroes or villains, although there is no whitewashing of either Hitler or Stalin. While it can hardly be faulted for applying its focus closely to its chronological framework, more reference to long-term considerations would have been welcome.</p>
<p>There remain a number of blank spots in the subject: in particular the deliberations of Stalin and his associates remain a matter of guesswork in spite of memoirs and recollections. This means that we cannot be certain of the mix between the search for security and the realization of expansionist ambition. In the end, as Chubar'ian writes in the final sentences of his comprehensive study, Stalin did not want to believe that war was imminent in June 1941, but all political and diplomatic means had been exhausted. All he could do now was wait.</p>
<p>The sources for the book are taken from a wide range of printed collections of documents, as well as from archives not only at home but also abroad, for example the National Archive in the UK. Moreover, for more than half a century, Chubar'ian has been an assiduous participant in national and international meetings on aspects of the subject, discussing them with colleagues from countries with which the Soviet Union was on far from good terms – Finland, Poland and the Baltic states – and there can be few historians as aware as he of their loyalties and convictions. Beyond doubt, by no means all of them will agree with his findings and arguments. For example, not all those from the Baltic states will accept that their pre-1940 regimes were right-wing authoritarian, still less that the Sovietization imposed on them with the collaboration of their left-wing parties led to some socio-economic and cultural improvements as well as repressions and deportations.</p>
<p>However, on the events of 1939, there would be a large measure of agreement between Alexander Chubar'ian and Šarūnas Liekis, who firmly puts the blame on the Lithuanian government. His argument runs as follows. In the years between the wars, the regime attempted to impose a uniform ideology of an idealized nationality, suppressing the freedom of the press and the plurality of opinions while underestimating the strength of feeling among minorities. It assumed that the country would remain independent forever, and did not take seriously enough the first major threat to its confidence in Klaipėda, which the local German population was more than ready to accept in March 1939 as Memelland, an integral part of the German ‘homeland’. When the Red Army entered Vilnius in September, there was no shortage of citizens claiming long-held loyalty to the Soviet Union. Liekis does not shrink from the problem of popular anti-Semitism and the widespread belief that the ruling party was working in the interests of ‘international Jewry’, suggesting that the Vilnius question helped to desensitize the people of the region towards Jewish suffering during the Holocaust. Perhaps Liekis could have done more to include his subject in the wider international context. Even more than other states in Central and Eastern Europe, Lithuania was a far-off country of which the Western powers knew and cared little in 1939 and after. On the other hand, most of it had been an integral part of the Russian Empire for many years before it was lost in the war following the Russian Revolution, and its reincorporation was seen by Stalin and his advisers as essential for Soviet security.</p>
<p>Certainly, Liekis should be excluded from the criticism of Sergei Kudryashov in his introduction to a collection of documents on the war from 1941 to 1945, chiding the governments of the independent Baltic republics for encouraging the rehabilitation of Nazi Germany and denigrating the contribution of the Soviet Union to its overthrow. In contrast, more recently, he finds a much more objective approach, even in the publications of the Soviet Union's former greatest enemy, for example in the 10 volumes of <italic>Das Deutsche Reich und der Zweite Weltkrieg</italic>, published by the German Military History <italic>Forschungsamt</italic>. Moreover, the collection of documents on the years 1941–45 under present review, like its predecessor on the years 1933–41, is published in collaboration with the German Historical Institute in Moscow. It throws new light on many activities, from those of the Leader downwards. For example, there are excerpts from Stalin's diary of meetings on the first day of the war. Far from succumbing to an inactive state of shock at Hitler's treachery on 22 June 1941, as has sometimes been alleged, the General Secretary was visited by Molotov and other high officials from 5.45am to 16.45 pm. Documents 34, 58, 67, 81 and others refer to the mobilization of reserves, reflecting the size of the losses. A series of captured German documents concerning the activity of Soviet partisans, among other subjects, concludes the volume.</p>
<p>Much too young to remember the Great Patriotic War but ‘a bewildered witness to the Soviet historical monolith’ (Krylova, xiii), Anna Krylova began her search for an alternative world view in the USA, lighting on the subject of her book as she became acquainted with gender discourse analysis. Soviet attitudes to women in pre-war days consisted of a blend of traditional patriarchy and post-revolutionary egalitarianism. The German invasion of 1941 moved many young women to volunteer for fighting at the front, and they were soon accepted to play more than their traditional part of nursing, with super snipers and ace pilots among them. A measure of their acceptance was the introduction by late 1943 of a flap in their battledress. Of course, other gender issues did not disappear, and after the war, there was something of a reversion to type. For example, one of the many heroes of the Soviet Union, Valeriia Gnarovskaia, was increasingly celebrated for tending wounded comrades rather than killing Nazi enemies. In her conclusion, Krylova finds it far from inconceivable that counterparts might be found to the Soviet woman citizen-soldier in British and American wartime society. This admirable endeavour will undoubtedly meet formidable obstacles. For example, in Britain, the female pilots of the Air Transport Auxiliary were restricted to flying planes from factory to airfield, while their comrades in the less hidebound USA might have discussed the possibilities of air combat but were never allowed to join in it. In the Soviet Union, on the contrary, women were involved in the fight from the first.</p>
<p>Behind the lines, en route for evacuation in Central Asia, travellers were affected both by official planning and the unofficial system known as <italic>blat</italic> – a network of personal connection and influence often involving supplication and bribery. Not surprisingly, then, as Rebecca Manley judiciously writes of recent evaluation of the evacuation:<disp-quote>
<p>[it] is alternatively presented as a formidable Soviet accomplishment and as a moment of breakdown and betrayal. It is remembered as a rescue operation and a source of suffering, a period of solidarity and one of isolation and ethnic tension. In reality, it was all these things. (Manley, 274)</p></disp-quote>Between the summer of 1941 and the autumn of 1942, approximately 16.5 million citizens were sent well behind the lines from eight invaded Soviet republics. The evacuations of the First World War provided a clear precedent, yet the official placed in charge of the operation could not find a scrap of information about them in the archives and libraries of Moscow, while the most recent Soviet statute was still in draft form and Stalin himself wanted to have nothing to do with it, at least at first. So there was much improvisation tending to follow the pattern of social stratification. Thus, rather than women and children or the sick and the elderly, bureaucrats and other members of the establishment tended to be given priority. To be sure, some people did not want to move, believing that Hitler would not harm Russians, only Jews, while others were deported. Tashkent was the main station among many to which the evacuees were sent. In the Uzbek capital city, the new arrivals did not for the most part meet with a warm welcome and, without <italic>blat</italic>, many of them were forced to live on the streets. Among the more favoured were members of the cultural intelligentsia, one of them, the poet Anna Akhmatova, writing not only ‘bitter is the air of banishment – like poisoned wine’ but also ‘Who dares to tell me, that I am in a foreign land?’ (Manley, 2, 236) The film director Sergei Eisenstein proclaimed upon his removal to Alma-Ata: ‘we are soldiers of art, going to assume our assigned positions’ (Manley, 36). His was the director's chair, for the controversial film <italic>Ivan the Terrible</italic>. At the war's end, there were many further problems for those exiled in the cities of Central Asia, both in securing the return train and in re-occupying their homes.</p>
<p>Why did the Russians and other peoples of the world not enjoy the peace that they so richly deserved? Why did the Cold War ensue? Among the most emphasized reasons has been the Soviet Union's recapture and extension of influence in Central and Eastern Europe. But Campbell Craig and Sergey Radchenko find the answer elsewhere, looking upon ‘Hiroshima as the final American strike of the Second World War, and Nagasaki as its first strike in the Cold War’, although admitting that they make the point ‘a bit crudely’ (Craig and Radchenko, 89). In a more nuanced manner, they take us through the years immediately leading up to 1945. Ultimately, however, they believe that the superpowers could not move gradually towards a compromise peace for three main reasons. First was the Soviet Union's firm and unwavering commitment to acquiring the bomb. Second, the discovery of Soviet atomic espionage made it impossible for the US administration to continue cooperation with the Soviet Union: to do so would have meant political suicide for Truman. Third, and most formidable in the estimation of the two authors, the very novelty of atomic weapons inhibited the construction of a genuine international order. However, their book construes the behaviour of the main antagonists differently: while Roosevelt and Churchill conducted normal foreign relations between themselves, they found it impossible to pursue them with Stalin, who engaged in cynical <italic>Machtpolitik</italic>, especially in Poland in 1944. Churchill soon emerges as the weakest of the Big Three, unable to defend the interests of the British Empire in a grand strategy pursued since the reign of Queen Elizabeth. We learn less about the long-term policies of the other two, for example the complex Russian relationship with Poland since the middle of the seventeenth century or the priorities of the policies of the USA as developed from the Monroe Doctrine. Thus, the book remains somewhat short of an analysis that would take full account of geopolitical realities. However, although it contains little archival material, it takes more notice of Russian-language publications than has been customary in writing on the Cold War.</p>
<p>With the end of the Cold War, Russia's boundaries shrank again with the collapse of the Soviet Union to an extent unimaginable at the time of its formation. Some observers have seen this as an opportunity for Russia to discover its true identity free from its official involvement with the other Soviet republics. Others have feared an intensification of internal regimentation and xenophobia, including a new expansionism: will there be a reversion to something like the type established by V.N. Tatishchev in 1730 and Gorchakov in 1864? The historical jury is still out, but some of the old enmities have died down. As Nikolaus Katzer, the new Director of the German Historical Institute in Moscow, pointed out at a conference on ‘War and Society in Transnational and Long Run Perspective’ in July 2010, many questions that could barely be posed in earlier years may now be discussed in a much more detached manner, the Holocaust and other crimes among them. The books under review, all of which make a contribution to our understanding of Russia and war in the twentieth century, underline this with some force.</p>
