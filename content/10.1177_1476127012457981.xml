<abstract>
<p>This article explores the concept of structural embeddedness and proposes a construct, contextual links, which represent coordination mechanisms applied to activities that may embed activities and their underlying resources within their business units. The main argument is that if activities and resources are highly embedded in unit structures, then unit reconfiguration should have an impact on activity reconfiguration, where reconfiguration refers to movement within the firm and retention or deletion from the firm. Specifically, the article argues that if there is a significant structural embeddedness, then removal from the contextual environment within which activities reside will result in their creating less value. Theoretical support is drawn from the dynamic capabilities and organization design literatures. Activity movements are specified as default, linked, or unlinked changes. The article examines, empirically, the simultaneous effects of activity and unit reconfiguration on activity retention to gain insight on structural embeddedness. It contrasts activity-level and unit-level contextual links; whereas the former refers to activities embedded in units, the latter refers to units embedded in the firm. Findings reveal that preserving activity-level contextual links is more influential than preserving unit-level contextual links in determining value creation from activities and their resources.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>This article makes an initial exploration into the concept of ‘structural embeddedness’ as it applies to product market activities (and their underlying resources) within business units. In a recent critique of the organization theory field, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1476127012457981">Greenwood and Miller (2010)</xref> advocate retackling the study of organization design. A fundamental issue in organization design is the choice of what activities and resources are to be managed and administered by which parts of the organization – in essence, what resides where and is managed by whom. The concept of ‘structural embeddedness’ is my reference to the activities and resources that reside within a structural context and have some dependence upon this contextual environment to create value.</p>
<p>Most of the literature studying embeddedness refers to either a context of social networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1476127012457981">Granovetter, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1476127012457981">Dacin et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1476127012457981">McEvily and Marcus, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1476127012457981">Moran, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-1476127012457981">Zukin and DiMaggio, 1990</xref>) or of external surroundings such as environments and institutions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1476127012457981">Peterson, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-1476127012457981">Yiu and Makino, 2002</xref>). References to business unit contexts do exist in classic organization design literature, however most of the discussion is around the grouping of units to constitute the hierarchy – it is not around the grouping of market activities within the units themselves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1476127012457981">Chandler, 1962</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1476127012457981">Galbraith and Kazanjian, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1476127012457981">Mintzberg, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1476127012457981">Nadler and Tushman, 1997</xref>). Thus, there is still a gap in the literature clearly addressing how activities and their underlying resources may be embedded within the physical business unit structures of organizations, and consequently a lack of terminology to address this issue. Further, embeddedness implies some level of dependence or support from that within which something is embedded.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1476127012457981">1</xref></sup> If activities are embedded within business units or business units are embedded within the firm, we may expect some negative ramifications from their dislodgement. Thus, the central research question addressed by this article is whether and how movement of product market activities – with and without the joint movement of their business units – are detrimental to firms’ value creation.</p>
<p>A premise of this study is that firms purposefully choose which activities to pursue and also purposefully design their structures to manage these activities. Structure is the container of market activities, and is compartmentalized into business units (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1476127012457981">Barney, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1476127012457981">Chandler, 1962</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1476127012457981">Mintzberg, 1979</xref>). The general issue of how to organize activities within structure has been addressed by various perspectives within the study of organization design, but there are only a few studies (namely in the dynamic capabilities literature) that have explored the reconfiguration of <italic>activities</italic>, as well as their reconfiguration <italic>in conjunction with</italic> changes in business units. The dynamic capabilities perspective focuses on how firms in turbulent markets need to be able to adapt frequently and quickly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1476127012457981">Amit and Shoemaker, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1476127012457981">Eisenhardt and Martin, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1476127012457981">Teece et al., 1997</xref>). Several studies present a ‘recombinant view of organizations’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1476127012457981">Galunic and Eisenhardt, 1996</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1476127012457981">2001</xref>) and depict firms as actively changing their divisional structures and the market activities that reside within these structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1476127012457981">Brown and Eisenhardt, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1476127012457981">Eisenhardt and Brown, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1476127012457981">Helfat and Eisenhardt, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1476127012457981">Karim, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Most relevant to this article are the studies by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1476127012457981">Galunic and Eisenhardt (1996</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1476127012457981">2001</xref>) who examined the evolution of firms by observing how market activities (which they refer to as ‘charters’) were moved among the divisions of a firm. In their work, divisions were ‘ “chartered” to look after one or more business areas’, and a charter was defined ‘as the businesses (i.e. product and market arenas) in which a division actively participates and for which it is responsible within the corporation’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1476127012457981">1996</xref>: 256). Thus, their use of the terms ‘division’ and ‘charter’ are equivalent to this article’s referral to ‘business unit’ and ‘product market activity’, respectively.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1476127012457981">2</xref></sup> One of the striking contributions made by these studies is highlighting that activities and structures are dynamic, not ‘timeless creations’, as stressed by Galunic and Eisenhardt. They go on to describe, ‘Businesses may be added to divisions, taken away, or switched from one division to another’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1476127012457981">1996</xref>: 256), causing divisional boundaries to expand and shrink over time.</p>
<p>Several studies on organization design and dynamic capabilities have built upon Galunic and Eisenhardt’s work by broadening the types of structural change observed. Whereas the charter papers focused on movement of market activities within the firm resulting in units shrinking or expanding,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1476127012457981">3</xref></sup> other researchers have added observations of units splitting and combining/merging which also may result in activity movements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1476127012457981">Brown and Eisenhardt, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1476127012457981">Eisenhardt and Brown, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1476127012457981">Helfat and Eisenhardt, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1476127012457981">Karim, 2006</xref>). Eisenhardt and Brown label this broader process as ‘patching’ which is defined as the ‘adding, splitting, transferring, exiting, or combining chunks of businesses’ to adapt to market conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1476127012457981">1999</xref>: 73). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1476127012457981">Karim and Mitchell (2004)</xref> highlight that this process may not only be adaptive but may also involve purposeful experimentation and search for new opportunities. Structural ‘reconfiguration’ is defined as the ‘addition of units to the firm, deletion of units from the firm, and recombination of units within the firm’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1476127012457981">Karim, 2006</xref>: 799). Whereas past literature on restructuring mainly examined diversification and the addition or deletion of divisions as firms choose what market activities to enter or exit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1476127012457981">Bowman and Singh, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1476127012457981">Hoskisson and Johnson, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1476127012457981">Porter, 1987</xref>), these studies of patching and reconfiguration focus on more incremental and frequent changes in structure that may or may not involve market entry or exit (i.e. in the case of recombination).</p>
<p>At their core, these papers examine how resources and capabilities that constitute firms’ product market activities may be used effectively to create value. In their examination of why market activities were moved from one division to another, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1476127012457981">Galunic and Eisenhardt (1996)</xref> found that it depended on the life cycle stage of the market activity (a division starting up a new charter, a division growing one charter business and not others, or a division with a mature charter business). They posed that the catalyst for charter loss was driven by firms aligning their business activities with divisions’ resources; in essence a matching process. Recently, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1476127012457981">Helfat and Eisenhardt (2004)</xref> suggested that firms may experience economies of scope through the recombination of modular units as they shift resources from one market activity to another, further highlighting the sharing and alignment of resources at different times. Galunic and Eisenhardt encouraged further study in this area by stating, ‘given the static conception of charters in previous research, there is little conception of how [charter change] processes operate, an important next step for research on diversified corporations to take’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1476127012457981">1996</xref>: 258). In this study, the motivation is to examine the different forms in which activity reconfiguration can be achieved, and to explore the potential associations to value creation.</p>
<p>This study extends the dynamic capabilities and organization design literatures in several ways.</p>
<p>First, the predominant focus of classic organization design has been on the grouping of units in an organization and the linking mechanisms between these units to accomplish firms’ goals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1476127012457981">Chandler, 1962</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1476127012457981">Galbraith and Kazanjian, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1476127012457981">Mintzberg, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1476127012457981">Nadler and Tushman, 1997</xref>). I draw attention to diversified firms that, though may once have assigned one product market per division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1476127012457981">Chandler, 1962</xref>), may now group several market activities into each unit. Because the concept of multiple activities within a unit structure has seldom been studied, there are few constructs to help us identify or even discuss the issues that may be related to such groupings. To place emphasis on this level of analysis, this article proposes a construct, namely ‘contextual links’, which are coordination mechanisms that embed activities and their underlying resources within units. Second, this article expands upon <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1476127012457981">Galunic and Eisenhardt’s (1996</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1476127012457981">2001</xref>) study of charter changes. They examined activity movements which were ‘unlinked’; here I also examine ‘linked’ and ‘default’ activity movements by questioning what happens to the structural unit from which the activity was moved (its ‘unit-of-origin’). Activity movement between existing units is examined, but I also observe movement to new units, to combined units, from split units, and from units that are dissolved. By observing these other forms of structural change, this article bridges their work on charter changes with those of Brown, Eisenhardt, and Karim that focus on unit patching and reconfiguration. Although these papers (along with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1476127012457981">Helfat and Eisenhardt, 2004</xref>) discussed the movement of activities between units, none observed the <italic>simultaneous</italic> movement of activities and units, referred to as ‘dynamic realignment’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1476127012457981">Galunic and Eisenhardt, 1996</xref>: 257).</p>
<p>These movements of activities (with or without their unit contexts) are empirically examined in the medical sector and its major categories: healthcare services, pharmaceuticals, and medical devices (including ophthalmic and dental). The product market activities and business unit evolution of 250 firms ranging across 28 four-digit NAICS segments are traced between 1978 and 1997.</p>
<p>It should be made explicit that this study does not measure embeddedness; instead, the goal of this article is to conceptualize what it means for activities to be embedded in their structure, and to identify some evidence of embeddedness. The hypotheses presented are exploratory for certainly there may be alternative explanations for what is observed, however, support of the hypotheses makes plausible the concept of structural embeddedness. Stated differently, for the logic of structural embeddedness to be upheld, support for these hypotheses needs to be established as a prerequisite.</p>
<p>The article is organized as follows. It begins with background literature and the development of hypotheses. This is followed by a section on methods and measures, which outlines the data and sample, operationalization of variables, and the methodology of this study. Finally, the article concludes with results and discussion.</p>

<title>Grouping within organizations</title>
<p>My interest in this concept of structural embeddedness stemmed from some fundamental questions about organizations: Why are particular activities and resources placed in certain parts of the organization, why and how is this ever changed, and what are the ramifications? Scholars in organization design have been tackling these broad questions for the past five decades. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1476127012457981">Mintzberg (1979)</xref> categorized design into four areas: the design of positions, superstructures, lateral linkages, and decision-making. Of particular relevance to this article is the design of superstructures, which he described as the design parameters of unit grouping and unit size. Unit grouping is based upon skill, knowledge, work process, business function, product, service client, or place – these can be broadly divided by function (‘by the means the organization uses to produce its products or services’) or by market (‘by ends, by the characteristics of the ultimate markets the organization serves’) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1476127012457981">Mintzberg, 1979</xref>: 325). Unit size ‘deals with the number of positions, or subunits, that are grouped into a single unit. The literature suggests that the greater the reliance on standardization for coordination (whether by work process output, or skill), the larger the size of the unit’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1476127012457981">Mintzberg, 1979</xref>: 325). Mintzberg highlights that design is proactive and purposeful: ‘Organizational structuring, of course, focuses on the division of labor of an organizational mission into a number of distinct tasks, and then the coordination of all of these tasks to accomplish that mission in a united way’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1476127012457981">1979</xref>: 324).</p>
<p>Like Mintzberg, other design scholars stress that achieving organizational goals or accomplishing a stated mission requires coordination (sometimes referred to as integration) within the organization. There is general consensus around the issue of what needs to be coordinated across several perspectives related to design including systems and modularity theories, as well as contingency theory. Basically, as elements are more interdependent or coupled – versus independent, decoupled, or differentiated – there is a greater need for coordination or integration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1476127012457981">Alexander, 1964</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1476127012457981">Baldwin and Clark, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1476127012457981">Galbraith, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1476127012457981">Lawrence and Lorsch, 1967</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1476127012457981">Sanchez and Mahoney, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1476127012457981">Schilling, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1476127012457981">Simon, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1476127012457981">Thompson, 1967</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-1476127012457981">Weick, 1976</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1476127012457981">Mintzberg (1979)</xref> states four criteria for grouping positions and units, including interdependencies in work flow, in work process, of scale, and in social relationships. Nadler and Tushman refer to coordinating work as ‘strategic linking’, where ‘the basis for linking decisions is rooted in the concept of <italic>task interdependence</italic>’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1476127012457981">1997</xref>: 91; italics in original), and the purpose of linkages is to provide the necessary flow of information that affects the work flow.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1476127012457981">
<title>Contextual links as coordination mechanisms</title>
<p>So what are these mechanisms that organizations create to facilitate coordination? In configuration theory, Mintzberg proposes that each of five commonly found configurations (one of which is the divisional form) strongly favors one of five mechanisms of coordination, which include mutual adjustment, direct supervision, standardization of work processes, standardization of outputs, and standardization of skills. In general, design scholars highlight several mechanisms that coordinate unit structures within the firm. What Mintzberg refers to as the ‘design of lateral linkages’ (which includes planning and control systems, and liaison devices), is what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1476127012457981">Galbraith and Kazanjian (1986)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1476127012457981">Galbraith (2010)</xref> refer to as ‘integrating mechanisms’ that include parts of the planning and budgeting process (such as allocating resources, measuring performance, and selecting and developing managers) and may involve overlapping functional and product divisions in matrix forms. Similarly, Nadler and Tushman propose that organizations achieve ‘structural linking’ via formal hierarchy, liaison roles, cross-unit groups, integrator roles, and matrix structures. These are top-down designs to manage accountability and information flow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1476127012457981">Galbraith, 1973</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1476127012457981">1977</xref>). Beyond larger cross-functional teams and project management systems, ‘smaller-scale coordination and control systems include liaison roles, committees, formal and informal rules, job descriptions, statements or procedures, codes of ethics, employee or customer survey systems, statistical sampling systems, and generally accepted “ways of doing things” in the organization’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1476127012457981">Burton et al., 2006</xref>: 159).</p>
<p>These coordination mechanisms that have been examined by classic organization design refer to formal linking mechanisms that ‘deal with work flows between distinct yet interdependent units’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1476127012457981">Nadler and Tushman, 1997</xref>: 92). These units were primarily responsible for a product market as firms began to diversify (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1476127012457981">Chandler, 1962</xref>). For example, Mintzberg’s configuration of the divisional form which typically coordinates by the standardization of outputs is based upon output for a market (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1476127012457981">Mintzberg, 1979</xref>). When employed effectively, these mechanisms can give diversified firms a ‘parenting advantage’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1476127012457981">Campbell et al., 1995</xref>) through the common application across units of mechanisms such as financial discipline, sourcing of inputs, and IT infrastructure, to name a few. These ‘lateral linkages’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1476127012457981">Mintzberg, 1979</xref>), or coordination mechanisms that link units to the parent organization, are what I refer to in this article as ‘<italic>unit-level contextual links</italic>’. Later I explore to what extent these units with their ‘unit-level contextual links’ may be significantly embedded in the <italic>firm</italic>.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1476127012457981">
<title>Establishing different levels of ‘contextual links’</title>
<p>This distinction – that these links are at the contextual level of the <italic>unit</italic> (which may be one of many within the firm) – is particularly relevant now because we have diversified firms that have groupings of <italic>several</italic> product markets within <italic>each</italic> unit; this is an area of study within organization design that is still fairly new. Thus, I draw an analogy from coordination mechanisms that deal with work flows between units within the firm to coordination mechanisms that deal with work flows between product market activities within a business unit. These latter coordination mechanisms are at the contextual level of the market <italic>activity</italic> (which may be one of several within a unit); I refer to these as ‘<italic>activity-level contextual links</italic>’ and examine to what extent these activities may be embedded in their <italic>unit</italic> structures.</p>
<p>So what may be these coordination mechanisms at the level of activities within units? I draw parallels from units within firms but propose that these activity-level contextual links that coordinate work flow must be more specific to the particulars of the work that is involved in each product market. Though originally written with regard to units within firms, Nadler and Tushman mention several processes and systems that are applicative to the level of market activity. For example, they ‘use the term “processes” to describe sequences of collaborative efforts by groups and individuals, at <italic>various</italic> org’l levels and frequently across structural boundaries, performed in the pursuit of a common objective’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1476127012457981">Nadler and Tushman, 1997</xref>: 104; my italics). Mintzberg also highlights that ‘grouping is a fundamental means to coordinate work in the organization’ and can have four important effects: to establish a system of common supervision, to share common resources, to create common measures of performance, and to encourage ‘mutual adjustment’ (which is the sharing of common facilities that, in turn, encourages frequent, informal communication) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1476127012457981">1979</xref>: 106). He discusses that positions are grouped into units based on knowledge, skills, work processes, timing, output, client, and place (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1476127012457981">Mintzberg, 1979</xref>). These are all characteristics that can be applied more granularly to how activities may be grouped and coordinated within a unit. For example, activities may be grouped in units based on whether they are product or service markets, regulated, localized (geographically), dependent upon similar inputs and suppliers, upstream or downstream in their respective value chains, and more. Such activities that are grouped together could benefit from communication of shared information, collaborations across markets, and common supervision to extract these synergies. Thus, whereas firm-specific coordination mechanisms are applied to all units within the firm, I expect there to be unit-specific coordination mechanisms that are applied to the particular composition or grouping of activities within each unit.</p>

<title>Structural embeddedness and why context matters</title>
<p>As organizations use coordination mechanisms and processes repeatedly they become routinized to an extent to accomplish goals effectively and consistently. Nelson and Winter state that ‘the capabilities of a firm are <italic>embedded</italic> in its organizational structure’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1476127012457981">1982</xref>: 37; my italics). This routinization of activity is what constitutes the organization’s memory, or the ‘storage of the organization’s specific operation knowledge’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1476127012457981">Nelson and Winter, 1982</xref>: 99).</p>
<p>Due to this relevance of memory stored within structure – what I refer to as ‘<italic>structural embeddedness</italic>’ through the use of coordination mechanisms (i.e. contextual links) – simply moving activities and resources to a unit does not necessarily imply that they will be effectively deployed. This is reiterated by Nelson and Winter: ‘an organization does not become capable of an actual productive performance merely by acquiring all the “ingredients,” even if it also has the “recipe.” What is central to a productive organizational performance is <italic>coordination</italic>. . . . This is another way of arguing that “blueprints” are only a small part of what needs to be in an organizational memory in order that production proceed effectively’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1476127012457981">1982</xref>: 104; my italics). Thus, the coordination mechanisms that contextually link a market activity to its unit may be very important. Further, organizational knowledge is comprised of the knowledge of its members, ‘but the knowledge stored in human memories is meaningful and effective only in some <italic>context</italic>,’ and ‘the context of the information possessed by an individual member is established by the information possessed by all other members’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1476127012457981">Nelson and Winter, 1982</xref>: 105; my italics). This implies that dislodging the tasks for a particular product market activity from one set of members to another may result in losing the organizational knowledge that once supported effectively carrying out this activity, as this may disrupt the coordination or ‘<italic>linking</italic> of those individual memories by shared experiences in the past, experiences that have established the extremely detailed and specific communication system that underlies routine performance’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1476127012457981">Nelson and Winter, 1982</xref>: 105; my italics).</p>
<p>What <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1476127012457981">Nelson and Winter (1982)</xref> highlight is the value of preserving the links or coordination mechanisms that embed organizational knowledge within a context. Both literature on knowledge transfer and firm scope have examined how this contextual embeddedness within business units may have consequences for coordination and knowledge management. In a study of new product development at a large firm, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1476127012457981">Hansen (1999)</xref> shows that the relationship between strength of inter-unit ties and project completion time is moderated by the complexity of the knowledge being transferred, where complexity is comprised of both level of tacitness and level of dependence on other components. He finds that as the knowledge to be transferred is more complex and has greater dependence on components from a division, the firm needs to have strong ties between units to effectively transfer that knowledge. In essence, the complexity of the knowledge is embedded in the division (in its work and people) with whom the ties are established. Related to this, Szulanski highlights the impediments to knowledge transfer within firms as due to its ‘stickiness,’ and refers to the tacit components of best practices as being ‘embedded partly in individual skills and partly in collaborative social arrangements’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1476127012457981">1996</xref>: 28). These tacit components are not easily separable from the individuals nor their social interactions, thus making the people and their interactions within divisions an integral part of (i.e. supporting) how the practices are achieved. Scholars have also examined coordination as it applies the knowledge-based view (KBV) and its comparison with transaction cost economics (TCE) to explain boundary choices of firms. Both rely on asset-specificity arguments to explain internalization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1476127012457981">Poppo and Zenger, 1995</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1476127012457981">1998</xref>), and basically argue for when firm-level embeddedness is valuable enough for firms to make versus buy. A distinction is made, however, in the causal mechanisms behind each perspective – whereas TCE predicts market failure due to opportunism and hold-up as the mechanism driving activities internally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-1476127012457981">Williamson, 1983</xref>), KBV predicts increased internal efficiencies due to better coordination from firm-specificity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1476127012457981">Grant, 1996</xref>). This internal coordination is better achieved due to the embedded nature of firm-specific routines and language within the firm – something that does not exist in transactions outside of the firm.</p>
<p>This idea of preserving the coordination mechanisms linked to activities becomes particularly relevant as we observe that product market activities and their underlying resources are not static but can be reconfigured within organizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1476127012457981">Galunic and Eisenhardt, 1996</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1476127012457981">2001</xref>). Mintzberg highlights: ‘In fact, organizational design is much less common than organizational <italic>redesign</italic> – incremental shifts from existing structures’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1476127012457981">1979</xref>: 105; my italics). In the hypotheses section below, I argue for how the context surrounding market activities may be more or less preserved as they do or don’t move within the organization. The basic arguments below are that preserving the coordination mechanisms will make the market activity create more value for the firm, as these ‘coordination systems support flexibility and adaptiveness within and across departmental or divisional boundaries’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1476127012457981">Burton et al., 2006</xref>: 159).</p>

<title>Market activities embedded within the context of business units</title>
<p>Firms manipulate resources and activities within the organization, and also choose what to retain or remove from the organization. For those activities remaining within the firm, executives choose where to appropriate responsibility for these activities. Structure is the container for activities (and their underlying routines) and changes in structure inevitably change the allocation of activities within the firm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1476127012457981">Barney, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1476127012457981">Galunic and Eisenhardt, 1996</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1476127012457981">2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1476127012457981">Nelson and Winter, 1982</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1476127012457981">Figure 1</xref>, business activities may be realigned either independent of or dependent upon unit structural change.</p>

<p>Different market activity movement effects on structure<sup>a</sup></p>
<p><sup>a</sup> This study builds on the concepts first examined by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1476127012457981">Galunic and Eisenhardt (1996)</xref>. Their use of ‘divisions’ and ‘charters’ are synonymous with this article’s use of ‘business units’ and ‘market activities’.</p>
<p><sup>b</sup> At Time 2, there are two possibilities for moving Activity C into Unit 1. In the top example, Unit 2 keeps its structural boundary though it has shrunk since Activity C has moved to Unit 1. This is an example of an unlinked activity movement (or an unlinked ‘charter change’ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1476127012457981">Galunic and Eisenhardt, 1996</xref>]). In the bottom example, Unit 2 has been recombined with Unit 1, taking with it Activity C (imagine Activity D has been divested or moved elsewhere) and no longer having its structural boundary. This exemplifies a linked activity movement in conjunction with unit movement.</p>

<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1476127012457981">Figure 1</xref> depicts that market activity movement (e.g. Activity C moving from Unit 2 to Unit 1) may occur either by moving an activity from Unit 2 to Unit 1 while keeping Unit 2’s boundary intact (i.e. Unit 2 has experienced an activity loss) or through recombination of Units 2 and 1 where Unit 2 is merged into Unit 1 (i.e. Unit 2 no longer maintains its boundary as a separate unit but its structural context and activities now exist within the boundaries of Unit 1). The first example (Option 1) is referred to in this article as an ‘unlinked’ activity movement and the latter (Option 2) as a ‘linked’ activity movement. Firms may employ both forms of activity reconfiguration. For example, while reconfiguring in late 2010, LG Electronics, Inc. pursued an unlinked activity movement when it pulled its digital storage market activities out of its Home Entertainment unit, and pursued linked activity movements when it moved the entire Business Solutions unit (with responsibility for monitors and solutions) into the Home Entertainment unit. Thus, linked and unlinked movements are both ways in which firms may realign market activities and their underlying resources.</p>
<p>The charter changes examined by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1476127012457981">Galunic and Eisenhardt (1996</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1476127012457981">2001</xref>), in which an activity is moved within the firm by moving it out of one unit and into another while still keeping the boundaries of the two units intact, are what I specify as an ‘unlinked’ activity movement. This type of movement preserves the basic structure (i.e. the identification of units) of the organization. In this scenario the activity is unlinked without its original unit context, and the responsibility and resources for it are removed from one unit and placed into another. As the activity is new to the destination unit, new routines and coordination mechanisms may need to be created in order to accomplish the market activity. An alternative arrangement (e.g. Option 2 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1476127012457981">Figure 1</xref>) is to keep an activity associated with or ‘linked’ to its structural context and to move an entire unit (with all of its routines, processes, and other linking mechanisms that are associated with its activities and resources) into another unit. In this second scenario, although the original unit (e.g. Unit 2) has relinquished its boundary and changed the basic structure of the firm, the routines that were originally associated with the activity are still intact and <italic>linked contextually</italic> within the boundary of the destination unit (e.g. Unit 1). The destination unit has now expanded due to the movement and combination of several units and their activities.</p>
<p>Studies have yet to investigate to what extent market activities may be embedded within business unit structures and little theory has been developed to address this concept.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1476127012457981">4</xref></sup> There are several empirical papers studying acquisition integration that refer implicitly to structural embeddedness of knowledge and address the importance of structural context. In a survey-based empirical analysis of the characteristics of knowledge and its effects on R&amp;D units’ organization within multinational firms, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1476127012457981">Birkinshaw et al. (2002)</xref> refer to ‘system embeddedness’ as the extent to which knowledge is a function of the system or context in which it is embedded. They later operationalize this embeddedness of knowledge as a combination of physical location and social context, and find that greater system embeddedness is associated with greater unit autonomy and less integration between units (where integration refers to the interactions of personnel across unit boundaries). When examining inventors’ innovative productivity after their pharmaceutical firms were acquired, Paruchuri et al. refer to ‘knowledge creation as an embedded, path-dependent process’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1476127012457981">2006</xref>: 547) and expect (and find) that target integration with the new parent firm will result in disruption and less innovative output. This notion of integration causing disruption within the targets’ operations resonates with several other acquisition integration studies. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1476127012457981">Pablo’s (1994)</xref> experimental design of decision-making in integration scenarios expects that targets will maintain some level of structural differentiation if it is important to preserve some context-specific organizational capabilities. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1476127012457981">Ranft and Lord (2002)</xref> interviewed managers who expressed concerns about how changes in a target’s organizational context (with respect to its autonomy) may damage its knowledge-based capabilities. Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1476127012457981">Schweizer (2005)</xref>, in his study of biotechnology firms acquired by pharmaceutical firms, discusses how capabilities were context-specific and could not simply be integrated or transferred from target to acquirer, thus requiring the creation of hybrid organizations as a compromise between integration and autonomy, their purpose ‘as not to endanger the future existence of the desired capabilities’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1476127012457981">2005</xref>: 1055). These papers express the idea of knowledge and capabilities being heavily embedded within a structure, where examples include R&amp;D units or entire target organizations. The studies allude to the potentially disruptive element of trying to integrate or transfer activities that may be somehow linked to or supported by their context.</p>
<p>Earlier, I referred to these ties as ‘<italic>activity-level contextual links</italic>’ – which are the coordination mechanisms at the level of a market <italic>activity</italic> (which may be one of several within a unit) – that bind the activity further to its structural unit. These mechanisms include such things as a market-specific common language, knowledge about the value chain, regulatory processes, information on market rivals, and more, that may further embed the activity (and its underlying resources) within its unit structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1476127012457981">Levitt and March, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1476127012457981">Nelson and Winter, 1982</xref>). The strength of these activity-level contextual links may be thought of as ‘activity embeddedness’ within unit structure.</p>
<p>Although most studies have stressed the benefits of embeddedness to preserve knowledge and facilitate coordination, it is worth noting potential drawbacks to embeddedness. Routines and processes that embed knowledge within structure may become old and outdated as inertia sets in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1476127012457981">Hannan and Freeman, 1984</xref>), or higher-level routines that are supposed to update lower-level routines may become less adaptive or responsive if seldom used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1476127012457981">Nelson and Winter, 1982</xref>). These circumstances may warrant purposefully dislodging activities to establish new links and coordination mechanisms. In essence, the unlinked charter changes examined by Galunic and Eisenhardt are examples of such detachment. Other examples also include some of the cases of patching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1476127012457981">Eisenhardt and Brown, 1999</xref>) and reconfiguration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1476127012457981">Karim and Mitchell, 2004</xref>) that were observed in prior studies as firms adapted to dynamic environments.</p>
<p>These varied arguments raise the question of how common is it for activities to be moved within the firm without their contextual links (i.e. how common are unlinked activity movements)? More generally, how common are activity movements without unit reconfiguration (i.e. without changing the basic structure of the firm)? Are these two processes of dynamic alignment independent or <italic>inter</italic>dependent? Ultimately, how do they affect the value created from these activities?</p>
<p>I address these questions iteratively. First recall the two scenarios presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1476127012457981">Figure 1</xref>. Both forms of activity movement have certain positive and negative characteristics as firms are trying to align resources to create value. In the case of an unlinked activity movement (Option 1), where activity movement is independent of unit movement, there may be time efficiencies in the reallocation of responsibilities but this may not translate into overall effectiveness if this requires the time-intensive creation of new routines and coordination mechanisms. In the alternative case of linked activity movements with intertwined activity and unit movement, it may take significant time to integrate several units together, however the independent activities of each unit could continue unabated since their associated contextual links remain within the boundaries of the new destination. Due to the potential disruption in organizational memory and coordination from moving an activity out of its unit context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1476127012457981">Nelson and Winter, 1982</xref>), I expect to observe that firms are more likely to choose the second scenario than the first. Also, if unlinked activity movements are more disruptive than linked activity movements, I expect the latter to more effectively create value for the firm. Thus, the firm is likely to experience more linked activity movements than unlinked activity movements:</p>
<p><bold>HYPOTHESIS 1a:</bold> Activity movements within the firm are more likely to be linked (moving with their business units) than unlinked (moving independent of their business units).</p>
<p><bold>HYPOTHESIS 1b:</bold> Of those market activities that are moved within the firm, there will be greater value creation from those activities that remain linked versus unlinked.</p>
<p>It is important to note that not all disruptions are bad. In fact, if we assume that executives are rational in their decision-making (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1476127012457981">Simon, 1996</xref>), then firms that pursue unlinked activity movements – like the example of LG Electronics, Inc. mentioned above – are being proactive about their designs in this manner because they think it will be value creating. In that particular case, freeing the digital storage activity from the rest of home entertainment may give the new unit a fresh start in establishing new protocols for faster growth, and they may be unencumbered by prior coordinative mechanisms that had existed at the entertainment unit. Certainly, independence can sometimes be beneficial. However, a common disruption associated with unlinked activity movements is the loss of personnel. For example, Boston Scientific Corp. in 2010 – when moving its heart-rhythm business from its earlier acquisition of Guidant Corp in with its stent business – eliminated 1300 jobs. Though this may help the firm with short-term cost-cutting, as Nelson and Winter highlighted, losing individuals and their knowledge can hurt the organizational memory and effectiveness of past routines and processes.</p>
<p>The hypothesis of unlinked activity movements being disruptive can be further generalized. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1476127012457981">Figure 2</xref> depicts all possible scenarios for activity movements (or lack of movement) within the firm boundary. Along with the unlinked activity movement examples of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1476127012457981">Galunic and Eisenhardt (1996</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1476127012457981">2001</xref>), recall that <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1476127012457981">Figure 1</xref> added the distinction of linked activity movements. These scenarios are again depicted in Quadrant 4 of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1476127012457981">Figure 2</xref>, and both are examples in which the <italic>context</italic> of the unit that originally had responsibility for the activity (labeled the ‘unit-of-origin’) is still maintained within the firm. In the linked case, Unit 2’s context remains within Unit 1 although its boundary no longer exists within the firm. In the unlinked case, Unit 2’s context remains within its own boundary since its identity still remains intact within the firm. If unlinked activity movements are more disruptive than linked activity movements, then by continuing this logic I expect that linked activity movements may be more disruptive than no activity movements. In other words, if activities are embedded in units, I expect that keeping the status quo (see Quadrant 1 of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1476127012457981">Figure 2</xref>) and not disrupting the activity-level contextual links or changing the basic structure of the firm may create more value:</p>

<p><bold>HYPOTHESIS 2:</bold> There will be greater value creation from activities that are not moved than activities that are moved within the firm.</p>
<p>Another scenario in which activity embeddedness within their units-of-origin may be particularly relevant is in the case of acquisitions. It is common for acquisitions to be followed immediately by partial divestitures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1476127012457981">Capron et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1476127012457981">Karim and Mitchell, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1476127012457981">Porter, 1987</xref>). Thus, it is a common practice among acquirers to, after purchase, move a charter from the target to another existing unit and divest (or liquidate) what is left of the target unit. Quadrant 3 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1476127012457981">Figure 2</xref> depicts this scenario and is labeled as a ‘default’ activity movement; when the unit-of-origin (e.g. Unit 2) is divested by the firm but the activity (e.g. Activity C) is maintained by the firm, the firm has no choice but to move that activity to another unit. If activities and their underlying resources are embedded within structure, then this scenario will involve the greatest disruption of the market activities and result in value loss. Not only are the activity-level contextual links no longer preserved, but the unit-of-origin is not even present in the organization from which to learn about the coordination mechanisms that had been associated once with this market activity. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1476127012457981">Figure 2</xref> also depicts in Quadrant 2 what is referred to as a ‘default removal’ of a charter if the entire unit-of-origin (with all of its activities) is divested or dissolved by the firm. Both Quadrant 2 and 3 depict cases in which the unit-of-origin is nowhere within the firm. Compared to cases where the unit-of-origin context still resides within the firm, I expect cases where this context is removed to affect value creation from the market activity.</p>
<p><bold>HYPOTHESIS 3:</bold> There will be greater value creation from market activities whose units-of-origin reside somewhere within the firm than those that do not reside anywhere in the firm.</p>

<title>Activity origin and the strength of activity-level contextual links</title>
<p>Thus far, I’ve proposed that if activities and their resources are embedded in structure, then activity movements may be disruptive to firms in their ability to create value. The first comparisons were made between unlinked and linked activity movements, and then between activity movements and no activity movements. These hypotheses placed importance on what was happening to the charter in relation to its unit-of-origin.</p>
<p>Market activities are conceived either through internal development or acquisition, so their units-of-origin are either internally developed units or acquired units. These activities have different characteristics and often provide different services to the firm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1476127012457981">Capron and Mitchell, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1476127012457981">Karim, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1476127012457981">Penrose, 1959</xref>). Compared to internally developed activities and units, firms face significant impediments when trying to create value from acquisitions, namely learning constraints and integration problems.</p>
<p>Both evolutionary and knowledge-based theories of the firm lend support to the hypothesis that it is more difficult to learn and create value from that which is less familiar than from that which is more familiar. Familiarity is fostered by time and some degree of path dependence. There is usually a significant duration of time that is involved with internal development of activities and their underlying routines and resources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1476127012457981">Dierickx and Cool, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1476127012457981">Singh and Montgomery, 1987</xref>). Internal development enables establishing systemic interdependencies among resources and increasing the specificity of resources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1476127012457981">Dierickx and Cool, 1989</xref>). Greater familiarity with the potential uses of these internal resources should increase their value to the firm. The time invested in internal activities also leads to further exercise of internal routines, creating firms’ norms, procedures, and culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1476127012457981">Levitt and March, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1476127012457981">Nelson and Winter, 1982</xref>). Although acquired activities also have associated routines and coordination mechanisms within their unit structures, firms may not be able to fully utilize them post-acquisition as they are new to their destination units and require some initial learning and integration within those units.</p>
<p>The learning process is also challenging as it exhibits path dependence; new learning depends in part on what the firm has learned in the past (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1476127012457981">Karim and Mitchell, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1476127012457981">Lyles, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1476127012457981">Teece et al., 1997</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1476127012457981">Grant (1996)</xref> proposes that resource development is better supported by internal development (than acquisitions) as it provides a more stable platform for the integration of knowledge into firms’ contexts and knowledge-bases. This integration of knowledge is what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-1476127012457981">Von Hippel (1988)</xref> refers to as the internal ‘know-how’ that allows firms to operate smoothly and effectively.</p>
<p>If activities are embedded within unit structures, the acquisition of activities is likely more disruptive than internal development of activities since the acquired unit-of-origin is new to the firm. Based on the time invested in creating market activities in-house, I expect that firms’ familiarity with these activities will lead to greater value creation than from acquired activities that face having new parents and a new business unit context:</p>
<p><bold>HYPOTHESIS 4:</bold> There will be greater value creation from internally developed market activities than acquired market activities.</p>
<p>These hypotheses are a first attempt at empirically exploring the concept of structural embeddedness. Although activity-level contextual links (i.e. the coordination mechanisms linking activities to their units) are not directly measured in this article, the logic for the existence of such links and the concept of activity embeddedness are plausible if these hypotheses are supported. Stated differently, although these hypotheses do not directly confirm the existence or strength of contextual links, their support is indication that these ties may exist and provide some evidence for the embedded nature of activities within structure.</p>

<title>Data and sample</title>
<p>The study uses data from several editions of the <italic>Medical &amp; Healthcare Marketplace Guide</italic>, published in 1975, 1978, 1983, 1986, 1989, and each year thereafter.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1476127012457981">5</xref></sup> The guides include information concerning US and non-US firms operating in the US medical sector, which can be further categorized into several industries: healthcare services, pharmaceutical drugs (both prescription and over-the-counter), and medical instruments (including ophthalmic, dental, and other medical devices).</p>
<p>The Guide states information on each firm regarding the business units possessed each year and the product market activities (out of a possible 258 listed in the Guides) that each unit is involved in. Business units are defined by the Guides as units identified by the firms as having responsibility for some product market activity within the medical sector, thus non-medical sector units are not listed. At the firm level, the Guide describes the history of the firm and any major changes or achievements. The unit-level descriptions also include each unit’s history, its products or services and whether they were internally developed or acquired, the origin of the unit, top personnel, number of employees, address, and more. Information regarding the divestiture, dissolution, or movement of a unit is available at the firm-level description. There is also general information for the entire organization such as revenue, nationality, and date of incorporation.</p>
<p>For each product market activity, I note its origin type (as internally developed or acquired), how long it was retained by the firm, whether it was moved between units, and what happened to the activity’s unit-of-origin that had prior responsibility for it. For each unit, I observe its origin type (as internally developed, acquired, or some mixture), the product market activities it is responsible for, how it evolves over the study period (if it is moved, split, or recombined with any other units), and whether it is retained within the organization (either with its own boundary or its recombination into another unit) or removed (i.e. divested or dissolved) completely from the organization.</p>
<p>The study sample consists of 250 firms that exist in the 1978 panel, beginning at the alphabet and ranging from letters starting with A, B, or C.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1476127012457981">6</xref></sup> The evolution of these firms is traced from 1978 to 1997, with snapshots across six panels in 1978, 1983, 1986, 1989, 1993, and 1997, resulting in a total of 3764 product market observations. The sample of 250 firms was reduced to 184 firms after removing outlier firms with less than US$500k in medical sales. For each product market activity of a firm, I observed whether its unit-of-origin was retained from the last panel to the present (from ‘t–1’ to ‘t’) and whether the activity was moved from the past to the present (from ‘t–1’ to ‘t’), and subsequent retention of the activity in the next panel (at ‘t+1). Thus, over the course of the six panels, there can be at most four observations per activity per firm since the sample consists of only those product markets that existed in 1983, 1986, 1989, and 1993 such that their characteristics could be noted from the prior panel and their subsequent retention could be noted in the next panel. Thus, ultimately, after removing activities from the 1978 and 1997 panels, the remaining final sample is of 1576 observations of product market activities for 157 firms. Of these 1576 observations, about half are internally developed activities with the remainder as acquired activities. The final sample includes product market activities of 28 segments (based on four-digit NAICS codes).

<title>Variables and methodology</title>
<sec id="section13-1476127012457981">
<title>Dependent and independent variables</title>
<p>Hypothesis 1a compares all activity movements within firms and notes how many move independently of unit movement versus how many move in conjunction with unit movement. Hypothesis 1b compares the retention of linked and unlinked activity movements. Both are evaluated using descriptive statistics and <italic>t</italic>-tests.</p>
<p>For Hypotheses 2, 3, and 4 the dependent variable is an activity’s value creation which is operationalized as whether a product market activity is retained by the next panel period by the <italic>firm</italic>; this is a binary variable labeled ‘<italic>PM activity retained by firm(t+1)</italic>’. Assuming that executives are rational (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1476127012457981">Simon, 1996</xref>), they should eventually divest or dissolve a product market activity if it is not adding value to the organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1476127012457981">Porter, 1987</xref>). This line of reasoning is very common in acquisition and diversification literatures that detail how acquisitions are evaluated in order to determine whether to retain or divest them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1476127012457981">Bergh, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1476127012457981">Capron et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1476127012457981">Hoskisson et al., 1994</xref>). This is also indicated in the market for firms as we witness that firms often reject acquisition bid offers until they reach a certain valuation at which point an agreement is reached; this implies that the seller has made some evaluation of what it thinks the asset is worth before agreeing to sell it, and has also decided to no longer keep the asset. Further, the use of retention (or lack of retention) as a proxy for success or value creation is common in acquisition studies. In his study of how CEO turnover affects the divestiture of recently acquired divisions, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-1476127012457981">Weisbach (1995)</xref> presented the divestitures as shedding of divisions that were not creating value for the firm and were bad prior decisions. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1476127012457981">Bergh (2001)</xref> examined the effect of retaining top executives from the acquired company on the successful acquisition implementation, where success was measured as retention of the acquired firm five years after acquisition. When examining the effect of acquisition experience on international acquisition success, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1476127012457981">Nadolska and Barkema (2007)</xref> also operationalize success as whether or not the acquisition was retained. Thus, if an acquisition (be it an asset, product market activity, or business division) is not creating value or deemed a success for the firm then I expect it will not be retained by its respective firm.</p>
<p>Regarding independent variables, Hypothesis 2 predicts that activities experiencing no movement (i.e. the status quo) are more likely to be retained than ones that move; this is operationalized in the dummy variable ‘<italic>no PM activity movement within firm(t)</italic>’. Hypothesis 3 predicts that market activities are more likely to be retained if their units-of-origin are retained. The independent variable, ‘<italic>PM’s unit-of-origin retained by firm(t)</italic>’, is a dummy variable coded 1 if the unit originally responsible for the market activity was retained somewhere within the firm (either keeping its own boundary or its context within another unit) and 0 if the unit-of-origin was divested or dissolved. Hypothesis 4 makes the distinction between acquired and internally developed product market activities; the variable ‘<italic>PM origin type(t)</italic>’ is 0 if internally developed and 1 if acquired.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-1476127012457981">
<title>Control variables</title>
<p>There are several time, industry, firm, and activity-level controls included in the study that may influence retention of market activities. To control for the context of external market conditions at the industry level, I controlled for the number of rivals in each product market activity as given by the Guides in each panel year, as ‘<italic>log number rivals in PM(t)</italic>’. Further, to account for the growth and turbulence in these markets, I drew from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1476127012457981">Dess and Beard’s (1984)</xref> commonly used operationalization of industry ‘munificence’ (i.e. growth) and ‘dynamism’ (i.e. turbulence) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1476127012457981">Sharfman and Dean, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-1476127012457981">Wholey and Brittain, 1989</xref>). Although Dess and Beard originally used census data and created aggregate measures using sales, margin, value added, and total employment, recent scholars have predominantly used sales data since study periods do not match exactly with census data. This operationalization was also used in other empirical studies examining restructuring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1476127012457981">Bergh, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1476127012457981">Keats and Hitt, 1988</xref>). To calculate munificence and dynamism, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1476127012457981">Dess and Beard (1984)</xref> regressed a variable (e.g. industry sales) against time (over the past five years) to determine the slope of the relationship in the equation below:</p>

</disp-formula>
</p>
<p>Munificence represents growth in industries and is calculated using Equation 1; it is equal to the time <italic>coefficient</italic> estimate (<italic>β</italic>
<sub>1</sub>) divided by the variable’s mean value. Using the same equation, dynamism (i.e. industry turbulence) is the <italic>standard error</italic> of the time coefficient (<italic>β</italic>
<sub>1</sub>) divided by the variable’s mean value. Using sales data from Compustat for the 28 segments (based on four-digit NAICS codes) in my sample, the calculations for munificence and dynamism are included for each product market as ‘<italic>industry munificence for PM(t)</italic>’ and ‘<italic>industry dynamism for PM(t)</italic>’.</p>
<p>Firm-level characteristics that are controlled for include ‘<italic>log firm medical sales(t)</italic>’, ‘<italic>firm percent medical sales(t)</italic>’ (to evaluate firms that are diversified outside of the medical sector), ‘<italic>log firm age(t)</italic>’, and ‘<italic>firm percent profit margin(t)</italic>’. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1476127012457981">Mintzberg (1979)</xref> mentions the importance of contingency factors such as age and size in their influence on organization design. I expect that older, larger, and more profitable firms may have more slack resources that support market activity retention, whereas unrelated diversified firms may not as they are allocating resources across multiple sectors. At the activity level, I control for the product market’s industry category (e.g. pharmaceutical, healthcare services, ophthalmic, dental, medical devices) within which each market activity belongs (with comparison being made to the omitted ‘<italic>Category: medical devices</italic>’).</p>
<p>For testing Hypotheses 2, 3, and 4, I later control for several alternative explanations of retention. First, based on escalation of commitment arguments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1476127012457981">Staw, 1981</xref>), a firm may continue to retain a product market activity that has been at the firm for a longer period of time; thus, there is a control for an activity’s age (or longevity) within the firm with ‘<italic>log PM age(t)</italic>’. Second, based on similar logic, I control for ‘<italic>PM level of establishment(t)</italic>’, which refers to how pervasive a product market activity is within the organization and is the count of the number of units responsible for this activity at time ‘t’ within the firm. Third, ‘<italic>firm level of total PM activity(t)</italic>’ signifies how many product markets the firm is actively involved in at time ‘t’; similar to the arguments about diversified firms, it is expected that as the firm’s number of market activities increase, the likelihood of retention decreases as there are eventual limits to a firm’s resources. Finally, the models include time controls in the form of panel <italic>year dummies</italic>, excluding that of 1983.</p>
<p>Finally, in the analysis portion of this article an additional control, ‘<italic>unit-of-origin A or AA</italic>’, will be used to explore the concept of unit-level contextual links and compare them to activity-level contextual links. Similar to ‘<italic>PM origin type(t)</italic>’, this variable describes the origin type for the unit-of-origin. It is a dummy variable that is set if the unit-of-origin was an acquisition or a recombined mix of acquisitions. Activities originating from acquired units (i.e. acquired units or combinations of acquired units) are expected to be less likely retained than those originating from internally developed units (or some recombined mix with these units) due to the lack of familiarity with targets’ routines and coordination processes.</p>

<sec id="section15-1476127012457981">
<title>Methodology</title>
<p>Hypothesis 1a – predicting that more resource movement occurs in conjunction with unit movement than independently of it – expects a certain event to occur more often than another event (for each firm). These predictions involving only two categories can be tested using paired <italic>t</italic>-tests that compare the difference between two groups of cases for each subject (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1476127012457981">Pedhazur and Schmelkin, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1476127012457981">Pindyck and Rubinfeld, 1981</xref>). Because this hypothesis explores whether certain types of activity movement occur more often than others and is not predicting a causal effect, a regression model is not appropriate. Hypothesis 1b, which predicts retention of linked activity movements to be greater than retention of unlinked activity movements, is also examined using descriptive statistics and <italic>t</italic>-test comparisons.</p>
<p>Hypotheses 2, 3, and 4 predict that certain market activity characteristics will affect the likelihood of its being retained. These hypotheses involve a binary dependent variable (i.e. retention) and an appropriate tool for empirical analysis using a logistic regression model for panel data (‘xtlogit’ in STATA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1476127012457981">Greene, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1476127012457981">Menard, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1476127012457981">Pindyck and Rubinfeld, 1981</xref>). Further, as the retention arguments are based on the changing conditions and characteristics of each firm and firms each enter the sample with unobserved heterogeneous characteristics, it is appropriate to use a fixed-effects model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-1476127012457981">Wooldridge, 1999</xref>). Lastly, to minimize issues of endogeneity, the independent variables are lagged as predictors (at time ‘t’) of the dependent variable (at time ‘t+1’) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1476127012457981">Judge et al., 1988</xref>).</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>To get a better sense of the data, let us first glance at the correlation matrix (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1476127012457981">Table 2</xref>) which shows no significantly high correlations that could bias the estimates. The highest correlation of future retention is with unit-of-origin being retained at 0.55, providing initial support for Hypothesis 3. Also, the matrix reveals that older firms are highly correlated with those firms that are larger (by sales) (correlation = 0.52) and juggling many PM activities (correlation = 0.48), and the latter two characteristics are also highly correlated (correlation = 0.67).</p>

<title>Linked and unlinked activity movements</title>
<p>A starting point for exploring the concept of structural embeddedness is to compare the proclivity of activity movements within the firm that occur simultaneously with unit reconfiguration versus independently of it. If activities are heavily embedded within unit structures, I expect that firms will seldom choose independent movements. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1476127012457981">Figure 4</xref> depicts that over the study period, 850 activity movements within firms (322 additions into units and 528 removals from units) were observed in conjunction with some form of unit reconfiguration within the firm, and only 149 activity movements (72 additions into units and 77 removals from units) were observed independent of unit reorganization. A paired <italic>t</italic>-test comparing these events for each firm finds the difference to be significant (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .001), providing support for Hypothesis 1a.</p>

<p>Looking now only at the cases of activities being added into units, there were 322 cases of linked activity movements and 72 cases of unlinked activity movements. Of the 322 linked movements, 266 (82.6%) of these activities were retained by the firm. Of the 72 unlinked movements, 52 (72.2%) of these activities were retained by the firm. Finding that the retention rate is higher for linked versus unlinked activity movements provides some support for market activities being embedded within structure; the difference in retention rates (when controlling for the number of movements), however, is not statistically significant and thus, there is only weak support for Hypothesis 1b.</p>

<title>Market activity movement versus no movement</title>
<p>Recall that the concept of market activities being embedded within their unit structures is based on the strength of activity-level contextual links; these were defined as coordination mechanisms that are applied to the market activity within the context of its business unit. Hypothesis 2 expects that market activities that experience no movement within the firm, and consequently no disruption of their underlying routines and processes (Quadrant 1 of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1476127012457981">Figure 2</xref>), are more likely to be retained than those that experience an activity movement (linked or unlinked) (Quadrant 4 of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1476127012457981">Figure 2</xref>). <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1476127012457981">Table 3</xref> reports the results of the activity retention analysis. The full sample of 1576 product market observations was reduced to 1000 observations for 45 firms due to STATA requiring a minimum of two observations per firm as well as several firms having all positive outcomes. Model 1 includes only the industry, firm-level (excluding firm profit margin), and product market controls. Model 2 adds the independent variable, namely ‘<italic>no PM activity movement within firm(t)</italic>’. Models 3–5 iteratively add remaining variables to rule out alternative explanations, namely PM age, PM establishment, and the firm’s total PM activity. Model 6 adds the firm control of its percent profit margin – due to missing data in the Guides this reduces the sample and observations to 859 observations over 33 firms. Finally, in Model 7, I test the subsample of only the internally developed product market activities to remove any bias from unobserved heterogeneity associated with acquired activities; of the 885 observations of internally developed market activities across the four panel years, 371 observations of 29 firms remain in the analysis. All models were significant.</p>

<p>The results in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1476127012457981">Table 3</xref> support Hypothesis 2. Activities that experience no movement are more likely retained than those that experience a movement to another unit (an activity movement). As linked activity movements are defined to be activities with their contextual links preserved, and were found to be somewhat more retained (above) than their unlinked counterparts, a comparison can be made that activities that are not moved (and found to be more likely retained) may have even stronger preservation of their coordination mechanisms. The positive result of greater retention in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1476127012457981">Table 3</xref> supports the logic underlying the concept of structural embeddedness.</p>
<p>Several of the control variables are also significant. As expected, when firms have greater medical sales, they are more likely to retain their product market activities. Pharmaceutical and healthcare service activities are more likely to be retained than medical device activities, whereas dental devices are not. This may be due to the high R&amp;D investments that are made in pharmaceutical businesses and the valuable tacit knowledge that resides in service operations. The longer a product market activity’s longevity in its firm, and the further established it is within the firm across several units, the more likely it is to be retained – supporting escalation of commitment arguments. Finally, as the firm is operating in more market activities, the less likely the activity is to be retained; this is what we would expect based on firms having resource limitations.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section19-1476127012457981">
<title>Impact of removing an activity’s unit-of-origin</title>
<p>If we consider no activity movement (Quadrant 1 of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1476127012457981">Figure 2</xref>) to be a stronger case of contextual link preservation than the case of linked activity movements (Option 2, Quadrant 4 of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1476127012457981">Figure 2</xref>), then we can also consider unlinked activity movements (Option 1, Quadrant 4 of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1476127012457981">Figure 2</xref>) as having greater access to their contextual links than the case of activities that have their unit-of-origin completely removed from the organization (Quadrants 2 and 3 of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1476127012457981">Figure 2</xref>). At least in the case of an unlinked activity movement the unit-of-origin still resides within the firm and there is still the possibility to learn about the coordination mechanisms that were once associated with this activity. When an activity’s unit-of-origin is removed and there are none of its contextual links remaining within the firm (a default activity movement), I expect it to be less likely retained (Hypothesis 3).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1476127012457981">Table 4</xref> reports the results of the activity retention analysis. Models 8–13 are ordered similarly to the sequence in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1476127012457981">Table 3</xref>; the only main difference here is that the independent variable included in the models is ‘<italic>PM’s unit-of-origin retained by firm(t)</italic>’.

<p>The results in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1476127012457981">Table 4</xref> provide strong support for Hypothesis 3. If the unit that was originally responsible for a product market activity was retained by the firm, then this increases the likelihood that the activity (regardless of whether it was moved or not) will be retained to the next panel year. This is only tautological for the ‘default removal’ case depicted in Quadrant 2 of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1476127012457981">Figure 2</xref>, when a firm chooses to not salvage any market activities and decides to discard an entire unit along with all the activities that reside within that unit. There is also the case of Quadrant 3 that is the ‘default activity movement’ and the results indicate that these activities are less likely retained than the cases (including unlinked activity movements) where the unit-of-origin context is kept within the firm (either in its own boundary or having been integrated into another unit).</p>
<p>Of the controls, as a firm has greater medical sales it is more likely to retain a product market activity. Healthcare service activities continue to have a greater likelihood of retention. Although activity longevity within the firm does not remain statistically significant, its establishment level continues to positively affect retention, and the firm’s total activity levels continue to negatively affect retention.</p>
<p>Finally, Model 14 of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-1476127012457981">Table 5</xref> includes both characteristics of a PM activity that could potentially indicate some level of activity embeddedness – whether the activity experienced no movement within the firm and whether its unit-of-origin was retained somewhere within the firm. Interestingly, the analysis reveals that what is driving PM activity retention is not so much whether the activity was moved (linked or unlinked), but whether the unit-of-origin was retained.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1476127012457981">7</xref></sup></p>

<title>Origins of activities and strength of contextual links</title>
<p>Earlier arguments for evidence of embeddedness included examples in which the contextual links or coordination mechanisms were preserved by the firm or easily accessible. If we apply this idea to activities that were internally developed versus acquired, then I expect retention to be greater for internally developed activities than for those acquired due to the familiarity with contextual links formed around internal activities. Of the 1274 unique product market activities in the full sample, 815 were internally developed, 443 were acquired, and 16 were joint ventures. On average, retention was 81% for internally developed activities and 56% for acquired activities. These descriptive statistics provide initial support for Hypothesis 4 that predicts that internally developed activities are more likely to be retained than those that are acquired.</p>
<p>For a more accurate test, I add this independent variable to the earlier models from <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1476127012457981">Table 4</xref> to analyze the effect of activity ‘origin type’ on likelihood of retention. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-1476127012457981">Table 5</xref> reports the models’ results of the activity retention analysis. In Model 15 the independent variable is a dummy for market activity origin type (‘<italic>PM origin type</italic>’, where acquired activities are coded as 1). Model 16 adds the prior relevant independent variable ‘<italic>PM’s unit-of-origin retained by firm(t)</italic>’, and Model 17 adds the control ‘<italic>unit-of-origin A or AA</italic>’.</p>
<p>The results in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-1476127012457981">Table 5</xref> for Models 15–16 do <italic>not</italic> support Hypothesis 4. Recall that ‘<italic>PM origin type</italic>’ is referring to how the activity came to be established within the organization as either acquired (1) or internally developed (0), whereas ‘<italic>unit-of-origin retained(t)</italic>’ is referring to whether the unit-of-origin’s context and links <italic>exist</italic> anywhere within the organization. Strikingly, an activity’s origin type is not a significant factor affecting its retention when controlling for unit-of-origin retention. This indicates that with regards to activity retention, the existence of contextual links (within the firm) is more influential than the familiarity (and source) of those links. Stated differently, what is relevant to value creation is not how the activity came to be (i.e. whether a product market activity is acquired or not), but how the activity is organized (i.e. whether the coordination mechanisms associated with that activity are retained by the organization).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section21-1476127012457981">
<title>Exploring unit-level contextual links within the context of the firm</title>
<p>The study of activity origin type inferred, based on past studies, that firms are more familiar with the activity-level contextual links underlying internally developed activities than acquired activities. Other than the test of Hypothesis 4 which revealed that there is a superseding influence of having accessible the unit-of-origin context, the descriptive statistics still highlight that acquired activities are retained less often than internally developed ones. This provides some support for the concept of activity embeddedness and that preservation of contextual links provides value to the firm as indicated by activity retention.</p>
<p>Just as activities may be embedded within their business unit contexts, an analogous comparison may be made of business units being embedded within their firm contexts. The greater the impact of a firm’s coordination mechanisms on the value creation by a unit, the greater its ‘<italic>unit embeddedness</italic>’. If activity origin type has an influence on retention and indicates possible evidence of activity-level contextual links, then unit origin type may also provide evidence of <italic>unit-level</italic> contextual links if unit origin has an impact on unit retention. Similar to what is inferred about activities, I expect that familiarity with unit-level contextual links (i.e. the coordination mechanisms employed by the firm across all of its units) is weaker for acquired units than internally developed units due to the time invested in the latter. In an earlier study of business unit reconfiguration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1476127012457981">Karim, 2006</xref>), I found that acquired units were in fact retained for a shorter duration than internally developed units. In that paper, the hazard of ‘not being retained’ diminished over time for acquired units; the finding supports the idea that these targets’ unit-level contextual links are either eventually better understood by the new parent organization or better understood because the routines and processes of the parent firm eventually permeate and integrate the acquired unit further into the firm’s context.</p>
<p>To test the joint influence of both activity-level and unit-level contextual links on activity retention, Model 17 of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-1476127012457981">Table 5</xref> includes the additional variable ‘<italic>unit-of-origin A or AA</italic>’, which represents the origin type of an activity’s <italic>unit</italic>-of-origin. If the <italic>unit</italic> that is responsible for an activity (regardless of whether this activity was internally developed by this unit post-acquisition or if this activity was acquired as part of this unit) was an acquisition or a recombination of several targets (i.e. an ‘A or AA’ unit), then the parent firm will likely have less familiarity with the unit-level contextual links between this unit and the firm versus those units-of-origin that are internally developed. Interestingly, Model 17 reveals that this added control is insignificant, implying that activity-level contextual links (binding activities to their unit context) may be more influential than unit-level contextual links (binding units to the firm context) when it comes to creating value from activities.</p>

<title>Discussion and conclusion</title>
<p>The goal of this study was to explore the concept of structural embeddedness – the extent to which the contextual environment (with its coordination mechanisms, routines, and processes) affects value creation from a market activity. Because the detailed study of multiple market activities within business units is still relatively new in the field of organization design, one motivation for this article was to define constructs that made the distinction between (multiple) activities within the context of their units versus (multiple) units within the context of their firms. Another goal was to question why and how this context may matter. Drawing on classic organizational design literature, I discussed how coordination mechanisms that have been examined by scholars and applied to the firm with respect to its units may also be applied to a business unit with respect to its market activities. Finally, to explore whether the retention of activities’ contextual environments (with their contextual links) is impactful to value creation, I empirically examined how changes in the structural context around the activities impact the future retention of the activity. I argue that finding significant impact is some indication of structural embeddedness.</p>
<p>Changes in the structural context around activities were examined from several dimensions. The article explores the concept of activity-level contextual links by studying the retention of activities that experienced linked versus unlinked movements, that were moved versus not moved, that kept versus lost their unit-of-origin context, and that were internally developed versus acquired.</p>
<p>Overall, most of the hypotheses in this study are supported, providing some evidence for the concept of significant structural embeddedness of market activities within business units. First, the study’s sample shows that activity reconfiguration usually occurs simultaneously with business unit reconfiguration rather than independently of it. This finding is aligned with the expectation that activities become embedded within their unit context and develop activity-level contextual links as coordination mechanisms are developed to bring these market activities to fruition. It is less common for activities to be moved between units (while both the units maintain their boundaries) and, instead, it is more often the case that activities are moved by recombining units. It should be acknowledged, however, that the movement of activities independently of any unit movement does still occur, as observed by the sample of 149 unlinked activity movements in this study and the examples of unlinked activity movements discussed in earlier papers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1476127012457981">Galunic and Eisenhardt, 1996</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1476127012457981">2001</xref>). The tradeoff between preserving and destroying activity-level contextual links may be driven by necessity; the dynamic capabilities perspective supports independent activity movements for those businesses in turbulent markets where speedy change is required. I find that there is a slightly higher percentage of retention for those activities experiencing linked versus unlinked movements, but the difference is not statistically significant.</p>
<p>Second, market activities facing no movements (i.e. the status quo) are more likely retained than those experiencing either linked or unlinked activity movements. This supports the idea that the activity-level contextual links may be better preserved when there is no disruption of movement, thus leading to greater value creation and retention. Third, most disruptive to the firm are cases where the original unit responsible for an activity is no longer maintained in any manner within the firm; it has been divested or dissolved. Results show that these activities are least likely to be retained by the firm, supporting the idea that the firm no longer has the unit-of-origin from which to learn about the underlying routines and processes that were once associated with an activity. When jointly observing the effects of lack of activity movement and retention of unit-of-origin, the study reveals that what is impacting activity retention is the latter, not the former. This implies that having access or being informed about the coordination mechanisms necessary for effective activity management (i.e. <italic>how</italic> the activity was reconfigured) may be more relevant than <italic>whether</italic> the activity was reconfigured. This has some strong implications for how knowledge is managed within organizations. If we consider one instrument of knowledge to be key personnel, the organization may still effectively reap the knowledge from this individual if he or she is moved within the organization as long as the individual is retained somewhere within the firm such that he or she can still be accessed. Recall that prior work has shown that knowledge may be embedded both in individuals and in their social arrangements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1476127012457981">Hansen, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1476127012457981">Szulanski, 1996</xref>). If we make the analogy of comparing these social arrangements to the coordination mechanisms linking activities to units, then the findings here imply that the preservation of the social arrangement somewhere within the firm (even if it is moved within) may be what is more influential in creating value from the knowledge than whether or not an individual was moved within the firm. This implication would advocate keeping teams that work well together and have strong social ties intact as they are moved or reapplied within the firm.</p>
<p>Fourth, whereas Hypotheses 1, 2, and 3 focused on the existence of activity-level contextual links, Hypothesis 4 studied the potential familiarity with these contextual links. I find that acquired activities are less likely to be retained than internally developed activities. This supports the idea that lack of preserving contextual links (in the case of acquisitions) may lead to less value creation. When comparing the effects of activity origin type and the removal of an activity’s unit-of-origin, the study reveals that having or not having contextual links (i.e. the unit-of-origin’s context is either somewhere within the firm or it is not) is far more influential than the degree of familiarity with those links (as internally developed or acquired). This has significant implications to acquisition research as many acquisitions are broken up – some activities or assets may be retained while others are not; ultimately some parts are usually shut down or divested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1476127012457981">Porter, 1987</xref>). Based on the findings here, I question whether some acquisitions that have been deemed failures could have been value creating if they had been reconfigured in such a way as to retain activity-level contextual links within the firm – even while other pieces of the acquisition were divested. Thus, what is relevant is not whether an activity or asset was acquired or internally developed so much as what was done with its original context.</p>
<p>Finally, this study explores the analogous concept of unit-level contextual links that are coordination mechanisms employed by the firm across all of its business units. In an earlier paper (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1476127012457981">Karim, 2006</xref>), I found that internally developed units are retained for a longer duration than acquired units, supporting this study’s logic of expecting stronger unit embeddedness <italic>within the firm</italic> for internally developed units. Adding this information about the origin type of an activity’s unit-of-origin reveals that activity-level contextual links (that bind an activity to its unit context) are more influential than unit-level contextual links (that bind a unit to its firm context) in determining activity retention. There may be several interpretations of this finding. Recall that the firm-specific coordination mechanisms applied by a firm across all of its units – its unit-level contextual links or what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1476127012457981">Mintzberg (1979)</xref> referred to as ‘lateral linkages’ – must be more generic by definition and applicative across many diversified units. Activity-level contextual links, on the other hand, are more specific to the nuances of the markets within each unit – that which links them together to have been grouped in the first place. These coordination mechanisms will likely differ from unit to unit within a firm, based on the activities within each unit. In this regard, I expect the <italic>design</italic> of business <italic>units</italic> to be more diversified as their groupings of market activities are more distinct. Because the firm-specific coordination mechanisms are more generic, it may be that their dissemination across units is more successful (regardless of whether they are applied to internally developed units or to acquired units) than a firm trying to reinvent unit-specific activity-level contextual links once the unit-of-origin is removed (again, regardless of whether the activity was internally developed or acquired). A counter-argument may be that though lateral linkages may be generic, they may still be quite sophisticated – take for example the logistical operations of Wal-Mart. However, though they may be sophisticated, the repeated application of these coordination mechanisms across all business units (both internally developed ones and acquired ones) likely makes the firm improve upon this process over time – similar to the diffusion of best practices throughout an organization. In contrast, there may be limited carry-over of activity-level contextual links that can be applied across units. Thus, the implications of the above finding suggest that firms should value the specifics of units’ coordination mechanisms as applied to their market activities – these may not be as readily reproduced as firms’ lateral linkages.</p>
<p>The main implication of this study is that when referring to organizations that are reconfiguring their activities, scholars and practitioners should acknowledge the unit structures within which these activities reside. From a dynamic capabilities perspective, as firms alter their divisional responsibilities and move activities from one unit to another, managers should consider whether they will reap their optimal value without the coordination mechanisms that were unit-specific for this activity. Based on the findings of this study, I would recommend to executives to move activities in conjunction with unit recombination. As another example, consider firms modularizing their product architectures such that activities may be partitioned into new arrangements. In such instances, firms should consider whether these new arrangements are preserving or destroying contextual links that may be critical for the activity to be effectively deployed. Another consideration may be the lost opportunities from the lack of movement or modularization of internal activities; if activities become too embedded within their unit contexts such that their coordination mechanisms are non-transferable, this, too may have an opportunity cost from lack of flexibility (in the case of modularization) or lost synergies with other activities (in the case of potentially moving the activity to a new destination unit).</p>
<p>This study has several significant limitations and there remains much room for future study. This is a first attempt at approaching the issue of structural embeddedness. Although the article theorizes about coordination mechanisms that are applied to activities to improve their value creation, it does not actually measure these routines or processes that are unit-specific and activity-nuanced. A subsequent study that could capture different contextual links applied at different units within a diversified firm, and then examine activity movement and retention would be ideal. This article assumes that retention indicates some market activity value to firms. Because most cases of activity movement occurred simultaneously with unit movement, it is inferred that this (preservation of activity-level contextual links) is one way in which firms reap that value (i.e. performance) from their businesses. Unfortunately, the data source did not provide financial data at the activity level, nor at the unit level, but did so only at the firm level. Thus, a future study on retention that could control for product market activities’ financial performance would be beneficial for more granular operationalization of value creation. Further, a study of the performance outcomes of activity movements that are independent of or interdependent with unit movement would also reinforce the expectations about value creation. Finally, although the study uses lagged predictors to limit biases from endogeneity, there is always the possibility of reverse causality – that due to its retention an activity could then be reconfigured. Knowing more about the intent behind both activity retention and movements would benefit future studies.</p>
<p>In conclusion, this study of simultaneous activity and unit reconfiguration provides insight into how firms evolve within the constraints of structural boundaries. Hopefully this article contributes to both practitioners’ and scholars’ better understanding of the process by which firms manage market activities and business units, and provides terminology for future dialogue on structural embeddedness.</p>

<p>A review of literature referring to embeddedness reveals several applications and studies, mostly dealing with either social networks or external environments and institutions. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-1476127012457981">Zukin and DiMaggio (1990)</xref> identified four types of embeddedness: structural, cognitive, cultural, and political. In the case of structural embeddedness, they are referring to actors being embedded within a social network. This referral to embeddedness within networks is common in sociology literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1476127012457981">Dacin et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1476127012457981">Granovetter, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1476127012457981">McEvily and Marcus, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1476127012457981">Moran, 2005</xref>). Other applications of ‘embeddedness’ include the study of learning processes and how they are embedded within culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1476127012457981">Barney, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1476127012457981">Karnoe, 1995</xref>) and in power relations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1476127012457981">Contu and Willmott, 2003</xref>). Several studies have alluded to embeddedness within a context; examples include institutional forces being embedded in national environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-1476127012457981">Yiu and Makino, 2002</xref>) and actors’ construction of events being embedded within structural surroundings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1476127012457981">Peterson, 1998</xref>).
