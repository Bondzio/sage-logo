<p><bold>Eating History</bold></p>
<p><italic>By Paula Finn</italic></p>
<p><italic>Finishing Line Press, 2012</italic></p>
<p>This collection of poems percolates with the ever-present past—its offerings and its burdens. <italic>New Labor Forum</italic> editor Paula Finn scrutinizes the residua of colonial occupation carried in the suitcases of immigrants, the imprints of war and terrorism on children’s games, the internal lives of otherwise invisible workers, and the traces of sexual violence borne by girls into womanhood. They are poems in which pain is made bearable partly by its telling and tempered by the abundance of natural beauty they describe.</p>
<p><bold>American Empire: The Rise of a Global Power, the Democratic Revolution at Home, 1945-2000</bold></p>
<p><italic>By Joshua B. Freeman</italic></p>
<p><italic>Viking, 2012</italic></p>
<p>In a history of the post–World War II United States, historian and <italic>New Labor Forum</italic> contributing editor Joshua B. Freeman chronicles a nation’s checkered march to global primacy. From the Marshall Plan to mounting militarization to Morning Again in America, <italic>American Empire</italic> recounts the complexities of foreign and domestic affairs over the last half century.</p>
<p>This fifth and final volume of Penguin’s History of the U.S. series kicks off with the postwar economic surge of the 1940s, which helped usher in an unprecedented era of democracy. It made the United States the world leader in living standards and individual rights. The civil rights and labor movements were pivotal to that process. But, as the new millennium drew closer, a gradual privatization and corporatization of power started to chip away at progressive inroads made in the preceding decades.</p>
<p>As the American empire enters its new century, Freeman asks whether it will live up to its promise or its threat.</p>
<p><bold>Back to Full Employment</bold></p>
<p><italic>By Robert Pollin</italic></p>
<p><italic>MIT Press, 2012</italic></p>
<p>Today, the United States is saddled with its highest unemployment rate since the Great Depression. Economist and <italic>New Labor Forum</italic>columinist Robert Pollin explains why it does not have to be this way.</p>
<p><italic>Back to Full Employment</italic> argues the case for an economic policy that explicitly makes full employment a national priority, notwithstanding the challenges presented by inflation and globalization. When such an objective is pursued in tandem with the clean-energy movement, Pollin maintains that individuals, families, and the greater economy will all win.</p>
<p>What’s stopping us? The prevailing neoliberal agenda.</p>
<p>Pollin taps into macroeconomic theory (from Marx to Keynes to Friedman) to explain why a full-employment agenda was discontinued in the 1970s. He insists that policy can return—once there is a redistribution of political power that places Main Street’s interests before Wall Street’s.</p>
