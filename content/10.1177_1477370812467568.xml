<abstract>
<p>This study aims to examine the association between drug law enforcement and rates of serious violence. A police crackdown on a large and stable cannabis market in Copenhagen disrupted established hierarchies among criminal groups and spurred renewed competition. In the five-year period after the crackdown in 2004 there were more homicides and attempted homicides in Denmark than in any five-year period for the previous 20 years. In the Copenhagen region we found 19 shootings that had a connection to known cannabis sellers or cannabis-selling locations. No such episodes were known prior to the crackdown. We estimate a fixed-effects (within) regression model for all Danish municipalities for the period 2000–9 (<italic>N</italic> = 2110, 269 groups). We find that there has been a significant relationship (<italic>p</italic> = .001) between drug arrests and charges for serious violence the following year, after correcting for demographic and social covariates found to be correlated with violence.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Drug markets are arguably the most violent sector of the illicit economy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1477370812467568">Andreas and Wallman, 2009</xref>). A lack of access to legal resources, the value of the commodities and participants recruited from social strata in which violence is more common make for a volatile combination. It has consistently been found that law enforcement can destabilize drug markets and lead to an increase in violence at national as well as local levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1477370812467568">Kleiman, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1477370812467568">Miron, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1477370812467568">Rasmussen and Benson, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1477370812467568">Shepard and Blackley, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1477370812467568">Werb et al., 2011</xref>). However, our empirical knowledge is limited because most of the existing research concerns the increase in homicides associated with the introduction and proliferation of crack-cocaine in the US in the late 1980s and early 1990s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1477370812467568">Baumer, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1477370812467568">Baumer et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1477370812467568">Inciardi, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1477370812467568">Lattimore et al., 1997</xref>). This focus on a particular drug in a particular social context challenges the theory that violence is an integral part of the ‘systemic’ operations of illicit drug markets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1477370812467568">Goldstein, 1985</xref>), and several researchers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1477370812467568">Blumstein, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1477370812467568">Blumstein et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1477370812467568">Brownstein et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1477370812467568">Golub et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1477370812467568">MacCoun et al., 2003</xref>) have noted how certain aspects of the crack-cocaine market made it prone to violence: low per-dose price and many street-level transactions, distribution by already violent street gangs, the value of the commodities, and a culture of violence in communities characterized by ‘concentrated disadvantage’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1477370812467568">Ousey and Lee, 2002</xref>: 78). Put briefly, many industrialized countries have problems with illicit drugs, but only the USA is known to have problems with excessively violent drug markets. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1477370812467568">Zimring and Hawkins (1997)</xref> therefore suggest that drug markets are not violent in themselves, but rather are a ‘contingent cause’ that requires pre-existing social conditions conducive to violence to be present; that is, the ‘classic’ covariates of violence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1477370812467568">McCall et al., 2008</xref>) known from social disorganization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1477370812467568">Shaw and McKay, 1942</xref>) and strain theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1477370812467568">Merton, 1938</xref>). This would help explain why research into drug market violence is absent in Europe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1477370812467568">Ousey and Lee, 2002</xref>), and maybe also why there are so few reports of violence associated with cannabis distribution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1477370812467568">Reuter, 2009</xref>). Perhaps the generality of the association between drug markets and violence has been overstated?</p>
<p>A series of recent events in Denmark support the notion of violence as a function of the interaction between drug law enforcement and the drug trade. In 2004, Copenhagen’s police cracked down on Denmark’s largest cannabis market in an area known as Christiania, arresting 40 sellers and 35 various runners and look-outs. Cannabis had been sold openly in this area for 30 years and it is commonly perceived to have had an almost monopolistic share of the total market (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1477370812467568">Copenhagen Police, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1477370812467568">Moeller, 2012</xref>). After the crackdown, police maintained a massive presence in the area for almost a year, effectively displacing buyers to other more clandestine markets around Copenhagen. When police left the area, a series of shootings erupted. Some of the shootings were selective and instrumental executions of known cannabis sellers in Christiania; others were spectacularly violent, indiscriminate shootings at groups of people around known cannabis-selling locations in Copenhagen; some incidents appear to be retaliations from prior shootings, and still others have no apparent link to drug markets. In the five-year period after the disruption of the cannabis market in Christiania, the number of homicides and attempted homicides surpassed any five-year period from the previous 20 years in Denmark. The temporal association between the crackdown and the increase in homicides is commonly noted in Danish media (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1477370812467568">Pedersen and Lindstad, 2012</xref>), and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1477370812467568">National Police (2009)</xref> stated that some of the participants in the shootings are known to be part of criminal groups with interests in the cannabis market.</p>
<p>Although there is sufficient research to have demonstrated linkages between drug market destabilization and violence internationally, the conditions under which this reflects a process where increased drug law enforcement leads to increased violence needs further research. Against this background, the events in Denmark provide a good case study. First, an affluent and egalitarian Scandinavian welfare state does not exhibit widespread social problems related to the classic covariates of violence; and, secondly, cannabis markets are very rarely associated with violence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1477370812467568">Reuter, 2009</xref>). We set out to examine the effects of two processes that could plausibly lead to increased violence in a drug market context: disruption of the dominant market and incapacitation of sellers in Copenhagen, and increased deterrence nationally. First, the hypothesis is that disruption of a stable market and incapacitation of dominant local sellers may lead to an increase in local violence. Removing established sellers dismantles existing hierarchies between criminal groups and leads to renewed competition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1477370812467568">Kleiman, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1477370812467568">Storti and Grauwe, 2008</xref>). Increased competition in an illicit market implies that violence may be used opportunistically in order to challenge the previously established hierarchical relations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1477370812467568">Rasmussen and Benson, 1994</xref>). Secondly, an overall increase in deterrence will theoretically increase both the risks and the potential profits from drug-selling and therefore also the incentive to use violence. Under the assumption that demand is inelastic in the short run, sellers will increase price to compensate for the increase in risk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1477370812467568">Becker et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1477370812467568">Kleiman, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1477370812467568">Kuziemko and Levitt, 2004</xref>). In both scenarios, the destabilization and the capacity for and willingness to use violence among criminal groups become a competitive resource.</p>
<p>The next section discusses the existing research on the relationship between law enforcement and violence associated with drug markets and how this relates to cannabis in Denmark. It is followed by a description of the data and empirical model. The final section presents the findings and discusses whether the theory of a temporal connection between drug law enforcement intensity and rates of violence is applicable to the events in Denmark.</p>

<title>Previous research on law enforcement and drug market violence</title>
<p>Law enforcement is the primary exogenous factor that affects drug markets. Many studies have examined the connection between drug law enforcement and various crime rates, but there are only relatively few empirical studies on the specific association between enforcement and violence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1477370812467568">Brumm and Cloninger, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1477370812467568">Friedman, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1477370812467568">MacCoun et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1477370812467568">Miron, 1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1477370812467568">2001</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1477370812467568">Werb et al. (2011</xref>: 2), in a systematic review, identified 14 studies and found that 93 percent of these reported an ‘adverse impact of drug law enforcement on levels of violence’, which led them to conclude that ‘disrupting drug markets can paradoxically increase violence’. The research on drug market violence departs from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1477370812467568">Goldstein’s (1985)</xref> tripartite conceptual framework of ‘psychopharmacological’, ‘economic compulsive’ and ‘systemic’ violence. Systemic violence conceptualizes ‘the traditionally aggressive patterns of interaction within the system of drug distribution and use’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1477370812467568">Goldstein, 1985</xref>: 150). Goldstein and his colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1477370812467568">Brownstein et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1477370812467568">Goldstein et al., 1989</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1477370812467568">1992</xref>) applied this conceptual scheme empirically to homicides in New York and found that drug market participants with no access to the legal system may resort to violence to settle disputes or gain competitive advantage. Further, it has been found that such violent disputes are typically initiated at the higher distribution levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1477370812467568">Coomber and Maher, 2006</xref>); that is, the violence is mostly ‘competitive’ not ‘transactional’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1477370812467568">MacCoun et al., 2003</xref>: 74). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1477370812467568">Reuter (2009)</xref> summed up the research by asserting that violence is constituted by the internal micro-mechanisms of enforcement and competition as well as by internal mobility and discipline in high-level drug markets.</p>
<p>Shepard and Blackley specifically examined the association between increased enforcement of cannabis offences and various crime rates over time in 62 New York counties from 1996 to 2000 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1477370812467568">Shepard and Blackley, 2005</xref>) and 1300 US counties from 1994 to 2001 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1477370812467568">Shepard and Blackley, 2007</xref>), respectively. In the study on 1300 US counties, they found marijuana sales arrests to be positively correlated with increases in homicides, followed by an insignificant decrease. In the study on the New York counties, they found larceny to be the only form of crime that was affected by increased numbers of marijuana arrests. This temporal association between enforcement and ensuing violence can be explained by the characteristics of drug markets. Both sellers and buyers prefer to conduct transactions routinely and stably in a business-like manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1477370812467568">Eck, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1477370812467568">Rasmussen et al., 1993</xref>). In the absence of enforcement, drug markets will move towards an equilibrium state with a dominant supplier. The dominant market actor can offer better prices and more reliable service and thereby continue to reinforce market position (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1477370812467568">Kleiman, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1477370812467568">Moeller, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1477370812467568">Storti and Grauwe, 2008</xref>). This equilibrium constitutes a local hierarchy that determines access to turf and market shares. Stability promotes low levels of violence. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1477370812467568">Rasmussen and Benson (1994)</xref> and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1477370812467568">Benson et al., 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1477370812467568">2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1477370812467568">Rasmussen et al., 1993</xref>) hypothesized that increased drug law enforcement will disrupt established hierarchies at the county level and be associated with increased numbers of homicides. They conceptualized that drug markets that are not actively policed will move towards a ‘spatial equilibrium’, similar to a hierarchy. Other American researchers have noted how access and stability were important factors in the extraordinary violence during the introduction and evolution of the crack-cocaine market. Once the market stabilized, the violence decreased (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1477370812467568">Brownstein and Taylor, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1477370812467568">Brownstein et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1477370812467568">Lattimore et al., 1997</xref>). Competition among suppliers may lead to increased violence.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1477370812467568">Papachristos (2009)</xref> noted how violent conflicts between criminal groups appear to be fuelled by a reciprocation process akin to the establishment of a pecking order among chickens. Retaliation for violence is required in order to prevent future attacks, which he terms the ‘norm of reciprocity’. The result is a network structure of conflict and interaction between disputants that leads to a sustained pattern of retaliations for prior violent incidents, and also generalized violence. When pro-violence norms appear among some drug market participants it can spread temporally and geographically and become ubiquitous; an assertion that is also made by other researchers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1477370812467568">Blumstein, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1477370812467568">Blumstein et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1477370812467568">Cohen et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1477370812467568">Dorn et al., 1992</xref>). In the competition over drug markets, prior events of violence beget future violence.</p>
<p>From the above we assert that the association between levels of drug law enforcement and violence in drug markets is a result of how enforcement affects the structure of the market. Low levels of enforcement allow for a non-violent, profitable, monopolistic structure, referred to as ‘concentrated industry’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1477370812467568">Eck and Gersh, 2000</xref>: 244–5). In such a monopolistic structure the market will be supplied by a few highly organized groups that have an interest in avoiding the use of violence, because overt violence attracts more law enforcement attention than discrete drug-selling. Such a ‘concentrated industry’ structure is unusual in illicit markets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1477370812467568">Reuter, 1983</xref>). Usually the pressure from law enforcement will lead to the creation of more ephemeral enterprises in heavy competition with each other, referred to as a ‘cottage industry’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1477370812467568">Eck and Gersh, 2000</xref>: 244–5). Low levels of competition and a monopolistic structure are possible only in the absence of intensive law enforcement. Increased drug law enforcement is therefore hypothesized to lead to more intensive competition over access to turf, buyers and eventually profits. Violence may be applied as a competitive resource in this competition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1477370812467568">Kleiman, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1477370812467568">Storti and Grauwe, 2008</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1477370812467568" sec-type="methods">
<title>Data and method</title>
<p>Denmark has a population of roughly 5.4 million people and is divided into 270 municipalities. Around 1.9 million people live in the greater Copenhagen area. We use publicly available police and criminal statistics, as well as the Infomedia database, to examine the association between changes in enforcement intensity and rates of violence.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1477370812467568">1</xref></sup> We focus on the period from 2000 to 2009.</p>
<p>In order to analyse the effects of the disruption of the cannabis market in Copenhagen, we first describe the local context and the situational factors that characterize the Christiania market, specifically the monopolistic conditions that were present prior to the crackdown in 2004. Next we examine homicide rates and discuss if some of the excess homicides can be associated with conflicts concerning the cannabis market. We do this with a search in the Infomedia database for the newspaper <italic>Politiken</italic> using a combination of the terms ‘hash’ and shots’ for the period 1 January 2000 to 31 December 2010. The purpose is to count incidents of shootings associated with cannabis markets or known cannabis sellers. The shootings that are documented in the newspaper are directly based on police reports and describe incidents that have not yet led to arrests or gone to court. Any speculation by the journalist as to motives is ignored in our analysis. Only explicit mention in the article of a geographical location known for cannabis sales or of a victim known to the police for being involved in the cannabis market is noted. We perceive this to be a reasonable method for counting shootings because such episodes are very rare in Denmark. The annual homicide rate in Copenhagen is low, even compared with other European capitals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1477370812467568">Stevens and Bewley-Taylor, 2009</xref>). This leads us to believe that all episodes of such overt violence will be documented in the media. We cannot verify this assertion directly but we can demonstrate that the clearance rate for homicides in Denmark oscillated between 91 percent and 100 percent between 2000 and 2008. It fell to 86 percent in 2009. For attempted homicides the clearance rate was 86–93 percent, also falling in 2009 to 75 percent (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.statbank.dk/STRAF22">http://www.statbank.dk/STRAF22</ext-link>). As such, the newspaper articles act as a proxy for police reports of shootings for which no searchable database exists.</p>
<p>Next we examine the proposition that drug law enforcement is associated with rates of violence in a more general way. We apply an economic model of crime specified by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1477370812467568">Levitt (1998)</xref> in an extension of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1477370812467568">Becker’s (1968)</xref> framework where crime rates are seen as a function of economic and demographic conditions, law enforcement, crime opportunities and characteristics of the local crime markets. Specifically, we employ a fixed-effects model similar to that of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1477370812467568">Shepard and Blackley (2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1477370812467568">2007)</xref>. The fixed-effects model is appropriate because we are interested in the variation within each municipality over time. The across-group variation is not used to estimate the regression coefficients. This is the correct method because it reflects how changes in enforcement intensity affect outcomes within each municipality rather than differences in patterns of violence between municipalities. In this way we reduce the unobservable differences – the omitted variable bias – between municipalities and get a better test of the specific effects of drug law enforcement on rates of violence. This is an advantage because detailed time-series data on local drug-use rates and labour market opportunities are not available at the municipal level in Denmark. This control for unobserved confounding factors assumes relatively stable conditions within each municipality over the 10-year period of analysis. <italic>F</italic>-statistics are used to test for the inclusion of the fixed-effects dummy variable and are significant at the .01 level for both models.</p>
<p>We use the number of charges for drug law violations as an indicator of law enforcement intensity, and charges for homicide, attempted homicide and ‘grievous bodily harm’ as indicators of violence. These are the three most serious charges for violence in Danish law. ‘Grievous bodily harm’ covers incidents that typically involve the use of weapons. Inclusion will better capture what we are trying to understand because the numbers for homicides and attempted homicides in the individual municipalities are quite small. Unfortunately, Danish crime statistics do not record drug law violations by type of offence or type of drug, so it is not possible to make a more specific test of the association. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1477370812467568">Figure 1</xref> shows the untransformed distribution of the number of drug charges in a year divided by the number of people in the municipality. We also test if the direction of causality is correct for our theory. We want to know whether violence follows from drug arrests, and not whether acts of violence attract law enforcement attention, which in turn could lead to more drug arrests. What predicts violence and what predicts drug offences?</p>

<p>We set the minimum number of observations in each group at two, which means that a few of the smallest municipalities were excluded from the analysis. In the test of what predicts violence we have 269 groups and 2110 total observations, with an average of 7.8 and a maximum of 9. In the test of what predicts drug offences, we similarly have 269 groups but with 2252 observations and an average of 8.4 and a maximum of 9. We include a one-year lag in both regressions to further ensure that the temporality of events is correct to answer our question: Were levels of drug law enforcement correlated with levels of serious violence the following year at the municipal level in Denmark between 2000 and 2009?</p>
<p>Finally, we control for economic and demographic conditions that have been found to influence homicide rates across time, space and unit of analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1477370812467568">Fajnzylber et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1477370812467568">Land et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1477370812467568">McCall et al., 2008</xref>): resource deprivation, measured as the percentage of people with no education and the percentage of welfare recipients (to measure unemployment), as well as population density, age composition and the percentage of non-Westerners. Resource deprivation and population density are explanations of crime put forward in theories of social disorganization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1477370812467568">Shaw and McKay, 1942</xref>). Denmark is among the least socially stratified countries in the world, with a Gini coefficient of 0.217 in 2008, so we turn to the theory of relative deprivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1477370812467568">Young, 1999</xref>) to explain how welfare recipients and people without education may experience disadvantage and feelings of injustice, similar to the subjectively experienced discontent of anomie (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1477370812467568">Merton, 1938</xref>). These processes are further exacerbated by population density owing to anonymity and opportunities for crime in some geographical areas. Demographically we include the proportion of young people in the individual municipalities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1477370812467568">Kyvsgaard, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1477370812467568">MacCoun et al., 2003</xref>) as well as the percentage of non-Westerners. The inclusion of this variable follows from a series of recent reports that have found this sub-population to have distinct social characteristics and relatively high crime involvement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1477370812467568">Andersen and Tranaes, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1477370812467568">Statistics Denmark, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1477370812467568">Moeller, 2010</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1477370812467568">National Police (2009)</xref> noted that gang formations in the non-Western immigrant communities have contributed to renewed conflicts between criminal groups in Denmark, with the established outlaw biker groups Hells Angels and Bandidos being challenged by a plethora of groups constituted primarily by non-Western immigrants.</p>

<title>Disruption of the dominant cannabis market</title>
<p>Cannabis was sold quite openly in Denmark prior to 2000. This policy dated back to a political decision that law enforcement resources should be focused on ‘hard drugs’ and ‘professional sellers’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1477370812467568">State Attorney, 1969–72</xref>). This cannabis policy option is similar to that in the Netherlands. The difference is that in the Netherlands it was formally decided that retail sales would not be policed at all; in Denmark retail sales have not been actively policed. This allowed for a street-level market in the ‘free town’ of Christiania in Copenhagen to exist and stabilize, largely undeterred by the police. Over time the area became well known for cannabis sales, attracting tourists as well as buyers from other parts of Denmark and Scandinavia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1477370812467568">Moeller, 2009</xref>). Copenhagen’s police (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1477370812467568">Copenhagen Police, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1477370812467568">Dürr, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1477370812467568">Hansen, 2003</xref>) have consistently pointed out that Christiania’s market is primarily controlled by the outlaw biker gang the Hells Angels. In the mid-1990s, a violent conflict erupted between the outlaw biker gangs Bandidos and the Hells Angels that revolved around access to illicit markets in Denmark’s larger cities. A truce was eventually reached where the Hells Angels remained in control of Copenhagen and Christiania (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1477370812467568">Hoeyer, 1999</xref>). Without further interference from competing groups, Christiania achieved an almost monopolistic share of the cannabis market in Copenhagen where upwards of 40 sellers would offer at least six different types of cannabis for sale in a low-risk atmosphere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1477370812467568">Moeller, 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>Beginning around 2000 the lenient policy towards cannabis sales was reversed. Seven amendments to the Penal Code and the Administration of Justice Act provided the legal basis for implementing nine months of video-surveillance and undercover buys that were followed by a crackdown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1477370812467568">Copenhagen Police, 2005</xref>). From the surveillance material it is estimated that around 9900 daily buyers purchased almost 10 tonnes of cannabis in Christiania in 2003 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1477370812467568">Thygesen, 2004</xref>), which is consistent with other estimates of the aggregate amount of cannabis used in Denmark per year (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1477370812467568">Kilmer and Pacula, 2009</xref>). The crackdown was carried out in April 2004 and a massive police presence was maintained in the area for a period of about a year afterwards (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1477370812467568">Hansen, 2003</xref>). This effectively disrupted the primary cannabis distribution point in Denmark and made buyers seek out new sellers in other parts of Copenhagen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1477370812467568">Moeller, 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1477370812467568">2012</xref>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1477370812467568">Figure 2</xref> illustrates this increase in drug law enforcement. For better comparison, cannabis seizures are indexed, with the 2000 value normalized to 100. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1477370812467568">Figure 3</xref> shows how this increased focus on cannabis offences affected the total number of charges for drug offences from 2005, in Copenhagen as well as in the rest of Denmark. It can also be seen that there was not a continuous increase after 2004, but rather a sharp increase followed by a decline, similar to the pattern in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1477370812467568">Figure 2</xref>.</p>

<title>Homicides and shootings</title>

During the same period the number of convictions for grievous bodily harm displayed a downward trend, both nationally and in Copenhagen (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.statbank.dk/STRAF3">http://www.statbank.dk/STRAF3</ext-link>; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.statbank.dk/STRAF33">http://www.statbank.dk/STRAF33</ext-link>).</p>

<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1477370812467568">Figure 4</xref> illustrates that there was no trend towards increased numbers of homicides and attempted homicides prior to 2004. It can also be seen that there were more convictions in Copenhagen in 2005 and 2006 than in previous years, but that it is the dramatic increase at the national level in 2009 that supports our statement in the introduction about a higher number of homicides and attempted homicides than in the previous 20 years. Two peaks stand out in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1477370812467568">Figure 4</xref> that merit explanation. The peak around 1997 is commonly interpreted as resulting from the conflict between the outlaw motorcycle gangs Hells Angels and Bandidos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1477370812467568">Hoeyer, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1477370812467568">National Police, 2009</xref>). As regards developments after 2004, it can be seen that in 2005, 2006 and 2009 the numbers of convictions in Copenhagen were above the usual levels. Although it is not unusual for homicide rates to display ‘oscillatory patterns’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1477370812467568">Blumstein, 1995</xref>: 12), the situational characteristics of some of these homicides support the notion of a violent conflict involving the cannabis market. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1477370812467568">Table 1</xref> summarizes the incidents identified in the Infomedia database search for newspaper articles containing both of the terms ‘hash’ and ‘shots’ for the period 2000–10. A total of 19 episodes involving shots, lethal violence or collective acts of aggression directed at known cannabis-selling locations were found in the media search. Note that no episodes were found prior to 2005. It is interesting that this many incidents have taken place that involve people and locations known to be associated with cannabis sales. Also note that the incidents were geographically limited to the Copenhagen region.</p>

<p>The results in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1477370812467568">Table 2</xref> describe the predictors of violent offences in Danish municipalities for the period 2000–9.

<p>Next we reverse the direction of causality for our hypothesis of an enforcement and violence link and test whether violent offences are associated with drug charges the following year. The results in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1477370812467568">Table 3</xref> describe the predictors of drug offences in Danish municipalities for the period 2000–9. We see that drug offences and population density predict drug offences the following year. This finding can be explained by policing practices – an area known for drug sales will logically attract law enforcement attention. All in all, our model supports the patterns of drug law enforcement and violence that are described in the literature where the disruption of a monopolistic structure and the associated spatial equilibrium and established hierarchy will increase competition for access to turf and customers. With more competition comes an increased potential for conflict and violence.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The temporality, number, characteristics and location of the shooting incidents identified in the media search support the claim by the National Police that criminal groups with interests in the cannabis market increasingly compete over access to the cannabis market. On the one hand, this is surprising because cannabis markets are not known to be violent internationally and Copenhagen has a low per capita homicide rate. On the other hand, the value of the cannabis market makes it a potential source of conflict (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1477370812467568">Harcourt and Ludwig, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1477370812467568">Rasmussen et al., 1993</xref>).</p>
<p>The structure of cannabis distribution in Copenhagen prior to 2004 was unusual in international comparison. Christiania’s open and stable market is commonly perceived as having had a dominant share of the total market, approaching the monopolistic characteristics described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1477370812467568">Storti and Grauwe (2008)</xref>. The disruption of this market in 2004 may therefore have had a very strong destabilizing effect on the total market and, by extension, unsettled the hierarchical balance between criminal groups. During operations carried out prior to the crackdown in 2004, police had found weapons in cannabis-selling locations and warned that a conflict between criminal groups might be impending (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1477370812467568">Hansen, 2003</xref>). With this background it seems plausible that criminal groups in competition with the Hells Angels were attempting to gain access to Christiania’s market even before 2004. The monopolistic structure of the Danish cannabis market prior to 2004 makes it difficult to assess the causality of events. Would the shootings eventually have occurred anyway as part of the ongoing competition between criminal groups or were the crackdown and the unsettling of the hierarchical structure necessary catalysts? The findings from the media search do not provide a definitive answer. It is noteworthy that no incidents of ‘shooting’ and ‘hash’ dating before the crackdown were found.</p>
<p>However, the structure of cannabis markets that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1477370812467568">Storti and Grauwe (2008</xref>; also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1477370812467568">Kleiman, 1989</xref>) describe in terms of monopolistic competition provides a theoretical explanation that is consistent with the indicated temporality of the events. The incapacitation of established sellers and increased drug law enforcement intensity increase competition between criminal groups. In <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1477370812467568">Goldstein’s (1985)</xref> terminology, this can increase the number of incidents of systemic violence because lack of access to the legal system promotes the settling of conflicts through violence. Interestingly, we found support for this association between drug law enforcement and aggravated violence in our regression. Our particular case study may be unique, but the processes that connect enforcement and violence related to the drug market appear to be the same as those identified in the international literature.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>We examined the association between drug law enforcement and violence using two analytic approaches. In the descriptive analysis we found that there was an increase in the number of charges for homicide and attempted homicide in the period after the crackdown on the cannabis market in Christiania in 2004. We found 19 episodes in our media search where serious violent episodes were directly tied to persons known to have been involved in cannabis sales or in geographical proximity to locations known for cannabis sales. This was interpreted as evidence that the disruption of the dominant distribution point and the incapacitation of established sellers spurred increased competition between criminal groups willing to use excessive violence in order to gain access to turf or market shares. However, the unique ‘concentrated industry’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1477370812467568">Eck and Gersh, 2000</xref>) structure of the Danish cannabis market makes it difficult to compare the findings with international examples where a ‘cottage industry’ structure prevails. We therefore took the analysis a step further and examined the effects of increased drug law enforcement on rates of serious violence in a fixed-effects model within all Danish municipalities. In this regression we found a significant association between drug charges and serious violence in the following year across all 269 municipalities for the period 2000–9, with a coefficient of .04 at a significance level of <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01. This fixed-effects method addresses the hypothesis of there being a ‘contingent causation’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1477370812467568">Zimring and Hawkins, 1997</xref>) between drug markets and violence, where such an association has usually been found in social contexts more conducive to violence than an affluent Scandinavian welfare state with low levels of violence.</p>
<p>Cannabis markets in general are not known to be associated with violence internationally. This may, partially at least, be a consequence of the way cannabis is most commonly distributed – indoors and among peers rather than in open street-level markets. Our study indicates that the value of the cannabis market in itself makes it a potential antecedent for criminal groups to use excessive violence in their competition with each other, independent of social contexts. This is not a finding that supports passive policing of street-level cannabis markets in order to avoid violence. The most important implication is for law enforcement to take heed that disrupting a monopolistic drug market structure may involve above-normal rates of serious violence while market shares are contested as new hierarchical relations are established.</p>
