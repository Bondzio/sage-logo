<abstract>
<p>Landfill leachates contain a wide variety of pollutants such as organic matter, refractory compounds, ammonia, particulate and dissolved solids and hazardous metals requiring application of advanced and well designed treatment processes before release to the environment. The main purpose of this research was to evaluate the efficiency of combined air stripping, Fenton oxidation and biological treatment in treating landfill leachate, especially the elimination of ammonia and refractory organics. The laboratory scale set-up consisted of three sequential but separate steps. The optimum conditions for air stripping and the Fenton oxidation were determined for landfill leachate from Karaj city, Iran. The final step was a moving bed bioreactor with HRTs of 18, 12 and 6 h. The highest NH<sub>3</sub>-N removal was 79% in the air stripping process at pH 10.5. At the optimum conditions for the Fenton reaction at a reaction time of 90 min, pH 3 and a H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>/Fe<sup>2+</sup> mass ratio of 20, the COD removal was 61% and improved the BOD/COD ratio from 0.42 to 0.78. The overall COD removal including the final biological reactor with a HRT of 6 h resulted in an effluent COD concentration of less than 100 mg L<sup>−1</sup></p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Final disposal of municipal solid waste in landfills is still the most common method of solid waste management in many parts of the world. An important side effect of this practice is the generation of considerable amounts of leachate as a function of solid waste composition, rainfall, landfill site design and operation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0734242X11433526">Cortez et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0734242X11433526">Li et al., 2010</xref>). The possibility of leachate release to the environment has led to environmental concerns. Landfill leachate is a dark liquid that contains high quantities of refractory organics and heavy metals, requiring the application of a series of physical, chemical and biological treatment processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0734242X11433526">Lim et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0734242X11433526">Morling, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0734242X11433526">Rocha et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0734242X11433526">Xu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0734242X11433526">Zhao et al., 2010</xref>). Therefore, the three processes ammonia stripping, advanced oxidation and biological treatment for removal of ammonia, refractory organics and easily biodegradable organic matter, respectively were examined in the present study. In the authors’ previous research, chemical precipitation for ammonia removal for comparison to air stripping was studied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0734242X11433526">Jaafarzadeh et al., 2010</xref>). Recently, advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) have become an attractive alternative for removal of colour, recalcitrant organics and for improving the biochemical oxygen demand (BOD)/chemical oxygen demand (COD) ratio of landfill leachates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0734242X11433526">Georgi et al., 2007</xref>). The AOP involves the generation of free radicals, mainly the hydroxyl radical via chemical or photochemical reactions between conventional oxidants such as ozone, hydrogen peroxide, UV irradiation, Fenton reaction etc. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0734242X11433526">Renou et al., 2008</xref>). The reaction of Fe<sup>2+</sup> and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> is the Fenton oxidation, which is widely studied for the treatment of landfill leachate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0734242X11433526">Deng and Englehardt, 2006</xref>). In the present study the Fenton oxidation was evaluated with the main purpose of examining the efficiency of a sequence of treatment processes including air stripping, Fenton oxidation and biological treatment for the combined treatment of landfill leachates.</p>

<title>The laboratory-scale treatment reactors</title>
<p>The treatment reactors consisted of three sequencing and separate steps of ammonia stripping, advanced oxidation (AOP) including Fenton reaction and a moving bed biological reactor. The scheme of the treatment reactors is presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0734242X11433526">Figure 1</xref>. A cubic Plexiglas reactor with total volume of 2 L was used for the stripping of ammonia. In this pre-treatment step, the pH range of 8–12 was adjusted with lime and sulfuric acid, with an inlet air flow of 25 L min<sup>−1</sup> during the operation periods of 6–30 h. The Fenton reaction tank with a total volume of 2 L was equipped with a mixer for uniform mixing Fe<sup>2+</sup> and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. The AOP reactor was operated in batch mode during different optimization steps. The H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> concentration of 10 000 mg L<sup>−1</sup>, the pH values of 3 which was adjusted with sulfuric acid, reaction time of 90 min (based on literature review) and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>/Fe<sup>2+</sup> mass ratios of 400, 200, 100, 40, 20, 10, 5 and 2.5 were studied in optimizing the AOP process. The moving bed bio reactor MBBR with a total volume of 4 L made of a Plexiglas cylinder. The MBBR was 40% filled with 2-H media with a specific surface area of 767 m<sup>2</sup> m<sup>−3</sup>, porosity of 93% and made of high density polyethylene. The reactor was aerated and mixed with an aerator pump delivering 22 L<sub>air</sub> min<sup>−1</sup>. The effluent leachate from the AOP was collected in a container and pumped to the MBBR with a dosing pump according to the defined hydraulic retention time. The pH of the effluent from the AOP process was adjusted to neutral range adding Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>. The main purposes of the container tank between the AOP and the MBBR was flow adjustment and ferric sludge precipitation.</p>

<title>Acclimation of activated sludge to leachate</title>
<p>The activated sludge (AS) used in this study was obtained from a return sludge line of a municipal wastewater treatment plant. Sludge was adapted through slow introduction of the leachate to the activated sludge. The procedure was carried out in a 4 L container starting with an initial sludge–leachate mixture of 1.8 to 0.2 L for each (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0734242X11433526">Jaafarzadeh et al., 2010</xref>). The mixture was aerated for 1 day and 0.2 L of supernatant was withdrawn and replaced by 0.2 L of leachate. Thereafter, the procedure was continued with 0.2 L daily withdrawal of supernatant and leachate was fed in increments of 0.2 L at intervals of 5 days. This was continued until the reactor had received 2 L of leachate. The COD removal and pH levels were monitored daily. The acclimatizing period was continued for 11 weeks. The acclimatized sludge was used as inoculums in the MBBR for further studies. The leachate pre-treated with stripping and Fenton reaction was fed to the MBBR at three hydraulic retention times of 18, 12 and 6 h.</p>

<title>Analytical methods</title>
<p>All laboratory determinations were implemented following the <italic>Standard Methods for Examination of Water and Wastewater</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0734242X11433526">APHA, 2005</xref>). Samples were collected from the supernatant and then centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 20 min. The samples for the NH<sub>3</sub>-N and soluble COD were filtered on glass-fibre filters (GF50). A pH meter (Hack) was used to measure the pH. The attached biomass was determined by a gravimetric method: the biofilm mass were determined using 100 media elements that were sampled randomly from the fixed bed bioreactor. The media elements were separated from the wastewater and dried until constant weight in an oven at 103 °C. The dried samples were weighed in order to determine the total mass, composed of media element mass (<italic>M</italic> media) and the attached biomass. The biomass was then washed off, the dry and clean media elements were weighed, and the amount of biofilm solids attached to the 100 media elements was calculated. The amount of biomass in the reactor could then be determined since the total number of carrier elements in the reactor with filling grade of 40% was known (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0734242X11433526">Plattes et al., 2006</xref>).</p>

<title>Ammonia stripping</title>
<p>The results of optimizing the NH<sub>3</sub>-N removal via air stripping are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0734242X11433526">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0734242X11433526">3</xref>. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0734242X11433526">Figure 2</xref> indicates that the removal efficiency of NH<sub>3</sub>-N improved linearly with the pH increase. The effect of pH at constant reaction time of 6 hours shows that the highest removal of 57.4% was obtained at pH 10.5. The main reason is the gaseous ammonia dominating at higher pH, facilitating ammonia stripping.</p>

<p>Increasing the reaction time up to 15 h has a positive effect on the NH<sub>3</sub>-N stripping at the optimum pH 10.5. Longer aeration did not improve removal probably due to the pH-lowering effect of recarbonation (Bonmat and Flotats, 2003). The best removal of 79% was obtained after 15 h. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0734242X11433526">Guo et al (2010)</xref> reported an optimum pH 11 and a reaction time of 15 h at NH<sub>3</sub>-N influent concentrations in the range 1000–1750 mg L<sup>−1</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0734242X11433526">Guo et al., 2010</xref>).</p>

<title>AOP optimization</title>
<p>Many studies show that pH is the most important factor influencing the performance of the Fenton process for mineralization of xenobiotics and for wastewater treatment due to its role in maintaining ferrous ions in soluble form for continuous reaction with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0734242X11433526">Hermosilla et al., 2009</xref>). Many studies have demonstrated pH 3 to be the best operational pH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0734242X11433526">Chu et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0734242X11433526">Silva et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0734242X11433526">Teel et al., 2001</xref>). Therefore, in the present study pH 3 was selected as the optimum for the Fenton treatment of leachate. Although it is often believed that excess amounts of reagents can improve the process efficiency, a high and uncontrolled dosage of iron salt and hydrogen peroxide may be harmful, leading to high dissolved solids, high electrical conductivity of the effluent and an excessive chemical sludge production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0734242X11433526">Grieger et al., 2010</xref>). High concentrations of residual H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> can adversely affect the subsequent biological treatment raising the operational costs, being scavenged and producing gas bubbles which prevent sedimentation of the sludge flocs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0734242X11433526">Hermosilla et al., 2009</xref>). So, it can be concluded that the degradation rate of organics increases as the H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> addition increases until the threshold H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> concentration where further degradation is absent Along this line the dosages of chemical reagents were optimized. Five different mass ratios of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>/Fe were examined at constant COD concentration, pH and reaction time. The constant H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> addition at 10 000 mg L<sup>−1</sup> (added as 30% solution) was studied with additions of 25, 50, 100, 250, 500, 1000, 2000 and 4000 mg L<sup>−1</sup> of Fe<sup>2+</sup>. The results of the Fenton reaction optimization are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0734242X11433526">Figure 4</xref>. The reaction time was a constant 90 min. It should be mentioned that about 675 mg L<sup>−1</sup> of COD was removed during the air stripping. The highest COD removal of 61% was observed with a H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>/Fe<sup>2+</sup> mass ratio of 20, which was in accordance with data obtained by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0734242X11433526">Lopez et al. (2004)</xref>. They achieved a COD removal of 60% for an initial COD concentration of 10 540 mg L<sup>−1</sup> and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>/Fe<sup>2+</sup> mass ratio of 12 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0734242X11433526">Lopez et al., 2004</xref>). Furthermore, Zhang et al. obtained COD removal of 68.2% with a favourable H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>/Fe<sup>2+</sup> molar ratio of 3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0734242X11433526">Zhang et al., 2006</xref>). Increasing the addition of Fe beyond a threshold value does not enhance the process performance significantly.</p>

</fig>
<p>According to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0734242X11433526">Figure 4</xref>, the COD removals did not improve at high H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>/Fe<sup>2+</sup> ratios. Therefore, it was assumed that the addition of iron salt must be in the catalytic range.</p>
<p>The BOD/COD ratio increased from 0.42 to 0.77 after the Fenton reaction. The main reason is partial oxidation of refractory organics and conversion of some slowly degradable organic matter to readily biodegradable organics. One of the AOP functions is rapid partial degradation and a long period of mineralization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0734242X11433526">Lu et al., 2010</xref>]. The H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>/Fe<sup>2+</sup> mass ratio of 20 was determined as the optimum ratio in this study.</p>

<title>Sequencing treatment</title>
<p>The feed stream to the MBBR has passed two pre-treatment steps for removal of ammonia, refractory organics and to some extent removal of COD. The MBBR was operated, initially at a hydraulic retention time of 18 h and constant influent COD of 4000 (± 90) mg L<sup>−1</sup>. The effluent COD concentration in steady state conditions after 44 day of operation was 43 (± 9.4) mg L<sup>−1</sup>. The steady-state conditions were observed after 31 days of operation. The effluent COD concentrations for HRT of 12 h were 83 (± 6.7) mg L<sup>−1</sup> and for HRT of 6 h were 103 (± 2.9) mg L<sup>−1</sup>. The statistical analysis with <italic>P</italic>-value of 0.05 indicates that the difference in effluent COD concentrations at an HRT of 18 h compared to HRTs of 12 and 6 h was significant, but there was no significant difference between HRTs of 12 and 6 h. It was noted that almost all examined HRTs were sufficient in meeting the effluent COD standard of less than 100 mg L<sup>−1</sup> to receiving waters. In the present study the HRT of 6 h was found to be the best operational option, having the advantage of small tank dimensions and/or the possibility of applying high flow rates. The microbial mass was increased when the HRT was decreased, due to higher organic loading and higher organic matter removal by the biomass. The MLSS concentrations in HRTs of 18, 12 and 6 h were 2050, 2340 and 2400 mg L<sup>−1</sup>, respectively. Furthermore, the biofilm mass attached to the 2-H media were 2.8, 3.1 and 3.1 g L<sup>−1</sup> for HRTs of 18, 12, and 6 h, respectively. The summary of operational results at optimum conditions for all processes is shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0734242X11433526">Table 2</xref>.

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>According to the laboratory scale data obtained, it can be concluded that a sequential treatment process including air stripping, Fenton oxidation and a moving bed bioreactor is reliable, practical and efficient in full scale applications for leachate treatment. Proper pilot scale experiments are needed to confirm the findings.</p>
<p>The following experimental data were obtained in this study.</p>
<list id="list1-0734242X11433526" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>The optimum pH of 10.5 based on preliminary experiments for ammonia stripping resulted in an initial 79% NH<sub>3</sub>-N removal.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>At defined conditions including pH 3 and a reaction time 90 min, the best mass ratio of added H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>/Fe<sup>2+</sup> for the intermediate Fenton oxidation was 20, resulting in a COD removal of 61%.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The Fenton oxidation increased the BOD/COD ratio from 0.42 to 0.78.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The final biological treatment was capable of producing an effluent with COD concentrations less than 100 mg L<sup>−1</sup> and removals higher than 95%.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The optimum sequence of processes was ammonia stripping at pH 10.5, followed by the Fenton oxidation at pH 3 and 90 min reaction time and an added H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>/Fe<sup>2+</sup> mass ratio of 20, followed by a final biological treatment with a HRT of 6 h.</p></list-item>
