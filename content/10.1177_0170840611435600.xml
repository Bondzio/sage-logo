<abstract>
<p>Boundaryless career theories are increasingly prominent in career studies and management studies, and provide a new ‘status quo’ concerning modern careers. This paper contextualizes the boundaryless careers literature within management studies, and evaluates its contributions, including broadening concepts of career and focusing interorganizational career phenomena. It acknowledges the considerable stimulus given to career studies by this literature, but also offers a critique based on five issues: inaccurate labelling; loose definitions; overemphasis on personal agency; the normalization of boundaryless careers; and poor empirical support for the claimed dominance of boundaryless careers. Because these problems render the boundaryless career concept increasingly obsolete as a ‘leading edge’ construct in career studies, we offer new directions for theory and research. In particular we re-examine the role of career boundaries, and suggest the development of new, boundary-focused careers scholarship based on boundary theory, to facilitate studies of the processes whereby career boundaries are created, and their effects in constraining, enabling and punctuating careers.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The ongoing relationships between people and their work are nicely captured by the notion of <italic>career</italic>, which uniquely connects individuals with organizations and other social institutions over time. Individual careers are shaped by their organizational milieus, yet intimately involved in the creation, reproduction and transformation of organizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0170840611435600">Higgins, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0170840611435600">Jones &amp; Dunn, 2007</xref>). Organizational restructuring and change, for example, mediate new career boundaries, and change management affects, and is affected by, workers’ career-driven responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0170840611435600">Currie, Tempest &amp; Starkey, 2006</xref>). The notion of career, then, offers a vantage point from which to understand the evolution of relationships between organizational structure and strategy, and individual agency and behaviour.</p>
<p>In this essay we consider the recent rise to prominence of ‘the boundaryless career’. Research on this concept has, we believe, provided fresh insights to organization and management studies, but has also suffered from conceptual vagueness and inconsistency, and sometimes enthusiastic but less-than-rigorous adoption, which have impeded good theory-building. By critically reviewing boundaryless career theory and research, we seek to develop new agendas that offer both revitalization in career studies and new insights for more broadly-based theories and practices of management.</p>
<p>Our paper is framed as follows. We first outline the historical development of career studies within management research and the burgeoning growth of theory and research discussing boundaryless careers. Next, we review boundaryless careers writing, and show that, despite having stimulated valuable new thinking, and contrary to a ‘mainstream’ view in career studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-0170840611435600">Sullivan &amp; Baruch, 2009</xref>), the concept and its elaboration in the literature render it inadequate as a central concept in future theory-building. We suggest new directions for research, particularly the development of boundary-focused career studies. Our paper is novel in integrating previous scattered critiques of boundaryless careers research (for an extended critique see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0170840611435600">Inkson, Ganesh, Roper &amp; Gunz, 2010</xref>), both adding new criticisms, and suggesting a ‘way forward’ through the explicit study of the role of boundaries in careers.</p>

<title>Career Studies and Management Studies</title>
<p>Despite the potential of the career concept to illuminate the functioning of organizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0170840611435600">Hughes, 1937</xref>), career studies was initially dominated by a vocational perspective emphasizing psychological phenomena such as early-career decision making and individual-job fit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0170840611435600">Brown &amp; Associates, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>In the 1970s, seminal books by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0170840611435600">Hall (1976)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-0170840611435600">Schein (1978)</xref> sought to articulate a new career-mediated accommodation between employees and their organizations, emphasizing the dynamic interaction over time between individual identity and company operation enabling the shaping of organizational career systems. A career development perspective would enable managers, particularly through HRM, to create frameworks for organizational careers, thus engaging not just employees’ momentary energies, but their personal resources assembled over a working life. The new career management was however at odds with the vocational view that a career is the property of the individual, who should take self-oriented career decisions, moving if necessary between organizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0170840611435600">Brown &amp; Associates, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>In the 1990s and 2000s, the career management movement was influenced by seismic changes in how organizational studies conceptualized organizations themselves. Scholars recognized the limitations of conceiving of them as containers (of careers), and instead focused on processes of organizing and on understanding organizations as sets of interconnected networks and flows (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0170840611435600">Clegg, Hardy &amp; Nord, 1996</xref>). Increased power was attributed to the agentic individual, who might engage in activities that previously had high transaction costs, thereby decentring the role of organizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0170840611435600">Bimber, Flanagin &amp; Stohl, 2005</xref>). Further, in the practical world of management, assumptions of stable employment arrangements were severely tested by the effects of the neo-liberal political, economic and business projects of the 1980s and 1990s. The new fashions – ‘market forces’, globalization, outsourcing, and organizational restructuring – threatened the comfortable view of careers unfolding upwards in single large and benevolent employment settings. New models of organization demanded new models of career.</p>
<sec id="section3-0170840611435600">
<title>Boundaryless careers</title>
<p>The year 1996 saw the publication of Arthur and Rousseau’s <italic>The Boundaryless Career: A New Employment Principle for a New Economic Era</italic>. In this pivotal book, the authors signaled a major change in career forms, from:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>the bounded, or organizational career … that saw people in orderly employment arrangements achieved through vertical co-ordination in mainly large, stable firms … the dominant employment form through the mid-1980s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0170840611435600">Arthur &amp; Rousseau, 1996</xref>, pp. 3–4)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>to:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>boundaryless careers … the opposite of ‘organizational careers’ – careers conceived to unfold in a single employment setting. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0170840611435600">Arthur &amp; Rousseau, 1996</xref>, p. 4)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p><italic>The Boundaryless Career</italic> challenged the managerially oriented organizational perspective. Boundaryless careers were explained as outcomes of, and advocated as a response to, wider changes in the economic and organizational landscape. The role of individuals as proactive creators of their own careers was emphasized. As if to underscore the point, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0170840611435600">Hall and Associates (1996)</xref> simultaneously published <italic>The Career is Dead – Long Live the Career!</italic> meaning that organizational careers had been replaced by ‘protean’ careers, which were ‘determined by the individual, not the organization’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0170840611435600">Hall &amp; Associates, 1996</xref>, p. xvi).</p>
<p>The boundaryless and protean career concepts have stimulated career research to the extent that they dominate Sullivan and Baruch’s recent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-0170840611435600">2009</xref>) review of the field, so that these concepts, ‘while once considered radical, have become part of a new status quo’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0170840611435600">Briscoe &amp; Hall, 2006</xref>, p. 1) in career studies. And of the two, the boundaryless career has arguably had greater academic impact in terms of published scholarly articles mentioning it (994 according to ProQuest, 2011-11-07, compared with 620 for the protean career).</p>
<p>We believe a critical examination of the boundaryless careers literature is warranted for several reasons. First, the interrogation of any status quo is both healthy and necessary for the advancement of research. Second, we seek to systematize heretofore scattered but pointed criticism of boundaryless careers (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0170840611435600">Arnold &amp; Cohen, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0170840611435600">Pringle &amp; Mallon, 2003</xref>) and to add new criticisms. Third, an effective critique points us toward new, and better, theory. Critical examination of boundaryless career theory, we shall argue, paradoxically draws attention to the nature and importance of career boundaries, thereby stimulating the advocacy of ‘boundary-focused careers scholarship’ with which we close this paper.</p>

<title>Review and Critique</title>
<p>Based on our reading and analysis of the literature on boundaryless careers, we identify and articulate five issues that suggest limits to the value of the boundaryless careers concept. These are: (1) the use of ‘boundaryless career’ as a label; (2) ambiguous and multiple definitions of boundaryless career; (3) overemphasis on personal agency in boundaryless career writing; (4) the normalization of boundaryless careers; and (5) the lack of empirical support for the claimed predominance of boundaryless careers.</p>
<sec id="section5-0170840611435600">
<title>The use of ‘boundaryless career’ as a label</title>
<p>The word ‘boundaryless’ was introduced to management studies by Jack Welch, CEO of General Electric, whose endorsement of ‘the boundaryless organization’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0170840611435600">Ashkenas, Ulrich, Jick &amp; Kerr, 1995</xref>) was borrowed by the organizers of the 1993 meeting of the Academy of Management in Atlanta as its conference theme. Prompted by the theme, Robert deFillippi and Michael Arthur presented a symposium entitled ‘The boundaryless career’, which was then developed into a Special Issue of the <italic>Journal of Organizational Behavior</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0170840611435600">Arthur, 1994</xref>) and later extended into the edited book (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0170840611435600">Arthur &amp; Rousseau, 1996</xref>). This history contextualizes two aspects of the rise to prominence of the label ‘boundaryless careers’.</p>
<p>First, while the development of knowledge is often guided by broad and ambiguous labels and metaphors, which may indeed attract attention and stimulate research, the term ‘boundaryless’ was not developed by scholars seeking appropriate terms to describe particular career phenomena, but diffused uncritically into the literature because of its currency as a conference banner and its attractiveness to organizational studies.</p>
<p>Second, as Sullivan has noted, ‘the term “boundaryless career” is really a misnomer, as systems need boundaries to define themselves’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-0170840611435600">1999</xref>, p. 477). In practice, ‘boundaryless career’ denotes not a boundary-<italic>less</italic> career but a boundary-<italic>crossing</italic> career (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0170840611435600">Inkson, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr95-0170840611435600">Zeitz, Blau &amp; Fertig, 2009</xref>). The notion that a career can be boundaryless potentially trivializes boundaries, even though they are often important means of defining and understanding careers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0170840611435600">Gunz, Peiperl &amp; Tzabbar, 2007</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0170840611435600">
<title>Ambiguous and multiple definitions of ‘boundaryless career’</title>
<p>According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0170840611435600">Arthur and Rousseau (1996</xref>, p. 6) boundaryless careers – ‘the opposite of organizational careers’ – included several specific meanings, or emphases: where a career (1) moves across the boundaries of separate employers; (2) draws validation from outside the present employer; (3) is sustained by external networks or information; (4) involves breaking traditional organizational career boundaries, such as hierarchical reporting and advancement; (5) involves rejecting career opportunities for personal or family reasons; (6) is seen by the career actor as leading to a boundaryless future regardless of structural constraints (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0170840611435600">Arthur &amp; Rousseau, 1996</xref>, p. 6).</p>
<p>This definition is now canonical to the extent that in many papers it continues to appear in full. However, it is ambiguous and consequently weak, most obviously in its ambiguity concerning which particular boundaries are crossed. The boundaries denoted by ‘the opposite of organizational careers’ and ‘single employment setting’ are clearly external organizational boundaries, but as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0170840611435600">Gunz, Evans and Jalland (2000)</xref> have noted, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0170840611435600">Arthur and Rousseau (1996)</xref> also discussed geographical, industry, occupational, professional and role boundaries. Other objective boundaries that a career can cross include those delineating hierarchical status, employment status, community, country, social class and work/home. Subjective boundaries include, in addition, those delineating reference groups, vocational interests and comfort zones. Yet the original definition of ‘boundaryless career’ privileges movements across organizational boundaries above all others, and much of the literature likewise assumes that the boundaries around organizations are the only, or at least the most important, ones to be considered (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0170840611435600">Becker &amp; Haunschild, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0170840611435600">Jones, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0170840611435600">Lazarova &amp; Taylor, 2009</xref>). We favour the study of career boundaries of many types, but this would necessitate a major revision of the accepted definition of ‘boundaryless career’.</p>
<p>Other authors have however adopted concepts of boundarylessness that are wider than Arthur and Rousseau’s formulation: for example, temporariness of employment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0170840611435600">Ackah &amp; Heaton, 2004</xref>), self-directedness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0170840611435600">O’Dowd &amp; Kaplan, 2005</xref>) and restlessness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-0170840611435600">Stahl &amp; Cerdin, 2004</xref>). To <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0170840611435600">Cabrera (2007)</xref>, who was interested in women’s careers, a boundaryless career was a career full of gaps, while to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-0170840611435600">Tung (2008)</xref>, whose focus was international careers, it was a career that crosses national boundaries.</p>
<p>As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0170840611435600">Feldman and Ng (2007</xref>, p. 368) put it: ‘The construct [of boundaryless career] has become somewhat boundaryless itself.’ How does one organize rational discussion of boundaryless careers amid such confusion? A broader, more thoughtful consideration is surely needed of the place of boundaries in career behaviour, the processes of career boundary formation and the wide range of types of boundary that are involved.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0170840611435600">
<title>Agency in boundaryless career writing</title>
<p>A fundamental question in career studies is whether careers are mainly the product of institutional frameworks or of individual agency. In the vocational perspective the individual is the agent of his or her own career, but the organizational perspective assumes that organizations can control members’ careers. A still wider perspective asserts that institutional forces, such as social class, gender, ethnicity, education and government regulation, also constrain even the most agentic career actors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0170840611435600">Mayrhofer, Meyer &amp; Steyrer, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>In considering institutional influences on career, we find it impossible to ignore ideology. In a separate critical analysis of the literature, we concluded that ‘boundaryless careers discourse … is a manifestation of wider neoliberal discourse that emphasizes individual rather than societal or organizational responsibility for economic and career outcomes’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0170840611435600">Roper, Ganesh &amp; Inkson, 2010</xref>, p. 673). Possibly due to such biases, institutional constraints on career are downplayed by many boundaryless career commentators. For instance, Banai and Harry state that individuals who have ‘boundaryless global careers … unilaterally take charge over their careers’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0170840611435600">2004</xref>, p. 98). Boundaryless career actors are perceived to be ‘mobile, self-determined … free agents who are able to seamlessly connect with work in multiple contexts’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0170840611435600">Harrison, 2006</xref>, p. 20). The language is evocative: boundarylessness ‘has seductive connotations of escaping limits and exploiting uncharted territory’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr95-0170840611435600">Zeitz et al., 2009</xref>, p. 372).</p>
<p>But other commentaries have observed the constraints that institutions often put on individuals’ latent career mobility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0170840611435600">Pringle &amp; Mallon, 2003</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0170840611435600">Dany (2003)</xref> described the intricate institutional forces – structural and attitudinal – faced, in France, by the cadres of the elite workforce. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0170840611435600">Ituma and Simpson (2009)</xref> characterized Nigerian IT workers’ careers as organizational, and constrained by institutional forces: ethnic allegiance, personal connections, gender discrimination, educational qualifications and work history. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr95-0170840611435600">Zeitz et al. (2009)</xref> suggested that even boundaryless career actors need institutional resources such as career counselling, socioeconomic support, skill certification and labour market assistance. Boundaryless career theorists are now taking heed of a barrage of evidence on contextual constraints. ‘Research examining careers within these wider institutional and cultural contexts challenges any unbridled notion of career agency’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-0170840611435600">Tams &amp; Arthur, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>While the boundaryless careers literature focuses mainly on professional, technical and managerial groups who due to their prized skills are able to exercise agency, autonomy and mobility in their careers, scholars have raised important questions about such agency. Notably, they have questioned whether the assumption of agency in boundaryless career theory privileges educated elites and marginalizes lower-skilled workers, women and minorities for whom boundarylessness simply means unemployment, insecurity and anxiety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0170840611435600">Currie et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0170840611435600">Marler, Barringer &amp; Milkovich, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0170840611435600">Pringle &amp; Mallon, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-0170840611435600">van Buren, 2003</xref>). A few have also asked whether acceptance of boundaryless careers may ‘legitimize the effects of downsizing and delayering and the reduction of traditional career opportunities’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0170840611435600">Cohen &amp; Mallon, 1999</xref>, p. 336).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0170840611435600">
<title>The normalization of boundaryless careers</title>
<p>To normalize is to represent something as being normal to the extent that audiences commonly regard such representation as fact. Many boundaryless career studies provide a powerful rationale for accepting boundaryless careers as inevitable and ubiquitous. For example:</p>

<p>Since the 1980s … globalization, restructuring, downsizing, reorganizing and outsourcing have transformed business, and the structure of the workforce has also changed … Jobs have been redesigned in terms of projects … Organizational commitment has been replaced with a business transaction … Boundaryless careers have become predominant.

<p>In such discourse the language is unqualified, unquestioning and all-embracing: the implication is of wholesale and rapid change, to the ‘predominance’ of boundaryless careers.</p>
<p>Many descriptions also involve a similarly unquestioning comparison with ‘traditional careers.’ For example:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Given today’s more volatile and unstable organizational environment, individuals can <italic>no longer</italic> expect lifetime employment within one organization or a steady climb up the corporate ladder. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0170840611435600">Eby, Butts &amp; Lockwood, 2003</xref>, p. 689, emphasis added)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The use of the term ‘traditional career’ as a synonym for ‘organizational’ career makes such careers redolent of an undesirable, change-resistant past. ‘A new dichotomy is being set up which suggests that old careers are stultifying and must be overturned and that the new hold out great possibilities for liberation’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0170840611435600">Cohen &amp; Mallon, 1999</xref>, p. 336).</p>
<p>An unfortunate corollary of the enthusiasm for boundaryless careers has therefore been a corresponding de-normalization of organizational careers. In the HRM literature the use of the term ‘career’ has noticeably diminished. For example, the <italic>Oxford Handbook of Human Resource Management</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0170840611435600">Boxall, Purcell &amp; Wright, 2007</xref>) does not even include the term ‘career’ in the index. That is not to say that this literature has lost its interest in the managerial activity of managing careers: it appears to have been subsumed in the somewhat inchoate label ‘talent management’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0170840611435600">Collings &amp; Mallahi, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0170840611435600">Lewis &amp; Heckman, 2006</xref>). It is the label ‘career’ that seems to have vanished from the HRM map.</p>
<p>Thus, the boundaryless career is constructed as a new, sudden and predominant career form. In addition, some treatments construct boundaryless careers not only as common individual experiences but also as ubiquitous context. For example: ‘a world of boundaryless careers’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0170840611435600">Becker &amp; Haunschild, 2003</xref>, p. 715); ‘the boundaryless career environment’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0170840611435600">Higgins, Dobrow &amp; Roloff, 2010</xref>, p. 749); and ‘the era of the boundaryless career’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0170840611435600">Eby et al., 2003</xref>, p. 689). The change from old to new is represented as both <italic>comprehensive</italic> and <italic>sudden.</italic> Has the employment world in which we live really changed so completely?</p>

<title>Lack of empirical support for the predominance of boundaryless careers</title>
<p>Arguably, the notion of ‘boundaryless career’ could be viewed as an ideal-type, although it would be easier to do so were its definition less fuzzy. However, the literature has tended not to treat it this way. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0170840611435600">Becker and Haunschild (2003</xref>, p. 714), the trend to boundaryless careers is an ‘empirical phenomenon’. And <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0170840611435600">Forret and Sullivan (2002)</xref> tell us that ‘whether voluntarily or involuntarily, managers and professionals are switching jobs at an ever-increasing pace’ (p. 245). The recent rise and current predominance of boundaryless careers is accepted as a fact so self-evident it requires no justification. But what hard evidence is there that this is so?</p>
<p>A major problem in answering this question is the lack of agreement on the definition of boundaryless career (see above). But on the basis of the predominant view that the key feature of boundaryless careers is crossing <italic>employer</italic> or <italic>organization</italic> boundaries, boundarylessness (or boundary-crossing) should be reflected in labour turnover statistics, which surely measure objective, though not subjective, career boundarylessness. Such information is not however provided in ‘boundaryless career’ studies, which typically assert that boundaryless careers have increased in frequency, or predominate, but offer no empirical evidence that this is so. Furthermore, several studies have indicated that, even in settings where one might <italic>expect</italic> boundaryless careers to have become predominant, substantial groups of workers are apparently still having organizational careers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0170840611435600">Donnelly 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0170840611435600">Gunz et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0170840611435600">Ituma &amp; Simpson, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0170840611435600">Pang, Chua &amp; Chu, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0170840611435600">Smith &amp; Sheridan, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>What do objective studies tell us? According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0170840611435600">Jacoby (1999)</xref> the percentage of US workers who had worked for their employer for ten years or more remained stable from 1983 to 1998. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-0170840611435600">Stevens (2005)</xref> found that average tenure for older males remained virtually stable (at over 21 years) between 1969 and 2002. And, following a comprehensive review of mobility data from the US, Europe and Japan since 1992, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0170840611435600">Rodrigues and Guest (2010</xref>, p. 1167) concluded that:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>There is … no evidence of a significant increase in mobility across organizational boundaries. Moreover, managers and professionals, who … have been the main focus of the boundaryless career literature, seem to be the least affected by market instability. Overall, careers have not become organizationally boundaryless.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>None of these studies support the view that there has been a move since the 1980s from organizational careers to boundaryless careers, or that boundaryless careers are now predominant. It may be that careers cross <italic>non</italic>-organizational boundaries with increasing frequency, but that, too, remains to be proven. Overall, we are forced to agree with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0170840611435600">Lazarova and Taylor (2009)</xref> that the boundaryless careers literature is ‘a bandwagon of ideas [that] seems to have developed without clear and compelling evidence’ (p. 133).</p>
<p>What is true, however, is that job tenure is highly correlated with age. For example, in the USA and Western Europe, average length of job tenure of men under 30 in the USA and Western Europe is 2 to 3 years. For men over 50 it averages between 13 and 20 years in different countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0170840611435600">OECD, 2006</xref>). Why, with apparently limited evidence to suggest more than minimal change in average job tenure in the period 1970–2010, and massive evidence of gross decreases in interorganizational mobility as people age, do nearly all commentaries on boundaryless careers treat them as if they were a new, universal and homogeneous phenomenon?</p>

<title>Synthesis</title>
<p>We note again that there has been other pointed criticism, on ideological, theoretical and empirical grounds, of boundaryless career theory and advocacy. However, such voices of criticism ‘are largely drowned out in a chorus of approval and celebration of the boundaryless career as a self-evident and pervasive context for twenty-first century careers’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0170840611435600">Arnold &amp; Cohen, 2008</xref>, p. 10). Is typical boundaryless careers discourse then no more than the ‘follow-the-leader’ perpetuation of a loose term and concept generated opportunistically in the 1990s – an academic fashion? <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0170840611435600">Abrahamson (1996)</xref> notes that fashions need to accord with ‘norms of progress’, and that their adoption relates to the ‘psychosocial needs’ of adopters. Is the promotion of boundaryless career driven in part by researchers’ need to say something new and progressive about careers?</p>
<p>To put our critique in context, we acknowledge that boundaryless career theory and the literature it has spawned have brought considerable benefits. Boundaryless careers present a novel ideal type and an appropriate model for <italic>some</italic> individuals, <italic>some</italic> organizations and <italic>some</italic> industries. Research and theory on boundaryless careers have been responsive to changes in the economic and organizational contexts of the past 25 years, and have pulled career studies in business school settings away from a myopic preoccupation with intra-organizational career phenomena. The increased focus on individual agency in careers has also provided an important counter to the common characterization of organizational members as inert ‘human resources’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0170840611435600">Inkson, 2008</xref>). Considering the crossing of boundaries and working at organizational and individual levels creates new opportunities for a rapprochement between the organizational and vocational traditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0170840611435600">Collin &amp; Patton, 2009</xref>), and a consequent strengthening of, and multidisciplinarity in, career studies as a whole (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0170840611435600">Arthur, 2008</xref>).</p>
<sec id="section11-0170840611435600">
<title>Restoring balance in careers research</title>
<p>In our critique, we differ markedly from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-0170840611435600">Sullivan and Baruch’s (2009)</xref> largely celebratory review of the literature, and their proposed ‘onward and upward’ further development of research on boundaryless and protean careers. We careers scholars need to pay more attention to the ideological context of our studies, and the potential subverting effects of managerialism, ideological certitude and attractive slogans and images.</p>
<p>We also need to provide a better empirical backdrop to our studies. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-0170840611435600">Sullivan and Baruch (2009</xref>, p. 1561) state that ‘whereas actual physical passages between jobs and organizations can be readily identified and enumerated … relatively little attention has been paid to psychological mobility’; and they advocate further measures of the ‘boundaryless career mindset’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0170840611435600">Briscoe, Hall &amp; DeMuth, 2006</xref>) and similar attitudinal variables. While authors such as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0170840611435600">Cappelli (1999)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0170840611435600">Gunz, Evans and Jalland (2000)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0170840611435600">Higgins (2006)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0170840611435600">Ibarra (1999)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0170840611435600">Jones (1996)</xref> have documented job mobility in interesting ways, this kind of study is relatively rare. We therefore advocate more quantitative studies that track the objective movements of career actors and the boundaries they cross (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0170840611435600">Nicholson &amp; West, 1988</xref>), and more use of secondary data sources such as national labour statistics. One strategy might involve partnering with disciplines such as labour economics, demographics, migration studies and industry studies, which may facilitate macro-level contextualization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0170840611435600">Cappelli, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0170840611435600">Jacoby, 1999</xref>); a contrasted approach might be to use social anthropological and ethnographic studies to study the micro-dynamics of career transitions.</p>
<p>We also need to avoid statements of universality, inevitability or dominance of particular career forms, at least until there is substantial evidence to support such conclusions. Doing so acknowledges better the vast heterogeneity that characterizes both individual careers and careers en masse. Because a career lasts a whole working life, the notion of ‘boundaryless career’ suggests not just momentary mobility but a working lifetime of boundarylessness. But the variety and complexity of careers obstruct any attempt to categorize them as ‘boundaryless’. Careers typically involve instances of boundary-crossing, periods of organizational focus, and times of attraction or devotion to, or flight from, particular roles, organizations, occupations, industries or locations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0170840611435600">Nicholson &amp; West, 1988</xref>). How do we explain such changes? Career studies should not just be about career types, but also about the multiplicity of processes, including, for example, boundary construction, boundary acceptance, boundary celebration, boundary defence and boundary shifting that take place, along with boundary crossing, at one time or another in most careers.</p>
<p>In moving the focus from the boundaryless type to boundary-related processes we find ourselves examining such phenomena as mobility versus embeddedness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0170840611435600">Feldman &amp; Ng, 2007</xref>), or the many ways in which career processes are affected by, or affect, careers. And it is here, we suggest, that the notion of ‘boundary’ has a major contribution to make.</p>

<title>Bringing Back Boundaries</title>
<p>Perhaps the most unfortunate – and probably unintentional – implication of the boundaryless career concept is its apparent rejection of boundaries as central features of careers. It is unfortunate because if it were true it would disconnect career research not only from organization studies, where there is a substantial but not well-integrated literature on career boundaries (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0170840611435600">Abbott, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0170840611435600">Glaser &amp; Strauss, 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0170840611435600">Gunz et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-0170840611435600">Schein, 1971</xref>), but also from its own roots in the Chicago School of Sociology and its study of the professions, which were inherently preoccupied with the erection and protection of career boundaries, and of the many people and occupations whose lives are profoundly affected by career boundaries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0170840611435600">Barley, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0170840611435600">Glaser &amp; Strauss, 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0170840611435600">Hughes, 1937</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0170840611435600">Roth, 1963</xref>). The implication of moving the focus from classifying careers as a whole to studying career processes is that we need to examine career phenomena in terms not of boundaryless careers but of boundary-crossing. And to do this, we need to understand conceptually the boundaries themselves.</p>
<sec id="section13-0170840611435600">
<title>Career boundaries as objects of study</title>
<p>Objectively, careers, boundaryless or otherwise, can be seen as sequences of role-related experiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0170840611435600">Hughes, 1958</xref>), with the roles separated by boundaries. To use the familiar metaphor of career as a journey over a complex landscape (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0170840611435600">Nicholson &amp; De Waal-Andrews, 2005</xref>), arguing that careers are boundaryless is like saying that a journey can be mapped without mapping the landscape or the boundaries it traverses.</p>
<p>Many authors have argued for the primacy of boundaries in understanding social structure. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0170840611435600">Abbott (1995)</xref>, for example, suggested that the formation of professions is preceded by the formation of boundaries that distinguish between different kinds of occupation, followed by a ‘hooking-up’ process in which occupational groups decide that they are ‘inside’, and defined by, a particular boundary. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0170840611435600">Gunz et al. (2007)</xref> suggest a simple model in which career actors contemplating making transitions typically face gatekeepers – for example organizational recruiters, or examiners for professional bodies – who are responsible for deciding whether they can make this transition. The gatekeepers assess the suitability of the career actor for the new role, and the career actor, similarly, makes an assessment of his or her likely success in making the transition. Career boundaries thus have a subjective origin, enacted by career gatekeepers and career actors through recursive organizing processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr93-0170840611435600">Weick, 1996</xref>).</p>
<p>The notion of a career boundary, then, is a useful tool for examining the interplay between career and social and organizational context, and for engaging with broader work in social anthropology and sociology. Boundaries have properties such as permeability, reversibility and transition time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0170840611435600">Glaser &amp; Strauss, 1967</xref>) which derive from the exigencies of social context and actors’ interpretations. For example, when a young female law graduate discovers that few women obtain partnership positions, she learns something very important about the social and organizational structures within which she plans to build her career.</p>
<p>Processes of career boundary creation, and the responses of career actors to boundaries, are therefore worthy of study. Such studies should recognize the forces that shape career complexity. In a study in Spain, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0170840611435600">Hall and las Heras (2009)</xref> note the constraining effects of cultural norms, geographical mobility, labor legislation and government security provisions in encouraging or discouraging flexibility. Each contextual variable creates boundaries that mobile actors must cross. More broadly, boundaries shift in response to tensions between, for example, agentic versus institutional forces; global versus local forces created by the globalization of capital and the localization of labour; cosmopolitan versus local career orientations; and organizational versus occupational/professional networks.</p>
<p>Can we begin to see regularities in career behaviour relating to boundaries? When organizational boundaries are removed through restructuring and contracting, career actors frequently respond by seeking, often collectively, to construct and reinforce alternative boundaries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0170840611435600">Currie et al., 2006</xref>). At the more micro-level, we might ask whether the crossing of one type of boundary by a career actor (e.g. organizational) makes the crossing of another type (e.g. occupational, industry) more or less likely. Organization-hopping Silicon Valley workers, for example, seem firmly anchored within the boundaries of their industry, occupation and geographical area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0170840611435600">Saxenian, 1996</xref>). According to Currie et al., ‘the time is right to go beyond the idea of the boundaryless career and find out more about the new boundaries and frontiers which mark current careers’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0170840611435600">2006</xref>, p. 757). Such suggestions are very susceptible to empirical investigation.</p>
<p>What kinds of research questions could emerge from this? Our point of departure is the insight that the boundaryless career literature has provided, namely that careers that result from boundary-crossing are at least as interesting, if not more so, as those constrained by boundaries. But, as we have seen, the boundaryless career literature is less interested in how particular boundaries are being transcended than it is in the notion that they <italic>are</italic> being transcended: indeed, it is often vague to the point of neglect about what boundaries are. Yet what emerges from boundary theory as introduced above is that boundaries are central to the shaping of careers. A good theory of boundaries both introduces a new set of questions for career research to address, and redirects our attention to important questions that the boundaryless career literature has shifted focus away from.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-0170840611435600">
<title>Boundary-focused career scholarship</title>
<p>We therefore argue for a new approach, albeit one which, as we noted above, has its roots among early career scholars from the Chicago School, and potentially enables career studies to re-connect with its roots in the sociology of occupations and the social anthropology of work. We call this <italic>boundary-focused career scholarship</italic>, and it has features of the traditions of both organizational career studies and boundaryless career studies. These can be thought of as being at two extremes.</p>
<p>Organizational career theory was based on the assumption that organizational boundaries define what is interesting in organizational careers, and that crossing them marks a transition to a different organizational career. The earlier career scholars did not ignore the possibility of boundary-crossing, which was implicit in many models – including <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0170840611435600">Gouldner’s (1958)</xref> seminal view of ‘locals’ versus ‘cosmopolitans’ – and is found in many empirical studies of managerial careers (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0170840611435600">Nicholson &amp; West, 1988</xref>). But the basic assumption made by the early theorists was that these boundaries, particularly interorganizational boundaries, were hard to cross, and that crossing them resulted in types of career in which most scholars were not particularly interested, because such careers could apparently not be managed by employing organizations.</p>
<p>Boundaryless career theory is based on the idea that boundaries are – or should be – completely permeable and that the careers that result are the consequences more of individual agency than of structural constraints. In essence, boundaryless career theory poses the question: what if boundary permeability matters more than impermeability, and what might it mean for careers? Boundaries, in other words, were no longer seen as being important to careers, even though more recently writers (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-0170840611435600">Tams &amp; Arthur, 2010</xref>) have acknowledged that context, which is framed and structured by boundaries, is crucial.</p>
<p>Unlike both organizational career studies and boundaryless career studies, boundary-focused career scholarship is conceptually interested in boundaries themselves. Drawing on boundary theory, which explains why career boundaries vary in permeability, it asks questions about the circumstances under which boundaries may be crossed or not, and about the impact of this crossing or non-crossing on career actors. Furthermore, the consequence of regarding boundaries as the objectified product of negotiation between gatekeepers and career actors is to treat them as social constructs, recalling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0170840611435600">Giddens’s (1981</xref>, p. 171) concept of logical entailment in which ‘the concept of action presumes that of structure and vice versa’. Boundary-focused career research thus directs attention to the effects of the actions and beliefs of career actors and career gatekeepers on the boundaries themselves.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-0170840611435600">
<title>A conceptual and research agenda</title>
<p>This concept of boundaries as social constructs suggests a new conceptual agenda including at least four forms of boundary-focused career research. The first arises directly from our observation that boundaries are <italic>socially created</italic>, by people, in communities. The remaining three forms of research spring from the suggestion of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0170840611435600">Gunz and Mayrhofer (2010)</xref> that boundaries play three distinct roles in careers. They <italic>constrain</italic> careers by restricting the kinds of changes people can make in their working lives; they <italic>enable</italic> careers by structuring status passages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0170840611435600">Glaser &amp; Strauss, 1971</xref>); and they <italic>punctuate</italic> careers by providing the markers that help people structure their working lives as they move through the many rites of passage that they encounter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-0170840611435600">van Gennep, 1960/1909</xref>). We examine each in turn.</p>
<p>First, we develop the point that boundaries are <italic>social creations</italic>, and career actors help create them. Indeed career scholars have recently developed an interest in the way that people respond to career-threatening events by reconstructing career boundaries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0170840611435600">Currie et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-0170840611435600">Valcour, Bailyn &amp; Quijada, 2007</xref>). The first mode of boundary-focused careers research examines the processes of boundary creation and modification by the career actor and his or her role set, in particular the gatekeeper. Understanding how people form career boundaries in their minds can potentially provide information about many other phenomena, ranging from dispositional data on the individual, for example their propensity to attribute career events to their own actions or to those of others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0170840611435600">Rotter, 1966</xref>), to processes of forming occupations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0170840611435600">Abbott, 1995</xref>). So, for example, the opposite side of the coin introduced above – the formation of new occupations and changes to old ones – could well be studied from this complementary perspective. This research would move beyond the question of studying, for example, what it takes to become a bioinformatics specialist and what happens to people when they do this, to how the boundaries that separate practising bioinformatics specialists from would-be bioinformatics specialists or from other occupational groups have developed over time. These questions, in turn, potentially tell us a great deal about the changing nature of occupations, how they fit into the intellectual forms of organization of which they are part (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr94-0170840611435600">Whitley, 1984</xref>) and about the socioeconomic systems in which they are embedded.</p>
<p>The <italic>constraining</italic> role of boundaries recognizes that boundaries define limits or resistances to people’s life chances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0170840611435600">Dahrendorf, 1980</xref>), and therefore play a key role in establishing their identities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0170840611435600">Ibarra, 1999</xref>). People locate themselves in the social order (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0170840611435600">Hughes, 1937</xref>) by reference to the opportunities not open to them, perhaps as a result of their social origins, lack of education, or intellectual limitations. With relatively few exceptions (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0170840611435600">Rosenbaum, 1984</xref>) the organizational careers literature has largely ignored what can be learned from the constraints that are either imagined by career actors or observable in the behaviour of gatekeepers, and the flows of people between status levels. Any career actor at any given moment has, at least in theory, many potential choices of changes in role that he or she could take; but for many, particularly the socially marginalized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0170840611435600">Prasad, Abate &amp; Prasad, 2007</xref>) these choices may be blocked by boundaries so powerful that the actors cannot imagine crossing them. Nevertheless it is at least as interesting, if not more interesting, to enquire into why a given career actor did <italic>not</italic> choose the many possibilities open to him or her, as it is to enquire into why they chose the one they did.</p>
<p>This second form of boundary-focused career research, then, in much the same way that sociologists have examined the how professions close themselves to all but a limited few (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0170840611435600">Abbott, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0170840611435600">Carr-Saunders &amp; Wilson, 1933</xref>), potentially helps us to learn about, for example, the structure of labour markets, the nature of occupational groups and occupational identification, and the influences of these and of education, technology, macroeconomic shocks, and so on, on the lives of working people.</p>
<p>More familiar in the careers literature is the <italic>enabling</italic> role of boundaries. For example, in the extensive literature on socialization, organizational and occupational boundaries are shown to structure the processes of becoming socialized into a new role. Becoming a full member involves crossing one or more boundaries structured by a series of choices that have been made by the gatekeepers or their predecessors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-0170840611435600">van Maanen, 1978</xref>). By focusing on ‘boundarylessness’ as an outcome – as the product of boundary-crossing rather than the process of living a boundary-crossing career – we reduce the opportunity to learn about the social context within which careers are made (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0170840611435600">Mayrhofer et al., 2007</xref>) and its influence on them.</p>
<p>The third form of boundary-focused career research, then, examines these processes, from which we can learn a great deal not just about careers, but about organizations and occupations and their relationship to careers. In that sense we are calling for a return to the tradition of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0170840611435600">Glaser and Strauss (1971)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-0170840611435600">Schein (1971)</xref>, to a study of the influence on people of boundary-crossing processes. There is, for example, an extensive literature on the process of becoming a professional (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0170840611435600">Becker, Geer, Hughes &amp; Strauss, 1961</xref>), much of it dating to the Chicago school of sociology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0170840611435600">Becker, 2003</xref>). But since then, in response to technological change, many new occupations have sprung up, and new, boundary-focused studies of entry to established and new occupations, and the effects on careers, are needed.</p>
<p><italic>The punctuating</italic> role of boundaries stems from the centrality of time to the concept of career (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0170840611435600">Arthur, Hall &amp; Lawrence. 1989</xref>, p. 8) and the fact that boundary-crossing events play a central role in punctuating the passage of time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0170840611435600">Roth, 1963</xref>). The punctuating role is informative about the meaning of time to the career actor and about how this relates to his or her sense of career progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0170840611435600">Lawrence, 1984</xref>) which may be in terms of maturation processes (e.g. coming-of-age ceremonies), of acceptance in a desired social grouping (e.g. the transition from probationer to professional), or of an aging process (e.g. the transition from employed person to retiree).</p>
<p>A fourth form of boundary-focused career research therefore examines boundary-crossing events as career punctuation, for example those involved in the changing process of retirement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0170840611435600">Maestas, 2010</xref>). This not only tells us about the position of the career actor in his or her career chronology, but when studied in representative samples of career actors is informative about the structures of the organizations, occupations and other social groupings around whom the boundary originally formed. For example in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0170840611435600">Bechky’s (2006)</xref> study of film productions as temporary organizations, novices entering the industry were shown to build their careers by crossing a series of project and occupational boundaries, trying something new each time they join a new film crew, and experimenting until they found their chosen occupation within the industry. In <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0170840611435600">Dany, Louvel and Valette’s (2011)</xref> study of French academics, ‘promotion scripts’ played a critical role in punctuating and constraining the participants’ careers across academic status boundaries.</p>
<p>To summarize, re-engagement with various academic disciplines enables development of a new and refocused research agenda, resulting in the recognition that career boundaries are interesting in their own right, both as social artefacts and in the process of their formation. While not denying the role of agency in career (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-0170840611435600">Tams &amp; Arthur, 2010</xref>), we suggest here that there is much to be learned by examining the context of careers and the impact on careers of the interaction between career agency and social structure.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>We have highlighted how studies of boundaryless careers, while pushing career studies in innovative directions, have failed adequately to define their concept, have overestimated agency and underestimated institutional effects, have neglected and derided organizational careers, and have assumed the predominance of boundaryless careers where the evidence says otherwise. Most importantly, they have failed to theorize career boundaries adequately. It is time to capitalize on the interest boundaryless career theory has created in career mobility, to make career studies more interdisciplinary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0170840611435600">Arthur, 2008</xref>), and to develop broader, more holistic theorizations of career dynamics, particularly as they are impacted by, and impact, a range of different types of boundary. It is also time for career studies to take a closer interest in studies in the sociology and social anthropology of work, which, as we have shown, have much to offer in terms of facilitating understanding of the creation and crossing of career boundaries.</p>
<p>In order to use our own analysis to engender positive momentum, we too have provided specific suggestions of new directions for theory and research, and suggestions for an invigorated and robust re-conceptualization of career boundaries. In particular, we have shown how studies of boundaries as social constructions of career actors and others, as constraints on careers, as enablers of careers, and as punctuation of careers, have the potential to extend and enliven both career studies and related disciplines.</p>
<p>The boundaryless career has played its part in developing the early promise of career studies to provide integration. It is now time, we suggest, to bring back boundaries, and use them to realise that promise.</p>
