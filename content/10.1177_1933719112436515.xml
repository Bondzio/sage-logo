<title>Oxidative Stress and Ovarian Carcinoma</title>
<p>Epithelial ovarian carcinoma is the most common form of ovarian cancer and the gynecologic malignancy most frequent in the Western world. It is associated with a high morbidity, mainly due to the fact that the disease may not present with any symptoms until more advanced stages, which are harder to treat. In addition, despite intensive research in the field, the molecular biology of ovarian cancer is still poorly understood, consequently impairing the development of new and more efficient therapeutic strategies.</p>
<p>Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are known to have a key role in malignancies, altering gene expression, genomic instability, and, therefore, tumor progression. They are also known to alter microRNA expression, and miR-200 family members (miR-200s) have been previously shown to accumulate in ovarian cancers.</p>
<p>These facts lead Mateescu and colleagues to further explore the role of ROS in epithelial ovarian carcinoma and to determine its impact on tumor prognosis. Their study has recently been published in the journal <italic>Nature</italic> <italic>Medicine</italic> (<italic>Nat Med</italic>. 17(12):1627-1634).</p>
<p>Mateescu et al report the identification of a new function for the miR-200s in ovarian stress and ovarian tumorigenesis. Their results show that 2 members of the miR-200 family (miR-141 and miR-200a) inhibit p38α, which normally suppresses malignancy by blocking cell proliferation or promoting apoptosis. In the mouse, accumulation of these microRNAs mimicked p38α deficiency and, as expected, increased tumor proliferation. In humans, high miR-200a expression was identified in human ovarian adenocarcinomas, which also presented with low amounts of p38α and an associated oxidative stress signature. Interestingly, this oxidative stress signature positively correlated with an improved patient outcome and survival in response to treatment. The authors believe that, although miR-200a and miR-141 promote tumor proliferation under untreated conditions, they contribute to an increase in tumor cell death and slow down the tumor growth rate in the presence of the chemotherapeutic drug pacli-taxel that is known to increase ROS.</p>
<p>Thus, the study presented by Mateescu et al provides evidence for a new function for miR-200a in stress response—it promotes tumor growth while it also enhances the tumor sensitivity to chemotherapy treatment. This last role, which was previously unrecognized, may allow the use of miR-200s expression as a good predictive marker for patient clinical outcome in ovarian cancer. In addition, these findings help explain the observed limited success of antioxidants in the treatment of the disease.</p>

<title>Gene Fusions and Breast Cancer</title>
<p>Recurrent gene fusions and translocations have been known to be associated with hematologic malignancies and soft tissue tumors. More recently, these genetic rearrangements have also been identified in a growing list of common solid tumors, including breast cancer. Although complex somatic rearrangements have been identified in the several breast tumors' genomes sequenced, the driving recurrent gene fusions have remained undetermined.</p>
<p>Aiming the identification of common gene fusions in breast cancer, Robinson et al used paired end transcriptome sequencing on a panel of 89 cell lines and tumor tissues and identified a total of 384 expressed gene fusions at an average of nearly 5 fusions per breast cancer sample, with a slightly higher incidence in the cell lines as compared to the primary tumors.</p>
<p>Robinson and colleagues identified 2 classes of recurrent gene fusions, both with significant phenotypic effects in breast epithelial cells. They either involved genes encoding microtubule-associated serine–threonine kinase (MAST), whose role is not completely understood and whose genetic alterations have never before been associated with breast cancer, or members of the Notch family, which are essential for cell–cell communication.</p>
<p>The authors observed that overexpression of <italic>MAST1</italic> and <italic>MAST2</italic> gene fusions had a proliferative effect both in vivo and in vitro and that the breast cancer cell lines overexpressing the <italic>Notch</italic> gene rearrangements lost cell-matrix adherence and propagated as weakly attached clusters. In addition, Robinson et al verified that <italic>Notch</italic> gene and the MAST kinase rearrangements were mutually exclusive aberrations in the samples tested, with a combined incidence of up to 5% to 7% in breast cancers.</p>
<p>These recently published findings (<italic>Nat Med</italic>. 17(12):1646-1651) support the notion that recurrent gene rearrangements play a much bigger role in carcinogenesis than previously envisioned. Additionally, the identification of functionally recurrent <italic>MAST</italic> and <italic>Notch</italic> gene fusions in the subset of breast cancers unravels a new field for future research that may lead to new forms of breast cancer treatment.</p>
