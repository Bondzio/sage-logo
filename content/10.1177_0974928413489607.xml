<p>The rise of India as an ‘emerging power’ constitutes one of the enrapturing and symbolic factor reflecting the fundamental power shift in the last decade. With India’s rise, much attention has been given to understand India’s foreign policy perspectives towards various pertinent global issues ranging from trade, environment to security in international relations. Additionally, there is also a strand of literature which has, in recent years, attempted to examine India’s foreign policy choices with the idea of a ‘regional power’ and its implications on becoming a global player (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0974928413489607">Flemes 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0974928413489607">Hurrell 2006</xref>). Various questions have been raised as to how India’s role as an emerging power would be affected by the regional dynamics. How would India’s relations with her neighbours in the South Asian region impact on her aspiration of being a global player? Sandra Destradi’s book, <italic>India’s Foreign and Security Policy in South Asia: Regional Strategies</italic>, is an attempt to capture India’s rise by focusing on its foreign policy at the regional level. The book is written in a lucid and compact manner, divided into seven short, yet insightful chapters.</p>
<p>In the first chapter, which forms an ‘Introduction’, she provides a brief background to India’s rise and places her in the region of South Asia. While providing the contours of her book, the author introduces the concept of ‘region’ in order to understand the notion of regional power by unraveling the stream of earlier works on region. After assessing the earlier works, she defines regional power as ‘a state which belongs to a region, disposes of superior power capabilities, and exercises an influence on regional neighbours’ (p. 5). Thereafter she wades through the two different strands of available literature which offers an interpretation of India’s policies towards its neighbours as ‘unilateralist’ and ‘cooperative’. In the last section of this chapter, the author provides the overall structure of the book summarising the core issues dealt in each chapter that ensue.</p>
<p>In the second chapter, ‘Empire, Hegemony, and Leadership: Assessing the Strategies of Regional Powers’, as the name suggests, the author attempts to develop as well as transpose an analytical framework based on these three concepts, which has so far been extensively used to understand the role of powerful states at the global level, to comprehend regional power strategies. By drawing on various literatures, the author makes a distinction of the three concepts and effectively applies it to the regional powers. She writes, ‘A conceptual distinction between the notions of empire, hegemony and leadership is necessary because these concepts have been used interchangeably, as synonyms, leading to an almost inextricable confusion about their usage’ (p. 10). She attaches three dimensions to the concepts—‘basic’, ‘constitutive’ and ‘operational’—for further clarification of the meaning for the purpose of the book. Empire, she argues, involves the ‘resort to military intervention or to threat of it’ and is associated with the pursuit of its ‘own goals and interests, if necessary by imposing them on other states involved’ (p. 15), and resembles imperial powers. Drawing a thin line of difference, the author defines hegemony as ‘a form of power exercised through strategies that are more subtle’ (p. 15) than exercised by empire or imperial powers. Yet, akin to imperial power, hegemony also involves the realisation of one’s own goals, and this distinguishes hegemony from the concept of leadership. Leadership is defined as ‘…leaders inducing followers to act for certain goals that represent the values and motivations—the wants and needs, the aspirations and the expectations—of both leaders and followers’ (p. 22), which implies having ‘commonality of goals between leader and followers’ (p. 23). The author further breaks down the concept of ‘hegemony’ into three categories for simplification of the strategies employed under it: hard hegemony (threats and sanctions); intermediate (incentives, hard persuasion); and soft hegemony (soft persuasion and socialisation efforts).</p>
<p>Following the delineation of the meaning and the constitutive elements of these three concepts, the author dwells on the operative aspect of the concepts and further breaks down these concepts to fit in the regional level of analysis. Recognising the fact that the definition of the concepts and strategies employed under the three concepts analysed do not suffice in itself to clear out the confusion pertaining to these ‘contested concepts’, the author includes the reactions and perceptions of the subordinate states in her analysis as a way to better understand the strategies pursued by regional power. As the author notes,
<disp-quote>
<p>The analysis of the foreign policy means used by the regional power, and of the commonality or divergence between the goals of the regional power and those of its small neighbours, needs to be complemented by an assessment of the strategies and perceptions of subordinate states. (p. 46)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The third chapter on ‘India’ provides a landscape of the region and defines India as a regional power. Taking cue from various theories in international relations on region like the Regional Security Complex theory, constructivist theory and institutionalist approach, the author delimits the region of South Asia as comprising seven states of India, Pakistan, Nepal, Bhutan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Maldives. Thereafter, the author proceeds to assess the power capabilities of India to define it as a regional power. Owing to the difficulties in assessing power capabilities in relational term, the author identifies three power indicators: demographic dividend, economic dividend measured in GDP terms and military capabilities. Since India possesses the largest share in all the three indicators, the author defines India as a regional power in the region of South Asia. Following this, the author highlights the core goals and objectives of Indian foreign policy in order to examine the commonality or divergence with the three case studies in the later chapters. The author figures three goals of Indian foreign policy through a qualitative content analysis and expert interviews: stability in the region; limit spillover effects; and preservation of India’s influence on the region by limiting the role of external powers.</p>
<p>Having outlined the theoretical framework and vividly sketching the landscape of the region of South Asia confirming the regional preponderance of India, the author dedicates the following three chapters—fourth, fifth and sixth—to test the theory on the empirical evidence. In doing so, she selected the small neighbours Sri Lanka, Nepal and Bangladesh and also stipulated specific time periods when all the three states were undergoing unprecedented changes politically. In all the three chapters, the author follows a similar pattern to analyse India’s regional strategy towards them. For instance, in the fourth chapter on Sri Lanka, the author considers the unfolding of events during the time period of 2003–2006 and 2006–2009, that is, from the time of the breakdown of the Norwegian peace process to the end of the military conflict in 2009. The chapter first proceeds to provide a brief historical background of the ethnic crisis and India–Sri Lanka ties as it developed during that time followed by India’s foreign policy strategy towards Sri Lanka during the same time frame. Then the author offers an understanding of the Sri Lankan approach towards India in terms of reactions and perceptions, and commonality or divergence of interests and goals. Similarly, in the fifth chapter on Nepal under the time frame of 2002–2008, that is, from the start of the democratic erosion to the elections in 2008, and the sixth chapter on Bangladesh covering the period from 2001 to 2008, that is, the start of electoral victory of BNP and its allies until the coming of the caretaker government and elections in 2008, the author follows the same order of arranging the events. In all the three case studies, the author finds that India adopted a mixed hegemonic strategy—hard, soft and intermediate—as per its national interests during the phases under consideration.</p>
<p>In case of Sri Lanka, the author finds the exercise of ‘unsuccessful hegemonic strategy’ since India was unable to influence the development of Sri Lanka. In fact, she argues, ‘India itself has been influenced by Colombo’ by ‘inducing India to conform to its approach’ (p. 95). Taking an unbiased view, the author maintains that during the Eelam War IV (2006–2009), ‘President Rajapaksa invoked a greater military involvement on the part of India in order to get support in his government’s fight against the LTTE’ (p. 82).</p>
<p>Nepal’s case study reveals the use of, what the author described, ‘partially successful hegemonic strategy’ mainly because of the informal leadership provided in the rapprochement between SPA and CPN(M) making itself the dominant actor to influence Nepal’s internal affairs, while it was unable to avert the negative perceptions and resistance on part of the latter to its policies.</p>
<p>India’s foreign policy towards Bangladesh is summarised by the author as ‘failed hegemonic strategy’ since ‘India as a regional power had almost no leverage on this neighbouring country despite its overwhelmingly superiority in terms of material capabilities’, particularly in preventing problems of migration, insurgency and terrorism, and further ‘limit China’s influence on Bangladesh’ (p. 162).</p>
<p>In the last chapter, ‘South Asia: Lessons Learned’, the author provides a brief summary of the analyses of the three chapters devoted to the case studies. At the same time, the author attempts to relate the analysis to the theoretical underpinnings she both underlined and developed in the second chapter, particularly pertaining to the regional power strategies. Additionally, the author seeks to offer certain reflections on the lessons that can be learnt from the experience of South Asia, which could be valuable in understanding regional power. As she writes:
<disp-quote>
<p>…we see in the South Asian case…an impressively predominant regional power that is unable to convert its superior power capabilities into actual leverage over its smaller neighbours. (p. 168)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This book gives interesting insights into the different dimensions of the foreign policy and leadership of rising or emerging power, India. What makes her work distinct from the already existing literature is that she departs from the established scholarship in assessing India’s foreign policy from a major power and/or Pakistan-centric lens. Instead, she concentrates on the smaller neighbours of South Asia—Sri Lanka, Nepal and Bangladesh. The novelty of her book lies in tracing minute details of India’s relations with the smaller neighbours through a combination of research methodology encompassing theoretical framework, content analysis of speeches, statements and parliament proceedings combined with secondary literature and expert interviews. The author provides a balanced view of all three case studies vis-à-vis India. For instance, while India sought to exercise its power on Sri Lanka, on one hand, the latter, on the other, also sought to induce India in the ethnic conflagration to legitimise its military endeavour. Similarly, while characterising India’s policy towards Nepal as hegemonic, the author also acknowledges the role played by India in the peace process of the country.</p>
<p>The fact that India’s ‘leadership without followers’ on account of divergence in regional and global foreign policy goals could hamper her future rise is well captured in this book. As she maintains, ‘… the threat perceptions and resistance of small neighbouring states can contribute to keep a regional power entangled in its region, thereby hampering its rise to great-power status at the global level’ (p. 9). This is true to a large extent pertaining to India’s bid for a permanent seat at the UNSC which has been opposed by her neighbour on the western front, Pakistan, as part of ‘Coffee Club’ or ‘Uniting for consensus’ mainly because of resistance emanating from threat perception.</p>
<p>The book both reiterates and strengthens certain vital nuances of statecraft as well as real politics. The book under review reflects that domestic considerations impact on the foreign policy-making of different regional powers. The foreign policy analysis of a country can be understood in the two-level game offered by Robert Putnam (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0974928413489607">1988</xref>) wherein there is constant interaction between domestic and global level. In the regional analysis provided by the book under review, the author has highlighted the interaction of domestic politics in the foreign policy perspectives of India towards its neighbours and vice versa. For instance, in analysing Indo-Bangladesh ties, the author elucidates, ‘India-Bangladesh relations are a victim of Bangladeshi politics’ and ‘there are political parties that have a vested interest in continued tensions and lack of trust in India’ (p. 151). That foreign policies are determined by, what Putnam puts it, the nature and size of ‘win-sets’, meaning a set of agreements that will gain majority support of domestic constituencies, is also reflected through the analysis of the book. The author cited the influence of regional/state parties in Tamil Nadu which shared close affinity towards the Tamils in Sri Lanka on Indian foreign policy during various stages of ethnic conflict. For instance, while analysing India’s policy towards Sri Lankan ethnic issue, the author maintains:
<disp-quote>
<p>New Delhi’s sensitivity to the problems of Sri Lanka was boosted…by the state government of Tamil Nadu, which exerted considerable pressure on the central government to pay greater attention to human rights issues and to the suffering of the people in Sri Lanka. (p. 88)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Similarly, assessing approach of Bangladesh towards India, the author states that on the issues of transit, Bangladesh ‘refused to make any concessions to India due to strong resistance from various quarters at the domestic level’ (p. 154).</p>
<p>Overall, an interesting read, particularly the theoretical underpinnings the author has build upon the existing literature and applied at the regional analysis. While much discussion has taken place on India’s policy towards her neighbours and its impact on her future rise, the author kneads the well-known facts and events to provide an answer to such questions. The book offers valuable insights and novel perspectives on contemporary questions of power, leadership and foreign policy pursuit, and thereby sheds some light to approach, through an analytical framework, the question of distinguishing regional and global powers which remains largely deliberated in International scholarship. Having said that, the work needs to encompass a broader discussion of other regional powers, including Brazil and South Africa in order to draw more general understanding of regional powers based on the three concepts, and extend its relevance to other regions endowed with peculiar settings.</p>
