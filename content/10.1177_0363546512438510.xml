<p>The Ligament Augmentation Reconstruction System (LARS, Surgical Implants and Devices, Arc-sur-Tille, France) is a synthetic, nonabsorbable augmentation device made of polyethylene terephthalate (PET).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0363546512438510">1</xref></sup> It has rapidly gained popularity in Australia because of the lack of graft donor site morbidity and the perceived absence of risk permitting an earlier return to sporting activity. While autograft use in anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction has demonstrated excellent clinical results,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0363546512438510">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0363546512438510">13</xref></sup> little has been published to support the use of artificial ligaments. Poor patient outcomes associated with graft failure, tunnel osteolysis, foreign body synovitis, and premature arthritis are among the reasons that artificial ligaments were abandoned over 2 decades ago.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0363546512438510">12</xref></sup> We present a case report of disabling synovitis after LARS artificial ligament implantation that required revision at 1 year. This case is a cautionary note to the implantation of LARS ligaments into young and active patients. The patient provided consent for the use of case information in this publication.</p>
<sec id="section1-0363546512438510">
<title>Case Description</title>
<p>A 33-year-old defense services officer suffered a valgus hyperextension injury to his knee while standing in a military vehicle hit by an improvised explosive device during overseas deployment. Injuries sustained included complete ACL and medial collateral ligament (MCL) ruptures, a partial posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) injury, and a minor depression fracture of the lateral tibial plateau. The knee was splinted in an extension brace, and he was evacuated to Australia on day 10 after injury. At 6 weeks, the patient underwent ACL reconstruction using a LARS artificial ligament with simultaneous arthroscopically assisted elevation of his lateral tibial plateau and augmentation with injectable calcium phosphate cement. Postoperative management consisted of nonweightbearing on crutches in a hinged brace with a progressive increase in range of motion. The brace was removed at 8 weeks after surgery, and full weightbearing was allowed to commence at 9 weeks with an appropriate rehabilitation regimen. At 6 months, the patient reported continual aching and tightness of the knee associated with a large effusion. An arthroscopic procedure was performed that demonstrated widespread synovitis. No new treatment was commenced, and physical therapy was resumed. At 9 months, the patient presented for a second opinion. On examination, a large effusion was present, and both the MCL and PCL were stable; the ACL examination demonstrated increased excursion with a grade 2 Lachman test result as well as anterolateral rotatory instability. Revision ACL surgery was recommended.</p>

<title>Operative Findings 12 Months After Lars Reconstruction</title>
<p>At arthroscopy, a frank hemarthrosis was drained. Villous synovitis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0363546512438510">Figure 1</xref>) was evident in all compartments despite a grossly intact ACL graft (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0363546512438510">Figure 2</xref>). The reported synovial biopsy samples were taken from the suprapatellar pouch. The LARS device was incompletely enshrouded in fibrous tissue with visible fraying (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0363546512438510">Figure 2</xref>). A total synovectomy was performed. The intra-articular LARS prosthesis was excised to reveal the titanium femoral interference screw, which was removed. The femoral and tibial ends of the prosthesis were able to be removed en bloc (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0363546512438510">Figure 3</xref>). Bony ingrowth into the femoral and tibial graft ends was absent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0363546512438510">Figure 4</xref>). The size of the existing femoral and tibial apertures, which were packed with morselized corticocancellous allograft, precluded a single-stage revision. Presynovectomy magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0363546512438510">Figure 5</xref>) and postoperative radiographs with bone-grafted tunnels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0363546512438510">Figure 6</xref>) are shown.</p>

<title>Microbiological Analysis</title>
<p>Synovial aspirate and tissue cultures in aerobic and anaerobic media revealed no growth after prolonged incubation. There were 960 ×10<sup>9</sup> red blood cells seen in the synovial fluid, which precluded an accurate white blood cell count. No acid-fast bacilli or crystals were seen.</p>

<title>Histopathological Analysis</title>
<p>Macroscopically, the frank hemarthrosis and villous synovitis were suggestive of diffuse, pigmented villonodular synovitis. On light microscopy, marked hemosiderotic surface synoviocyte hypertrophy and hyperplasia were seen. Within the subsynovial fibroadipose tissue, a degree of expansion by mononuclear, multinucleated giant cells was seen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0363546512438510">Figure 7</xref>), resembling pigmented villonodular synovitis. Areas of fibroconnective tissue were noted to exhibit prominent mucoid degenerative change. There was no evidence of malignancy. Polarization light microscopy confirmed abundant, brightly polarizable foreign material present throughout, in association with a chronic mononuclear infiltrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0363546512438510">Figure 8</xref>). An acute inflammatory infiltrate, as would be expected in sepsis, was not seen. The findings were consistent with a hemosiderotic synovitis in a setting of a chronic inflammatory tissue reaction to a foreign material (LARS ligament).</p>

<title>Revision Acl Reconstruction</title>
<p>At 6 months after removal of the LARS graft and total synovectomy, the knee was pain free, demonstrated a full range of movement, and had no swelling. The second stage revision ACL reconstruction was performed with a hamstring tendon autograft. At arthroscopy, there was no effusion and a virtually normal synovium with minimal scar tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0363546512438510">Figure 9</xref>). The articular surfaces were generally softened with some minor chondromalacia in the lateral tibial plateau secondary to the prior fracture. The bone graft had healed, leaving a cortical layer at the intercondylar notch. The graft was isometrically placed and securely fixed with cannulated interference fit screws. The procedure was technically satisfactory. At the time of this publication, the patient was progressing satisfactorily at 2 weeks postoperatively.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Artificial ligaments for reconstruction of the ACL were introduced in the 1970s. By the early 1990s, however, problems associated with premature rupture, wear debris–related synovitis, tunnel osteolysis, and osteoarthritis were evident.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0363546512438510">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0363546512438510">14</xref></sup> These uniformly poor clinical outcomes led to the withdrawal of many artificial ligaments from the market by 1994.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0363546512438510">6</xref></sup> The Leeds-Keio ligament, made of PET like the LARS ligament, has been used in over 50,000 cases worldwide.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0363546512438510">6</xref></sup> Although early results were very encouraging with failure rates of less than 10% at 3 years,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0363546512438510">2</xref></sup> increasing instability became apparent over time, with over 50% of Leeds-Keio–reconstructed knees at 10- to 16-year follow-up having increased laxity and 100% having developed osteoarthritis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0363546512438510">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>The current resurgence in artificial ligament use in Australia may be related to a new generation of surgeons who have not shared previous experiences with such devices as well as to a marketing push without new clinical evidence. Theoretical benefits over autograft use are highlighted, asserting early strength at implantation, lack of harvest site morbidity with a technically easier surgical technique, and potentially faster patient rehabilitation. While early experience with all artificial ligaments showed they were successful in restoring knee stability in the short term, they were subject to fatigue failure like all synthetic materials, and with time, all ultimately failed. This process is accelerated in poorly positioned ligaments.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0363546512438510">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0363546512438510">15</xref></sup> The tunnel positioning in this case was unlikely to be the reason for the early fatigue. It did appear as though a transtibial technique for femoral tunnel drilling had been utilized. The tibial tunnel was in a satisfactory position, and although the femoral tunnel was slightly anterior (being approximately 70% of the way along the Blumensaat line), there was no obvious impingement seen from the remaining fibers that would suggest a cause for early failure.</p>
<p>An 18- to 21-year follow-up of ACLs reconstructed with synthetic ligaments showed only 25% of patients considered their knee normal, with 75% displaying laxity on side-to-side assessment and alarmingly 100% of patients demonstrating signs of osteoarthritis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0363546512438510">14</xref></sup> This contrasts with recent outcomes using hamstring tendon autografts, with 88% of 114 patients assessed at 15 years maintaining a good or excellent Lysholm knee score, with Lachman and pivot-shift grades of 0 in 75% and 86% of patients, respectively.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0363546512438510">4</xref></sup> This same series reported International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) radiographic grade A or B in 89% of patients. The mechanism for osteoarthritis associated with artificial ligament use has been studied. Artificial ligaments form insoluble wear particles that incite an inflammatory reaction, ultimately initiating a failure of chondrocyte integrity leading to osteoarthritis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0363546512438510">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>The LARS ligament claims advanced design and manufacture compared with previous generations of artificial ligaments.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0363546512438510">1</xref></sup> Parallel fibers pretwisted in a side-specific manner mimic native ACL ultrastructure, while a refined cleaning process removes irritant residues associated with the manufacturing process. Improved weave design together with recommended placement through the native ACL is intended to encourage fibrovascular ingrowth around individual fibers and hence to prevent the articular release of wear particles. Unfortunately, most cases of ACL rupture do not leave sufficient intact tissue to completely enshroud the artificial ligament. While coverage may theoretically prevent wear particles from entering the joint, the native ligament remains stress shielded by the nonabsorbable LARS graft, and when it does fail, the stress-shielded tissue will also fail, resulting in laxity and exposure of the joint to PET wear debris.</p>
<p>The absence of peer-reviewed medium- and long-term outcome data has not hampered enthusiastic use of the LARS ligament in Australia, with considerable press following the use in high-profile athletes only bolstering its image in the public eye, leading to greater demand from patients. To date, published literature on the LARS ligament has focused on perceived advantages including return of functional knee stability, reduced rehabilitation time, and faster return to preinjury sport, while claiming complication rates comparable with autogenous graft procedures.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0363546512438510">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0363546512438510">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0363546512438510">10</xref></sup> A recent multicenter retrospective study followed up 159 patients who underwent LARS ACL reconstruction for a mean of 50 months.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0363546512438510">3</xref></sup> Reported morbidity was 5.9% overall, with only 3 cases of graft failure after trauma. One case of synovitis was reported after graft rupture, and it was suggested that synovitis was not associated with intact LARS ligaments; however, little clinical case detail was provided.</p>
<p>This current case highlights that despite adherence to the recommended LARS surgical implantation technique with preservation of the native ACL stump, and in the absence of a LARS rupture and proven absence of infection, disabling synovitis can still occur. The morbidity associated with LARS synovitis can prevent a return to occupational or recreational activities, with worsening symptoms ultimately necessitating revision ACL surgery. Of perhaps the greatest concern is the presence of associated focal degenerate change seen in the subsynovial layer on histological analysis, heralding the initiation of an arthritic process resulting from the foreign body synovitis. This complication, although not published to date for the newly improved LARS ligament until now, was well recognized with previous generations of artificial ligaments and led to their discontinuation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0363546512438510">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0363546512438510">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0363546512438510">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>This 2-staged revision technique allowed for a healing response of the synovium. At the second stage procedure, there was no effusion, the synovium had healed, and the bone grafts had successfully integrated into the previous defects, allowing new tunnels to be drilled and secure fixation achieved.</p>
<p>Although it would be unwise to draw too firm a conclusion from one case, we assert that the further use of the LARS device, like its artificial graft predecessors, should be with great caution. We encourage surgeons to be alert to these potential problems and to investigate and report further cases like this one if they should arise.</p>
