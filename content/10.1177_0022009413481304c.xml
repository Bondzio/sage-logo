<p>The two studies by Olivia Muñoz-Rojas and Dacia Viejo-Rose explore reconstruction following the Spanish Civil War from two related perspectives. One offers a viewpoint on the urban landscape and the other on what is called ‘cultural heritage’, though the term is not really defined. The latter is associated here with ‘memory’, confirming at least that the term ‘reconstruction’ encompasses multiple themes, including representation of the past. Viejo-Rose in <italic>Reconstructing Spain</italic> takes as a case study the market town of Gernika – its Basque name used by the author in part to distinguish it from <italic>Guernica</italic>, Picasso’s iconic depiction of the infamous fire-bombing of the town by rebel forces in April 1937. Gernika (the town) would be ‘adopted’ by Franco and the regime after the war and, as in many other places (102 by 1940), its rebuilding would be controlled by the state; architecturally, the emphasis would be on Castilian folkloricism. In <italic>Ashes and Granite</italic>, Muñoz-Rojas examines rather different processes of reconstruction: the renovation of war-damaged Madrid, Bilbao and Barcelona. Both understand reconstruction as more than rebuilding the material fabric and infrastructure destroyed in the conflict. They are, in effect, studies of symbolic landscapes which, in the aftermath of armed civil conflict, confer meaning according to the postwar process of moral, material and political restructuring. This reading is reinforced by many of the well-chosen photographs and maps which accompany the texts.</p>
<p>Viejo-Rose provides an introductory chapter which makes a case for the role of ‘cultural heritage’ in post-conflict reconciliation, arguing that a key outcome of civil war (especially in cases where no negotiated settlement is permitted) is often the cultural ‘disinheritance’ of the defeated. Material sites of suffering and sacrifice thereby become ‘places of forgetting’ for those who are vanquished. Control by the victors of cultural heritage thus prolongs the violence and prevents social integration and state legitimacy. This is certainly a case that can be powerfully made in relation to Gernika and, through a publicly expressed collective sense of national and religious identity, to the Basque Country more generally. The appropriation of ‘Basqueness’ by the central state left a legacy of problems only imperfectly resolved by the post-Franco political settlement after 1975. The chapters on Gernika are the most enlightening, but the picture was not uniform throughout Spain. Although it is useful to be reminded that the dictatorship strictly controlled which monuments and buildings were erected – and, of course, what could be commemorated – the repressive process (side-by-side with state paternalism) did not have the same effects throughout national territory, as the cases of El Valle de los Caídos (Franco’s own and largely ignored pantheon of ‘the Crusade’), the anachronistic Alcázar of Toledo, and the ruins of the town of Belchite (Aragón) confirm. The book’s structure, which leaps from the Civil War and its immediate aftermath to the surge in war-related calls for justice in the late 1990s and beyond, reinforces the vision, however, of cultural authoritarianism and rigid control of memory. But cultural heritage was shaped in complex ways by political power and aspects of culture beyond the material, and these evolved over time after 1939. The style of Philip II’s El Escorial was the architectural paradigm of the 1940s and 1950s, symbolizing the permanence of Francoist power and described by one Falangist intellectual as ‘a Magna Carta in stone’. The monopoly of cultural heritage by the Franco regime depended, therefore, on the theory and practice of the postwar nation- and state-building project. Nationalist politics and the doctrine of Spanish identity interacted with mass migration and cultural sentiments (in, for example, social memory and mentalities), but all of these remain somewhat elusive in these two accounts. The emphasis here is less on culture, in fact, than on the cultural policies of Francoism. The meaning implied by architectural projects and urban planning was not necessarily the same as the meaning derived from them by citizens, a variation itself only partly determined by regional identity.</p>
<p>Chronologically, <italic>Ashes and Granite</italic> is the more limited in its aims: to assess the penetration of the new postwar aesthetic and moral order based on a replaying of Hapsburg imperialism, as implanted through urban reconstruction and planning in the 1940s. The chapter on Madrid explores in interesting fashion the treatment and symbolism of the Montaña Barracks, which had been largely destroyed by political militias (the ‘Red horde’, in Francoist mythology) in putting down the military rebellion against the Popular Front government in 1936. The limits of Franco’s totalitarianism – and the hollowness of his regime’s critique of the ‘anarchy’ of liberal planning – are illustrated in the gradual withering of 1939 plans to construct a grandiose Falangist party headquarters (‘Casa del Partido’) on the site when faced with a lack of resources and of political will to give free rein to the Falange or to confront the power of property speculators. The ruined site would be left undeveloped until becoming a memorial park in 1968. Elsewhere, as in Bilbao, symbolism was easier to marry with functionality, as the reconstruction of eight bridges – destroyed by the Republican military as it withdrew in 1937 – permitted traversal of the Nervión River which runs through the city. Wartime ‘barbarism’ (not least, that of Basque ‘separatists’) could thus be transcended as daily normality was regained in the name of ‘Spanishness’. The situation in Barcelona was closer to that of Madrid, with partially realized plans to ease the circulation of traffic and ‘sanitize’ the old city being based on the pre-war designs of Republican governments, though a Hispanic nationalist discourse would be constructed in the process of uncovering part of the ancient Roman city wall as work went on. Reconstruction was thus political and cultural as well as material and interacted with postwar change. The false starts and wrong-turns made under the Franco regime meant that processes of re-building (or, at least, modernization) were still pending even in the early 1970s. But is it really true to argue, as Dacia Viejo-Rose does, that some elements of post-Civil War reconstruction were still ongoing in 2008? The notion that the surge in war-related memory in Spain since 2000 represents the return of unresolved issues which have festered since Franco’s death forgets Basque grievances before 1975, and neglects analysis of the 1980s and 1990s and of the current global culture of memory into which Picasso’s inevitably symbolic work can be readily fitted. That the bombing of Gernika became a singularly symbolic event with universal resonance is a point still made, perhaps regretfully (as she notes), by some of the residents of the town themselves.</p>
