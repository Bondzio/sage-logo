<p>Turkey’s possible European Union accession has triggered an intense and unprecedented debate concerning the formation of European identity as well as European values. This debate is most recognizable in France, a country which is representative of Europe and European civilization and which is among those EU members where public opinion is constantly hostile toward Turkey’s EU membership. Within the framework of the constructivist approach in international relations theory, Tekin, in this book, investigates what topics, discursive strategies and linguistic devices are used in French political discourse to construct Turkey in regard to its possible accession to the EU. It pays special attention to how French discourse constructs European identity in relation to Turkey’s EU accession and how ‘othering’ is used as a discursive strategy in that construction. In terms of methodology, the book draws heavily on the Viennese School of Critical Discourse Analysis (CDA), that is, the Discourse Historical Approach (DHA). This approach ‘goes beyond textual analysis, paying particular attention to the historical setting of discourse, and introducing a socio-cognitive level’ (p. 17). In line with this approach, apart from an introduction, the volume is organized into two parts, focusing on the socio-historical contextual level and the discourse level respectively.</p>
<p>In the introduction, the author introduces the background and motivation of the study, the theoretical framework and method, the nature and source of the data, and finally the organization of the whole book.</p>
<p>Part I, ‘The socio-historical context’, consists of two chapters. The first, entitled ‘The makings of the historical image of the Turk: Metaphors, stereotypes, and memories occupying the French collective imaginary’, is devoted to the historical development of the representations and images of Turks and Turkey in France, that is, the evolution of otherness in the French collective memory. The aim of this chapter is to ‘examine the rich historical heritage of the discourse that still echoes in today’s French debates on Turkey’s EU membership’ (p. 26). With this aim, the author scrutinizes representative and primary historical texts from different historical periods and of various genres. In Chapter 2, ‘Contextualizing French attitudes towards Turkey’s possible EU membership’, the author offers a multiple-factor contextual analysis of the French conception of Turkey’s EU candidacy, pointing out that this conception is intertwined with the relationship between France and Europe. Therefore, this chapter presents an historical review of the complex relations between France and European construction and integration. It then also provides a diachronic discussion of French ambiguous and, in some sense, changeable attitudes toward Turkey’s European aspirations. Finally, some aspects of French politics and society and their influence on French attitudes to Turkey’s adhesion to the EU are also touched upon in this chapter.</p>
<p>Part II, ‘The discourse analysis’, also contains two chapters. Based on the first level of DHA, Chapter 3, ‘Analyzing manifest discourse: A critical content analysis of the French debate on Turkey’s EU membership’, concentrates on semantic macrostructures, aiming to ‘discover what speakers are talking about and to identify which themes and arguments are employed by the French political discourse’ (p. 111). The author divides the issues into essentialist arguments which highlight the essential differences between Turkey and Europe, and functionalist arguments concerning Turkey’s state of preparedness. The former argument relates to geographical location, culture, history and religion, while the latter is concerned with issues such as the army, women’s rights, the economy, demography and geo-strategies. Chapter 4, ‘Representations and othering in discourse’, presents a more refined analysis by drawing on more explicit linguistic tools. Specifically, in analysing French political discourse on Turkey, this chapter demonstrates a variety of discursive strategies (e.g. referential, predication, argumentation, perspectivation, intensification and mitigation), and how these strategies are realized linguistically, that is, their linguistic and rhetorical characteristics, the use of specific metaphors, and lexicalizations, etc.</p>
<p>Although focusing on the identities of France, Turkey and Europe, the book sheds light on identity studies in general, and the Self–Other nexus in particular, which, as a key research issue in International Relations, ‘remains predominantly theoretical with very little empirical work on the role identity plays in international relations’ (p. 4). So, besides the primary historical texts analysed in Part I, the author in this book employs diversified empirical materials, ranging from discourse by French politicians and scholars, and media reports of this discourse, to newspaper articles, editorials, commentaries, parliamentary discussions and semi-structured interviews. By applying DHA to concrete discourse, the book opens up a new perspective and applies a refined and systematic framework to the phenomenon at hand. On the other hand, the author also makes theoretical and methodological contributions. For example, in his analysis (in Chapter 4), the author incorporates additional discursive strategies (argumentative fallacies and counterfactuals) into the list of DHA by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0957926513476603">Wodak (2001)</xref>, in order to ‘add to the power of the analysis’ (p. 154). Another strength of the book is its attempt to justify the multidisciplinary theoretical advantage of CDA. For instance, in addition to the historical, political, sociological and psychological dimensions involved in the analysis, the author also draws on Conceptual Metaphor Theory from cognitive linguistics when presenting the rhetorical analysis.</p>
<p>Throughout the whole book, the analysis and conclusions are objective and well-balanced. As mentioned above, most of the discussions or conclusions are based either on primary historical texts (see the socio-historical contextual analysis in Part I) or on naturally-occurring talks or texts collected from various sources using different methods. Moreover, in the content analysis of the French debate on Turkey’s EU membership, both the supporting and oppositional discourses are examined to illustrate various issues. The book will be of great interest to researchers in the field of discourse analysis, international relations, history and sociology.</p>
