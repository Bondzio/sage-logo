<p>Dear Sir,</p>
<p>A 12-year-old boy presented with a restriction in left elbow flexion. He had difficulties in sporting activities and washing his hair. There was no history of injury. He had been diagnosed with a left congenital proximal radioulnar synostosis at the age of 2 years, without any other abnormalities. He had no pain of the left elbow and active motion was from 5–95°. The forearm was fixed in a position of 30° pronation position with 25° of cubitus valgus.</p>
<p>Radiographs showed an anterior displacement of the radial head and a unilateral synostosis of the proximal aspects of the radius and ulna that could be classified as a type IV synostosis according to the system of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1753193412440541">Cleary and Omer (1985)</xref>. Three-dimensional (3D) CT reconstruction scans showed the radial head to be about 15 mm longer than the tip of the coronoid process of the ulna (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1753193412440541">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

<p>Surgery was carried out through an anterior approach under general anaesthesia. About 15 mm of the radial head was excised. The excised radial head had a small dimple, a bluish contusion and cartilage denudation on the articular surface. There was no enlarged soft tissue that could cause impingement within the range of motion. The joint capsule was securely closed. After resection, the elbow could be flexed fully without any impingement. Postoperatively the elbow was immobilized for 3 days followed by a range of motion exercises. Six months later there was full flexion of the elbow and no tenderness around the joint (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1753193412440541">Figure 2</xref>).</p>

<p>Most patients with congenital radioulnar synostosis have a fixed position of the forearm ranging from neutral rotation to maximum pronation. Although the extent of clinical disability is variable, many patients are asymptomatic and do not have any perception of a handicap, with the exception of those who have a bilateral involvement or a severe degree of fixed pronation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1753193412440541">Cleary and Omer, 1985</xref>). Generally speaking, patients with congenital radioulnar synostosis do not have problems with elbow flexion and extension, although some authors have reported that an acute flexion contracture of the elbow can develop after forced hyperflexion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1753193412440541">Masuko et al., 2004</xref>). Limitation of elbow flexion causes considerable difficulty in activities of daily living as more than 130° of flexion are required for everyday tasks.</p>
<p>In this case, the limitation of elbow flexion and associated difficulties were unusual findings in congenital radioulnar synostosis. The cause of the limitation was diagnosed by physical examination and a lateral radiograph of the elbow in a position of maximum flexion. The problems were alleviated by removal of the radial head, which had the abnormal features noted above. Although the shape of the radial head can be deformed in congenital radioulnar synostosis, in this case recurrent impingement appeared to contribute to the deformation and damage to the articular cartilage of the radial head. No enlargement of soft tissue was visible at operation, especially the annular ligament-like structure that is known to contribute to the acute elbow flexion contracture after forced hyperflexion in congenital radioulnar synostosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1753193412440541">Masuko et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1753193412440541">Wang et al., 2010</xref>). This tissue is often difficult to distinguish from the joint capsule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1753193412440541">Wang et al., 2010</xref>). We did not attempt to find it because the problems of both limitation of elbow flexion and flexion contracture could be resolved by simple excision of the radial head.</p>
<p>Serial review of the patient’s previous radiographs indicated that the proximal end of the radius and ulna had united slowly over time and the synostosis lesion has grown three-dimensionally in the proximal, anterior and radial directions. These findings are compatible with other reports in relation to the Cleary and Omer type IV synostosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1753193412440541">Cleary and Omer, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1753193412440541">Hung, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1753193412440541">Masuko et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1753193412440541">Wang et al., 2010</xref>). These bony deformations make the radial head liable to impinge with the distal humerus by shortening the distance and reducing the rotational angle between the two bony structures.</p>
<p>When limitation of flexion and radial head impingement develop in a patient who has a Cleary and Omer type IV congenital radioulnar synostosis, surgical excision of the radial head may be helpful in increasing the range of motion.</p>
