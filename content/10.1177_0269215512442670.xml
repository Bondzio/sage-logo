<title>Introduction</title>
<p>There are several methods to measure internal mood states, but most of them rely on verbal communication.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0269215512442670">1</xref></sup> Clinical interviews or self-completed questionnaires may not be suitable for use with people with language and other cognitive deficits.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0269215512442670">2</xref></sup> Some authors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0269215512442670">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0269215512442670">3</xref></sup> have suggested the use of non-verbal, picture-based measures. Visual analogue scales (VAS) have been used to measure a variety of health outcomes in social and behavioural research and have been described as simple and quick to administer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0269215512442670">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0269215512442670">5</xref></sup> and as efficient as other more complex, time-consuming mood self-rating or observer rating scales.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0269215512442670">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0269215512442670">7</xref></sup> However, stroke patients have been found to have difficulty using these scales.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0269215512442670">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0269215512442670">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>A typical visual analogue scale consists of a straight line, usually 100 mm long, with labelled, sometimes bipolar endpoints, such as ‘depressed’ and ‘not at all depressed’.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0269215512442670">6</xref></sup> Individuals are asked to place a single mark along the line to reflect their current mood state. Instructions are given either by gesture or verbal expression, but both methods may be used depending on the patients’ abilities to understand the task and provide meaningful responses.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0269215512442670">10</xref></sup> The Visual Analog Mood Scales (VAMS)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0269215512442670">11</xref></sup> consist of eight simple cartoon faces and their verbal descriptors, which assess a range of mood states. Each cartoon face depicting a mood state is placed at the bottom of a vertical 100 mm line with a neutral face placed at the top of the line. This means that on both negative mood items, afraid, confused, sad, angry, tired and tense, and positive mood items, happy and energetic, the neutral face is always at the top. Each unipolar mood scale is presented on a separate page and for each the respondent is required to make a single mark on the vertical line to indicate the extent to which each mood state represents their feelings at the time of the assessment.</p>
<p>The scales are presented in a vertical orientation to overcome invalid responses due to hemianopia and inattention.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0269215512442670">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0269215512442670">12</xref></sup> The VAMS was designed for use with people with communication disorders by using schematic faces and single words to represent a range of mood states.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0269215512442670">10</xref></sup> It has been standardised in young and older adult samples, psychiatric patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0269215512442670">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0269215512442670">11</xref></sup> patients with dementia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0269215512442670">13</xref></sup> and neurological patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0269215512442670">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0269215512442670"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0269215512442670">16</xref></sup></p>
<p>For clinical purposes each item is considered on its own. However for research purposes a total score has been calculated as a measure of overall mood. The VAMS has been shown to correlate highly with other standardized depression scales in stroke patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0269215512442670">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0269215512442670">16</xref></sup> Bennett et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0269215512442670">16</xref></sup> assessed 79 stroke patients on the VAMS and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and found that the two measures were significantly correlated. They also examined the internal consistency of the VAMS in healthy older adults and stroke participants. The internal consistency of the VAMS in healthy elderly was low (α = 0.45), however, when the items happy and energetic were removed it was much higher (α = 0.73). In stroke patients the internal consistency was 0.71, and when the happy and energetic items were removed, the internal consistency increased to 0.81. It was noted that participants in both groups failed to notice that the polarity of the scales was sometimes reversed (i.e. the neutral face is at the top both for positive and negative mood items). Therefore, it may be possible to improve the internal consistency by placing positive mood states at the top and negative mood states at the bottom of the line. This was carried out in order to create a revised version of the VAMS, the VAMS-R, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0269215512442670">Figure 1</xref>.</p>

<p>The aims of the study were to evaluate the internal consistency, validity and factor structure of the revised version of the VAMS (VAMS-R) in a sample of healthy older adults and a sample of aphasic stroke patients.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0269215512442670" sec-type="methods">
<title>Method</title>
<p>Healthy older adults were recruited between October 2004 and June 2005. They were identified from people attending day centres and local community groups and invited to take part in the study. Participants were included if they were over 55 years old and able to give informed consent. They were excluded if they had previously suffered a stroke or they had other physical or mental disability, were blind or deaf, were not able to speak English or had any other communication difficulties.</p>
<p>Participants were assessed using a self-administered postal questionnaire, which included the Hospital and Anxiety Depression Scale (HADS).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0269215512442670">17</xref></sup> An extended modified version of the VAMS-R was also included. This comprised six of the original items of the VAMS (afraid, confused, sad, angry, tired and tense) and in addition the items happy and energetic with the scale reversed, so that ‘neutral’ was at the bottom of the page. This is illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0269215512442670">Figure 1</xref>. Four items of the VAMS-R (sad, happy, energetic and tired) were also included without the verbal labels to evaluate the validity of these items without the associated verbal descriptors. This was an attempt to estimate how a language-impaired individual would experience the VAMS-R by relying only on the presentation of cartoon faces.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0269215512442670">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0269215512442670">12</xref></sup> Each item was scored on a scale of 0–100 with high scores indicating low mood. Participants’ gender and age were also recorded. They were asked to complete the questionnaires in their own time and return them using a pre-paid return envelope.</p>
<p>Aphasic stroke patients were recruited between July 2005 and July 2007. They were assessed as part of the screening procedure for recruitment to the pilot study of a randomized controlled trial of behavioural treatment for depressed aphasic patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0269215512442670">18</xref></sup> Aphasic patients were identified on hospital wards and in the community and invited to take part in the study. In addition, speech and language therapists were invited to refer aphasic patients to the study. Participants were included if they had been diagnosed with a stroke as documented in their medical notes, had been diagnosed with aphasia by a speech and language therapist, were at least four weeks after their stroke, were conscious, alert and well enough to be approached for consent. Participants were excluded if they were blind or deaf, had a documented history of dementia in their medical notes, had a documented history of depressive disorder or other psychiatric disorder in the five years preceding their stroke, were unable to understand English prior to their stroke or lived more than 40 miles from the recruiting centre.</p>
<p>Participants were assessed during an interview with a researcher on the Sheffield Screening Test for Acquired Language Disorders<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0269215512442670">19</xref></sup> to document their language ability. Mood was assessed on the VAMS-R and the Visual Analogue Self Esteem Scale,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0269215512442670">20</xref></sup> and a nurse, carer or relative was asked to complete the Stroke Aphasic Depression Questionnaire (SADQH-21)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0269215512442670">21</xref></sup> about the participant. The level of disability was recorded using the Barthel Index.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0269215512442670">22</xref></sup></p>
<p>The study was granted ethical approval by the Nottingham University School of Psychology Ethics Committee for healthy participants and Nottingham Research Ethics Committee 1 for aphasic participants. Informed consent was obtained from all participants who were able to give consent or assent was obtained from a relative.</p>
<p>Data were analysed using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 19 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Internal consistency was assessed using Cronbach’s alpha. With scales with less than 10 items, such as the VAMS-R, it is common to find low alpha values, therefore item-total correlations were also considered. Item-total correlations greater than 0.3 indicate that each item is measuring something similar to the scale as a whole.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0269215512442670">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0269215512442670">24</xref></sup> The convergent validity of the VAMS-R was assessed by examining the relationship between the VAMS-R and scores on the HADS Anxiety and Depression subscales, and HADS total in healthy adults and between the VAMS-R and SADQH-21 in aphasic stroke patients. Exploratory Factor Analysis was conducted to assess the number of factors underlying the eight items which were designed to assess positive and negative mood states. It is recommended that if communalities are equal or higher than 0.6 then samples less than 100 may be adequate when performing a factor analysis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0269215512442670">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0269215512442670">26</xref></sup> The Kaiser–Meyer–Olkin Measure of sampling adequacy was checked to determine whether it was greater than 0.5 and the Bartlett test of sphericity was checked to determine whether it was non-significant. Factors were extracted with Eigen values greater than 1 and the scree plot was examined to confirm the appropriate number of factors. The loadings were checked to determine whether they were greater than 0.4 and the differences in any cross-loadings were <italic>&lt;</italic>0.2.</p>

<p>There were 166 aphasic patients who were considered for inclusion in the study. Of these, 20 (12%) did not meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria, 14 (8%) were discharged or died before being approached, 60 (36%) refused consent, one withdrew consent and 71 (44%) were included. Of those included, 24 (34%) were recruited from hospitals and 47 (66%) from community settings.</p>
<p>Of the 71 aphasic stroke patients recruited, 38 (54%) were men. The mean age was 69 years (SD 12.33, range 34–91). The median time post stroke was seven months (interquartile range 2–20). There were 37 (52%) living with a partner or spouse, 21 (28%) living on their own and 14 (20%) with relatives or professional carers. There were 55 (77%) with left hemisphere lesions, 13 (18%) right hemisphere lesions and in 3 (4%) patients the location of lesion was unknown. There were 21 participants for whom the assent form was completed, 31 gave consent and for 19 both were obtained.

<title>Internal consistency</title>
<p>The VAMS-R was tested as a scale with multiple items that could be used as a measure of mood. Cronbach’s alpha (α) coefficient was calculated. The internal consistency of the VAMS-R in healthy adults was high (α = 0.74). Item-total correlations ranged between 0.26 and 0.58. Correlations were lower for items angry (0.25), happy (0.30) and energetic (0.29). Cronbach’s alpha value did not increase above 0.74 when any of these items was deleted. In aphasic stroke patients the internal consistency was 0.80. Item-total correlations ranged between 0.32 (energetic) and 0.63 (tired). Cronbach’s alpha value did not increase above 0.80 when any of these items was deleted.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-0269215512442670">
<title>Convergent and discriminant validity</title>
<p>In healthy adults, the VAMS-R total was moderately correlated with all HADS scores (HADS Anxiety <italic>r</italic><sub>s</sub> = 0.59, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001, HADS Depression <italic>r</italic><sub>s</sub> = 0.49, <italic>p</italic> = 0.001, HADS Total <italic>r</italic><sub>s</sub> = 0.62, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001). The effect of written labelling of items was investigated by examining the correlation between the same items with and without labels. All correlations were significant (energetic <italic>r</italic><sub>s</sub> = 0.51, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001, tired <italic>r</italic><sub>s</sub> = 0.26, <italic>p</italic> = 0.04, happy <italic>r</italic><sub>s</sub> = 0.64, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001, sad <italic>r</italic><sub>s</sub> = 0.78, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001).</p>
<p>In aphasic stroke patients the VAMS-R was significantly correlated with the VASES (<italic>r</italic>
<sub>s</sub> = −0.69, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001) and moderately correlated with the SADQH-21 (<italic>r</italic><sub>s</sub> = 0.43, <italic>p</italic> = 0.001). This provides some support for the convergent validity of the scale. Correlations between VAMS-R and age (<italic>r</italic>
<sub>s</sub> = 0.05, <italic>p</italic> = 0 .71), Barthel (<italic>r</italic><sub>s</sub> = 0.10, <italic>p</italic> = 0.41) and Sheffield Screening Test for Acquired Language Disorders (<italic>r</italic><sub>s</sub> = −0.08, <italic>p</italic> = 0.55) were all non-significant (<italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.05), indicating discriminant validity of the scale.</p>

<title>Factor structure</title>
<p>In healthy adults, prior to extraction all communalities were equal to 1 and after extraction all communalities were greater than 0.6 (0.61–0.83). In aphasic stroke patients, prior to extraction all communalities were equal to 1 and after extraction all communalities were 0.57–0.81. There was one value below 0.60 (confused 0.57). The Kaiser–Meyer–Olkin test of sampling adequacy for the item-total correlations was 0.70 for healthy participants and 0.71 for participants with aphasia, which is considered to be good.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0269215512442670">24</xref></sup> The Bartlett test of sphericity was significant (χ<sup>2</sup> = 138.6, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001 in healthy adults and χ<sup>2</sup> = 157.1, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001 in aphasic patients), indicating that the method of factor analysis was appropriate.</p>
<p>In healthy adults three factors were identified (Eigenvalues 3.25, 1.58, 1.01), accounting for 73% of the variance. This factor model solution was also confirmed by the application of a scree plot. The factor model was considered further using an orthogonal rotation (varimax).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Each item of the original VAMS has been used as a single mood measure, but previous findings have suggested that a single-item visual analogue scale can only moderately predict the classification of mood disorders.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0269215512442670">6</xref></sup> The eight-item revised version was explored as an overall measure of mood problems. The findings suggested that the VAMS-R can be used as a multi-item measure of mood. The VAMS-R was shown to have high internal consistency in both healthy participants and aphasic stroke patients, with Cronbach’s alpha indicating that the items were homogeneous and measured something similar and that all items should be retained. The internal consistency of the VAMS-R was higher than the original version and comparable to the value reported by Bennett et al.,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0269215512442670">16</xref></sup> in which the items energetic and happy were removed. The VAMS-R was also shown to have acceptable convergent validity as it correlated moderately significantly with the total and subscale scores of the HADS in healthy participants and with the VASES and SADQH-21 in aphasic stroke patients.</p>
<p>The items with and without the verbal labels produced similar scores, apart from the item tired, which is consistent with previous studies with healthy young and elderly people,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0269215512442670">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0269215512442670">11</xref></sup> indicating that the faces themselves can be descriptive of the mood states. However the low correlation for the tired item suggests that this picture does not convey the mood state well on its own.</p>
<p>The VAMS-R showed a three-factor structure in both healthy participants and aphasic stroke patients. There was a general negative mood state factor in both groups, which accounted for over half the variance in the scores. In addition, in both groups there was a factor that reflected energy levels as determined by the items energetic and tired (factor 2 in healthy participants, factor 3 in aphasic stroke patients). There was another factor reflecting happiness, which was loaded only by happiness in healthy participants, but by both the happy and sad items in aphasic stroke patients. These factors show some similarity with those reported by Nyenhuis et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0269215512442670">12</xref></sup> in healthy adults, apart from the factor related to happiness, which did not emerge. Cross-loading of the item afraid occurred in healthy adults, suggesting it may need to be removed, but as this did not occur in aphasic patients, in whom the scale would be used clinically, this was not carried out.</p>
<p>These findings offer some support for the validity of the VAMS-R as a measure of mood that is suitable for patients with communication problems. The results confirmed that the format of the positive mood items in the original VAMS was problematic and the revised format of the positive items improved the internal consistency of the scale. Price et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0269215512442670">8</xref></sup> suggested that stroke patients have some difficulty using visual analogue scales, and the revised format may reduce this problem. The correlations between the mood measures were moderate but not high. This is likely to reflect that the VAMS-R covers a range of mood states and the relationship was examined with scales designed to assess anxiety, depression and self-esteem. There are no questionnaire measures which assess exactly the same mood states as assessed by the VAMS. Therefore, the validation questionnaires were chosen as being appropriate comparable measures. Overall, the results support the VAMS-R as a simple and short measure of mood states.</p>
<p>However, there are limitations to the study. The applicability of the verbal labels was only assessed on four items, in order to minimize the length of time required to complete the questionnaire. The data on healthy participants were collected from a non-clinical, community sample and very few participants had low scores on either of the measures, indicating mood problems were relatively infrequent. The sources of recruitment were opportunistic, such as day centres and community groups, and therefore the sample may not be truly representative of a healthy elderly population. Although an attempt was made to assess all aphasic patients, both from hospitals and the community, therapists were aware that participants were being screened for a trial of treatment of mood disorders and therefore may have been biased towards referring those with low mood. In addition they may have not referred those with very severe communication problems, believing them to be unsuitable for the treatment trial. There were six patients who were unable to complete the VASES and five unable to complete the VAMS-R, so the sample does not include people with very severe communication problems. This aphasic sample may therefore be more representative of aphasic patients with moderate aphasia and low mood than of all aphasic stroke patients.</p>
<p>Based on these findings, the VAMS-R has advantages over the original VAMS. It is simple and quick to administer, is cognitively undemanding and may be appropriate for those who do not speak or understand English. However, the test–retest reliability of the VAMS-R needs to be checked in people with communication problems.</p>
