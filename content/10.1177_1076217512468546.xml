<title>21st Century Workplace Skills</title>
<p>The National Academies of Science have defined what researchers, educators, and policymakers mean by deeper learning and 21st century competencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1076217512468546">Pellegrino et al., 2012</xref>). With deeper learning, students develop expertise in a particular domain or subject area and can take what was learned in one situation and apply it to new situations. Using the process of deeper learning, students develop 21st century competencies. The researchers used the broader term <italic>competencies</italic> rather than <italic>skills</italic> to include both knowledge and skills. The knowledge and skills generally fall into three categories: cognitive, interpersonal, and intrapersonal. Knowledge and skills that fall within the cognitive domain include critical thinking, reasoning, and related skills; those within the interpersonal domain include expressing information to others, interpreting others’ messages, and responding appropriately; and those within the intrapersonal domain include self-management. Although research on 21st century competencies is limited, emerging evidence suggests that cognitive, intrapersonal, and interpersonal knowledge and skills can be taught in ways that encourage transfer. Transfer is supported when instruction is organized around general principles and teachers instruct students about how, when, and why to apply this knowledge. Research-based teaching methods include using multiple and varied representations of concepts and tasks; encouraging elaboration, questioning, and explanation; engaging learners in challenging tasks; teaching with examples and cases; connecting topics to students’ personal lives and interests; attending to the knowledge and skills students are developing and their relevance, rather than grading; and using formative assessments that monitor students’ progress and provide feedback to teachers and students.</p>

<title>School Is Easy for Students</title>
<p>The Center for American Progress has reported that many students find that their schoolwork is just too easy. Using the 4th, 8th, and 12th grade background surveys of the 2009, 2010, and 2011 National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1076217512468546">Boser and Rosenthal (2012)</xref> reported these findings:</p>
<list id="list1-1076217512468546" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p><italic>Large percentages of students report that their schoolwork is “too easy.”</italic> Across grade levels and subject matter areas, students report a lack of challenge: 21% of high school math students, 29% of eighth-grade math students, and 37% of fourth-grade math students, 56% of high school civics students, 51% of eighth-grade civics students, 55% of high school history students, and 57% of eighth-grade history students report that their schoolwork is too easy.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Students report that they are not engaged in rigorous learning activities</italic>. Almost one third of 8th-grade students and 12th-grade students report that they rarely write lengthy answers to reading questions on tests.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Students do not have access to key science and technology learning opportunities</italic>. For example, 72% of eight-grade science students say that they are not taught engineering and technology.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Too many students report that they are not learning during class and do not understand their teacher’s questions.</italic> For example, about 50% of 12th-grade math students reported that they feel they are always or almost always learning in their math class. One third of 12th graders and one fourth of middle school students report that they hardly ever clearly understand what their math teacher asks.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Students from disadvantaged backgrounds are less likely to understand their teachers’ questions</italic>. For example, 74% of higher income fourth-grade students report that they often or always understand what their science teacher is saying compared with just 56% of lower income fourth-grade students.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Based on these results, the researchers recommend that (a) policymakers continue to push for higher, more challenging standards, (b) the nation needs to identify ways to provide all students with the teachers and the teaching that provide more rigorous learning opportunities, and (c) researchers and educators should continue to develop and use student surveys.</p>

<title>Progress on Science Standards</title>
<p>Using a representative sample of 122,000 eight-graders who participated in the 2011 NAEP science assessment, the National Center of Education Statistics reported that among the 47 states that chose to participate in both years, scores in 16 states were higher in 2011 than in 2009 and remained the same in the rest of the states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1076217512468546">National Center for Education Statistics, 2011</xref>). Although there was a significant change in the gender gap where males score about 5 points higher than females, the racial/ethnic gap also narrowed between White, Black, and Hispanic students. However, while students scored higher in 2011 than in 2009, there was no significant change from 2009 in the scores for students at the 90th percentile. In terms of teaching and learning, students whose teachers reported using more hands-on projects scored higher than students who participated less frequently in hands-on projects. Moreover, students who report doing science-related activities that are not for schoolwork score higher on the NAEP. However, a more recent report on science standards across states found great variability in their quality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1076217512468546">Lerner et al., 2012</xref>). Using a common grading metric, researchers who were supported by the Thomas B. Fordham Institute evaluated each state’s science standards, “content and rigor” and “clarity and specificity” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1076217512468546">Lerner et al., 2012</xref>, p. 5). They found that the average grade across all states was a “C” with 26 earning a “D” or below and only 2 (California and District of Columbia) earning an “A.” They identified these areas where states fail to measure up: an undermining of evolution, a propensity to be vague, poor integration of scientific inquiry, and limited integration of math with science. Clearly, education of our high-performing science students needs more support from teachers, standards, and assessments.</p>

<sec id="section4-1076217512468546">
<title>Text Complexity</title>
<p>One of the Common Core State Standards in English language arts places a great emphasis on increasingly complex texts. Writers of the standards say that whereas the complexity of texts in entry-level college courses and workplaces has held steady or increased slightly, the complexity of texts used in high schools has declined over the past few decades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1076217512468546">Rothman, 2012</xref>). For this reason, the Common Core State Standards lay out a three-part model for examining text complexity that includes quantitative analysis using readability formulas and a qualitative analysis that includes examinations of the readers and the tasks. Quantitative formulas measure text complexity using vocabulary and syntax. For example, texts that contain many unfamiliar words and contain long, complicated sentences are more difficult to understand than texts using common words and shorter sentences. The qualitative analysis examines factors such as knowledge demands placed on the readers and the levels of meaning. For example, a text is more complex if more of the information needed is implicit rather than explicit or has deeper meanings. In addition to these qualitative and quantitative analyses, teachers need to determine their students’ interests and background knowledge to select texts that the students comprehend.</p>

<title>More Imaginative Children</title>
<p>Students in 2008 are more imaginative than their counterparts in 1985 report researchers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1076217512468546">Russ &amp; Dillon, 2011</xref>) in the <italic>Creativity Research Journal</italic>. They videotaped nearly 900 children ages 6 to 10 for 5 min each as they talked while playing with three blocks and two hand puppets. They then scored each video for the child’s imagination, emotional expression, actions, and storytelling using the <italic>Affect in Play Scale</italic> (APS). Across 14 studies spanning 23 years, children showed no difference in the organization or emotional engagement of their play or storytelling, but the imagination quality showed a marked increase. The children also expressed less negative feelings in play and a wide range of positive emotions to tell their stories and organize their thoughts. The authors concluded that even though children’s playtime has been restricted, they have found ways to continue to pretend whether in more imaginative tasks within the curriculum or at home. They further explained that children might gain cognitive skills from using technology where they once got it from acting out situations in play.</p>

<title>Rural Connections for Gifted Students</title>
<p>The Johns Hopkins Center for Talented Youth has initiated a new program, Rural Connections, which provides scholarships for low-income, rural students to attend the center’s 3-week residential program during the summer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1076217512468546">Courrégé, 2012</xref>). The program, which is supported by the Jack Kent Cooke Foundation, has been operating since 1980 and is intended to give students a taste of college life—academically and socially. Students choose from an array of courses such as engineering and design course to studying the classics. Students also have opportunities to interact with other students who are interested in academics and are similar to themselves. The center does research and offers online courses, family academic programs, and counseling. It is part of a larger consortium of talent search programs, which include Duke Talent Identification Program, Center for Talent Development at Northwestern, the Belin-Blank Academic Talent Search, and the Carnegie Mellon Institute for Talented Elementary and Secondary Students.</p>

<title>K-8 Publishers’ Criteria for Common Core State Standards in Mathematics (CCSSM)</title>
<p>The writing team of the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1076217512468546">CCSSM (2012)</xref> has developed a document that is intended to provide a guide to states and districts in evaluating and selecting curricular materials. The document has been endorsed by the Council of the Great City Schools, Council of Chief State School Officers, National Association of State Boards of Education, National Governors Association, and Achieve. The design principles should focus on three areas:</p>
<list id="list2-1076217512468546" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p><italic>Focus</italic>. The scope of content in each grade needs to be narrowed so that students focus more deeply on the concepts.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Coherence</italic>. Each individual content standard is connected across grades and between topics.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Rigor</italic>. Each major work at each grade level needs to emphasize conceptual understanding, procedural skill and fluency, and applications.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Using these principles, the rubric for evaluating math materials includes the following criteria:</p>
<list id="list3-1076217512468546" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p><italic>Focus on “major work.”</italic> Students and teachers spend the large majority of their time on the major work of each grade.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Focus in early grades</italic>. Materials do not assess topics prior to the indicated grade level.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Focus and coherence through supporting work</italic>. Supporting content does not detract from the focus on the major work.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Rigor and balance</italic>. Materials and tools develop students’ conceptual understanding, fluency, and applications.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Consistent progressions</italic>. Materials are consistent with the progressions in the standards.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Coherent connections</italic>. Materials include learning objectives that are shaped by the CCSSM cluster headings and connect two or more clusters in a domain.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Practice–content connections.</italic> Materials connect content standards to practice standards.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Focus and coherence via practice standards</italic>. Materials promote focus and coherence by connecting practice standards with content emphasized in the standards.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Careful attention to each practice standard</italic>. Materials attend to the full meaning of each practice standard.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Emphasis on mathematical reasoning.</italic> Engage students in attending to the specialized language of mathematics, problem solving, and constructing and critiquing viable arguments</p></list-item>

Both books are published by Prufrock Press (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.prufrock.com">http://www.prufrock.com</ext-link>).</p>
<p>The <bold>Reading Like a Historian</bold> curriculum, designed by the Stanford History Education Group, is a set of 75 free secondary school lessons in the U.S. history. The program focuses heavily on four key skills: “sourcing,” to gauge how authors’ viewpoints and reasons for writing affect their accounts of event; “contextualization,” to get a full picture of what was happening at the time; “corroboration,” to help students sort out contradictory anecdotes and facts; and “close reading,” to help them absorb text slowly and deeply, parsing words and sentences for meaning. For example, each lesson begins with a question and is followed by students reading a group of primary source documents. Using these reading materials, students develop interpretations about the events that must be supported by the evidence that they have read. Instead of being the primary source of information, the textbook is used as a teacher and student resource. Lessons are designed to fit within the 50-min class period.
