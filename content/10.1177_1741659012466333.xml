<p>The welfare state has been inadequately considered in research on illicit drug markets and those who participate in them, so <italic>Street Capital</italic> is a welcome addition to the literature. The broader concept of marginalization, which <italic>Street Capital</italic> also engages, is central to most ethnographic studies of urban drug markets. These are mainly done in the United States, where economic inequality is high and marginalized populations – disproportionately people of color – are often concentrated in cities. A rich body of ethnographic literature documents the street-based norms, codes of conduct and practical competencies that emerge as alternatives to mainstream human and social capital. Authors Sveinung Sandberg, Research Fellow in Sociology at the University of Bergen, and Willy Pedersen, Professor of Sociology at the University of Oslo, term this constellation of skills and dispositions “street capital,” and explore its development and meanings among a group of ethnic minority cannabis dealers in Oslo. The setting, in a strong welfare state, is a reminder that marginalization is a relative concept, and that “otherness” varies mainly in its details.</p>
<p>Historically and cross-nationally, understanding something about a country’s welfare policies can help to explain important aspects of its drug policy as well, including the type and severity of criminal sanctions against sellers and buyers, and the accessibility of treatment services for users who seek care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1741659012466333">Benoit, 2003</xref>). The United States, for example, has long stood out among economically advanced nations for having a stingy, “residual” welfare state and a harshly punitive illicit drug policy that is a major contributor to the dramatic increase in mass incarceration since the 1970s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1741659012466333">Mauer, 2009</xref>). Both welfare and drug control policies aid in the political demonization of marginalized groups. Norway inhabits the opposite, generous end of the welfare-state spectrum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1741659012466333">Esping-Andersen, 1990</xref>). Sandberg and Pedersen summarize important differences between the Norwegian and US welfare systems including, chiefly, that benefit recipients in Norway are less likely to constitute a permanent underclass and more likely to eventually escape poverty than their counterparts in the US. Immigrants, especially from Africa, Asia and Eastern Europe, receive more benefits and for longer periods than ethnic Norwegians, yet are no more likely to re-enter the system (challenging the argument often heard in the US that generous benefits foster dependency). Norway’s approach to illicit drug control is comparatively quite progressive. Voluntary treatment is an optional alternative to prison, and the maximum penalty for the most severe trafficking offenses is 21 years. (In the US, the maximum drug offense penalty is execution, although it has never been applied). Norway has a number of fixed and mobile syringe exchange sites, and the government allows individual municipalities to establish injection rooms (EMCDDA, nd).</p>
<p>Despite their differences, in both Norway and the US, race is an important factor in drug markets and social location. Yet it is important in different ways. In the US, drug laws are disproportionately enforced against people of color, particularly African-Americans, who comprise 12 percent of the population but 45 percent of drug incarcerations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1741659012466333">Mauer, 2009</xref>). The historical trauma of slavery sets African-Americans apart from African immigrants and other immigrants, often in a negative way. For example, immigrants are popularly, if wrongly, perceived as more reliable and industrious – and thus more employable – than African-Americans, particularly African-American men. There are substantial numbers of people of African descent in Norway as well, but they are either immigrants or the children of immigrants. In Oslo, nearly 20 percent of the city’s 500,000 residents are immigrants. Somalis, mostly refugees, constitute about 10 percent of Oslo’s immigrant population. Sandberg and Pedersen spent more than a year at an open-air drug market in Oslo known as the River (because it operates along the banks of the Akerselva), observing activity, getting to know cannabis dealers and conducting in-depth interviews with 20 dealers, of whom 19 were men; 10 had immigrated from Somalia; the others came from Morocco, Eritrea, Ghana, Congo, Kenya, Gambia and Pakistan. The lone woman was ethnic Norwegian.</p>
<p><italic>Street Capital</italic> is not about welfare policy or drug policy per se, but about policy effects as they are lived by young immigrant cannabis sellers. Although permanent marginalization is rare in Norway, Sandberg and Pedersen describe their respondents as high-risk individuals, who generally arrived at the River through one of three trajectories. Some, especially the younger dealers, were impoverished youth seeking excitement and money; at the River they could assume roles commanding the respect they were denied in their home communities. Others, a few years older, ended up dealing at the River as a last resort, having failed in more prestigious criminal careers and being unprepared to succeed in the legal economy. The third group were refugees, including men from Somalia who had failed to obtain asylum in Norway but who could not safely return to their home country. Without rights to benefits or employment, they, too, turned to the River as a last resort.</p>
<p>The authors are cognizant of the risks involved in writing about marginalized populations – of either reinforcing stereotypes or romanticizing the people whose stories they tell. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1741659012466333">Bourgois (1996</xref>: 12) resolved this dilemma by presenting uncensored accounts of the “brutal events” he either witnessed or experienced directly or that were related to him by the actors themselves. Sandberg and Pedersen develop and employ a well-constructed interdiscursive framework that synthesizes discourses of oppression (“victim discourse”) and resistance (“gangster discourse”) to show how dealers at the River construct street capital, and to convey the multiple meanings it has for them. Influenced by the work of Bourdieu, Anderson and others, the interdiscursive framework manages tensions between agency and structure and between oppression and resistance, an effective way to understand marginalization in a strong welfare state. The dealers used gangster discourse to obtain respect and victim discourse to justify drug dealing and violence, in an overall narrative that was ultimately one of resistance.</p>
<p>Both victims and gangsters, the River dealers detailed for Sandberg and Pedersen how their lives are circumscribed by interactions with the Norwegian welfare state. Most of their experiences with ethnic Norwegians were interactions with social welfare workers and police officers, which reinforced their “otherness.” Social workers were sympathetic and useful, sometime allies against oppression and ostensibly fostering agency. The dealers were aware, however, that their victimizations also served the social workers’ professional interests. And in some cases, such as for the non-returnable refugees, social workers switched sides, so to speak, and became “agents of exclusion” forced to deny benefits. Police, on the other hand, were agents of oppression deployed to minimize the agency of the dealers as gangsters. Yet the River dealers expressed respect for police officers’ masculinity, based on their physical fitness, familiarity with street culture, and repertoires of violence. They also appreciated the opportunity to develop “complementary competence,” which enabled them to exploit the limits of police authority. For example, in Oslo the police are not allowed to deny their identity (although they work in plain clothes), and sting operations are forbidden. For the River dealers, interactions with police that do not end in arrest burnish the masculine gangster image.</p>
<p>Toward the end of <italic>Street Capital</italic>, the authors ask:<disp-quote>
<p>… if oppression discourse ... is unique to life on the streets in a Scandinavian welfare state or whether it is a common feature of street life. ... Our guess is that oppression discourse will be more prevalent in contexts with a high density of welfare organisations and in states with a socialist or social-democratic history. (p. 158)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The question they raise is a fascinating one, and it inspires speculation as to the usefulness of their interdiscursive framework in cross-national comparisons. To be sure, in a setting without welfare resources, marginalized people have little to gain by using oppression discourse. However, it is possible to be oppressed without identifying as a victim, as the authors recognize when they describe hip-hop as a mixture of oppression and gangster discourses that expresses victimization as a source of strength that empowers resistance. It also seems that sympathetic (victim-oriented) oppression discourse might be likely to emerge in weak welfare states that privilege agents of social control, such as the US. That may have happened in New York City, for example, where illegal “stop-and-frisk” tactics used by the NYPD grew unchecked for many years. In 2011 police stopped 685,724 individuals, of whom 87% were black or Latino, without reasonable suspicion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1741659012466333">NYCLU, 2012</xref>). The vast majority of those stopped were released, but many others were arrested for possessing marijuana in public view, having been tricked or intimidated by the police into emptying their bags and pockets. A class-action lawsuit was filed against the NYPD, and media characterizations of poor young men of color shifted from dangerous potential felons to victims of oppression whose futures were marred by fraudulent arrest records.</p>
<p>NYPD tactics seem unlikely in Oslo, but there are troubling trends. Sandberg and Pedersen report that, although there have been gangs in Norway for decades, Oslo’s street culture now has an ethnic dimension, and the public is beginning to associate minority ethnic groups with crime. It remains to be seen whether ethnic tension will lead Norway’s criminal justice and drug policies to become more like those in the US, given the social context of the strong Norwegian welfare state. In any case, the interdiscursive framework developed in <italic>Street Capital</italic> is an appropriate mechanism for exploring the changing experiences of the marginalized.</p>
