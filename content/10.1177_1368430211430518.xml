<abstract>
<p>Arguing that globalization is an important factor in shaping intergroup relations, this paper examines its impact on xenophobic attitudes towards immigrants and on the relationship between nationalism, constructive patriotism, and xenophobia. While multilevel analysis of data from the International Social Survey Program (ISSP) National Identity II (2003) across 31 countries indicates no direct effect of globalization on xenophobia, the relationship between nationalism, constructive patriotism, and xenophobia does appear to be affected. The negative relationship between constructive patriotism and xenophobia is obtained in countries with higher levels of globalization, and the positive relationship between nationalism and xenophobia is also stronger in such countries. A comparison of globalization and economic explanations for xenophobia indicates the unique effect of globalization. The common economic explanations of xenophobia are discussed in light of these findings.</p>

<p>In developing social identity theory, Tajfel sought to understand social change by examining how social contexts shape social identity and behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1368430211430518">Reicher, 2004</xref>). As social identity is not determined only by individual personality, social context plays an important role in explaining intergroup relations. Therefore, it is no wonder that a growing body of studies examines how social contexts affect intergroup relations and especially attitudes toward minorities and immigrants (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1368430211430518">Bilodeau &amp; Fadol, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1368430211430518">Cohrs &amp; Stelzl, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1368430211430518">Green, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1368430211430518">Lahav, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1368430211430518">Meuleman, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1368430211430518">Pehrson, Vignoles, &amp; Brown, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1368430211430518">Quillian, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1368430211430518">Savelkoul, Scheepers, Tolsma, &amp; Hagendoorn, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1368430211430518">Sides &amp; Citrin 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1368430211430518">Van Geel &amp; Vedder, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1368430211430518">Wagner et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1368430211430518">Weldon 2006</xref>). The greatest contribution of the social-psychology perspective to the multidisciplinary study of immigration is in “linking the individual to the social system … examining mediators between ‘macro’ factors, such as policies and social representations, and ‘micro’ factors, such as individual attitudes and identities” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1368430211430518">Esses, Deaux, Lalonde, &amp; Brown, 2010</xref>, p. 639). Most studies so far have used group conflict and intergroup contact theories to suggest explanations which combine the micro and macro levels of explanations (for review, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1368430211430518">Ceobanu &amp; Escandell, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1368430211430518">Wagner, Christ, &amp; Hetmeyer, 2010b</xref>).</p>
<p>This study proposes an explanation that has been overlooked in those studies, that is, globalization. The paper argues that globalization— the “increasing cross-border flows of goods, services, money, people, information, and culture” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1368430211430518">Held, McGrew, &amp; Perraton, 1999</xref>, p. 16)—is an important factor in shaping national identity and intergroup relations. After all, globalization is not just an objective historical process that redefines our world. Globalization is also a conceptual change in which people are aware of the world as a single place, and it has had an important effect on various types of social identities around the world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1368430211430518">Arnett, 2002</xref>). It is no wonder then that the ways globalization redefines national identity have been gaining increasing attention in research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1368430211430518">Barber, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1368430211430518">Calhoun, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1368430211430518">Guibernau, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1368430211430518">Norris &amp; Inglehart, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>This paper investigates the link between the micro level of analysis, people’s national identity, with globalization at the macro level of analysis. Following the distinction between constructive patriotism and nationalism (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1368430211430518">Blank &amp; Schmidt, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1368430211430518">De Figueiredo &amp; Elkins, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1368430211430518">Raijman, Davidov, Schmidt, &amp; Hochman, 2008</xref>), this paper examines the effect of globalization on the relations between constructive patriotism, nationalism and xenophobic attitudes toward immigrants. The effect of globalization is also compared to the common explanation used by group conflict theory, i.e., economic competition.</p>
<p>The paper proceeds as follows. The first section provides a short review of the distinction between constructive patriotism and nationalism. Then, the impact of globalization on national identity, and its relations to attitudes toward immigration are discussed. Multilevel analysis of data from the International Social Survey Program (ISSP) National Identity II (2003) across 31 countries is used to examine how globalization affects the relations between nationalism, constructive patriotism, and xenophobic attitudes toward immigrants. Additional analysis is conducted to examine alternative economic explanations.</p>

<title>National identity and attitudes toward immigrants</title>
<p>The very concept of the nation is a form of social identity that unites people into national groups. From Ernest Renan’s aphorism that the nation is a “daily plebiscite” to Benedict Anderson’s famous conceptualization of nations as “imagined communities,” scholars have defined nationalism in a very similar way to social identity. This is not surprising given that a nation is “a group of people [who] have come to see themselves as constituting a unique, identifiable entity with a claim of continuity over time, to unity across geographical distance, and to the right to various forms of self expression” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1368430211430518">Kelman, 2001</xref>, p. 191).</p>
<p>The major difference between national identity and the types of social identities that were examined in the lab experiments in which social identity theory (SIT) was developed lies in the complexity and multidimensionality of national identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1368430211430518">Reicher &amp; Hopkins, 2001</xref>). Sometimes national identity can be perceived as banal and be taken for granted, and sometimes it serves to stimulate soldiers entering the battlefield (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1368430211430518">Billig, 1995</xref>). At times it can unite nearly all members of the nation and at times it may be a source of friction among them. The meanings that people attribute to national identity are not static but dynamic, as national identity changes over time. The only consensus, therefore, that has developed from the research on national identity to date is that it is multidimensional.</p>
<p>Despite the complexity of national identity, however, there is a commonly accepted distinction between nationalism and patriotism which is also labeled as <italic>constructive patriotism</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1368430211430518">Bar-Tal &amp; Staub, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1368430211430518">Kosterman &amp; Feshbach, 1989</xref>; Schatz, Staub, &amp; Levine, 1999). Constructive patriotism reflects an “attachment to country characterized by critical loyalty” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1368430211430518">Schatz et al., 1999</xref>, p. 153) and it is seldom described as supporting democratic or constitutional principles of a specific country. <italic>Nationalism</italic> is defined as a sense that one’s country is superior to other nations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1368430211430518">Blank &amp; Schmidt, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1368430211430518">Kosterman &amp; Feshbach, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1368430211430518">Schatz et al., 1999</xref>). The distinction between these two aspects of national identity thus appears to be widespread, as empirical evidence across countries indicates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1368430211430518">Blank &amp; Schmidt, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1368430211430518">Davidov, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1368430211430518">Ezell, Seeleib-Kaiser, &amp; Tiryakian, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1368430211430518">Karasawa, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1368430211430518">Rothi, Lyons, &amp; Chryssochoou, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>More importantly, constructive patriotism and nationalism are not only two distinct elements of national identity; they also have dissimilar impacts on out-group devaluation. Nationalism is inherently related to out-group devaluation, whereas patriotism is positively related to one’s own national group but does not necessarily lead to out-group devaluation. The positive relations between nationalism and out-group devaluation are well supported. Across different countries nationalism predicts negative attitudes towards out-groups such as minorities, immigrants, or nationals of other countries. Constructive patriotism has often (but not always) been found to be unrelated or even negatively related to out-group devaluation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1368430211430518">Blank &amp; Schmidt, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1368430211430518">Coenders &amp; Scheepers, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1368430211430518">De Figueiredo &amp; Elkins, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1368430211430518">Herrmann, Isernia, &amp; Segatti, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1368430211430518">Li &amp; Brewer, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1368430211430518">Raijman et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Further support for the dissimilar impact of nationalism and constructive patriotism on out-group devaluation has been found in a recent study that used longitudinal data from Germany and therefore examined causal relations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1368430211430518">Wagner, Becker, Christ, Pettigrew, &amp; Schmidt, 2010a</xref>). This study shows that nationalism can cause an increase in out-group devaluation but not vice versa. For patriotism this effect was evident only when the common variance of nationalism and patriotism were controlled. Their study thus further supports the causal relations that were suggested by the application of social identity theory.</p>
<p>In conclusion, we know that nationalism and constructive patriotism are two aspects of national identity that can be found across different national contexts. We also know that they have dissimilar effects on attitudes toward out-groups. However, the impact of dissimilar national contexts on these effects is not clear. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1368430211430518">Raijman et al. (2008)</xref> have examined these relations in the US, Israel, France, and Germany. They found that in Israel and Germany, countries with ethnic conceptions of nationhood, relations between nationalism and willingness to grant citizenship rights were lower than in the more multicultural US or the republican France.</p>
<p>Other studies have also examined dissimilar national contexts but they have not examined the distinction between nationalism and constructive patriotism per se. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1368430211430518">Pettigrew, Wagner, and Christ (2007)</xref> compared Germany and the US, and found that national identification plays a similar role in both countries. However, another study, which compared Germany and Canada on other aspects of identity, found that the dissimilar context is relevant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1368430211430518">Esses, Wagner, Wolf, Preiser, &amp; Wilbur, 2006</xref>). Similarly, a study in Belgium found a dissimilar impact of the national context. Identification with Flanders is related to negative attitudes toward foreigners; the inverse is the case in Wallonia. Identification with Wallonia’s sub-national identity correlates with a positive attitude towards foreigners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1368430211430518">Billiet, Maddens, &amp; Beerten, 2003</xref>). Thus, the relations between national identification and out-group devaluation are related to the social representation of the nation</p>
<p>Other studies have examined such relations across a large number of countries by utilizing multilevel models that also account for explanations based on group conflict, intergroup contact and social identity theories. Such studies confirm the role of economic conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1368430211430518">Green, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1368430211430518">Meuleman, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1368430211430518">Semyonov, Raijman, &amp; Gorodzeisky, 2008</xref>), the relative numbers (or perceived numbers) of immigrants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1368430211430518">Kunovich, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1368430211430518">Meuleman, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1368430211430518">Schlueter &amp; Wagner, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1368430211430518">Semyonov et al., 2008</xref>) as well as the type of nationhood conceptions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1368430211430518">Pehrson et al., 2009</xref>) and institutions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1368430211430518">Crepaz, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1368430211430518">Weldon, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1368430211430518">Wright, 2011</xref>). However, the contextual effects on nationalism in comparison to constructive patriotism were not explicitly addressed by these studies. Furthermore, the results of these studies are inconsistent. I do not offer a more robust way to address this problem (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1368430211430518">Meuleman, 2011</xref> for one such study). Instead, I propose to examine an additional contextual explanation—globalization.</p>

<title>Globalization, national identity, and attitudes toward immigrants</title>
<p>SIT suggests that social identity is defined in terms of differences between or among social groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1368430211430518">Tajfel &amp; Turner, 1986</xref>). Thus, national identity, like any type of social identity, requires comparison between or among social groups. SIT also suggests that people like to think positively about themselves and the groups to which they belong. Members of the national group will seek to differentiate themselves positively from out-groups. It is crucial, however, to emphasize that SIT does not offer a static view of the relations between in-group identification and out-group attitudes in which in group identification leads to negative attitudes toward out-groups in all contexts. Differentiation and positive evaluation of the in-group does not necessarily lead to feelings of superiority toward out-groups. Differentiation occurs on the valued dimensions of comparison. It might lead to out-group devaluation but it can also be defined in terms of positive attitudes toward out-groups.</p>
<p>What is valued can change from one national context to another. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1368430211430518">Pehrson et al. (2009)</xref> has shown, in some countries there are positive relations between national identification and negative attitudes toward immigrants while in other countries these relations are negative. More important, the nature of the in-group identification and the effects it has on intergroup relations can be changed over time. This is evident when one views national identity from a historical perspective. Through history, the conceptions of national identity in countries like the US, Germany and Canada have changed. Such changes also influence the place of ethnic minorities and immigrants in the national ethos. These changes have occurred not only as a response to major events like wars but, as this study proposes, they have also taken place under the ongoing process of globalization.</p>
<p>In recent years, the term globalization has become one of the most widely used to describe the contemporary world. Numerous books and articles have been devoted to globalization which is one of the most hotly-debated topics in contemporary social research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1368430211430518">Guillèn, 2001</xref>). By and large, “[t]he central psychological consequence of globalization is that it results in transformations in identity, that is, in how people think about themselves in relation to the social environment” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1368430211430518">Arnett, 2002</xref>, p. 777). While it is supposed that globalization changes social identities, its impact on the relations between national identity and attitudes toward immigrants is far from being clear. This is not surprising since globalization involves a puzzling process of contradictory effects on many aspects of politics and society due to its multifaceted nature.</p>
<p>Some scholars consider globalization as a force that undermines national identity (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1368430211430518">Hobsbawm, 1992</xref>), while others argue that globalization trends reinforce national feelings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1368430211430518">Smith 2007</xref>). If globalization undermines national identification, it should also reduce negative attitudes toward immigrants as the blurriness of boundaries makes it harder for any single national identity to retain its unique significance and distinguish itself from other national identities. In the global village, the ability to produce and maintain a homogeneous national identity is challenged as people become global consumers of goods and information. In a wired world, the government no longer has the exclusive capacity to exert cultural control over its citizens and territory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1368430211430518">Barber, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1368430211430518">Guibernau, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>In other respects, globalization might have the opposite impact on national identity. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1368430211430518">Smith (2007)</xref> while the existence of culturally-diverse waves of immigrants has reshaped the meaning of national identity, this process also leads members of the nation to reflect on their national identity and reinforce its meaning and functions for the nation. Others view the continuation of national identity in a globalized world as a consequence of the necessity to organize public life. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1368430211430518">Calhoun (2007)</xref> asserts that national identity organizes ordinary people’s “sense of belonging.” According to Calhoun, globalization makes the sense of belonging even more important than in the past. Inconsistent interpretations of the nexus between globalization and national identity reflect not only different theoretical predispositions regarding the meaning of nationalism but also the different methods used to examine that relationship. While some studies have found that the experience of globalization reduces identification with the nation amongst the public (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1368430211430518">Norris &amp; Inglehart, 2009</xref>), others have reached the opposite conclusion (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1368430211430518">Jung, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>It is also important to emphasize that globalization does not influence all segments of society in a similar way. Individual attitudes toward globalization vary according to people’s gains from globalization and their basic values. While globalization may push some part of the population in a given nation towards cosmopolitanism, other parts will develop what Manuel <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1368430211430518">Castells (2004)</xref> calls ‘resistance identities’. Such resistance identities reinforce ethnic, religious or national identification across the globe. In a similar way, Kinnvall has claimed that globalization has destabilizing effects on people’s sense of security. Nationalism and religion are “[p]articularly powerful stories and beliefs because of their ability to convey a picture of security, stability, and simple answers” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1368430211430518">Kinnvall, 2004</xref>, p. 742) to people who are affected by such a sense of insecurity. In Western Europe, for example, globalization has created a new conflict between “winners” and “losers” of this process. Such a conflict is used by radical right parties to mobilize support among those who attribute their losses (economic and cultural alike) to globalization and immigration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1368430211430518">Kriesi et al., 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>In light of the above, it is not clear what the impacts of globalization actually are on people’s sense of national identity and especially not on their relations with attitudes toward immigrants. On the one hand, globalization has a unifying impact. At least among some segments of the population, it might create identification with the “global village” as a whole. This might be a type of superordinate identity at the global level. Studies of intergroup relations show that superordinate identity reduces intergroup threat to some extent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1368430211430518">Riek, Mania, Gaertner, McDonald, &amp; Lamoreaux, 2010</xref>). Therefore, by creating a sense of superordinate identity, globalization might have a negative effect on the relations between national identification and xenophobia. If this is the case, one can expect that globalization will reduce xenophobic attitudes toward immigrants as well as reducing the positive relations between nationalism and such attitudes. For constructive patriotism, however, one might expect that globalization will increase positive relations with attitudes toward immigrants. After all, such superordinate identity might reinforce people’s attachment to their country but in a way that is based on its place in a global world. An illustration of such superordinate identity can be found in the case of the European Union itself. While identifying with the EU is sometimes described as a contradiction of national identity, studies have found that over time, national identification is directly related to European identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1368430211430518">Duchesne &amp; Frognier, 2008</xref>). Some people identify with their countries as part of their growing identification with the EU.</p>
<p>Yet, globalization also has a fragmenting impact. Exposure to globalization can increase the awareness of national boundaries and national uniqueness and reinforce feelings of national identification and xenophobic attitudes. As SIT suggests, sometimes even minimal criterions are required to construct social identification. The effect of globalization probably creates much more than minimal criterions, thus making national identification much more important, at least for some people. For nationalists, exposure to globalization might reinforce nationalist attitudes and feelings that the national group is superior to migrants. For constructive patriots, however, one might expect that such exposure will not reduce a welcoming attitude towards immigrants. The analysis will reveal which of these options is the more plausible.</p>

<p>In conclusion, following previous studies one can expect clear connections at the individual level of analysis. As illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1368430211430518">Figure 1</xref>, I expect positive relations between nationalism and xenophobic attitudes toward immigrants and negative relations for constructive patriotism. Using a multilevel approach, this study will focuses on the social level of explanation. I examine how country level of globalization directly affects xenophobic attitudes toward immigrants and how it affects the relations between constrictive patriotism, nationalism and xenophobia.</p>

<sec id="section4-1368430211430518">
<title>Data</title>
<p>Data were drawn from the International Social Survey Program (ISSP) National Identity II (2003).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1368430211430518">1</xref></sup> The ISSP has two advantages which make it suitable for this study. First, it contains items that measure of nationalism and constructive patriotism, and their equivalence across 34 countries was examined by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1368430211430518">Davidov (2009)</xref>. Second, the coverage of countries outside of Europe enables variation in the primary variable of interest—globalization.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1368430211430518">2</xref></sup> I used data for 31 countries:<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1368430211430518">3</xref></sup> Australia, Austria, Bulgaria, Canada, Chile, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Hungary, Ireland, Israel, Japan, Latvia, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Philippines, Poland, Portugal, Russia, Slovakia, Slovenia, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Uruguay, US, and Venezuela.</p>
<p>When national identity is analysed, it is important to distinguish between the majority national group and national minorities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1368430211430518">Staerklé, Sidanius, Green, &amp; Molina, 2010</xref>). Since the ISSP collects data from a representative sample of the adult population in each country, I excluded from the analysis respondents from an immigrant background (i.e., they or their mother or father were immigrants), respondents that do not identify themselves as belonging to the majority group’s ethnicity, and respondents that do not use the country’s dominant language at home as a first language. Thus, for example, for the Slovak Republic I included only respondents whose parents (both mother and father) are not from an immigrant background, who identify their ethnic group as Slovak, and who speak Slovak at home as their first language. In this way, I could ensure that I analysed only the national in-group. The overall sample that was used had 29,886 respondents.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1368430211430518">4</xref></sup></p>

<title>Measurements</title>
<sec id="section6-1368430211430518">
<title>Individual-level variables</title>
<p>Xenophobic attitudes toward immigrants was measured with five items: “Immigrants increase crime rates”; “Immigrants take jobs away from people who were born in [respondent’s country]”; “The government spends too much money assisting immigrants”; “Immigrants improve [respondent’s country] society by bringing in new ideas and cultures”; and “Immigrants are generally good for [respondent’s country] economy.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1368430211430518">5</xref></sup> Constructive patriotism and nationalism were measured with the scales used by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1368430211430518">Raijman et al. (2008)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1368430211430518">Davidov (2009)</xref>. Constructive patriotism was measured with three items: “How proud are you of [respondent’s country] in the way democracy works in [respondent’s country]?”; “How proud are you of [respondent’s country] in its social security system?”; and “How proud are you of [respondent’s country] in its fair and equal treatment of all groups in society?” Nationalism was measured with two items: “The world would be a better place if people from other countries were more like the [country nationality of respondent]” and “Generally speaking, [respondent’s country] is a better country than most other countries.” I also measured age, gender, education, and subjective social class as control variables because previous studies have shown their effect on attitudes toward immigrants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1368430211430518">Ceobanu &amp; Escandell 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>The means of the individual level variables as well as their Pearson correlations are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1368430211430518">Table 1</xref>. While the correlation between nationalism and constructive patriotism is positive, it is greatly below any threshold for multicullinearity. To account for the equivalence of the scales, a multiple group confirmatory factor analysis was conducted across the 31 countries. Overall, the analysis indicates that partial measurement equivalence can be accepted (see <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-1368430211430518">Appendix 1</xref> for further details).</p>

<title>Globalization</title>
<p>The KOF globalization index was used to measure globalization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1368430211430518">Dreher, Gaston, &amp; Martens, 2008</xref>). This index defines globalization as the “process of creating networks of connections among actors at multi-continental distances, mediated through a variety of flows including people, information and ideas, capital and goods. Globalization is conceptualized as a process that erodes national boundaries, integrates national economies, cultures, technologies and governance, and produces complex relations of mutual interdependence.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1368430211430518">6</xref></sup> The KOF index examines various parameters such as the number of McDonald’s restaurants, internet hosts, internet users, membership in international organizations and international trade.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1368430211430518">7</xref></sup> The index was measured on a 100-point scale. I used the average of 2000–2005 and the countries rankings vary between 91 (Austria) and 58 (Philippines).</p>

<sec id="section9-1368430211430518">
<title>Economic conditions</title>
<p>Economic conditions were measured by four indexes: Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita for 2000–2003 (in current US$); GDP Growth: Gross Domestic Product annual growth for 1995–2003; unemployment rates among the total population—the share of the labor force that is without work but available for and seeking employment (average for 2000–2003); unemployment by level of educational attainment for primary education (Average for 2002–2003).

<title>Results</title>
<p>The multilevel approach was applied for this analysis. This approach takes into account that level 1 variables (people) are nested in different contexts (level 2—countries), and it facilitates examination of macro-level explanations, i.e., the country-level variable effects on individual-level results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1368430211430518">Hox, 2010</xref>). Recalling <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1368430211430518">Figure 1</xref>, such an approach enables an examination of the effects of the country level variable (globalization) on the dependent variable (xenophobic attitudes toward immigrants) as well as the interaction effect on the relations between the individual level of explanations (constructive patriotism, nationalism) on the dependent variable.</p>
<p>For clarification, I will explain how the multilevel model is constructed. The first step, before the actual analysis is conducted, involves calculating the interclass correlation coefficient (ICC) in order to examine how much of the variance is between country variance. The ICC for xenophobic attitudes toward immigrants was 11.9% indicating the proportion of the between-country variance at the country level. Such proportion justifies a multilevel analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1368430211430518">Hox, 2010</xref>). In the next step, a model that accounts only for the individual-level variables was developed, i.e., a model that analyses the lower part of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1368430211430518">Figure 1</xref>.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-1368430211430518">8</xref></sup> The results of the models are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1368430211430518">Table 2</xref>.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-1368430211430518">9</xref></sup></p>

<p>Model 1.1 examines only the effect of control variables and is used as baseline to examine the ways our main variables of interest reduce the explained variance. Models 1.2 and 1.3 confirm the expectations that nationalism is positively related to xenophobic attitudes toward immigrants while constructive patriotism is negatively related to them. Looking at the contribution of each factor to the reduction in the explained variance reveals an interesting pattern. Nationalism reduces more of the explained variance (6%) than constructive patriotism (1.9%) at the individual level. At the country level of variance, constructive patriotism reduces 22.5% of the explained variance while nationalism does not reduce the explained variance at the country level at all. Such differences might imply that constructive patriotism is more affected by the social context than nationalism is. Before moving to that discussion, I will just note that Model 1.4 further supports the dissimilar impact of constructive patriotism and nationalism in a model in which they are both included.</p>
<p>To better illustrate the merit of the multilevel approach, one might look at <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1368430211430518">Figure 2</xref>. This figure presents the variation of the slopes in ten of the 31 countries. It demonstrates that the slope differs between countries with strong relations and much less strong relations in others. The following analysis examines whether globalization affects this variance of slopes.</p>

<p>In Model 1.5, I combine the interaction effect on the relations between constructive patriotism, nationalism and xenophobia. I also account for the direct effect of globalization. The results of Model 1.5 indicate that there is no direct effect of globalization on attitudes toward immigrants. There are however significant interaction effects. For constructive patriotism there is a negative interaction effect and slope tests revealed that the differences are significant at <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01. For nationalism, the interaction effect is positive and significant at <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001. As <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1368430211430518">Figure 3a</xref> illustrates, in countries with higher levels of globalization (average upper quartiles) the negative relations between constructive patriotism and xenophobic attitudes toward immigrants are stronger than in countries with lower levels of globalization (average lower quartiles). At the same time, in countries with higher levels of globalization, the relations between nationalism and xenophobia are stronger than in countries with lower levels of globalization as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1368430211430518">Figure 3b</xref>. It seems then that globalization has an impact on the ways these two aspects of national identity are related to xenophobic attitudes toward immigrants. In both cases, these relations are stronger in countries with higher levels of globalization.</p>

<title>Is it indeed globalization?</title>
<p>One of the debates regarding globalization concerns the question of whether this process differs from modernization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1368430211430518">Guillèn, 2001</xref>). Globalization may merely constitute a stage in modernization and economic development rather than a unique phenomenon. Since from an empirical point of view the more globalized countries are also more modernized and economically developed, it is possible that while the previous analysis has focused on globalization, economic factors (also) lie behind these relations. As group-conflict theory suggests, economic conditions impact the relations between in- and out-groups, many studies also demonstrating (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1368430211430518">Ceobanu &amp; Escandell, 2010</xref> for a review) that attitudes towards immigration are affected by economic conditions.</p>
<p>This section thus analyses the impact of globalization vis-a-vis economic explanations. I chose two approaches to measure economic conditions: economic competition and overall national economic development. Economic competition is examined in terms of the job market and economic growth. I used two variables for competition in the job market: a) the total percentage of unemployment in the country; b) the level of unemployment among workers with primary education. Since studies have found that less-skilled workers are likely to oppose immigration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1368430211430518">Scheve &amp; Slaughter 2001</xref>), the second measure explicitly observes the supposed competition among less-skilled workers at the national level. Examining economic growth (GDP annual growth) is also relevant for economic competition. According to group-conflict theory, economic slowing down increases competition, since resources are scarce. The other approach looks at the overall economic development, measured by the common index of GDP per Capita used in previews studies (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1368430211430518">Semyonov et al., 2008</xref>). To illustrate the differences between these approaches one should consider the impact of the 2008 recession. In Portugal, for example, while the GDP annual growth for 2009 was -.2.6% and total unemployment was 9.5%—indicating economic decline—the country’s relative levels of GDP per Capita in comparison to other countries changed to a much lesser extent in 2009.</p>
<p>The results given in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1368430211430518">Table 4</xref> indicate that the measures of economic competition (Models 2.1, 2.2, and 2.3) indicate the lack of significant direct or interaction effects.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-1368430211430518">10</xref></sup> If one examines the overall economic development in the country (GDP per Capita), a similar effect to globalization exists with respect to nationalism (Model 2.4), GDP per Capita exerting a positive impact on the nationalism slope. In terms of the effect of the constructive patriotism slope, however, the effect is far from significant. In other words, the results indicate that it is economic development rather than economic competition which possesses an effect similar to that of globalization.</p>

<p>As illustrated in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1368430211430518">Table 3</xref>, economic development and globalization are highly correlated. This correlation is even higher (<italic>r</italic> = .760; <italic>N</italic> = 30) when Japan—an outlier—is excluded from the calculation.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-1368430211430518">11</xref></sup> It is therefore not surprising that the lack of deviance differences between Models 2.4 and 1.5 indicate that the models are not distinct. While including both GDP per Capita and globalization in the same model (Model 2.5) might be interpreted as supporting the distinct impact of globalization rather than economic development, since GDP per Capita is not significant in this model whereas globalization is, as the fact that GDP per Capita and the globalization index are strongly correlated with one another suggests that it is important to note that the analysis does not provide evidence for the distinct impact of globalization. The only thing I can determine is that globalization significantly impacts the slopes of constructive patriotism while GDP per Capita does not.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Nations are a unique type of collective. Unlike other collectives, like religion or class, nations constitute sovereign bodies. The ultimate sovereignty of nations is expressed by their ability to draw lines between insiders and outsiders. Even in Europe, where sovereignty has been transferred from the member states to the EU in many spheres, citizenship policies are under the domain of the states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1368430211430518">Howard, 2009</xref>). While drawing lines between insiders and outsiders, nations are subject to a paradoxical logic of inclusion and exclusion which occur simultaneously. Nations use universal principles to include those who are members of the nations, and use particularistic doctrine to exclude those who are not. Political philosophers (cf. Jürgen Habermass; Michael Walzer; David Miller) have offered different normative principles to resolve this inherent tension. Social psychologists have suggested the distinction between nationalism and constructive patriotism as an empirical aspect of national identity (For a critique of this distinction in psychological research see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1368430211430518">Sapountzis, 2008</xref>). The results of this study, along with previous studies, have shown that nationalism is related to the logic of exclusion while constructive patriotism is related to the logic of inclusion.</p>
<p>Social identity theory suggests that such relations should not be viewed as static. They are influenced by the changing social contexts. This study makes a cross national effort to examine such a change. Going beyond the explanations that are offered by group conflict and intergroup contact theories, it focuses on the role of globalization. Multilevel analysis across 31 countries indicates that while globalization does not have a direct effect on attitudes toward immigrants, it does have an effect on the relations between nationalism and constructive patriotism, and attitudes toward immigrants. On average, in countries with higher levels of globalization, the negative relations between constructive patriotism and xenophobic attitudes toward immigrants are stronger than in countries with lower levels of globalization. Positive relations between nationalism and xenophobic attitudes toward immigrants, however, are increased in such countries. The higher the country level of globalization is, the stronger the relations are between nationalism, constructive patriotism and attitudes toward immigrants.</p>
<p>The meaning of these results should be viewed in light of the study caveats. First, this is a cross-sectional study. As such, the questions of causal relations at the individual level and at the country level of analysis are not addressed. While <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1368430211430518">Wagner et al.’s (2010a)</xref> longitudinal study in Germany points to casual relations between nationalism and prejudice, the uniqueness of the German national identity undermines the possibility of assuming such a casual mechanism in this study. Furthermore, since globalization is an ongoing process, a cross-sectional longitudinal study or other study designs (c.f. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1368430211430518">Wilkes &amp; Corrigall-Brown, 2011</xref>) are required to examine changes over time and the possibility of causal impact.</p>
<p>Second, the limits of the measurements that were used in this study should be emphasized. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1368430211430518">Meuleman (2011)</xref> has pointed out, the inconsistent results from studies about contextual effect on attitudes toward immigrants are explained by the lack of attention to comparability of measures that were used. While this study followed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1368430211430518">Davidov (2009)</xref> in the use of the scales for constructive patriotism and nationalism and in implementing multiple group confirmatory factor analysis to examine measurement equivalence, the validity and comparability of the scales are as yet open questions. One should just look at an item like “How proud are you of [respondent’s country] in the way democracy works in [respondent’s country]?”; and think about its different meanings in Germany, in the US, in Russia, in Venezuela and in Israel to recognize that. The issue of measurement also applies to the main contextual explanation—globalization. Thus, for example, while the presence of McDonald’s, among other measures, forms part of the KOF Globalization Index, the significance of the chain differs across countries. While McDonald’s represents a symbol of globalization in France, it is not perceived as foreign in Japan. This is just one example of the problems that arise when the complex phenomenon of globalization is measured (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1368430211430518">Dreher et al., 2008</xref>). As the results of Model 2.5 indicate, it is difficult to distinguish between globalization and the economic development of a given country.</p>
<p>Third, this study is also limited in its coverage of countries. While the use of the ISSP 2003 National Identity Module enables examination of countries outside the Western world, it covers only a limited number of the countries internationally. As immigration is relevant to countries outside the West, including additional countries, future analysis can provide further leverage to examine the distinction between globalization and other macro sociological factors.</p>
<p>Fourth, the current study looks only at how people are clustered in states, and uses measures of globalization at the national level. Although this approach is commonly employed in similar studies, it is important to note its limitations. While people are clustered in states, they are also clustered in cities and regions. As Saskia Sassen has pointed out, globalization should be understood in the context of cities and not just countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1368430211430518">Sassen, 1999</xref>). That means that regional differences should have been considered as well, as a few studies have demonstrated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1368430211430518">Rustenbach, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1368430211430518">Schlueter &amp; Wagner, 2008</xref>). For example, one can assume that the effect of globalization on social identities in New York is dissimilar to its effect in rural America. However, as measures of globalization are available at the country level, this study did not account for such variations.</p>
<p>All of these caveats notwithstanding, this research is, to our knowledge, the first attempt to cross-nationally study the contextual effect of globalization on the relations between nationalism, constructive patriotism, and attitudes toward immigrants. As such, this study follows <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1368430211430518">Pettigrew’s (2010)</xref> call for intergroup processes to be examined across different contexts while considering the effect of macro level explanations. Focusing on globalization, this study proposes to examine the contexts that shape national identity and attitudes toward immigrants in multiple ways.</p>
<p>The results indicate that in countries with higher levels of globalization the relationship between the two dimensions of national identity and xenophobia are stronger—possibly implying that the distinction between nationalism and constructive patriotism changes across levels of globalization. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1368430211430518">Figure 4</xref> further illustrates this point by plotting the countries’ level of globalization and the correlation between constructive patriotism and nationalism. The negative relationship (<italic>r</italic> = -.54) illustrates that in the more globalized countries the distinction between nationalism and constructive patriotism is stronger than in the less globalized countries. This points to a general pattern, the question of whether globalization indeed affects the distinction between these two components of national identity requiring a separate study. It nonetheless might be form a point of departure for discussing the theoretical implications of the results.</p>
<fig id="fig5-1368430211430518" position="float">
<label>Figure 4.</label>
<caption><p>Plot for globalization and the correlation between constructive patriotism and nationalism.</p></caption>
<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1368430211430518-fig5.tif"/></fig>
<p>In the more globalized countries, the sharper distinction between constructive patriotism and nationalism is reflected in the dissimilar interaction effect. The positive effect of globalization on the relationship between nationalism and xenophobia might imply that exposure to globalization reinforces feelings of nationalism. As SIT suggests, meaningful differences between social groups increase the level at which people compare their social group to other groups. Globalization might increase this process. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1368430211430518">Figure 4</xref> indicates that the more globalized countries are also those which are destinations for immigrants. We may assume that nationalists take this to mean that the national in-group is superior to migrants. For constructive patriots, this situation may operate conversely, their exposure to globalization possibly reinforcing their superordinate identity which identifies with their country’s adoption of universal democratic criteria and identification as world citizens. Such dual identification might explain the negative effect of globalization on the relationship between constructive patriotism and xenophobia.</p>
<p>The lack of direct effect of globalization on the level of xenophobia may also imply, however, that the mechanism of the effect of globalization on xenophobia and national identity is still puzzling. As the review of the literature has demonstrated, contradicting interpretations concerning the impact of globalization on national identity exist. Given the evidence provided in this study, one cannot conclusively determine which psychological mechanism facilitates the results. Future research might use different research designs to develop answers to this question. Additional research might also take an in-depth look into the different components of globalization to ascertain which aspect is more relevant. In addition, looking at the components of national identity in more refined ways (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1368430211430518">Roccas, Sagiv, Schwartz, Halevy, &amp; Eidelson, 2008</xref>) would enable the examination of such a mechanism.</p>
<p>The results of this study call into question the conclusions of studies that have used only GDP per Capita as a measure for potential economic competition with immigrants. GDP per Capita is highly correlated with globalization. It is also highly correlated with other measures of the overall social and economic development of a given country. It is much less correlated with other economic indicators of competition in the job market or changes in economic conditions in the short term. The assumption behind group conflict theory is that groups compete for scarce economic resources like jobs, housing and welfare support. The results however, indicate that significant relations were found only with GDP per Capita. Studies that use group conflict theory to conceptualize the effects of economic conditions should consider this difference and develop a more refined examination of economic explanations.</p>
<p>The relations between national identification and migrant devaluation are not identical across all countries but, rather, are shaped by the dissimilar national contexts. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1368430211430518">Reicher and Hopkins (2001</xref>: 36) point out: “The attempt to find generic relationship between the level of identification (at whatever level, personal, national or supernational) and behavior will fail if, as happens all too often, the situated historical and cultural context is ignored … .” In recent years, more and more studies have included contextual explanations. One contribution of this study is in indicating how the ongoing process of globalization, a key social change, should also take this into account.</p>

<title>Appendix 1. Multiple group confirmatory factor analysis</title>
<p>Following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1368430211430518">Davidiv (2009)</xref>, I examined whether our three main variables of interest were equivalent across the 31 countries. I constructed a measurement model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1368430211430518">Figure 5</xref>), examined it in each country and across the countries. The single country CFA revealed that in most countries the model had good fits (we used the CFI, REMSA, and Pclose) and sufficient factor loadings on the constructs. But I also found that in the xenophobia construct, the covariance between the errors of V51 (e2) and V53 (e4) had to be released. This may be because the item measures were in opposite directions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1368430211430518">Brown, 2006</xref>) or because of differences in the item content. I also found that in some countries, as in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1368430211430518">Davidov (2009)</xref>, some modifications of the models were required as the distinction between nationalism and constructive patriotism was not clear.

The reduction in the CFI between the configural model and the partial metric model was .009 and there was no REMSA reduction which fits <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1368430211430518">Chen’s (2007)</xref> recommended criteria.</p>

<p>The estimation method was RML (Restricted Maximum Likelihood). However, since the relatively small number of countries might bias the results, Bootstrapping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1368430211430518">Goldstein, 2011</xref>) and Bayesian (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1368430211430518">Hamaker &amp; Klugkist, 2011</xref>) estimation was applied. As the results from these three estimation methods are nearly identical, once can establish the lack of bias in the RML estimation.</p></fn>
