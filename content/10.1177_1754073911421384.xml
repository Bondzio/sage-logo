<abstract>
<p>This comment on Stueber’s article clarifies the nature of the core disagreement between his approach to understanding reasons and mine. The purely philosophical nature of the dispute is highlighted. It is argued that understanding someone’s narrative often suffices for understanding the person’s reasons in ordinary cases. It is observed that Stueber has yet to provide a compelling counter case. There is also a brief clarification of some of the empirical commitments of the narrative practice hypothesis.</p>

<p>In his article <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1754073911421384">Stueber (2012)</xref> makes a case for thinking that we simply cannot do without reenactive empathy when engaging with others viscerally or making sense of their actions in terms of reasons. He is right to set out his stall differently along these two fronts. One concerns low-level forms of intersubjective interacting (which I call unprincipled enactive/embodied engagements) and the other concerns much more sophisticated, articulate and conceptually based forms of understanding (which I call folk psychology, <italic>stricto sensu</italic>). In this short commentary I focus exclusively on what Stueber has to say about the latter, for reasons of space.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1754073911421384">Stueber (2012)</xref> acknowledges that the new trend of supposing that narratives might play an important, and perhaps even fundamental, part in our understanding reasons has “enriched” the theory of mind debate. Nevertheless, he regards it as stepping over the mark if we imagine that to understand X’s reason we need only understand X’s narrative. He rejects the idea that narrative understanding suffices or exhausts what it is to understand someone’s reason. Call this the “narrative suffices for reason understanding” (or NSRU) claim. Steuber thinks the NSRU cannot be true because it fails to acknowledge the utterly necessary and central (i.e., nonsuperfluous) role of reenactive empathy (or simulation) in enabling us to understand a person’s reasons for acting. Call this the “reenactment is necessary for reason understanding” (or RNRU) claim.</p>
<p>Inspired by Collingwood and others, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1754073911421384">Stueber (2012)</xref> wants to establish the truth of the RNRU (and hence the falsity of its competitor, the NSRU). To assess the success of his efforts one must recognize the thoroughly philosophical character of this debate. Both claims under examination are claims about what is minimally required for understanding reasons, advanced on a priori grounds (no doubt some would regard them as attempts to express analytic truths). In his 2006 book, Stueber is admirably frank about the status of his claim (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1754073911421384">Stueber, 2006</xref>, p. 152).</p>
<p>Recognizing this point is important when it comes to assessing different strands of Stueber’s argument. He devotes space to discussing some empirical findings and raises questions about how best to interpret them. But this is orthogonal to his main concern. Although the empirical issues are worthy of further scrutiny and discussion, they make exactly no contribution to deciding what is at stake in the NSRU–RNRU debate. Still, I can’t resist clarifying my views on one issue (especially since Stueber invites me to do so). How do children move from having a piecemeal and partial grasp of mental state concepts to an integrated, articulate understanding of reasons—that is, a full folk psychological competence? Children do this, I conjecture, by mastering and deepening their capacities for producing and consuming narratives. This is a slow process. It involves participating in shared, scaffolded, story-telling practices. The narrative skills required for this are in place only very weakly in early childhood, becoming stable only at around age 5 and growing more secure after that. Thus the proposal that our capacity to understand reasons only comes by developing narrative abilities concurs with the findings that</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>5- and 6-year-old children (who are old enough to pass false-belief tasks) still have problems understanding: how beliefs are acquired (Carpendale &amp; Chandler, 1996; Robinson &amp; Apperly, 2001) how beliefs interact with desires (Leslie et al., 2005; Leslie &amp; Polizzi, 1998) and the emotional consequences of false beliefs (e.g., Harris, Johnson, Hutton, Andrews, &amp; Cooke, 1989; Ruffman &amp; Keenan, 1996). (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1754073911421384">Apperly &amp; Butterfill, 2009</xref>, p. 957)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Mastering all of this, the child in effect “learns the core principles” of folk psychology (as some philosophers would put it), but they do this, remarkably, without coming to possess or acquire any “principles” at all.</p>
<p>It is true, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1754073911421384">Stueber (2012)</xref> stresses, that I accept that the exercise of imaginative capacities—even capacities for cocognition—are important in enabling children to develop an understanding of reasons. But imaginative and cocognitive capacities do not, individually or jointly, add up to “understanding an agent’s reasons.” Full mastery of that special kind of understanding only comes as the result of engaging with narratives. If so, it follows that it cannot be a prerequisite for entering into the relevant narrative practices. Philosophers of a certain Platonic mindset tend to marvel as to how it is possible to learn something without already knowing it, but gradual mastery of skills and techniques is a quite common phenomenon.</p>
<p>This brings us back to the main question. Is it possible to fully understand someone’s reason for acting without putting ourselves in their shoes, identifying with them, or otherwise simulating their mindset? I agree with Stueber that theory theory is inadequate. Having general knowledge about the laws of folk psychology—that is, how mental states interrelate—will not suffice for understanding a person’s reasons for acting on some occasion. For example, without knowing the appropriate backstory, being told that X ate an acorn because he believed it was an acorn and desired to eat an acorn it is likely to leave us puzzled, even though it is not irrational to do such a thing (in a strict sense of rational).</p>
<p>By contrast, if we flesh out enough of X’s story, X’s stated reason may become intelligible. Thus if we learn that this is part of an important religious ritual for X—if we can see a link between this sort of activity and activities that play, or could have played, a similar role in our lives, then it becomes possible to make sense of X’s reason. In getting the bigger picture by fleshing out X’s narrative we don’t typically need the whole of X’s story, we need just enough to see the relevant connections. But for Stueber, apparently even having the whole story would not suffice. Even if we had the full details of X’s story—in every detail and particularity—we wouldn’t be able to understand X’s reasons; that is, until we also “put ourselves” in X’s shoes. For <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1754073911421384">Stueber (2012)</xref>, using all of this “information” provided by the narrative could provide a frame for making the relevant adjustments that would allow us to do just that.</p>
<p>A great deal in this debate hangs on what we mean by “understanding a reason.” Note that it seems perfectly possible to understand someone’s reason without endorsing it. We can understand someone’s reason while still finding it strange, unattractive, or repugnant to our moral sensibilities (as in the—hopefully, imaginary—case of the student who desires to shoot his professor; or that of a suicide bomber). There is no doubt that more needs to be said about what that involves and what goes on in the closely connected phenomenon of imaginative resistance (for a good discussion see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1754073911421384">Currie, 2010</xref>, Chapter 6). But careful scrutiny of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1754073911421384">Stueber’s (2012)</xref> article reveals only the repeated claim that understanding reasons, in folk psychological fashion, essentially requires reenactment. What are not provided are compelling arguments or examples to support that claim.</p>
