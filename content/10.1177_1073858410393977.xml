<abstract>
<p>Multiple plasma membrane proteins such as ion transporters and ion channels are involved in electrogenesis by setting resting membrane potentials and triggering/propagating action potentials. Recent findings strongly suggest that some of these membrane proteins are selectively transported into membrane microdomains termed <italic>lipid rafts</italic>. There appear to be multiple mechanisms for the specific protein translocation to lipid rafts, and many of these proteins exhibit distinct properties when inserted into the raft microdomains. Here the authors review the plasma membrane ion channels specifically localized at membrane lipid rafts in neurons. The mechanisms to selectively translocate these molecules to the lipid rafts and the consequences of the trafficking are also discussed.</p>

<body>
<p>Neurons, like all types of cells, exhibit a negative potential difference inside the cells compared with the outside in their resting state. This is a result of an uneven distribution of ions across the plasma membrane and is called the resting membrane potential. The resting membrane potential is established by electrogenic carriers and the permeability of ions through channels. The plasma membrane Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase pumps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1073858410393977">Fig. 1A</xref>) maintain intracellular Na<sup>+</sup> concentration low and K<sup>+</sup> high (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1073858410393977">Stahl and Harris 1986</xref>). Because the K<sup>+</sup> permeability is much higher than the Na<sup>+</sup> on the plasma membrane, due to the presence of K<sup>+</sup> leak channels, passive diffusion of K<sup>+</sup> ions occurs according to the K<sup>+</sup> concentration gradient. This phenomenon further contributes to set the negative membrane potential of neurons. An action potential occurs when a depolarizing stimulus causes voltage-gated Na<sup>+</sup> channels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1073858410393977">Fig. 1C</xref>) to open, and the influx of Na<sup>+</sup> ions causes further depolarization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1073858410393977">Momin and Wood 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1073858410393977">Waxman 2000</xref>). Although Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase pumps, K<sup>+</sup> leak channels, and voltage-gated Na<sup>+</sup> channels play key roles in setting the resting membrane potentials and initiation/propagation of action potentials, some other membrane proteins, such as voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels and ionotropic glutamate receptors, also play important roles in controlling excitability of neurons. All of these proteins need to be precisely localized in certain areas of the plasma membrane to ensure efficient electrogenesis.</p>

<p>Lipid rafts are defined as plasma membrane microdomains, which contain considerably higher levels of both cholesterol and sphingomyelin compared with the bulk membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1073858410393977">Simons and Ikonen 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1073858410393977">Fig. 2</xref>). The phospholipids enriched in lipid rafts contain a high amount of saturated acyl chains that allow the raft regions to be tightly packed. The relative abundance of cholesterol and hydrogen bonding between sphingolipid head groups contributes to this phenomenon. These physical properties define the ability of lipid rafts to be resistant to nonionic detergents, such as Triton X-100, at 4 °C. Lipid rafts exist in a liquid ordered phase and selectively attract and concentrate proteins that have been acylated with saturated lipids during their posttranslational modification. Caveolae are a subset of lipid rafts, first described by Yamada in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1073858410393977">1955</xref> as “small cave-like indentations of the cell wall” as observed by electron microscopy. Caveolae are often seen as 50- to 100-nm pits of the plasma membrane, are enriched in sphingolipids and cholesterol, and are distinguished by the presence of caveolin. Lipid rafts have been linked to many vital cell processes such as trafficking, cell signaling, and membrane protein sorting. Several transmembrane proteins such as caveolin 2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1073858410393977">Fujimoto and others 2001</xref>) and G-protein–coupled receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1073858410393977">Seno and others 2001</xref>) have been shown to be selectively transported to the lipid rafts, where they exhibit specific roles.</p>

<title>Ion Channels</title>
<p>Ion channels control the excitability of neurons, and their subcellular localization determines the specific electrical properties of different regions of neurons (e.g., dendritic tree, soma, axonal initial segment, nodes of Ranvier). To date, several ion channels have been reported to associate with lipid rafts and to be either directly or indirectly modulated by this association. Ion channels can be divided into different classes according to their gating mode, ion selectivity, function, and structure. In the following sections, examples of ion channels associated with lipid rafts will be discussed.</p>

<title>Proteins Involved in Setting Membrane Potential</title>
<p>Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase pumps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1073858410393977">Fig. 1A</xref>) play the main role in setting the resting membrane potential by pumping against the electrochemical gradient three Na<sup>+</sup> out and two K<sup>+</sup> into the cells, and they are the main source of energy expenditure in neurons (approximately 50%; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1073858410393977">Stahl and Harris 1986</xref>). In cerebellar granule cells, the Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase pumps have been described to localize in clusters on the cell membrane and to reside in Brij 98 detergent-resistant membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1073858410393977">Dalskov and others 2005</xref>), thus indicating that Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase pumps are localized in lipid rafts. The physiological meaning of the association between Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase pumps and lipid rafts has not been addressed in this study. Although the precise mechanism of targeting Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase pumps to lipid rafts is unknown, the authors speculated that Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase pumps themselves recruit the surrounding membrane lipids and thus function as a core for raft formation and a focal contact between the pump and the cytoskeleton, as opposed to a scenario in which membrane proteins are targeted to preexisting lipid rafts. Together with Na<sup>+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup>, Cl<sup>−</sup> ions are involved in setting the resting membrane potential of neuronal cells. Two transporters regulate the concentration of Cl<sup>−</sup> across the plasma membrane: the K<sup>+</sup>-Cl<sup>−</sup> (KCC2) and the Na<sup>+</sup>-K<sup>+</sup>-2Cl<sup>−</sup> (NKCC1) co-transporters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1073858410393977">Delpire 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1073858410393977">Fig. 1B</xref>). In mature brain neurons, KCC2 and NKCC1 show different patterns of segregation, with NKCC1 enriched in lipid rafts and KCC2 distributed both in lipid rafts and the non–lipid raft (soluble) fractions. This dual segregation appears to have a functional role as disruption of lipid rafts alters the transport activity of these proteins. The combined activity of methyl-β-cyclodextrin (MβCD), a drug that depletes cholesterol from the membrane and disassembles lipid rafts, and sphingomyelinase in heterologous cells expressing the transporters had opposite effects on the transporters, with KCC2 being potentiated and NKCC1 becoming less active. It also led to a redistribution of the transporters into larger clusters at the level of the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1073858410393977">Hartmann and others 2009</xref>). This study clearly shows how protein function can be modulated by sorting the proteins between the lipid raft microdomains and the bulk membrane. Further supporting the evidence of KCC2 being segregated into lipid rafts, another study demonstrated that KCC2 associates with lipid rafts in clusters in hippocampal neurons. This association between KCC2 and lipid rafts appears to be dependent on the integrity of lipid rafts and on the phosphorylation of KCC2, which occurs at Tyr-1087 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1073858410393977">Watanabe and others 2009</xref>).</p>

<title>Voltage-Gated Ion Channels</title>
<p>Among the ion channels, there is a group of proteins that are gated by voltage changes across the plasma membrane, and they are therefore referred to as <italic>voltage-gated ion channels</italic>. They are transmembrane proteins expressed throughout the nervous system, and they all are thought to have originated from a common ancestor. Apart from a few examples (e.g., K<sub>V</sub>2.1; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1073858410393977">Long and others 2005</xref>), the structure of these channels can be predicted only because their x-ray crystal structures have not been reported yet. These channels contain one or more “voltage-sensing” domain, which upon a change of the membrane potential alters its orientation, leading to a change in the structure of the channel. In the opened state, the channels mediate the ion flux according to the existing electrochemical gradient. Based on their ion selectivity, voltage-gated ion channels can be further classified into sodium, potassium, or calcium channels. To date, a few of these channels have been reported to associate with lipid rafts and to be modulated by such association.</p>
<sec id="section4-1073858410393977">
<title>Voltage-Gated Sodium Channels</title>
<p>Voltage-gated sodium channels (VGSCs) are a group of highly conserved channels that share a similar structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1073858410393977">Fig. 1C</xref>). VGSCs are composed of a large, sodium-conducting, main α-subunit (each one made of four domains comprising six transmembrane segments), which associates with single transmembrane β-subunits. In mammals, there are nine classic VGSCs (Na<sub>V</sub>1.1–1.9), each one with specific tissue distributions and electrophysiological and pharmacological properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1073858410393977">Waxman 2000</xref>). These channels are directly involved in the generation and propagation of action potentials in the nervous system (e.g., Na<sub>V</sub>1.2 and Na<sub>V</sub>1.6) and muscle tissues (e.g., Na<sub>V</sub>1.4 and Na<sub>V</sub>1.5). To date, one sodium channel, Na<sub>V</sub>1.5, has been reported to reside in lipid rafts, and our unpublished data suggest a functional association between Na<sub>V</sub>1.8 and rafts.</p>
<p>Na<sub>V</sub>1.5 is mainly expressed in the cardiac tissue, where it triggers action potentials and supports their propagation through the tissue. Mutations of this channel have been linked to several pathological conditions including failure of cardiac conduction, long QT syndrome 3, and ventricular fibrillation. Caveolae-type lipid rafts in the heart are thought to be implicated in the modulation of sodium currents by regulating the trafficking of the channel to and from the membrane. Na<sub>V</sub>1.5 copartitions with Caveolin-3, a marker of Caveolae-type lipid rafts, when extracted with a detergent-free method from myocytes. It is also reported that Caveolin-3 specifically takes part in the β-adrenergic stimulation-mediated increase in sodium currents in the heart (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1073858410393977">Yarbrough and others 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>Na<sub>V</sub>1.8 is expressed in nociceptors, primary sensory neurons whose axons originate from the cell bodies located in dorsal root ganglia (DRG), and is responsible for the detection of painful stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1073858410393977">Okuse 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1073858410393977">Okuse and others 1997</xref>). Na<sub>V</sub>1.8 plays a key role in controlling the excitability of these neurons, being responsible for the majority of Na<sup>+</sup> influx during action potentials in nociceptive sensory neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1073858410393977">Momin and Wood 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1073858410393977">Rush and others 2007</xref>). Na<sub>V</sub>1.8 has been proven to have a role in inflammatory conditions and in neuropathic pain states, which currently lack truly effective treatments. We hypothesized that lipid rafts on unmyelinated primary sensory axons act as a platform in the plasma membrane, where Na<sub>V</sub>1.8 can be clustered to a density that is sufficient to underlie action potentials generation by mimicking the nodes of Ranvier in myelinated axons. Our unpublished data, obtained by using OptiPrep-gradient ultracentrifugation, indicate that Na<sub>V</sub>1.8 resides both in the non–lipid raft and lipid raft fractions from freshly extracted DRG neurons. Interestingly, Na<sub>V</sub>1.8 appears to partition into lipid rafts fraction upon culture of DRG neurons in the presence of nerve growth factor. It is also confirmed that Na<sub>V</sub>1.8 localizes specifically in the lipid rafts fractions of rat sciatic nerves. Cholera Toxin β subunit, a marker for lipid rafts, showed a distinct punctate pattern at regular intervals along the neurites of cultured DRG neurons and colocalized with Na<sub>V</sub>1.8 visualized with anti-Na<sub>V</sub>1.8 antibody (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1073858410393977">Pristerá and Okuse 2008</xref>). We also found that disruption of the lipid rafts in cultured sensory axons by MβCD caused remarkable reduction in both the conduction velocity and the number of cells responsive to mechanical and chemical stimuli using calcium-sensitive dye fluo-4 and confocal live cell imaging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1073858410393977">Pristerá and Okuse 2009</xref>). This result indicates that Na<sub>V</sub>1.8 functions properly only when it is clustered in lipid rafts.</p>
<p>We previously showed that p11, annexin II light chain, binds directly to the N-terminus of Na<sub>V</sub>1.8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1073858410393977">Poon and others 2004</xref>) and is necessary to functionally expose Na<sub>V</sub>1.8 onto the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1073858410393977">Okuse and others 2002</xref>). Interestingly, NaV1.8 and p11 share the same pattern of staining and degree of association with lipid rafts in a DRG primary culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1073858410393977">Pristerá and Okuse 2008</xref>). As p11 is known to form a tetramer with p36, annexin II heavy chain, and localizes at lipid rafts, the interaction with p11 may cause not only the membrane translocation of NaV1.8 but also specific transport of the complex to the lipid rafts. It should also be noted that many other molecules have been identified as interactors for NaV1.8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1073858410393977">Malik-Hall and others 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1073858410393977">Swanwick, Pristerá, and others 2010</xref>). We have recently reported that one of these molecules, PDZD2, a multiple PDZ-binding domain protein, also acts as a necessary factor for NaV1.8 to be functionally expressed on the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1073858410393977">Shao and others 2009</xref>). PDZD2 may also account, with other proteins, for the compartmentalization of NaV1.8 into the lipid rafts.</p>

<sec id="section5-1073858410393977">
<title>Voltage-Gated Potassium Channel</title>
<p>Voltage-gated potassium channels are composed of α subunits, each with six transmembrane domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1073858410393977">Fig. 1D</xref>), which assemble as a homo- or hetero-tetramer to form the ion conductive pore. The α subunits associate with auxiliary β subunits that regulate the channel activity. Because of the presence of multiple genes and splicing variants for the α subunits, many different potassium channels (e.g., delayed rectifier, rapidly inactivating and inward rectifying channels) can be found in the nervous system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1073858410393977">Gutman and others 2005</xref>). K<sub>V</sub>2.1 is a member of the Shab-like potassium channel group that is thought to be responsible for the repolarization of the membrane after an action potential due to its electrophysiological features and kinetics. It is expressed in the brain and localizes preferentially to the dendritic compartment of neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1073858410393977">Lim and others 2000</xref>). K<sub>V</sub>2.1 is mostly associated with non–caveolae-type lipid rafts both in brain neurons and when expressed in heterologous systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1073858410393977">Martens and others 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1073858410393977">Figs. 3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1073858410393977">3C</xref>). Depletion of membrane cholesterol by 2-hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin leads to altered buoyancy and electrophysiological properties of K<sub>V</sub>2.1. In fact, the K<sub>V</sub>2.1 steady-state inactivation curve is shifted toward more hyperpolarized values, while its current density and activation kinetics are unchanged (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1073858410393977">Martens and others 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1073858410393977">Fig. 3B</xref>). Interestingly, another channel, K<sub>V</sub>4.2, has been investigated and was shown not to partition into lipid rafts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1073858410393977">Martens and others 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1073858410393977">Fig. 3C</xref>). This evidence suggests that lipid rafts may act as platforms for localizing and activating the channels and can selectively regulate the subcellular localization of different isoforms to shape the excitability of the neurons. It has been hypothesized that the K<sub>V</sub>2.1-raft complex facilitates the interaction between K<sub>V</sub>2.1 and signaling molecules known to be enriched in rafts such as kinases. The authors also conjectured that the transmembrane regions of K<sub>V</sub>2.1 may contain the information that determines lipid raft association as discussed previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1073858410393977">Scheiffele and others 1997</xref>), because they found that the cytoplasmic N- and C-terminal domains of K<sub>V</sub>2.1 are not required for targeting to lipid rafts (unpublished data).</p>

<p>In another report, cellular localizations of K<sub>V</sub>1.4 and K<sub>V</sub>4.2 were examined. The former is localized in axons and contributes to action potential repolarization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1073858410393977">Debanne and others 1997</xref>), whereas the latter is confined to the soma and dendrites, where it contributes to set the excitability of the postsynaptic compartments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1073858410393977">Hoffman and Johnston 1998</xref>). K<sub>V</sub>1.4, K<sub>v</sub>4.2 (in contrast with the previous study), and the scaffolding protein PSD-95 were all found in lipid rafts in rat brain membranes. Although both channels, in a heterologous system, have the ability to traffic to lipid rafts in the absence of PSD-95, co-expression of PSD-95 further promoted the association of K<sub>v</sub>1.4 with lipid rafts, whereas PSD-95 did not affect the trafficking of K<sub>v</sub>4.2. In addition, the PDZ binding motif present in both channels appears to play a key role in the channel trafficking because its deletion leads to a robust decrease in rafts association (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1073858410393977">Wong and Schlichter 2004</xref>). Another voltage-dependent potassium channel, K<sub>v</sub>1.3, has also been discovered to partition into lipid rafts. K<sub>v</sub>1.3 is thought to affect the neuronal firing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1073858410393977">Kupper and others 2002</xref>) and has been reported to be expressed in the presynaptic terminals of brain stem auditory system neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1073858410393977">Gazula and others 2010</xref>) and in postganglionic sympathetic neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1073858410393977">Doczi and others 2008</xref>). When expressed in HEK cells, K<sub>v</sub>1.3 is trafficked to lipid rafts, and KCNE4, a single transmembrane β subunit of voltage-gated potassium channels, modulates its trafficking between the endoplasmic reticulum and the raft domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1073858410393977">Sole and others 2009</xref>). KCNE subunits also regulate the trafficking to lipid rafts of K<sub>v</sub>7.1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1073858410393977">Roura-Ferrer and others 2010</xref>). Even though the channel’s partition into rafts has not been studied in neurons, a potentially similar mechanism could exist in the nervous system. In DRG neurons, lipid rafts may play a role in the functional coupling between K<sub>v</sub>7.2/3 and muscarinic acetylcholine receptors. These channels contribute to the subthreshold excitability of the neurons where they are expressed, by underlying slowly activating and deactivating currents (M-currents). Lipid raft disruption by MβCD abolishes the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor–mediated suppression of the M currents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1073858410393977">Oldfield and others 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>A few studies have also highlighted a potential role for lipid rafts in the stabilization of potassium channels at the paranodes along myelinated axons. The paranodes flank the nodes of Ranvier and are rich with clustered Shaker-type potassium channels, whereas sodium channels are excluded from them and instead concentrated in the nodal region. The correct assembly of these structures is crucial for an efficient propagation of action potentials. A complex feedback between glial cells and neurons is the key for the development of the correct morphology of nodes and paranodes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1073858410393977">Poliak and Peles 2003</xref>), and lipid rafts are thought to participate in the maintenance of such structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1073858410393977">Schafer and others 2004</xref>). A proteomic analysis has revealed that many paranode-associated proteins are clustered at lipid rafts in this region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1073858410393977">Ogawa and Rasband 2009</xref>). In addition, the paranodal junctions in mice lacking the β1, 4-N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase, a key enzyme in the synthesis of gangliosides (lipids enriched in lipid rafts), have an altered composition of lipid rafts and display an abnormal morphology and mislocalization of K<sub>v</sub>1.2. The overall effect of these abnormalities is reflected by impaired action potential conduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1073858410393977">Susuki and others 2007</xref>).</p>

<title>Voltage-Gated Calcium Channel</title>
<p>Similarly to sodium and potassium channels, voltage-gated calcium channels are opened upon membrane depolarization and mediate influx of Ca<sup>2+</sup>. In the nervous system, Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx triggers neurotransmitter release and modulates cell excitability. The Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry also initiates calcium-dependent intracellular pathways that result in long-term changes such as synaptic plasticity. Voltage-gated calcium channels are composed of a large α<sub>1</sub> subunit that determines the main properties (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1073858410393977">Fig. 1C</xref>) and auxiliary proteins, α<sub>2</sub>δ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1073858410393977">Fig. 1E</xref>), β and γ which tune their electropophysiological features and trafficking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1073858410393977">Cao 2006</xref>). To date, the α<sub>2</sub>δ-2 subunit has been found to partition into lipid rafts and to regulate the channel’s function. In mouse cerebellum preparation, total α<sub>2</sub>δ-2 and a portion of Ca<sub>V</sub>2.1 co-partition with lipid rafts, suggesting α<sub>2</sub>δ-2 may help trafficking of Ca<sub>V</sub>2.1 into lipid rafts. The association with lipid rafts has been further investigated in a heterologous system, and it has been found that lipid raft disruption potentiates the calcium currents mediated by the Ca<sub>V</sub>2.1 α<sub>1</sub> subunit when it is co-expressed with the auxiliary proteins α<sub>2</sub>δ-2 and β4. An important finding of clinical relevance is that the affinity of gabapentin, a drug administered to treat neuropathic pain conditions, to the α<sub>2</sub>δ-2 subunit is enhanced in lipid rafts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1073858410393977">Davies and others 2006</xref>).</p>

<title>Ligand-Gated Ion Channels</title>
<p>Ligand-gated ion channels are a large and diverse family of channels that are opened upon binding of a ligand to a specific site of the protein. Usually, the effect of binding translates into a conformational change, which leads to channel gating. The output can be either excitatory or inhibitory depending on the identity of the channel and nature of the ions. Ligand-gated ion channels can be modulated by other molecules different from the ligand, such as ions, toxins, and drugs, and an increasing number of studies are pointing to a role of lipid rafts in the regulation of their activity. The following section will describe a few examples of such interaction.</p>
<sec id="section8-1073858410393977">
<title>NMDA Receptor</title>
<p>N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors are ligand-gated cation channels that open upon binding of glutamate and glycine. They are heterotetramers composed of two NR1 and two NR2 subunits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1073858410393977">Fig. 1F</xref>) that are present as multiple isoforms in different regions of the nervous system. The NMDA receptors show the unique ability, among ligand-gated channels, to be also voltage dependent. Upon depolarization, the Mg<sup>2+</sup> ion block is released, and the channel increases its permeability for Na<sup>+</sup> and Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions. NMDA-mediated cation fluxes take part in the creation of both excitatory postsynaptic potentials and synaptic plasticity, which has a fundamental role in learning, memory, and pain states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1073858410393977">Dingledine and others 1999</xref>). A few studies have highlighted the role of the association of NMDA receptors with lipid rafts and how this is dynamically regulated. By using a yeast two-hybrid system, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1073858410393977">Swanwick and others (2009)</xref> demonstrated that the NMDA receptor subunit NR2B binds to lipid raft markers Flotillin-1 and Flotillin-2, whereas NR2A binds only to Flotillin-1. The same group later showed that Flotillin-1 drives the formation of glutamatergic synapses in hippocampal neurons, colocalizes with synaptic NMDA receptors, and regulates the firing frequency of these synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1073858410393977">Swanwick, Shapiro, and others 2010</xref>). The partition of NMDA receptors between the postsynaptic density and lipid rafts has been found to be developmentally regulated in the brain. The amount of both NR2A and NR2B subunits increases during the first three weeks postnatally, with NR2A already associating with lipid rafts after birth and with NR2B gradually being transported to lipid rafts over three weeks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1073858410393977">Besshoh and others 2007</xref>). In addition, the dynamic shift between postsynaptic density and lipid rafts has been described in a pathological condition. In a model of transient cerebral ischemia, it has been found that NR1 and NR2 subunits increase their phosphorylation levels, and the proportion found in lipid rafts is decreased while it is augmented at the postsynaptic density (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1073858410393977">Besshoh and others 2005</xref>). In addition, the partitioning of NMDA receptors is regulated during memory formation, as shown by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1073858410393977">Delint-Ramirez and others (2008)</xref>, who demonstrated that NR1, NR2A, and NR2B subunits quickly move to lipid rafts during the learning of a spatial task.</p>
<p>The trafficking between the postsynaptic density and lipid rafts of NMDA receptors could be partly mediated by the association between the intracellular portion of NR2 subunits and the scaffolding protein PSD-95, which contains the PDZ domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1073858410393977">Delint-Ramirez and others 2010</xref>).</p>

<title>AMPA Receptor</title>
<p>AMPA (α-amino-3-hydroxyl-5-methyl-4-isoxazole-propionate) receptors are non-NMDA, glutamate binding, cation channels. They are heterotetrameric proteins, composed of isoforms GLU1-4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1073858410393977">Fig. 1F</xref>), and they underlie fast electric transmission in glutamatergic synapses in the central nervous system. Several studies have focused on the trafficking of these channels to the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1073858410393977">Choquet 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1073858410393977">Kessels and Malinow 2009</xref>), and a few groups have highlighted a role for lipid rafts in their functional sorting. An early report described the presence of the four GLU subunits in dendritic rafts of forebrain neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1073858410393977">Suzuki and others 2001</xref>). Hippocampal neurons contain lipid rafts in the dendritic tree, and they are crucial for the maintenance of the normal morphology and the number of the dendritic spines. In addition, a portion of AMPA receptors localizes in these domains, and the stability of rafts is important for the stabilization of AMPA receptor clusters on the membrane. In fact, lipid raft depletion leads to a reduction of AMPA receptor molecules on the membrane, both in basal and AMPA-stimulated neurons, due to their recruitment into the endocytotic pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1073858410393977">Hering and others 2003</xref>). The presence of lipid rafts in hippocampal neurons has been confirmed by another study. Lipid rafts were imaged both in fixed cells and in live cells by monitoring the GM1 ganglioside and a modified form of green fluorescent protein (GFP), which partition into lipid rafts (GFP-glycosylphosphatidylinositol), respectively. AMPA receptors were found in lipid rafts, and this association has been proven to be modulated by NMDA receptors. This finding provides a regulatory loop between the two receptors, which segregate to lipid rafts. When NMDA receptors are activated, more AMPA receptors are trafficked to the lipid rafts, and this effect is mediated by the nitric oxide synthase pathway. The integrity of lipid rafts is important for the correct insertion of the AMPA receptors into the membrane. Lipid raft disruption with MβCD reduced the amount of AMPA receptors on the membrane, and this effect was attributed to impairment in the rate of translocation of the molecules to the membrane rather than an increased rate of endocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1073858410393977">Hou and others 2008</xref>).</p>

<title>Acetylcholine Receptor and 5-Hydroxytryptamine type 3 (5-HT<sub>3</sub>) Receptor</title>
<p>Motor nerves trigger muscle contraction through the neuromuscular junction, a specialized synapse that connects neurons and skeletal muscles. Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (AChRs; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1073858410393977">Fig. 1G</xref>) bind to endogenous acetylcholine and allow movement of cations, which depolarize the postsynaptic cells. AChRs determine an excitatory postsynaptic potential in neurons and a muscle contraction in the case of myofibers. A hallmark of the neuromuscular junction is the clustering of AChRs in the postsynaptic membrane, which is needed for a correct function of the synapses, and lipid rafts play a role in clustering of the AChRs. It has been found that lipid rafts act as a platform that allows the dynamic molecular interactions between AChRs and their binding partners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1073858410393977">Pato and others 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1073858410393977">Zhu and others 2006</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1073858410393977">Pato and others (2008)</xref> proposed that AChR is targeted to the cell surface with MuSK, a tyrosine kinase receptor, and binding to agrin, a large proteoglycan, leads to MuSK phosphorylation, which subsequently causes recruitment of the downstream MuSK effector Cdc42 as well as the actin-nucleation factors N-WASP and Arp2/3. Finally, coalescence of microrafts via actin-based movement leads to the formation of AChR macroclusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1073858410393977">Fig. 4</xref>). Rafts also participate in the clustering of AChRs in neuronal presynaptic terminals, as in ciliary neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1073858410393977">Bruses and others 2001</xref>).</p>

<p>Serotonin receptor 5-HT<sub>3</sub> is structurally related to the AChRs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1073858410393977">Fig. 1G</xref>). It also acts as a cation channel that opens when the neurotransmitter serotonin binds to it and causes cell excitation. It is widely distributed in the nervous system and serves multiple functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1073858410393977">Barnes and others 2009</xref>).

Indeed, cholesterol depletion and raft disruption resulted in a reduction of the serotonin-induced current, concomitant with an alteration of the channel’s kinetics. Interestingly, raft disruption alters only the native properties of the channel and leaves serotonin-mediated currents unaffected in the presence of antidepressant drugs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1073858410393977">Nothdurfter and others 2010</xref>).</p>

<title>P2X3 and Acid-Sensing Ion Channel 3 (ASIC3)</title>
<p>P2X proteins are a group of nucleotide gated channels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1073858410393977">Fig. 1H</xref>). Upon binding to adenosine 5′-triphosphate (ATP), a conformational change opens the channel and allows an influx of Na<sup>+</sup> and Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions into the cells. P2X3 is a member of this group and is expressed in primary sensory neurons, where it is thought to sense tissue damage by binding to ATP released by necrotic/apoptotic cells. Its expression in primary sensory neurons, which are able to detect painful stimuli, makes P2X3 a potential target for analgesic drugs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1073858410393977">North 2002</xref>). Its association with rafts has been analyzed in different tissues and cell types, and P2X3 has been shown to partition into raft domains in cerebellar granule neurons and DRG. The meaning of this partition is yet to be determined, and functional studies have to be performed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1073858410393977">Vacca and others 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>ASIC3 is a cation channel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1073858410393977">Fig. 1H</xref>) gated by low pH and localizes at nerve terminals, where it is thought to act as a transducer of acidosis.

<title>Transient Receptor Potential (TRP) Channels</title>
<p>TRP channels are cation channels named after the spontaneous mutation <italic>trp</italic> in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> that is characterized by a transient response, compared with a continuous one, to a steady light stimulus. In mammals, there are more than 20 TRP channels, which share a six-transmembrane structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1073858410393977">Fig. 1I</xref>). Within this family, two channels have been reported to be modulated by lipid rafts: TRPV1 and TRPM8.</p>
<p>TRPV1 is expressed in the peripheral nervous system in DRG and trigeminal ganglia. It is a polymodal receptor involved in the transduction of noxious heat and painful stimuli and can be activated by the endogenous lipid anandamide, pH lower than 5.9, temperatures higher than 43 °C, and capsaicin, the component that confers chili peppers their hot taste. Once activated, it drives an inward current of cations, which depolarizes the cells and triggers action potentials. In DRG neurons, it has been found that cholesterol, an essential component of lipid rafts, is needed for the correct functioning of the channel. MβCD-treated DRG neurons have less TRPV1 trafficked to the membrane, and both capsaicin and protons evoke smaller currents when compared with control neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1073858410393977">Liu and others 2006</xref>). The functional interaction between TRPV1 and lipid rafts has been further investigated in trigeminal ganglia neurons. Different tools were employed to disrupt lipid rafts: MβCD, sphingomyelinase (a hydrolase enzyme involved in sphingomyelin metabolism), and d-threo-1-phenyl-2-decanoylamino-3-morpholino-1-propanol (an inhibitor for glycosphingolipids synthesis). Upon pretreatments with these reagents, capsaicin-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup>fluxes, imaged with a fluorescent indicator in live cells, were markedly diminished when compared with untreated trigeminal ganglia neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1073858410393977">Szoke and others 2010</xref>). In support of the link between lipid rafts and TRPV1 function, a recent study discovered that the inhibition of ganglioside synthesis leads to a reduction of capsaicin-responsive neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1073858410393977">Santha and others 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>TRPM8, like TRPV1 and other TRP channels, contributes to the transduction of thermal stimuli. TRPM8, unlike TRPV1, shows higher ion permeability at temperatures lower than 25 °C and is activated by substances such as menthol and icilin, which produce a sensation of cold. TRPM8 is also expressed in peripheral sensory ganglia, where it transduces cooling stimuli into an electric signal (i.e., depolarization). TRPM8 also associates with and is modulated by lipid rafts. In particular, TRPM8 cosegregates with Flotillin-1 in the lipid raft fractions of mouse DRG and HEK cells. Notably, the partition of TRPM8 into lipid rafts is linked to variable degrees of its glycosylation state, with the highly glycosylated form being preferentially targeted to rafts. Lipid raft disruption, by cholesterol depletion, increases the responsiveness of TRPM8 to menthol and cooling stimuli, suggesting that lipid rafts have an inhibitory role toward this channel. When the electrophysiological properties of the channel in MβCD-treated cells were examined, its temperature activation threshold was shifted to warmer temperatures, and the voltage dependence of activation shifted to a more negative value. Interestingly, the trafficking of the channel is unaffected in MβCD-treated cells, suggesting the lipid rafts directly modulate the gating properties of the channel rather than its amount on the membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1073858410393977">Morenilla-Palao and others 2009</xref>).</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Most of the work on lipid rafts has been traditionally conducted in epithelial, endothelial, and immune cells, and very little has been focused on the peripheral sensory nervous system since the concept of lipid rafts has emerged. Growing evidence indicates that some ion channels are specifically clustered at lipid rafts in neurons, and functional consequences of channel/raft complexes have been identified. In fact, approximately 300 articles have been published on neuronal lipid rafts to date, and more than half of them were published in the past 5 years. Nevertheless, precise mechanisms involved in the channels trafficking to lipid rafts need to be identified, as well as detailed functions of channel/raft complexes for a better understanding of the roles of lipid rafts in neurons. Recent advances in new optic technologies enabled us to monitor dynamics of lipid rafts and raft proteins at high temporal and spatial resolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1073858410393977">Simons and Gerl 2010</xref>). Understanding of the trafficking mechanisms and functional roles of channel/raft complexes may provide novel therapeutic targets for the treatment of neurological disorders.</p>
