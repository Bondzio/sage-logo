<abstract>
<p>This article makes the case for the socioemotional wealth (SEW) approach as the potential dominant paradigm in the family business field. The authors argue that SEW is the most important differentiator of the family firm as a unique entity and, as such, helps explain why family firms behave distinctively. In doing so, the authors review the concept of SEW, its different dimensions, and its links with other theoretical approaches. The authors also address the issue of how to measure this construct and offer various alternatives for operationalizing it. Finally, they offer a set of topics that can be pursued in future studies using the SEW approach.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Early studies in the family business field suffered from significant methodological problems and were largely descriptive and atheoretical. But as the field evolved and responded collectively to unceasing calls for theoretical rigor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0894486511435355">Chrisman, Chua, &amp; Sharma, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0894486511435355">Chrisman, Steier, &amp; Chua, 2008</xref>), scholars suggested a battery of paradigms for examining issues that were idiosyncratic to family-controlled firms. These paradigms were borrowed from other domains, primarily financial economics and strategic management, where the primary focus of attention was large publicly owned corporations with highly dispersed ownership. These included agency theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr100-0894486511435355">Morck &amp; Yeung, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr113-0894486511435355">Schulze, Lubatkin, Dino, &amp; Buchholz, 2001</xref>), stewardship theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr94-0894486511435355">Miller &amp; Le Breton-Miller, 2006a</xref>), and the resource-based view of the firm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0894486511435355">Habbershon &amp; Williams, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0894486511435355">Habbershon, Williams, &amp; MacMillan, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Although important insights have been derived from extensions and adaptations of these imported formulations to explain the behavior of family-controlled firms, much remains to be done, and the core issues that are unique to family firms (most of which are nonfinancial in nature) are at best tangential in these formulations. It is fair to say that the field lacks paradigmatic coherence and that much of the family business literature still retains a strong phenomenological flavor. We believe that “foreign” paradigms designed for organizations where economic instrumentality is assumed fall short of adequately dealing with the uniqueness of family firms. For family business studies, this practice has often led to contradictory empirical results, excessive reductionism, overlapping terminology, fragmented theoretical interpretations, and a forced application of borrowed logic to explain descriptive findings.</p>
<p>In response to this need, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0894486511435355">Gomez-Mejia, Haynes, Nuñez-Nickel, Jacobson, and Moyano-Fuentes (2007)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0894486511435355">Gomez-Mejia, Makri, and Larraza Kintana (2010)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0894486511435355">Berrone, Cruz, Gomez-Mejia, and Larraza-Kintana (2010)</xref>; and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0894486511435355">Gomez-Mejia, Cruz, Berrone, and De Castro (2011)</xref> suggested a new “homegrown” theoretical formulation within the family business field, which they called the socioemotional wealth (SEW) model. This model builds on the foundations of prior family firm studies. However, at the same time, it is firmly anchored in the behavioral tradition within the management field. Simply put, the SEW model suggests that family firms are typically motivated by, and committed to, the preservation of their SEW, referring to nonfinancial aspects or “affective endowments” of family owners. In this formulation, gains or losses in SEW represent the pivotal frame of reference that family-controlled firms use to make major strategic choices and policy decisions.</p>
<p>As is commonly the case with new theoretical approaches, the SEW model shows several benefits but at the same time poses important challenges, especially in its methodological application. Because of its recent addition to the family business literature, empirical studies using this model have relied on SEW as a latent explanatory construct (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0894486511435355">Gomez-Mejia et al., 2010</xref>), but the construct itself has not been directly measured. This article represents an important step in this direction. We explore the content structure of SEW as a construct and describe approaches to measure it better and capture its behavioral consequences. We also provide a set of research questions pertaining to SEW that might be used to guide future research.</p>
<p>We contribute to the current literature in three distinctive ways. First, we propose a set of dimensions of SEW based on prior research. We have labeled these dimensions as FIBER, which stands for <bold><italic>F</italic></bold><italic>amily control and influence</italic>, <bold><italic>I</italic></bold><italic>dentification of family members with the firm</italic>, <bold><italic>B</italic></bold><italic>inding social ties</italic>, <bold><italic>E</italic></bold><italic>motional attachment of family members</italic>, and <bold><italic>R</italic></bold><italic>enewal of family bonds to the firm through dynastic succession.</italic> Second, from an empirical perspective, we directly address what is perhaps the greatest challenge that the SEW model faces, that is, the operationalization of SEW, by proposing a set of items to capture the distinct dimensions of SEW, and we discuss some alternative ways for measuring them. These items are derived from the cross-disciplinary literature that has addressed various aspects of SEW. Last, we outline a set of research questions where the SEW model and the dimensions proposed here may be used as valuable analytical tools.</p>

<sec id="section2-0894486511435355">
<title>The Origin of the SEW Approach</title>
<p>There is general agreement in the field that family firms are not simply a unique phenomenological setting but are significantly different from nonfamily firms (for a recent review of literature, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0894486511435355">Gomez-Mejia, Cruz, et al., 2011</xref>). There is a large body of empirical evidence consistent with this statement across many countries, including Ireland (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr109-0894486511435355">Reid &amp; Adams, 2001</xref>), Israel (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-0894486511435355">Lauterbach &amp; Vaninsky, 1999</xref>), the United States (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0894486511435355">Chrisman, Chua, &amp; Litz, 2004</xref>), Germany and Switzerland (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr142-0894486511435355">Zellweger, Kellermanns, Chrisman, &amp; Chua, 2011</xref>), and Spain (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0894486511435355">Gomez-Mejia, Nuñez-Nickel, &amp; Gutierrez, 2001</xref>), among others.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0894486511435355">Gomez-Mejia et al. (2007)</xref> developed a general “socioemotional wealth” model to explain many of these diverse findings. This model was created as a general extension of behavioral agency theory, formulated years earlier by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr132-0894486511435355">Wiseman and Gomez-Mejia (1998)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0894486511435355">Gomez-Mejia, Welbourne, and Wiseman (2000)</xref>Behavioral agency theory integrates elements of prospect theory, behavioral theory of the firm, and agency theory. Fundamental to this theory is the notion that firms make choices depending on the reference point of the firm’s dominant principals. These principals will make decisions in such a way that they preserve accumulated endowment in the firm. In the case of family principals, the emphasis on preserving SEW becomes critical. Hence, family owners frame problems in terms of assessing how actions will affect socioemotional endowment. When there is a threat to that endowment, the family is willing to make decisions that are not driven by an economic logic, and in fact the family would be willing to put the firm at risk if this is what it would take to preserve that endowment.</p>
<p>The socioemotional endowment is conceptualized in broad terms to capture the stock of affect-related value that a family derives from its controlling position in a particular firm. It includes the unrestricted exercise of personal authority vested in family members, the enjoyment of family influence over the business, and close identification with the firm that usually carries the family’s name (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0894486511435355">Gomez-Mejia et al., 2007</xref>). Although nonfamily principals and managers might experience some of this, “the value of socioemotional wealth to the family is more intrinsic, its preservation becomes an end in itself, and it is anchored at a deep psychological level among family owners whose identity is inextricably tied to the organization” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0894486511435355">Berrone et al., 2010</xref>, p. 87).</p>
<p>According to the logic of behavioral agency theory, given its pivotal utility to family principals, any threat to SEW means that the family is in a “loss mode” and, therefore, will make strategic choices that will avoid these potential SEW losses even if achieving this objective might come at the expense of other principals (e.g., institutional investors) who do not share in these SEW utilities. For the family principals, risk averseness to socioemotional endowment takes priority over risk averseness to financial losses. In contrast, agency arguments indicate that family principals would avoid strategic choices that carry a significant risk of financial losses because the family’s patrimony is largely tied to one firm. Hence, SEW preservation in a behavioral agency context contradicts a basic agency prediction: Insofar as SEW preservation is the primary reference point of family principals, and that strategic choices reducing the firm’s financial risk jeopardize that SEW, the family will opt for the SEW preservation alternative.</p>
<p>Although SEW may not be unique to an organizational context where family ties are present, for family principals and employees the firm becomes an integral and inescapable part of their lives. This contrasts with nonfamily shareholders or hired managers and employees for whom the relationship with the firm is more distant, transitory, individualistic, and utilitarian (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0894486511435355">Block, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0894486511435355">Chua, Chrisman, &amp; Sharma, 2003</xref>). In other words, as we argue next, SEW is the single most important feature of a family firm’s essence that separates it from other organizational forms.</p>
<sec id="section3-0894486511435355">
<title>Empirical Evidence in Support of the SEW Approach</title>
<p>In recent years, research by Gomez-Mejia and colleagues has provided overwhelming evidence that when issues are framed negatively by the family in terms of SEW losses, family principals tend to choose risky economic actions that preserve SEW. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0894486511435355">Gomez-Mejia et al. (2007)</xref> reported that family-owned olive oil mills prefer to remain independent and not join cooperatives even though the cooperative offers many financial benefits to the firm and greatly reduces firm risk. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0894486511435355">Jones, Makri, and Gomez-Mejia (2008)</xref> showed that family-controlled firms prefer to appoint affiliate directors to the board (those with business ties with the firm), even if this constrains the board’s ability to monitor management and provide independent advice. In the same vein, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0894486511435355">Cruz, Gomez-Mejia, and Becerra (2010)</xref> showed that family principals tend to create agency contracts for the top management team (TMT) that are more protective of their welfare when the team is composed of family members, even though this action is decoupled from firm performance.</p>
<p>Another set of empirical papers shows how SEW predicts distinctive strategic choices. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0894486511435355">Gomez-Mejia et al. (2010)</xref> reported that family-controlled firms tend to diversify less even though this implies greater business risk. The reason given is that diversification reduces the family’s SEW by having to appoint nonfamily members to various business units, reducing family influence over the units, decreasing centralization of decision making, and the like. Similar findings and arguments are given by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0894486511435355">Gomez-Mejia, Hoskisson, Makri, Sirmon, and Campbell (2011)</xref> for family firms operating in high-technology sectors when facing technological diversification decisions. The study shows that family-controlled firms are less likely to diversify technologically, even though this reduces firm risk. The reason is that technological diversification is framed negatively by the family principal in terms of SEW losses, because it usually forces the family to cede some ownership to parties outside the firm, such as venture capitalists or institutional investors.</p>
<p>Last, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0894486511435355">Berrone et al. (2010)</xref> reported that family-controlled firms in polluting industries tend to contaminate less in order to enhance the family’s image (i.e., to protect their SEW), particularly if the plants are geographically congregated in a particular community. They do so even when there are no obvious economic rewards derived from adopting such behavior.</p>
<p>Recently, the SEW has started taking hold in the field as some scholars adopted it as the main framework for their empirical studies. For instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr142-0894486511435355">Zellweger, Kellermanns, et al. (2011)</xref>, using a sample of Swiss and German family businesses, showed that as families’ intentions for transgenerational control increases, family owners will demand a higher price for selling the company to nonfamily actors. The authors argue that intentions for transgenerational control suggest that family owners count the future benefits of control as part of their socioemotional endowment. Consequently, selling the firm is an option only if family owners are commensurably compensated for the loss in SEW.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr96-0894486511435355">Miller, Le Breton-Miller, and Lester (2012)</xref> use the SEW approach to investigate whether or not the pursuit of SEW objectives leads to greater strategic conformity among large and publicly listed family firms. Their findings suggest that the more the family is implicated in ownership and management, the more likely is strategic conformity to occur. Following an SEW reasoning, they argue that family involvement is a signal to external stakeholders of family priorities on preserving SEW and requires family firms to put more efforts on achieving legitimacy by showing strategic conformity to industry norms.</p>
<p>The common theme across the studies noted above, consistent with the logic of the behavioral agency theory, is that in family-controlled organizations, the preservation of SEW represents a key noneconomic reference point for decision making, which might drive the firm to make strategic choices that cannot be explained by applying an economic reference point or a risk-averse financial logic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr142-0894486511435355">Zellweger, Kellermanns, et al., 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>As an extension of behavioral agency theory, some of the studies listed above allow for the existence among family principals of different reference points that might change depending on the external threats facing the firm (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0894486511435355">Gomez-Mejia et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0894486511435355">Gomez-Mejia, Cruz, et al., 2011</xref>). Although SEW preservation is the “higher order” reference point for the family principal, poor performance acts as an informational clue that alters the family owners’ loss framing. Poor performance raises the specter of a dual threat: the prospect of severe financial hardship to the family’s standard of living (because the family has most of its patrimony deposited in one organization) and the possibility of SEW extinction (because the firm might have to be sold, merge with another firm, be taken over by another firm, go bankrupt, be liquidated, and the like). Empirical results are consistent with a shifting reference point in family-controlled firms but only when the family is forced to reconsider SEW as the primary reference point.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0894486511435355">
<title>Advantages of the SEW Model</title>
<p>Because of its breadth and depth, the SEW construct has proven to be a good analytical lens for interpreting a wide variety of family firm phenomena. However, the SEW model is still in its infancy, and as it matures, it can be particularly advantageous for pursuing future research in the family business area. There are several interrelated reasons for this belief. First, as noted earlier, the SEW approach is firmly rooted in the behavioral agency theory, and hence, it has a strong conceptual base. Second, the SEW preservation notion does not reject the main argument of the agency perspective that indicates that family members can occasionally behave opportunistically. SEW suggests, however, that they do so to protect their socioemotional endowment even when this has a financial cost. As mentioned, the study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0894486511435355">Gomez-Mejia et al. (2007)</xref> found that family-controlled mills were 3 times less likely to join a cooperative (a rather lucrative option) than the non–family-controlled mills because doing so implied the loss of the family’s SEW.</p>
<p>The SEW model also helps explain anomalous results inconsistent with agency theory predictions by allowing differential risk preferences to family members. For instance, contrary to the conventional agency-based view (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0894486511435355">Anderson &amp; Reeb, 2003b</xref>), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0894486511435355">Gomez-Mejia et al. (2010)</xref>, applying the SEW approach, argue that family firms are willing to incur significant business risks if necessary by diversifying less in order to preserve SEW.</p>
<p>The SEW model also addresses one of the main flaws of agency theory, that is, it accounts for the collaborative behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr124-0894486511435355">Sundaramurthy &amp; Lewis, 2003</xref>) and the emotional aspects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0894486511435355">Baron, 2008</xref>) of family firms. In this regard, the SEW model is in line with some of the basic tenets of stewardship theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0894486511435355">Donaldson &amp; Davis, 1991</xref>). Unlike stewardship theory, however, the SEW model rejects the naïve assumption that family members do not pursue selfish objectives. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0894486511435355">Berrone et al. (2010)</xref> warned us, the SEW approach does not imply that family firms are self-sacrificial and/or ignore financial issues. The main point of SEW is that when there is high family involvement, firms are more likely to bear the cost and uncertainty involved in pursuing certain actions, driven by a belief that the risks that such actions entail are counterbalanced by noneconomic benefits rather than potential financial gains. It is also in line with recent studies that propose both (agency and stewardship) views to have an application to the family business context but under different circumstances, depending on the degree of embeddedness of family actors in the family and in the business (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-0894486511435355">Le Breton-Miller, Miller, &amp; Lester, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Last, since the SEW explains the behaviors in the decision-making process, it is informative regarding the seemingly mixed arguments suggesting that “familiness” can have both negative and positive impacts on firm outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0894486511435355">Habbershon &amp; Williams, 1999</xref>). However, most important of all for family business scholars is the fact that the SEW model largely relies on and is developed from the body of research in family business. This is relevant because, in contrast with other approaches that struggle to adjust their rationales to the context of family firms, the SEW model naturally stems from the reality of family businesses that suggest the existence of multiple salient goals that are driven by the values of the family and that change over time (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0894486511435355">Chua, Chrisman, &amp; Sharma, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr122-0894486511435355">Sorenson, Goodpaster, Hedberg, &amp; Yu, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr144-0894486511435355">Zellweger, Nason, Nordqvist, &amp; Brush, 2011</xref>). It also gathers insights and understanding from the large volume of research that has been created over the past three decades in the family business arena. From a disciplinary perspective, having a “homegrown” theoretical framework provides legitimacy and positions the area of family business studies as a rigorous, distinctive, and solid field. Together, all these benefits position the SEW approach as a potential dominant paradigm in the field.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0894486511435355">
<title>Dimensions of SEW</title>
<p>As noted earlier, SEW is an all-encompassing approach that captures the “affective endowment” of family owners, including the family’s desire to exercise authority, enjoyment of family influence, maintenance of clan membership within the firm, appointment of trusted family members to important posts, retention of a strong family identity, continuation of the family dynasty, and so on (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0894486511435355">Gomez-Mejia et al., 2007</xref>). Therefore, by its very nature, the concept of SEW is multidimensional. Because most prior research on SEW relied on archival data sources, secondary univariate measures (e.g., ownership distribution, percentage of family members in board, and CEO family status) have generally been used as proxies for the purported importance of SEW. Hence, prior research has not explored the dimensions of the SEW construct in detail. Based on the family business literature and basic social science disciplines that support it, our next task is to unravel and disentangle the various dimensions of SEW. We propose that there are five major dimensions of SEW that may be derived from prior research. We will collectively label these five dimensions as FIBER. We describe them below.</p>
<sec id="section6-0894486511435355">
<title>Family control and influence</title>
<p>The first dimension refers to the control and influence of family members. One key characteristic that distinguishes family firms is that family members exert control over strategic decisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0894486511435355">Chua et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr112-0894486511435355">Schulze, Lubatkin, &amp; Dino, 2003b</xref>). The power to control can be exerted directly, such as being CEO or chairman of the board, or more subtly by, for instance, appointing the TMT members. The control can be exerted by the original founder or by a dominant family coalition. The ability to exercise authority vested in family members can emanate from a strong ownership position, from an ascribed status, or from personal charisma. It is not uncommon to see family owners assuming multiple roles in the firms as a way of exerting formal and informal control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr101-0894486511435355">Mustakallio, Autio, &amp; Zahra, 2002</xref>). In any case, control and influence are an integral part of SEW and highly desired by family members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr142-0894486511435355">Zellweger, Kellermanns, et al., 2011</xref>). Put differently, to achieve the goal of preserving SEW, the family members require continued control of the firm. Therefore, family firms are more likely to perpetuate owners’ direct or indirect control and influence over the firm’s affairs regardless of financial considerations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0894486511435355">Gomez-Mejia et al., 2007</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0894486511435355">
<title>Family members’ identification with the firm</title>
<p>The second dimension addresses the close identification of the family with the firm. Numerous family business scholars contend that the intermeshing of family and business gives rise to an inherently unique identity within family firms (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0894486511435355">Berrone et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0894486511435355">Dyer &amp; Whetten, 2006</xref>). The identity of a family firm’s owner is inextricably tied to the organization that usually carries the family’s name. This causes the firm to be seen both by internal and external stakeholders as an extension of the family itself. Internally, this is likely to have a significant influence on the attitudes not only toward employees, for instance, but also toward other internal process and on the quality of the services and products they provide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0894486511435355">Carrigan &amp; Buckley, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr127-0894486511435355">Teal, Upton, &amp; Seaman, 2003</xref>). Externally, this makes family members quite sensitive about the external image they project to their customers, suppliers, and other external stakeholders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-0894486511435355">Micelotta &amp; Raynard, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Consistent empirical evidence is now available that suggests that because of the strong identification with the firm’s name and because public condemnation could be emotionally devastating for family members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr131-0894486511435355">Westhead, Cowling, &amp; Howorth, 2001</xref>), family firms exhibit higher levels of corporate social responsibility and community citizenship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0894486511435355">Berrone et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0894486511435355">Craig &amp; Dibrell, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0894486511435355">Dyer &amp; Whetten, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr107-0894486511435355">Post, 1993</xref>) and take particular care to perpetuate a positive family image and reputation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr116-0894486511435355">P. Sharma &amp; Manikuti, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr131-0894486511435355">Westhead et al., 2001</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section8-0894486511435355">
<title>Binding social ties</title>
<p>The third dimension refers to family firms’ social relationships. Recent research by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0894486511435355">Cruz, Justo, and De Castro (2012)</xref> argues that SEW provides kinship ties with some of the same collective benefits that arise in closed networks, including collective social capital, relational trust (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0894486511435355">Coleman, 1990</xref>), and feelings of closeness and interpersonal solidarity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr129-0894486511435355">Uzzi, 1997</xref>).</p>
<p>The reciprocal bonds seen within family business are not exclusively between family members but are likely to be extended to a wide set of constituencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-0894486511435355">Miller, Jangwoo, Sooduck, &amp; Le Breton-Miller, 2009</xref>). For instance, family firms often have time-honored vendors and suppliers, who may be viewed as, or might actually be, members of the family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr128-0894486511435355">Uhlaner, 2006</xref>). The family firms’ sense of belonging, self, and identity are often shared by nonfamily employees, promoting a sense of stability and commitment to the firm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr93-0894486511435355">Miller &amp; Le Breton-Miller, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Kin ties among members of the extended family are likely to engender strong social bonds with the community at large as well. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0894486511435355">Brickson (2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0894486511435355">2007</xref>) argued, given these reciprocal bonds in family businesses, one would expect these firms to pursue the welfare of those who surround them, even if there were no obvious transactional economic gains in doing so. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0894486511435355">Berrone et al. (2010)</xref> argued that family firms are deeply embedded in their communities and often sponsor associations and activities that are valued in the community, such as United Way, YMCA, charities, special events, and local sports teams. They might do this for altruistic reasons, for the enjoyment of receiving recognition for generous actions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr112-0894486511435355">Schulze et al., 2003b</xref>), or for both.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0894486511435355">
<title>Emotional attachment</title>
<p>The fourth dimension deals with the affective content of SEW and refers to the role of emotions in the family business context. Although emotions are an “integral and inseparable part of everyday organizational work” (Ashforth &amp; Humphrey, 1998, p. 98), in organizations where family relationships dominate, there is a longer history and knowledge of shared experiences and past events that converge to influence and shape current activities, events, and relationships. Indeed, many scholars see the intermingling of emotional factors originating from family involvement with business factors as a distinctive attribute of family firms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0894486511435355">Eddleston &amp; Kellermanns, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr126-0894486511435355">Taguiri &amp; Davis, 1996</xref>). By their own nature, families are characterized by a wide range of emotions, some of them positive, such as warmth, tenderness, love, consolation, and happiness, and others that are negative, such as anger, fear, loneliness, anxiety, sadness, disappointment, and depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0894486511435355">Epstein, Bishop, Ryan, Miller, &amp; Keitner, 1993</xref>). These emotions result from daily situations and are not static, as they emerge and evolve through more or less critical events in each family business system (succession, divorce, illness, family or business loss, economic downturn, etc.; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0894486511435355">Dunn, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0894486511435355">Gersick, Davis, Hampton, &amp; Lansberg, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr118-0894486511435355">Shepherd, Wiklund, &amp; Haynie, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Because the boundaries between family and corporation are rather blurred in family businesses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0894486511435355">Berrone et al., 2010</xref>), emotions permeate the organization, influencing the family business’s decision-making process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0894486511435355">Baron, 2008</xref>). At the same time, emotional attachment also refers to psychological appropriation of the firm by the family in order to maintain a positive self-concept. Because of the type of social links that family members have within and outside their firms (see next point), companies become the place where the needs for belonging, affect, and intimacy are satisfied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0894486511435355">Kepner, 1983</xref>). In other words, the family’s emotional attachment to the firm can “facilitate self-continuity by connecting a person with a desirable past self (e.g., memories), a present self (me now), or a future self (who I am becoming)” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-0894486511435355">S. S. Kleine, Kleine, &amp; Allen, 1995</xref>, p. 328). It also fosters the family’s sense of legacy, since the loss of the firm represents a highly emotional event for most owners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr116-0894486511435355">P. Sharma &amp; Manikuti, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr118-0894486511435355">Shepherd et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Unfortunately, despite the relevance of emotions for SEW and their prevalence in the family business setting, emotions and sentiments in family business research have been largely understudied. As noted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-0894486511435355">Labaki, Michael-Tsabari, and Zachary (in press)</xref>, emotions in the context of family firms are often discussed indirectly referring to issues that impact businesses, such as family conflicts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0894486511435355">Beehr, Drexler &amp; Faulkner, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0894486511435355">Danes, Zuiker, Kean &amp; Arbuthnot, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0894486511435355">Kellermanns &amp; Eddleston, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-0894486511435355">Lee &amp; Rogoff, 1996</xref>), personal relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0894486511435355">Kaye, 1996</xref>) and family culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0894486511435355">Danes, Lee, Stafford &amp; Heck, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0894486511435355">Dyer, 1986</xref>).” <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-0894486511435355">Labaki et al. (in press)</xref> also identified authors who proposed their own emotional constructs specific to the family business, such as emotional returns and costs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0894486511435355">Astrachan &amp; Jaskiewicz, 2008</xref>), emotional capital (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr115-0894486511435355">P. Sharma, 2004</xref>) and emotional value (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr141-0894486511435355">Zellweger &amp; Astrachan, 2008</xref>). Others have studied related constructs, such as trust (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr123-0894486511435355">Steier, 2001</xref>), altruism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0894486511435355">Eddleston &amp; Kellermanns, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr136-0894486511435355">Zahra, 2003</xref>), and benevolence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0894486511435355">Cruz et al., 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>This dimension is particularly useful in understanding why, under certain circumstances, family members take the opportunity to be altruistic to each other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr112-0894486511435355">Schulze et al., 2003b</xref>) or are more likely to consider family members as trustworthy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0894486511435355">Cruz et al., 2010</xref>). However, sentiments can also have a negative effect, making kin relations dysfunctional. Unlike nonfamily firms, however, where dysfunctional relationships and persistent conflicts often end with termination of the employment contract of the parties involved, in family firms, where the emotional attachment is high, conflictive relationships are preserved, perhaps involuntarily and in the hope that they will eventually return to a harmonious condition. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0894486511435355">Fletcher (2000)</xref> states, “The interpersonal linkages, emotional bondings and affectionate ties that characterize all firms are possibly more complex and embedded in family firms” (p. 164).</p>

<sec id="section10-0894486511435355">
<title>Renewal of family bonds to the firm through dynastic succession</title>
<p>The fifth and last dimension of SEW refers to the intention of handing the business down to future generations. Indeed, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr141-0894486511435355">Zellweger and Astrachan (2008)</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr142-0894486511435355">Zellweger, Kellermanns, et al. (2011)</xref> suggest this transgenerational sustainability as one of the central aspects of SEW.</p>
<p>This sense of dynasty has important implications for the time horizons in the decision-making process. From the perspective of a family shareholder, the firm is not just an asset that may be easily sold, since the firm symbolizes the family’s heritage and tradition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0894486511435355">Casson, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr125-0894486511435355">Tagiuri &amp; Davis, 1992</xref>). Consequently, family members view the firm as a long-term family investment to be bequeathed to descendants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0894486511435355">Berrone et al., 2010</xref>). Evidence shows that maintaining the business for future generations is commonly seen as a key goal for family firms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0894486511435355">Kets de Vries, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr142-0894486511435355">Zellweger, Kellermanns, et al., 2011</xref>) and that many family firms exhibit longer term planning horizons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr95-0894486511435355">Miller &amp; Le Breton-Miller, 2006b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr98-0894486511435355">Miller, Le Breton-Miller, &amp; Scholnick, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr120-0894486511435355">Sirmon &amp; Hitt, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Although the long-term view might foster some undesirable consequences, such as managerial entrenchment or conflicts over succession, it is well established in the family business literature that the preservation of the family dynasty, the perpetuation of family values through the business, and the intention to pass the business to subsequent generation foster a “generational investment strategy that creates patient capital” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr120-0894486511435355">Sirmon &amp; Hitt, 2003</xref>, p. 343), commitment to building capabilities, and learning.</p>

<title>Measuring Fiber Dimensions of SEW</title>
<p>Despite the demonstrated value of the SEW model, prior studies left out an important element for research, namely, mapping out the domain of SEW and developing instruments to assess its various dimensions. Either explicitly or implicitly, SEW has been used as a broad yet unitary explanatory construct without measuring it directly. The most common proxy used to capture the intensity of SEW in prior studies is rather coarse, namely, stock ownership in the hands of family members. There are good reasons to expect that the family’s SEW is enhanced as ownership increases. Different studies have shown that as concentration of firm ownership in family hands increases, the family has greater influence over the firm’s strategic decisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0894486511435355">Anderson &amp; Reeb, 2003a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr96-0894486511435355">Miller et al., 2012</xref>), reinforcing the control dimension of SEW (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0894486511435355">Gomez-Mejia et al., 2007</xref>), personal financial dependence, and the level of personal attachment, identification, and emotional bonds between family members and the firm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0894486511435355">French &amp; Rosenstein, 1984</xref>).</p>
<p>Although use of secondary proxies (e.g., percentage of shares owned by a family) may be a valid first-degree approximation to SEW, and perhaps the only available alternative when using large archival databases, they are unlikely to capture its full spectrum. For instance, sentiments, emotions, and relationships within the family controlling a firm may vary from one firm to another and, within the firm, from one point in time to another (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0894486511435355">Hoy &amp; Sharma, 2010</xref>), even with the same level of ownership. In other words, family firms are not a monolithic or homogeneous group of people with congruent interests, nor are all family businesses identical with respect to organizational characteristics and behaviors. Therefore, the issue of how to measure SEW deserves a closer look and a better assessment. Next, we discuss different approaches to addressing this methodological gap, namely, surveys, content analysis, laboratory experiments, and case studies.</p>
<sec id="section12-0894486511435355">
<title>Surveys</title>
<p>Although studies analyzing publicly traded family firms tend to rely mainly on archival data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0894486511435355">Anderson &amp; Reeb, 2003a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0894486511435355">2003b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0894486511435355">2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0894486511435355">Berrone et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0894486511435355">Gomez-Mejia et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr96-0894486511435355">Miller et al., 2012</xref>), questionnaires and surveys are widely used when studying privately held family firms (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0894486511435355">Beck, Debruyne, Janssens, &amp; Lommelen, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0894486511435355">Bettinelli, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr140-0894486511435355">Zellweger &amp; Dehlen, 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>At a theoretical level, among the drivers of noneconomic goals, scholars have proposed concepts such as altruism, fairness, justice, and generosity (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0894486511435355">Eaton, Yuan, &amp; Wu, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr113-0894486511435355">Schulze et al., 2001</xref>). Using surveys, empirical evidence has tried to measure the importance that family owners attach to noneconomic goals (vs. financial goals; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-0894486511435355">Lee &amp; Rogoff, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr126-0894486511435355">Taguiri &amp; Davis, 1996</xref>). To date, however, no attempt has been made to grasp the SEW construct using psychometric instruments. We believe that surveys can be appropriate tools for measuring SEW, given the extensive experience and knowledge that scholars in the field have gained over the past few years.</p>
<p>As a first approximation, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0894486511435355">Table 1</xref> presents a set of items that will be a useful base for conducting questionnaires and that are designed to capture the different dimensions of SEW. We generated 30 items thought to represent the five proposed FIBER dimensions of SEW drawn from previous studies. For each set of items, we indicate in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0894486511435355">Table 1</xref> a representative literature on which these proposed items are based. For instance, to build some of the items of our dimensions of emotional attachment and family identity, we used a modified version of some of the items included in the studies by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr103-0894486511435355">O’Reilly and Chatman (1986)</xref>, to reflect identification with the organization, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0894486511435355">Allen and Meyer (1990)</xref>, for organizational commitment. Moreover, we also draw on scales from the family business literature, such as the Family Business Commitment Questionnaire developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0894486511435355">Carlock and Ward (2001)</xref>, the F-PEC Scale for Family Businesses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-0894486511435355">S.

Thus, the FIBER scale is eclectic in its sources but soundly based on previous literature.</p>

</table-wrap-foot>
</table-wrap>
<p>Items were formulated at the individual level as we consider the individual family member as the appropriate unit of analysis on which to collect data. However, as mentioned before, the SEW construct is defined on the basis of a collective family identity, so questions were in most cases designed to capture individual perceptions about group (family) attitudes regarding the five dimensions described above.</p>
<p>Although the items proposed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0894486511435355">Table 1</xref> are based on prior research, they still need to be tested and to pass standard psychometric procedures (e.g., exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses) to verify the hypothesized content structure of SEW and ensure the items’ internal consistency and interrater reliability. This is an important agenda for future research since as stated by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr105-0894486511435355">Pearson and Lumpkin (2011)</xref>: “Without progress in developing psychometrically sound constructs and measures, we risk the credibility of the field as a whole” (p. 290).</p>
<p>Although survey instruments can be powerful tools, they can also have certain shortcomings. For instance, the responses to these questionnaires might be seriously biased, as respondents tend to present a socially desirable image of themselves or their firms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0894486511435355">Golden, 1992</xref>). Also, family business research often relies on convenient samples when conducting surveys, rather than purely random ones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr121-0894486511435355">Sonfield &amp; Lussie, 2004</xref>). This is problematic, as random samples are needed to properly perform factor analyses. Moreover, convenient samples can lead to problems of endogeneity, self-selection, omitted variables, and other such problems that tend to be quite common in the field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr130-0894486511435355">Villalonga &amp; Amit, 2006</xref>) and that only a few exceptions have fully addressed (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0894486511435355">Berrone et al., 2010</xref>). Scholars should be aware of these drawbacks and take the necessary steps to account for them. However, of necessity, family researchers often rely on convenient samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr121-0894486511435355">Sonfield &amp; Lussie, 2004</xref>), and therefore, efforts should be made to justify the selection on theoretical grounds rather than on statistical aptness, finding alternatives to surveys in those cases where questionnaires are unsuitable.</p>

<sec id="section13-0894486511435355">
<title>Content Analysis</title>
<p>Another potential approach is to use content analysis techniques to capture the FIBER dimensions of SEW. The use of content analysis implies the examination of narrative texts such as press releases, annual reports, mission statements, interview transcripts, shareholder letters, speeches, transcripts from recorded meetings, and other archival texts. Given that SEW is “anchored at a deep psychological level among family owners” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0894486511435355">Berrone et al., 2010</xref>, p. 87), content analysis could be used by family business scholars as it allows for the study of mental models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0894486511435355">Carley, 1997</xref>), perceptions, and beliefs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0894486511435355">D’Aveni &amp; MacMillan, 1990</xref>) that are generally difficult to obtain by other means. Although content analysis is increasingly used among organizational and strategic management scholars (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0894486511435355">Barr, Stimpert, &amp; Huff, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0894486511435355">Berrone &amp; Gomez-Mejia, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0894486511435355">Kabanoff, Waldersee, &amp; Cohen, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr106-0894486511435355">Phillips, 1994</xref>), its use in the family business context is just starting to grow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-0894486511435355">McKenny, Short, Zachary, &amp; Payne, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-0894486511435355">Micelotta &amp; Raynard, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr104-0894486511435355">Parmentier, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>There are other associated benefits of this methodology. For instance, compared with other techniques such as interviews, content analysis is recognized as a less obtrusive technique for capturing managerial cognitions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr106-0894486511435355">Phillips, 1994</xref>). In addition, content analysis tends to avoid recall biases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0894486511435355">Barr et al., 1992</xref>) and is a highly used means of obtaining otherwise unavailable information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0894486511435355">Kabanoff et al., 1995</xref>). Finally, gathering data through content analysis of organizationally produced texts has been encouraged because it allows for greater reliability and replicability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0894486511435355">Finkelstein &amp; Hambrick, 1996</xref>).</p>
<p>Despite its benefits, content analysis may be arduous, and researchers must go to great lengths to ensure reliability in data coding and subsequent analyses. To ameliorate these concerns, researchers use computer-aided content analysis for the coding of organizationally produced texts. As an illustration, we applied the content analysis program DICTION (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0894486511435355">R. P. Hart, 2000</xref>) to analyze proxy statements from 43 family-owned, publicly traded U.S. companies and their corresponding matched-pair sample of nonfamily firms (based on industry affiliation and return on assets). Unlike other content analysis software packages, DICTION not only relies on word count but also contains 31 predefined dictionaries that are based on different linguistic theories and applies artificial intelligence systems to understand the context of words and sentences.</p>
<p>In <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0894486511435355">Table 2</xref>, we indicate variables in our example for which there are significant statistical differences between family and nonfamily firms. We conducted this statistical test via a Student’s <italic>t</italic> test for independent samples, which is appropriate when the means for two independent groups need to be compared (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr133-0894486511435355">Wooldridge, 2000</xref>).</p>

<p>This illustration indicates that some DICTION variables may be useful for tapping the FIBER dimensions. For instance, family firms highlight temporal aspects, thereby signaling a concern for chronological matters. This is in line with the <italic>renewal of family bonds to firm through dynastic succession.</italic> Family firms also exhibit greater values in variables such as human interest, cooperation, and collectives. This is consistent with the <italic>binding social ties</italic> dimension of FIBER since, for instance, the human interest variable examines language involving family members and relations (cousin, wife, grandchild, uncle), and generic terms (friend, baby, human, people), whereas the collectives variable includes aspects of social groupings, task groups, and geographical entities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0894486511435355">R. P. Hart, 2000</xref>). Additionally, in agreement with the <italic>identification of family members with the firm</italic> and <italic>emotional attachment</italic>, family firms score higher in variables such as praise (indicating affirmations of some person, group, or abstract entity), denial (an important element defining narcissism; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0894486511435355">Brown, 1997</xref>), and embellishment.</p>
<p>We did not find any relevant variables to account for the <italic>family control and influence</italic> dimension. However, we believe that content analysis in general and the use of the DICTION program in particular might be an alternative to survey instruments to capture the proposed FIBER dimensions. The possibility of defining custom dictionaries opens a great avenue for future research. Scholars in family business research can further explore this custom dictionary feature to check for the relative frequency of words associated with the various proposed items under each of the FIBER dimensions. Moreover, given that DICTION variables can be applied to family and nonfamily firms, comparison of the five FIBER dimensions could potentially be performed not only within family firms but also relative to other organizational forms.</p>

<title>Other Alternatives</title>
<p>As argued before, the use of ownership as a proxy of SEW requires the strong assumption that variables have an isomorphic behavioral and emotional counterpart. There is a second problem with traditional studies using quantitative methods—which is that they use some variation of correlational methods, limiting causal inferences. One way to overcome these problems is by conducting laboratory experiments, where researchers can construct variables of interest and manipulate them in ways that isolate their effects and permit stronger inferences about their causal effects. This methodological choice may be particularly useful for testing and expanding one of the basic tenets of the SEW perspective. This refers to the argument that when family firms face the quandary of choosing between an action that would confer economic gains (but a subsequent deficit of SEW) and one that would protect SEW (but with uncertain economic benefits), they tend to favor the latter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0894486511435355">Berrone et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0894486511435355">Gomez-Mejia et al., 2010</xref>). However, this preference for SEW goals instead of financial objectives is unlikely to be monotonic and constant under any situation. Cases may arise in which a family firm’s attempts to protect and gain SEW could cause the firm to make decisions that drastically reduce firm economic value, even leading to the firm’s closure, and they may ultimately threaten the very SEW that such decisions are meant to preserve. In such extreme situations, SEW preferences may not be as influential as originally assumed and economic logic may take over (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0894486511435355">Gomez-Mejia, Cruz, et al., 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Although case studies are not a measurement technique per se, they can also be informative about the nature of SEW. This methodology might be useful for gaining a more profound understanding of certain situations involving SEW arguments. For instance, prior research has shown that the family’s desire to protect its SEW can lead to better environmental behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0894486511435355">Berrone et al., 2010</xref>). For this to happen, however, the family needs sufficient unconstrained discretion to impose its will on nonfamily shareholders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0894486511435355">La Porta, Lopez-de-Silanes, &amp; Shleifer, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr111-0894486511435355">Schulze, Lubatkin, &amp; Dino, 2003a</xref>). At low levels of control, even if the family were to have enough legitimacy and urgency to pursue environment-friendly policies, it might not enjoy sufficient control vis-à-vis other (nonfamily) shareholders in following this potentially riskier strategy. But as family involvement increases, the family’s views are likely to demand a greater deal of attention, and thus, the firm should be able to enforce environment-friendly policies with fewer constraints.</p>
<p>Additionally, because case studies recognize patterns of relationships among constructs within and across cases and their underlying logical arguments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr134-0894486511435355">Yin, 1994</xref>), they can be constructive in understanding the links between the different dimensions of SEW and how they interact in the decision-making process. Case studies also have certain advantages over other methodologies such as laboratory experiments. Although laboratory experiments isolate the phenomena from their context, case studies highlight the rich, real-world environment in which the phenomena take place (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0894486511435355">Eisenhardt &amp; Graebner, 2007</xref>). This is important for family research using the SEW approach because the context in which the firms operates is invariably intertwined, and boundaries between social environment, family, and business are rather blurred (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0894486511435355">Berrone et al., 2010</xref>). Finally, because of scholars’ frequent access restrictions to random or stratified samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr121-0894486511435355">Sonfield &amp; Lussie, 2004</xref>), case studies might be a more appropriate option than the use of convenient samples (and their undesirable consequences, such as biases, overestimations, error inflation, etc.) as case studies demand theoretical sampling; that is, cases are selected because they are particularly appropriate for understanding and extending relationships among constructs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0894486511435355">Eisenhardt &amp; Graebner, 2007</xref>).</p>

<title>Future Areas for Development of the SEW Approach</title>
<p>Although recent family business studies have provided new insights into family business and helped the field gain momentum, several dimensions of family firms remain unstudied. The SEW approach seems to be a suitable perspective for advancing the field because it depicts the uniqueness of the family firms’ identity through the consideration of noneconomic factors. But more research is needed to show the validity of this approach. A straightforward path would be to test the extent to which these five dimensions overlap although we believe that they are not redundant. Based on the recent review by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0894486511435355">Gomez-Mejia, Cruz, et al. (2011)</xref>, below we highlight those areas in which we believe devoting more energy and resources may be favorable to advancing the SEW approach.</p>
<sec id="section16-0894486511435355">
<title>The Role of Emotions and SEW</title>
<p>As mentioned before, despite the relevance of emotions for SEW, current family business literature is unable to explain how feelings and emotions affect the formation of SEW and how they affect the functioning of the family and the firm. Whereas the above studies are mainly focused on discussing positive aspects of SEW’s emotional aspects, such as joy at the achievement of the firm’s objectives or trust and harmony among family members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0894486511435355">Kets de Vries, 1993</xref>), family owners also experience negative aspects related to their affective experiences at the ownership level. For instance, family businesses are especially exposed to relationship conflicts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr141-0894486511435355">Zellweger &amp; Astrachan, 2008</xref>), which may have severe implications for the survival of their organizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0894486511435355">Davis &amp; Harveston, 2001</xref>) by creating incentives to sell out ownership stakes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0894486511435355">Beckhard &amp; Dyer, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-0894486511435355">Levinson, 1971</xref>) and by negatively affecting firm performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0894486511435355">Eddleston &amp; Kellermanns, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>At the same time, evidence suggests that the presence of emotions may also lead to increased role conflict among family employees. Unlike employees in nonfamily firms, family business members have the dual role of being a family member and a family firm employee, which may complicate the responsibilities of fulfilling both family and business expectations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0894486511435355">Gersick et al., 1997</xref>). Moreover, the influence of psychodynamic effects such as ownership dispersion, marital discord, sibling rivalry, and identity conflict (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0894486511435355">Dyer, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr113-0894486511435355">Schulze et al., 2001</xref>) elevates the complexity of multiple roles and multiple activities, thereby intensifying role conflict among family business members. Researchers suggest that role conflicts reduce job satisfaction and lower employees’ commitment, leading over time to a desire to leave the organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0894486511435355">Bedeian &amp; Armenakis, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr114-0894486511435355">Senatra, 1980</xref>). In the family firm, however, the high emotional attachment impedes family employees from leaving (what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0894486511435355">Gomez-Mejia, Larraza-Kintana, &amp; Makri, 2003</xref>, called the “family handcuff”) and thereby preserves conflicting relationships.</p>
<p>The previous discussion suggests that the emotional dimension of FIBER engenders both positive and negative aspects that may have important performance consequences that may be enduring, given the longer tenures of employment contracts within family firms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0894486511435355">Cruz et al., 2010</xref>). Despite this evidence, we lack an understanding of how emotions translate into SEW gains or losses or how they affect family and firm functioning. Although economic wealth can eventually be recovered, SEW may be more difficult to restore, so more research efforts should be devoted to understanding this relationship. Formally, the above discussion can be summarized in the following research questions:</p>
<list id="list1-0894486511435355" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><italic>Research Question 1</italic>: What types of emotions have a positive influence on SEW formation? Which ones have negative connotations?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Research Question 2</italic>: Can SEW be restored after pervasive conflicts?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Research Question 3</italic>: How does the emotional dimension of SEW temper or amplify relationship conflicts within the organization? How does it affect family members’ role conflicts?</p></list-item>
</list>

<sec id="section17-0894486511435355">
<title>Family Firms’ Heterogeneity and SEW</title>
<p>Partly because of measurement challenges, most current research treats family firms as homogeneous in their emphasis of SEW considerations. Indeed, in most studies, family ownership is used as a proxy for the existence of SEW (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0894486511435355">Berrone et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0894486511435355">Gomez-Mejia et al., 2007</xref>). In contrast to this, the family business literature has largely emphasized existing differences within family firms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr138-0894486511435355">Zahra, Hayton, &amp; Salvato, 2004</xref>). However, these differences have not been linked to SEW issues. The SEW literature must reach beyond this oversimplification and explain the factors behind the varying sources and degrees of SEW.</p>
<p>For instance, it has been suggested that the family’s attachment to the organization is highest when the firm is owned and managed by the founding family and that it tends to weaken as the firm transitions into subsequent generations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0894486511435355">Chua et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr99-0894486511435355">Mishra &amp; McConaughy, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr111-0894486511435355">Schulze et al., 2003a</xref>). Based on that, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0894486511435355">Gomez-Mejia et al. (2007)</xref> argue that, independently of financial considerations, losses in SEW should weigh less heavily on a family firm’s willingness to give up control as it moves from a founding–family-controlled and -managed firm to a firm that is owned by an extended family and professionally managed. However, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr96-0894486511435355">Miller et al. (2012)</xref> suggest that although this reasoning appears to be valid for small private firms, in large publicly held firms in which legitimacy becomes more important, the trend could be quite the opposite. Future research should address the trend followed by SEW as firms pass through generations.</p>
<p>Moreover, it is expected that the proposed FIBER dimensions of SEW would have different weights depending on the owning family’s preferences. Although some families might place a greater value on the sense of dynasty and transgenerational vision, others might emphasize the protection of the family image as their main priority. Future research should examine which factors play a role in determining the weight placed on the different dimensions. If, as mentioned before, SEW evolves as the firm passes through generations, it is also likely that the weights of the different dimensions of SEW vary as firms pass to the next generation. In particular, we would expect control and influence, sense of dynasty, and emotional attachment to have a stronger weight in first generations, given these companies’ founder-centric orientation. Similarly, we expect the family image to have an increasing importance as the firm moves through generations, since, as the firm evolves, the family name becomes a living symbol of multigenerational achievement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0894486511435355">Gomez-Mejia et al., 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Although the previous discussion has emphasized the role of generations in explaining changes in the importance given to SEW preservation and its different dimensions, future research should also investigate how other factors that account for family business heterogeneity (e.g., industry, environmental conditions, and TMT composition) affect SEW. Similarly, given the popularity of the stakeholder management approach, more research effort should be devoted to investigating how the way family firms identify, respond, and prioritize different interest groups and their claims affect the emphasis they put on SEW preservation and the weight given to its dimensions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0894486511435355">Berrone, Gomez-Mejia, Cruz, &amp; Cennamo, in press</xref>) The following research questions might shed some light on these issues:</p>

<title>Family Firm Governance and SEW</title>
<p>Although the review conducted so far has demonstrated the importance of SEW in guiding family firms’ strategic decision making, scholars also recognize that family owners need to have enough discretion within the organization to impose their goals of SEW preservation. This is why studies have tried to link family governance variables with socioemotional aspects. For instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0894486511435355">Berrone et al. (2010)</xref> argue that SEW will be more salient when the CEO belongs to the family and also when the CEO doubles as the board chair. In a similar vein, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0894486511435355">Gomez-Mejia, Hoskisson, et al. (2011)</xref> propose that the presence of other owners, such as institutional investors, with different problems or strategic frame would diminish the emphasis on SEW preservation. Empirical evidence is mixed, since, although the study of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0894486511435355">Gomez-Mejia, Hoskisson, et al. (2011)</xref> confirms a weak effect for institutional investors, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0894486511435355">Berrone et al. (2010)</xref> found no support for the proposed relationships. This opens an interesting avenue for future research on the governance structures that really facilitate or inhibit family power and discretion within the organization and, therefore, a family’s ability to protect its SEW.</p>
<p>Related with corporate governance issues, a growing area of interest is the study of family enterprise groups or portfolios of firms run by a family. There is some evidence indicating that most families run a portfolio of firms and not just one firm, as the great majority of literature has thus far assumed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr143-0894486511435355">Zellweger, Nason, &amp; Nordqvist, 2011</xref>). This has important implications in terms of governance issues as well as how SEW considerations are affected by these arrangements.</p>
<p>Another area that deserves greater attention is the role of the board of directors, and other related family governance bodies such as family councils, in fostering SEW preservation within family firms. To date, much of the literature on boards has concentrated on sociopolitical aspects, in which the emphasis is put on how parties with a contractual relationship struggle for power and pursue self-serving activities aimed at promoting personal agendas at the expense of other stakeholders. However, as argued by the SEW approach, family owners are likely to be guided by a very different set of motives, namely, the stock of affect-related value that the family has invested in the firm. These aspects, however, have not been explored in boards of family firms. Together, the foregoing paragraphs suggest the following research questions:</p>

<title>SEW and Financial Outcomes</title>
<p>As mentioned before, rooted in behavioral agency theory, an implicit assumption in the SEW model’s reasoning is that family principals may respond to claims that protect and enhance their SEW even if they are not financially rewarding. However, this assumption does not necessarily imply that all decisions driven by the maximization of socioemotional endowments will lead to economic loss. Although it might not be intentional, certain decisions, especially those that are long term, based on socioemotional aspects, have the potential of becoming the source of a competitive advantage. For instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0894486511435355">Berrone et al. (2010)</xref> empirically demonstrated that family firms pollute less than their nonfamily counterparts to preserve their SEW. Although the authors do not establish performance implications, as shown by a substantial amount of research, such care for the environment can contribute to building up a competitive advantage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0894486511435355">Bansal, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0894486511435355">S. L. Hart, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr110-0894486511435355">Russo &amp; Fouts, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr117-0894486511435355">S. Sharma &amp; Vredenburg, 1998</xref>) and have a positive impact on financial performance in the long run (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0894486511435355">S. L. Hart &amp; Ahuja, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0894486511435355">King &amp; Lenox, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0894486511435355">Klassen &amp; McLaughlin, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr110-0894486511435355">Russo &amp; Fouts, 1997</xref>). The study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr96-0894486511435355">Miller et al. (2012)</xref> analyses the impact of family firm’s strategic conformity on firm performance, but their results were mixed: Although strategic conformity was related to superior return on assets, it did not enhance market valuation. According to the authors, the results appear to mirror the ambiguity in the SEW (and institutional) literature regarding whether or not the preservation of SEW (and the attainment of legitimacy) is an end in itself that goes beyond any economic reward.</p>
<p>Indeed, some authors have tried to establish a direct link between SEW and firm performance. In this regard, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr142-0894486511435355">Zellweger, Kellermanns, Chrisman, and Chua (2011)</xref> provide direct evidence that socioemotional aspects related to organizational ownership can have a monetary value in themselves by showing how transgenerational sustainability intentions increase acceptable sales prices indicated by family firm owners. The study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0894486511435355">Cruz et al. (2010)</xref> also shows how the socioemotional aspects implicit in family ties imprint family employment with a performance advantage in the case of micro and small firms. Similarly, a study of 58 enduring cases of family firms with a median age of 104 years revealed that the interplay of strong ties within the internal community and the connection with external stakeholders enable these firms to sustain their viability across generations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr93-0894486511435355">Miller &amp; Le Breton-Miller, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Despite these potential performance benefits, unlike other theoretical approaches, the SEW perspective allows for negative aspects, such as managerial entrenchment, succession conflicts, and dysfunctional relationships. In the study of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0894486511435355">Cruz et al. (2010)</xref>, following the social capital literature, the authors also recognize the negative aspects of this SEW implicit in family employment. For instance, too much collective capital can limit access to information and new ways of doing things (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0894486511435355">Coleman, 1988</xref>). It could also lead to “relational inertia” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0894486511435355">Gargiulo &amp; Benassi, 1999</xref>), which impedes the development of knowledge and leads to the depreciation of human capital (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0894486511435355">Granovetter, 1985</xref>). Similarly, control desires could promote efforts to increase the family’s power both inside and outside the firm, with the deleterious consequences noted by authors such as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr100-0894486511435355">Morck and Yeung (2003)</xref>. Desires to maintain transgenerational control could also lead family firms to behave more conservatively and myopically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr137-0894486511435355">Zahra, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>In conclusion, despite the richness demonstrated by the SEW approach so far, much remains to be done in understanding the SEW–financial performance relationship. First of all, future research should investigate whether family firms make strategic choices using SEW as the only reference point or, on the contrary, strategic outcomes are chosen with the intention of maximizing an utility function with two main components (SEW and financial outcomes). Evidence so far suggests that as economic conditions become more salient, the emphasis on SEW concerns is reduced in favor of financial considerations. For instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0894486511435355">Gomez-Mejia, Hoskisson, et al. (2011)</xref> show that family firms’ willingness to invest in R&amp;D increases as performance indicators deteriorate. Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0894486511435355">Gomez-Mejia et al. (2010)</xref> demonstrate that family firms are more likely to diversify as the firm faces greater performance hazards.</p>
<p>Following the above arguments, it would be interesting to determine whether there is any threshold beyond which the frame of reference changes from SEW to financial considerations and whether or not this threshold varies across family firms.</p>
<p>Moreover, it would be interesting to determine under which conditions the emphasis on SEW may be beneficial or detrimental to firm performance. Anecdotal evidence suggests that, for instance, when there is a high need for patient capital, or when tacit knowledge is important, SEW can enhance firm value.</p>
<p>Similarly, a related important research question would be to determine which particular type of stakeholders might benefit from the family principals’ emphasis on strategic actions aimed at SEW preservation.</p>
<p>Last, future research should also investigate how SEW evolution affects performance outcomes. For instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr130-0894486511435355">Villalonga and Amit (2006)</xref> found that family ownership creates value only when the founder serves as CEO or as chairman with a hired CEO. Their results also show that when the founder’s descendants serve as CEO, firm value is destroyed. How this value creation/destruction relates to the evolution of SEW remains unanswered. Therefore, the following research questions may constitute important avenues for future research:</p>

<title>SEW and Privately Held Family Firms</title>
<p>Because of the difficulties in gaining access to privately held family firms’ data, most of the existing evidence on the impact of SEW in family firms’ decision making have been conducted on publicly traded firms. In these studies, a firm is classified as a family company if the family holds more than 5% of the shares (see review by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr97-0894486511435355">Miller, Le Breton-Miller, Lester, &amp; Cannella, 2007</xref>). The percentage of family ownership in privately held companies is much greater, with a large majority of companies in which the family owns more than 50% of the equity and even 100% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0894486511435355">Cruz et al., 2010</xref>). Under these circumstances, it is expected that personal attachment to the firm, as well as discretionary power, will be extremely high, so SEW concerns will be more evident than in publicly listed companies. At the same time, unlike publicly traded firms, privately held family businesses are less visible to external stakeholders and the community at large, so their need to gain legitimacy and status (and therefore the existing trade-off between socioemotional and financial rewards) is lower (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr96-0894486511435355">Miller et al., 2012</xref>). This may have implications in terms of the scrutiny level experienced by private firms and their consequent responses to external and institutional pressures.</p>
<p>Analyzing SEW concerns in private companies provides an interesting opportunity for future research as well as a challenge, given that it is very difficult to obtain data from a large sample of these firms. The following research questions could guide future research:</p>

<title>Family Entrepreneurship and SEW</title>
<p>Last, since entrepreneurship has been recognized as a key factor contributing to firm success, increasing a firm’s profitability, revenue streams, and growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-0894486511435355">Lumpkin &amp; Dess, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr135-0894486511435355">Zahra, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr139-0894486511435355">Zahra, Neubaum, &amp; Huse, 2000</xref>), an interesting avenue of research relates to the influence of SEW concerns in fostering entrepreneurship in the family business. The entrepreneurship literature has already linked some of the proposed SEW dimensions to entrepreneurial outcomes, although with inconclusive results. Some argue that kinship ties, unique to family firms, have a positive effect on entrepreneurial opportunity recognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0894486511435355">Aldrich &amp; Cliff, 2003</xref>) and that the long-term nature of family firms’ ownership fosters entrepreneurship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr138-0894486511435355">Zahra et al., 2004</xref>). Others maintain that the desire to protect family wealth leads family firm owners and managers to become too conservative in taking the risks associated with entrepreneurship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr102-0894486511435355">Naldi, Nordqvist, Sjöberg, &amp; Wiklund, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr137-0894486511435355">Zahra, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>In addition to this, existing evidence suggests that the links between entrepreneurial orientation (EO) and performance, which are quite strongly established in the literature (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr108-0894486511435355">Rauch, Wiklund, Lumpkin, &amp; Frese, 2009</xref>, for a review), may not be as straightforward in the context of family firms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr119-0894486511435355">Short, Payne, Brigham, Lumpkin, &amp; Broberg, 2009</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr102-0894486511435355">Naldi et al. (2007)</xref>, for instance, found risk taking to be not only a distinct dimension of EO in family firms but also negatively associated with a firm’s performance. Considering that in most family firms, the desired performance outcomes are based on a mix of financial and nonfinancial goals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr115-0894486511435355">P. Sharma, 2004</xref>), future research should investigate to what extent SEW influences this relationship. These research questions review the previous ideas:</p>

<title>Discussion and Conclusion</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0894486511435355">Gomez-Mejia, Cruz, et al. (2011)</xref> made a persuasive call to family researchers to build new theories that capitalize on the unique context of family business research in order to gain academic legitimacy for the field. And although some attempts have been conducted in this regard (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0894486511435355">Carney, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0894486511435355">Gedajlovic &amp; Carney, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-0894486511435355">Lubatkin, Ling, &amp; Schulze, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr112-0894486511435355">Schulze et al., 2003b</xref>), none has gained enough traction to become the prevailing framework. As argued in this article, the SEW perspective has the potential of becoming a dominant perspective in the family business field as it is solidly anchored in the family business literature, it allows for differential risk preferences, it accounts for nonfinancial aspects, and it contemplates both positive and negative consequences of these noneconomic aspects. Therefore, we propose the SEW approach as an umbrella under which it is possible to group all existing theories and evidence related to explaining why family firms behave in a distinctive fashion.</p>
<p>The studies cited in this review have contributed to this objective, but much interesting research remains to be done. The infancy of the SEW approach posses several challenges. We have focused on two: its dimensions and its measurement. But others remain, such as the strength of the SEW approach as the dominant paradigm for the field. We believe that the limits of a theoretical approach are learnt by applying it and seeing how the boundaries progress. We need to obtain a better understanding of the conditions under which the positive forces of family involvement can be unleashed and directed toward economic, as well as noneconomic, objectives. On the other hand, we also need to understand why, when, or how the pursuit of noneconomic goals might lead to positive performance outcomes. In this regard, we presented 24 research questions that will enhance our understanding of how family firms are created and how they operate and evolve over time. We believe that answering these questions might shed light on claims that family presence can influence firms’ overall performance, by showing how socioemotional elements influence either strategic choices or the implementation of those choices and, consequently, performance outcomes, providing an alternative explanation to seemingly contradictory results in the field. We hope we were able to chart a road map for researchers who are excited by the prospects of the SEW perspective, yet are unsure about how to incorporate it into their own research agendas.</p>
<p>Finally, the SEW approach offers benefits and nuances. It has the potential of advancing a more unified view of the field that relies on its own theory-based research. Moreover, it can enhance the shared identity, a quality necessary for developing a strong scientific community. However, measuring the influence of this noneconomic endowment poses major challenges. We have provided both theoretical insights as well as methodological practices that should help enhance the validity of SEW measurement. In addition, family firms represent a highly heterogeneous group with different levels of family involvement and emotional attachments. Again, this poses not only major challenges but also a great opportunity; clearly, this is a good time to invest in examining how SEW evolves and changes and how these changes contribute to value creation.</p>
