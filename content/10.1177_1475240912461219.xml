<abstract>
<p>Taking as its starting point that the adjective <italic>international</italic> is an inadequate, but unavoidable, label to describe the content of a contemporary international education, this article sets out to explore some of the issues facing international education in a post-international world. It draws mainly on writings in French as a deliberate counterweight to international education’s over-reliance on anglophone sources. The article’s main theme is that the practice of international education is determined, in ways of which we are often unaware, by the social, cultural, political and ideological context in which we live. It tries to identify some of the areas in which the impact of this context is most apparent. The first part of the article focuses on the continuing role of the nation state and on education for citizenship and multiple identities, stressing that citizenship education cannot be subsumed within ‘education for inter-cultural understanding and respect’ and drawing attention to Amartya Sen’s warning about the dangers of ‘plural monoculturalism’. The remainder of the article explores other areas in which hidden and sometimes unexamined presuppositions influence thinking and practice in ways that would benefit from challenge. These include the following: the impact of western utopianism; the balance between reason and emotion and the need for ‘an intelligent heart’; the pitfalls of service education and education for rights; the balance between contemporaneity and transmission; and attitudes towards happiness, adversity and language.</p>

<title>A starting point</title>
<p>It seems appropriate, in an edition celebrating the 10th anniversary of the <italic>JRIE</italic>, to take as my starting point one of the articles in the journal over the last few years that most made me think again about the nature of international education. This was my former colleague Conrad Hughes’s ‘International education and the International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme: A view from the perspective of postcolonial thought’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1475240912461219">Hughes, 2009</xref>). He had sent me an early draft of the article on which I had commented, enthusiastically in places and sceptically in others.</p>
<p>The article was successful in unsettling ways of thinking about issues of identity that I had developed over time. I did not agree with what I felt was Hughes’s downplaying of the potentially positive role of national identities. I was also not fully in harmony with his zeal for postcolonial theory and his attachment to the language of French structuralism, but even this encounter with ‘the Other’ – to borrow one of his themes – was a helpful reminder that the empirical Anglo-American spectacles through which I normally viewed the world were not the only ones available.</p>
<p>The main thrust of his article, however, was compelling. We work in ‘international’ education, teach in ‘international’ schools, and talk about ‘internationalism’ and ‘international-mindedness’, and yet do so within a schema – ‘inter-nationalism’, the relations between nations – which is an inadequate label for the complexity of what we are trying to do to prepare young people for a rapidly changing and culturally diverse world. Hughes does not propose the abandonment of the word. That would involve changing the names of schools all over the world and re-naming the International Baccalaureate (IB). Only the most fervent postcolonial theorist and structuralist inventor of neologisms would wish to go down this road, and Hughes is not of their number. We must therefore reinterpret what we mean by ‘internationalism’, as Hughes does in his suggestions for the teaching of the IB Diploma. I propose to use his conclusion as a stimulus and starting point for an article that explores some of the issues facing those who set out to provide a distinctively ‘international’ education for these early years of the 21st century.</p>
<p>I have drawn in my reading largely on contemporary writings, of a different kind, in French. This is for three reasons: first, because this is what I have mostly been reading; second, because, although French educators played a major role in the early days of international education, international education has for a long time been largely closed to French influences; and, third, because thinking about international education suffers from drawing its roots mainly from writings in English, a medium which, for linguistic and cultural reasons, as I will show later in the article, can exclude perspectives more likely to emerge from other languages.</p>

<title>International education: the continuing importance of nation states and relations between them</title>
<p>‘Internationalism’, in its literal sense of promoting understanding and cooperation between different nations, is not just a label that, having had its day, exists merely as a convenient historical umbrella term for a variety of loosely related practices taking place within internationally minded schools. It is still a source of ideas and practices based on the idea of nations and on relations between nations. This is both inevitable and appropriate.</p>
<p>It is inevitable for two reasons. First, it is inevitable because the words we use have consequences. We cannot talk daily about ‘internationalism’ without the idea of nations and relations between nations having some impact on how we think and what we do. Second, educational practice focused on getting students to learn about the relations between nations has such a long pedigree in our schools that a shift in focus to global issues and inter-cultural, as opposed to just international, understanding will not happen overnight. Schools are conservative places and many teachers in internationally minded schools have grown up in a world that has seen global issues largely or exclusively in terms of ‘inter-nationalism’. Old habits die hard. George Walker’s biography of Marie-Thérèse Maurette, head of the pioneering International School of Geneva from the late 1920s to the late 1940s, shows what careful thought was given to the key task of getting students to understand and respect each other’s national identities, but how relatively little thought was given to issues of cultural difference that did not fall neatly under this heading (one exception being the school’s sensitive handling of the presence of German Jewish students in the school following Hitler’s assumption of power in 1933) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1475240912461219">Walker, 2009</xref>). The post-war development of the IB similarly shows a strong focus on respect for others’ national identity, inter-nationalism and the means needed to ensure peace between nations. This emphasis is still there today in some of the defining policy statements of the IB, alongside the slightly different emphasis in the IB mission statement on ‘intercultural understanding’.</p>
<p>This continuing stress on internationalism in the strict sense of the word, however, is in many ways not just inevitable, but to be welcomed. Nation states remain crucially important in our world. Many of the decisions that have most impact on ordinary people take place at national or local level, despite economic globalization and the growing limitations on the power of national governments. Even when political action is taken at an international level it is usually the result of a series of decisions made separately by national governments. It remains important that young people grow up learning about the nation states in which they are citizens, that they learn about their duties, and rights, as citizens of these states, and that they understand how they can exercise these duties and rights to ensure that the nation states to which they belong contribute, through their foreign policies – in the words of the IB mission statement – to the creation of ‘a better and more peaceful world’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1475240912461219">IB, 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>The IB mission statement does not mention citizenship, probably for good reasons given the diversity of schools in which the three IB programmes (Primary Years Programme, Middle Years Programme and Diploma Programme) are taught, but one could be forgiven for coming away with the impression that ‘a better and more peaceful world’ was thought to be achievable largely through individuals showing ‘intercultural understanding and respect’ (which is how this part of the mission statement concludes) than by political action. It cannot. This is why education for citizenship, which may or may not involve a course in ‘citizenship education’, is so crucial an objective for schools.</p>
<p>A distinction, however, needs to be made between ‘internationally minded’ national schools, whether state or private, where students are overwhelmingly citizens of a particular nation state, and the original ‘international’ schools, which now constitute a small minority within those schools that offer IB programmes. Programmes of international education originally developed for expatriate students who mostly did not have citizenship within the country in which the school was located do not necessarily meet, without adaptation, the needs of students in national schools. The diversity of our world makes a ‘one size fits all’ model of international education impossible.</p>
<p>This is not of course just a question of providing national schools with an education for national citizenship, alongside an international or global education. It is also a question of ensuring that enough curriculum time in these schools is made available to allow immersion in depth into the distinctive cultures (and these are likely to be plural) of the nation state in question. If we fail to give due recognition to national distinctiveness, alongside internationalism, our educational programme may well end up diminishing the world’s cultural diversity while simultaneously proclaiming a commitment to its promotion.</p>
<p>Continuing to recognize the place of nation states in education is also important not just because their existence is a tedious fact of life to which educational programmes have to adjust. They even have some advantages. At their best, when respectful of internal diversity and committed to peaceful relations with the rest of the world, nation states can give individuals a sense of identity and belonging, an external recognition of the values that they hold dear, and a feeling of purpose which helps to transcend their insignificance and transience in this world. A sense of national identity can also help to overcome the divisiveness of what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1475240912461219">Amartya Sen (2006</xref>: 156–157) calls the ‘plural monoculturalism’ of some ‘multicultural’ states.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1475240912461219">Régis Debray (2010</xref>: 91–92), in a brilliant and provocative essay ‘Eloge des frontiers’ (In defence of frontiers), quotes the Martiniquan writer Aimé Césaire as saying that there are two ways in which a human being is able to lose himself – ‘by walling oneself up within the particular and by dissolving oneself into the universal’ – and adds that ‘of these two suicides the second is today the most tempting’ and the most dangerous, culturally, intellectually and psychologically. The emergence of cosmopolitan elites who lack an understanding of what it means to be rooted to one place – some of whose members have been educated in our ‘international’ schools – has had negative political consequences that have been long rehearsed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1475240912461219">Lasch, 1994</xref>: passim; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1475240912461219">Finkielkraut, 1999</xref>: 125–129). Others equally have pointed to intelligent and sensitive ways of avoiding these outcomes, above all through promoting the kind of all-embracing world view, outlined in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1475240912461219">Kwame Anthony Appiah’s (2006</xref>: 152) ‘Cosmopolitanism’, that begins with an affiliation to Edmund Burke’s ‘little platoons’ and moves, in Burke’s words, via ‘love to our country’ to ‘love to mankind’.</p>
<p>In referring to education for citizenship I have had in mind citizenship at a national level. This may also involve education for one’s duties and rights as a citizen at both local and regional levels and, where there are supranational bodies such as the European Union, at that level too. It is only at these levels that citizenship has meaning. Global citizenship is merely a metaphor in the absence of a world government, a development both highly unlikely and, for reasons clear to Aimé Césaire (and to Aldous Huxley in Brave New World), highly undesirable. Global understanding, global commitment, and global engagement, where this is appropriate and possible, all follow from our deepest purposes in international education, and are the main elements of what might be loosely described as a programme of ‘global citizenship’. The term ‘global citizenship’, however, is as much a misnomer as the term ‘international’ itself and perhaps best avoided.</p>

<title>International education: the need for a new paradigm</title>
<p>Putting aside all these arguments for the continued importance of ‘nations’ and ‘inter-nationalism’ in contemporary education, Hughes’s conclusion that we need a new paradigm is correct. The need for this is partly that the nation state has never been the sole or even main source of people’s identities, and as such able to claim to be the main focus of an education designed to help young people understand and find their place in the world. The need also arises from recent developments that have created a world in some respects very different from the one in which Marie-Thérèse Maurette developed her concept of an international education during the 1920s and 1930s and in which the IB came into existence 30 or 40 years later.</p>
<p>Most nation states have always been highly diverse, with major internal linguistic, religious and cultural differences, and in some cases with different perceptions of ethnic identity on the part of groups within the state. Even in the fairly distant past this situation led to what might be seen as complex ‘modern’ senses of identity. A recent study has shown, for example, how the Marranos – forcibly converted Jews in late medieval Spain – had little choice but to develop multiple identities as well as a mindset both suspicious of authority and accepting of diversity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1475240912461219">Yovel, 2011</xref>). Even the most oppressively indoctrinating nation states, whether democracies or authoritarian regimes (and the pressure for a sole national identity has come from both), have found it difficult to eliminate altogether the recognition of these differences from their education systems. The porousness of frontiers and the inter-dependence of our world are, similarly, far from new. Globalization has taken new forms in recent years but links between widely scattered parts of the world, and a sense of a wider identity, have been the norm in human history rather than the exception. The role of Latin for more than a millennium following the fall of the Roman Empire, the sense of belonging to a universal faith, European expansion from the 15th century onwards, the cosmopolitanism of educated elites in the 18th and 19th centuries – all these contributed to the forming of perspectives which in many cases transcended those of the nation state.</p>
<p>Recent developments have reinforced a situation that was always present. These developments include the revolution in information technology and mass communications, the growth of multinational companies and international finance, mass migration and the appearance in some parts of the world of supranational bodies. Psychologically perhaps the most important is the powerful but often misleading sense, arising from the rapidity and immediacy of mass communications, that the world has shrunk and that we are all now linked. The effect of this of course is not to bring about a state of universal harmony. As the Franco-Lebanese writer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1475240912461219">Amin Maalouf (2009</xref>: 295) has put it:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>We talk constantly of the ‘global village’ and it is true that, thanks to improvements in communications, our planet has become a single economic space, a single political space, and a single arena of communications. But the mutual hatreds are only more manifest than ever.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Maalouf pleads for the recognition of multiple identities and the rejection of the idea that everyone <italic>must</italic> feel that they have only one identity which constitutes their essence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1475240912461219">Maalouf, 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1475240912461219">2009</xref>. See also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1475240912461219">Todorov, 2008</xref>: 117; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1475240912461219">Sen, 2006</xref>: 118–119, 156–157). In Maalouf’s own case these multiple identities are those of an Arabic-speaking Lebanese, brought up as a Catholic in a family with multiple Christian traditions; someone with a sense of identity with the rest of the Middle East and the Arabic-speaking world, but also with France, of which he is now a citizen, with the French language, and with the world of <italic>la francophonie</italic>, extending across five continents, in which that language is spoken. Moreover, Maalouf – and this is where his view of the world has its most important implications for ‘international education’, in the extended sense of that term – sees the need for these particular identities to be overlaid by a ‘solidarity of a new kind’, one that is ‘universal, complex, subtle, considered, adult’. This solidarity should be one based on a consciousness of humanity’s common destiny and on the same core values. It should ‘transcend nations, communities, ethnic groups’ without at the same time suppressing the particular cultural identities that mean so much to people and that, where they coexist harmoniously, contribute to the attractiveness of our world. This sense of solidarity is what he calls a global <italic>patrie éthique</italic> (ethical homeland) alongside the many particular <italic>patries</italic> (homelands) to which people will also continue to feel attached (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1475240912461219">Maalouf, 2009</xref>: 210, 310; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1475240912461219">Todorov, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Helping young people to develop their own multiple identities is one of the biggest challenges facing not just international education but any kind of education in the contemporary world. It should influence how the school handles diversity within its community, how it helps students engage with the wider society, and how it structures its curricula and chooses its teaching materials (as Hughes shows in the examples he gives of literary texts that in IB Diploma programmes might be used to help students appreciate the complexity of cultures, identities and viewpoints).</p>
<p>It is partly a question of balance, and the nature of this balance will vary as between national schools and schools serving expatriate populations. Too much emphasis on the universal, on the one hand, can leave the impression that the (often relatively easy) sympathy for those distant from oneself is more important than the (often less glamorous) task of getting involved in the messy, boring but important activities needed to improve the quality of life close to home. Too much emphasis on the cultural distinctiveness of particular groups, on the other hand, can lead to an ethical relativism which threatens the essential core values of Maalouf’s <italic>patrie éthique</italic>. Too much emphasis on the cultural distinctiveness of minority groups within a particular society or nation state can similarly, as Caroline Fourest has argued, undermine the sense of common identity essential for the civic functioning of nation states and the well-being of their citizens whatever their background (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1475240912461219">Fourest, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1475240912461219">Sen, 2006</xref>: 156–157). It can also, as Alain Finkielkraut has argued even more profoundly, lead to a self-congratulatory imprisonment within one’s cultural identity at the expense of giving priority to Reason in pushing forward one’s understanding of the world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1475240912461219">Finkielkraut, 2000</xref>: 79–80).</p>

<title>International education: some challenges and pitfalls</title>
<p>Having discussed some of the ways in which the label, and focus, of ‘internationalism’ remains appropriate within contemporary international education, and some of the ways in which it represents an inherited carapace from which we must struggle to free ourselves, I should now like to turn to some of the challenges and pitfalls facing international education as defined above.</p>
<sec id="section5-1475240912461219">
<title>Utopianism and angélisme</title>
<p>At a major conference on international education a few years ago the event was introduced by a local school choir singing John Lennon’s ‘Imagine’. We were ushered into the conference with the words of the song ringing in our heads and, more importantly, surging through our emotions: ‘imagine all the people living for today’; ‘imagine there’s no countries … and no religion too’; ‘I hope someday you’ll join us and the world will live as one’. Despite its merits as a tune, its enormous popularity and its relevance to the location of the conference, it was a careless choice at the start of an event devoted to discussing how to promote international understanding among serious intelligent young people. Not long afterwards I referred to this episode in a speech at a school graduation ceremony, as part of a plea for the importance of thinking rather than feeling, and for realism rather than for sentimentalism. I was interested, some days later, to find that my comments had been seen in some quarters (both among parents and teachers) as an assault on one of the central icons of internationalism as they understood it. The following statement in my speech clearly fell on some (though not all) deaf ears:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>We will improve the world by linking our ideals and values to tough thinking, through working away at difficult problems, aware that we will never solve them completely, content that we have made a difference in small ways. We will not do so through subscribing to the words of ‘Imagine all the people’ or thinking that rushes of warm feeling by themselves will solve anything. It is this adult realism that ought to distinguish us from the young children that we used to be.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This episode set me thinking about the role in international education of idealism, utopianism and <italic>angélisme</italic> (a French word, for which there is no English equivalent, for the state of mind which imagines that there are simple solutions to things and that all will be well as long as we have the right feelings). It also helped me to understand better the criticism of international education that it is Western-centred.</p>
<p>International education emerged out of idealism and out of the wish, through education, to contribute to the making of a better world. The origins of the International School of Geneva in the reaction against the horrors of the First World War, and of the International Schools Association and the IB after the even worse horrors of the Second World War, still mark international education profoundly today, as shown in the IB mission statement. We explicitly wish young people to grow up with a vision of how the world might be a better place, to have ideals, and to challenge those who are merely self-serving and do not care about other people or about the damage that their actions do to the world. There is a danger, however, in the West, where international education has its origins, that this idealism slips into utopianism and into <italic>angélisme.</italic></p>
<p>Two books in recent years have provided a particularly close analysis of utopianism and found it both a distinctively western phenomenon and one that has been deeply damaging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1475240912461219">Gray, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1475240912461219">Todorov, 2012</xref>).The starting point in both cases is Pascal’s dictum in his <italic>Pensées</italic>: ‘Qui veut faire l’ange fait la bête’ (whoever wants to play at being an angel will act like a beast).</p>
<p>In ‘Black Mass. Apocalyptic Religion and the Death of Utopia’, the British political philosopher <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1475240912461219">John Gray (2007)</xref> traces western utopianism from its origins in the millenarian tendencies of Christianity right through to the present day. Utopianism, he argues, is not an exclusively western phenomenon, but one that has characterized the Western tradition above all others and one that is unknown, for example, in Buddhism and Hinduism. It involves seeing history in terms of its purpose, which is the salvation of humanity. Though deriving from Christianity, utopianism, Gray argues, did not cease with the waning of religious belief. It was simply secularized with the coming of the 18th-century Enlightenment and the belief of most Enlightenment thinkers in human progress and perfectibility (Montesquieu, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1475240912461219">Tzvetan Todorov [2006</xref>: 26; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1475240912461219">2012</xref>: 39–40] points out, being one exception). Utopianism also lay behind the ideals, derived from the Enlightenment, of the French Revolution and behind its zeal, during the revolutionary and Napoleonic wars, to impose these ideals on the rest of humankind whether it wished to receive them or not. Out of the French Revolution then grew Marxism and communism, with a similar belief that history has a purpose and that, through war, persecution and terror, utopia on earth can be achieved. Nazism, the other great 20th-century totalitarianism, had different roots and different aims but shared the same commitment to teleology and the same belief that the ends justified the means however brutal these might be.</p>
<p>In our present day Gray, like the French political philosopher Tzvetan Todorov, believes that yet another manifestation of the western utopian tradition has emerged since the fall of communism. This is the belief in the irresistible onward march of liberty, democracy, human rights and the market, and the desire on the part of some elements in the West, especially in the USA, to impose these ideals on others, using force, war, and the newly proclaimed humanitarian ‘right of intervention’, and once again justifying violence on the grounds that the beneficence of the ends justifies the brutality of the means (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1475240912461219">Todorov, 2012</xref>). Given the long-term persistence of the utopian tradition in the West, and the way it has migrated right across the political spectrum, Gray’s conclusion is that ‘its irrational faith in the future is encrypted into contemporary life’ and that to people comforted by this faith ‘nothing is more threatening than the idea that (history) is a meandering flux without purpose or direction’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1475240912461219">Gray, 2007</xref>: 288–289).</p>
<p>Gray’s realism about history is one that would be shared by most contemporary historians. The realist tradition that he opposes to utopianism of all kinds is one based on the assumption that people are not inherently good (despite Rousseau), that conflict of some kind in this world is inevitable and cannot be magicked away through attempts to realize utopian dreams, that some problems are insoluble, that values pull in different directions, and that compromises are needed which will leave many people dissatisfied. The contemporary German philosopher <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1475240912461219">Peter Sloterdijk (2011</xref>: 83–85) draws a similar conclusion in arguing that, in the modern world, when one sows the seeds of ‘secular religions’ and idealist meta-narratives ‘one harvests world wars’. The qualities required in the real world are thus stoical determination and intellectual detachment, not faith or the kind of emotions stirred up by John Lennon’s ‘Imagine’ or by the kind of inspirational speakers so common at international education conferences who target one’s emotions when talking about how schools can help to make the world a better place, without at the same time stiffening one’s mind.</p>
<p>Given that education takes place within a context, and that this context is pervaded by the utopian thinking that Gray and Todorov have analysed, there are consequences for international education. First, we need to be aware of this context as, if we are not, we are likely to help shape young minds in particular ways without realizing what we are doing. Hughes gives examples of how schools can actively thwart the process of helping young people to develop their own sense of identity, for example through international fairs in which everyone has to represent ‘their country’ in some inevitably stereotypical and frequently embarrassing way. One avoids this, as an educator, through one’s own continuing self-education. One similarly avoids, as an educator, through one’s own continuing self-education, the many ways in which one is liable to convey simplistic and utopian views of the world, unaware of the extent to which one is simply regurgitating the dominant discourse of one’s time.</p>
<p>Schools’ choice of curriculum and of learning and teaching approaches also plays its part in helping to shape a world in which people are able to strive for betterment while avoiding noble causes that create havoc. In a speech at a conference on ethics and education in 2011, Monique Canto-Sperber, Director of the Ecole Normale Supérieure in Paris, discussed how schools might best develop a sense of responsibility that extends from the individual to the collective and outlined the elements that needed to be involved: the fostering of dispositions and motivations, the development of understanding through the study of history, literature and film, the refinement of ethical and intellectual judgments, efforts to sensitize young people to the distortions of the mass media (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1475240912461219">Ethical Issues in Education, 2011</xref>: 73–76). The Nobel Prize-winning author Mario Vargas Llosa makes the same point throughout his <italic>La Verdad de las Mentiras</italic> (<italic>The Truth of Lies</italic>), a spirited defence of imaginative literature illustrated by reference to major novels of the 20th century. His analysis of George Orwell’s <italic>Animal Farm</italic>, for example, draws attention to the way in which the novel alerts readers to the harm done by utopianism, to the intrinsic dangers of all authority, and to the need for a hard-headed realism about human beings, while never sinking into passivity or into scepticism about one’s ability to make a difference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1475240912461219">Vargas Llosa, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>The importance of well-chosen literature, as Hughes has also stressed, can hardly be over-estimated in developing young people’s appreciation of all those elements essential to the human condition – nuance, complexity, uncertainty, ambiguity – and which are so frequently absent from political discourse which, even in the most mature of democracies, is pushed relentlessly by mass media pressures in the direction of populism and demagoguery. The novelist and literary critic Juan Gabriel Vásquez has defined the greatest works of fiction as those that ask intelligent and interesting questions without necessarily providing any answers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1475240912461219">Gabriel Vásquez, 2009</xref>: 26, see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1475240912461219">Nussbaum, 2010</xref>: <italic>passim</italic>). One cannot think of a better antidote to the pressures that one is under to espouse certain causes or a better stimulus to reflective, as opposed to unconsidered, action.</p>
<p>A key element in the curricula of many internationally minded schools is education about and for human rights. This is crucial in a world in which these are frequently so little respected and is an important part of education for responsibility. If one is maintaining a balance between global education and education for national citizenship it is important to ensure that there is an understanding that there are also many other kinds of rights which are specific and not universal, and which arise from membership of a particular state. One needs, as an educator, to be aware of what is at times a kind of rights imperialism in western societies whereby duties and responsibilities are downplayed and claims to rights extended <italic>ad absurdum</italic> in the pursuit of self-interest. One should also be aware, as Gray points out, that rights frequently conflict and that tough decisions about priorities need to be made, and that, as Fourest stresses, it is sometimes all too easy in societies that are highly unequal socio-economically to use the assertion of the civic rights of minority groups as a smokescreen behind which to avoid tackling the society’s more fundamental structural inequities.</p>
<p>The realism urged by Gray also applies to the service learning which, rightly, is such an important curricular element in internationally minded schools. One of the ways in which we can promote students’ learning and their emotional intelligence is through encouraging them to reflect on all the feelings and emotions that they themselves and others have, or might have, in these kinds of situations, as well as about the global issues that particular projects are attempting to tackle. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1475240912461219">Luc Boltanski (2007)</xref> in his ‘La souffrance à la distance’ has shown, altruism and sympathy for those in need or suffering, or victims of what we have, curiously, come to call ‘humanitarian crises’, are rarely simple. They can involve the enjoyment that sometimes comes with pity. They can involve feeling sorry for oneself, feeling superior, hypocrisy, pretence, even hysteria. There is a risk that one stereotypes the receiver or sufferer. There is a danger that one ends up fantasizing about the relationship between giver and receiver. I do not accept the crude assumptions of some Marxist theorists that all philanthropy is suspect, that it is simply a device to salve the consciences of the possessing classes, a means of maintaining behind a façade of benevolence a continuing situation of gross and unfair inequality, a diversion from tougher political action, a form of neo-colonialism, a way of avoiding the more radical change that the world needs, or that it has done more to weaken local cultures than colonial rule ever did. It can, however, sometimes be at least some of these things or have some of these effects. This is why the opportunities for learning from these experiences are so rich in possibilities for helping young people to understand how enthusiasm, commitment and a thirst for action to right wrongs, which no one wishes to discourage, can and must be allied with reflection.</p>

<sec id="section6-1475240912461219">
<title>Happiness and adversity</title>
<p>Part of Gray’s critique of societies striving vainly after utopian dreams was amply developed much earlier by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1475240912461219">Pascal Bruckner (2000)</xref> in his ‘L’euphorie perpetuelle’ published in 2000. Bruckner’s thesis is that Western democratic societies, by their exaggerated claims to solve people’s problems and to be moving towards utopia, create expectations that cannot be met and as a result generate a perpetual sense of dissatisfaction and a culture of complaint. He traces this to the 18th-century Enlightenment which, for the first time, situated perfection and happiness in this world, to the French Revolution with its inflated promises, and to the US Declaration of Independence, pure product of the Enlightenment, which declared ‘the pursuit of Happiness’ as an ‘unalienable Right’. As his other works on love and marriage in the modern world indicate, Bruckner is no opponent of happiness. He is critical, however, of the idea that it is a right, sceptical that it should be seen as the main purpose of existence (because if one does one will be disappointed), amazed at the assumption that if one is not happy one must therefore be deemed to be unhappy, and convinced that some degree of unhappiness needs to be accepted, for all of us, as an inevitable component of existence.</p>
<p>Bruckner is therefore particularly critical of education systems that appear to aim to exclude the frustration that comes from having to struggle with difficult tasks and ideas. In his view, far from promoting happiness, this limits it, as some of the greatest satisfactions in learning come from having failed, having analysed why one has failed, and then, with great effort and maybe some psychological pain, having overcome the obstacles and achieved one’s objective. This, he says, is the kind of learning that one values, not the kind, based on accessible texts or topics that ‘start where the child is’, that comes too easily. This is common knowledge to many teachers but not necessarily sufficiently at the centre of the (otherwise frequently admirable) constructivist view of education dominant in internationally minded schools. What can be achieved with literary study that is not easily accessible, is remote from students’ daily experiences, and that meets initial resistance, can be found in Cécile Ladjali’s account of a project she ran in the <italic>lycée</italic> of a highly disadvantaged Parisian suburb. Students read Aeschylus and the Old Testament and ended up performing a play that they had written based on these hard texts for the French radio programme <italic>France Culture</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1475240912461219">Ladjali, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1475240912461219">Steiner and Ladjali, 2007</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section7-1475240912461219">
<title>Relevance and contemporaneity</title>
<p>International education has its origins in an engagement with the contemporary world: a concern for peace, a wish to promote understanding and cooperation between nations, support for a new international order (the League of Nations, the United Nations), a commitment to human rights, a passionate belief in respect and tolerance, a wish to make the world a better place. These are aims one hopes are shared by all educators, whatever type of school they work in or are responsible for. The effect of the particularly sharp focus on these aims in internationally minded schools, and especially those following IB programmes, is, however, to give a priority to relevance and contemporaneity that is more insistent than in some national education systems. Together with the pressure for relevance which comes from progressive educational traditions described as ‘child-centred’, and from the breadth of IB secondary school programmes by comparison with some national education systems, this runs the risk of downplaying the transmission element of education that consists of an induction into the history and culture of the past, and especially the distant past, and the passing on of what Matthew Arnold called ‘the best which has been thought and said’ (an objective that applies to all cultures). Pushing education in the same direction is the contemporary pedagogical emphasis on skills and competences at the expense of content, which <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1475240912461219">Laurent Fedi (2011)</xref> has come to see as the product of a global economic system demanding imperiously to be fed by permanently recyclable free-floating individuals rather than ones who have been inducted, as in the past, into a shared and inherited narrative. Given the combination of these influences, it is hardly surprising that some IB Primary Years Programme (PYP) and Middle Years Programme (MYP) schools are low on this kind of transmission, despite their well-attested success in developing literacy and numeracy, in promoting an interest in learning, in developing spirited young people, and in passing on the IB’s values.</p>
<p>George Steiner, one of our greatest contemporary thinkers and one equally at home in the anglophone and francophone worlds, sees the ‘atrophy of memory’ as the dominant characteristic of education and culture in the second half of the twentieth century, with the US education system labelled a programme of ‘planned amnesia’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1475240912461219">Steiner, 1997a</xref>: 29–30). Steiner’s critique is in direct line from Hannah Arendt’s attack, in her 1958 essay ‘The Crisis in Education’, on ‘central European’ constructivism and how this had undermined education in the USA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1475240912461219">Arendt, 1972</xref>: 223–252).The consequences of this assault on transmission, in the eyes of both these great 20th-century thinkers, are the pervasive loss of the ability even to begin to understand much of past literature and art, together with a loss of historical memory which shows itself all too frequently among Western political leaders when faced with issues that require a long view to be understood.</p>
<p>This ‘atrophy of memory’, especially as far as what one might call ‘high culture’ is concerned, is also a product of the democratization of western societies, of a system of consumer capitalism which intrinsically favours what is intellectually and aesthetically undemanding over what is difficult, and of mass media that privilege the sound bite and the visual image. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1475240912461219">Steiner (1997b</xref>: 132) illustrates this by recounting how in the bookshops he knew in East Berlin or in Weimar, following the fall of communism, ‘Jackie Collins and the video-cassette … swiftly ousted Lessing and Hölderlin’. The disappearance of tyranny and censorship is not for a moment regretted, but with liberty in modern capitalist democracies come dominant tastes that make it less and less likely that young people will grow up steeped in the ‘high culture’ that was the birthright during childhood and adolescence of almost any great early and mid-20th century cultural figure one cares to mention (Sartre, Simone de Beauvoir, Samuel Beckett, James Joyce, Simone Weil, Albert Camus, and George Steiner himself, spring immediately to mind). This may be an overly pessimistic view and the birthright of a new generation of writers, scholars and artists may, though very different, prove equally stimulating to subsequent high achievement. Educational practice also varies, with France, for example, despite the many deficiencies in its education system, still managing to produce large numbers of young people with a breadth of cultural knowledge that is impressive. A country that prints its Baccalaureate philosophy questions on the front page of its daily newspapers and has a cultural radio programme in which one can hear, while driving to work, a panel participant saying unselfconsciously and <italic>en passant</italic> ‘when one re-reads Spinoza’, must have at least something to teach internationally minded schools.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1475240912461219">
<title>Language and diversity</title>
<p>Finally, one of the corollaries of being a school committed to international education with the aims, whether ‘inter-national’ or global, that I have mentioned, is that one should be committed to the learning of other languages. The IB has recognized the importance of this from the beginning and requires the study of a second language in both its Diploma and Middle Years programmes while strongly recommending it in the PYP. The take-up of IB programmes, however, despite the IB’s best efforts, continues to be dominated by schools in which English is the (usually sole) language of instruction. Over 50 per cent of IB programmes are to be found in North America, overwhelmingly in English-medium schools. Around the world many international schools also continue to offer an exclusively English-medium education, not just for expatriate populations but also for local elites keen to have the passport to employment, and to higher education in anglophone countries, that comes with fluency in English.</p>
<p>There is no reason, however, why international education should be associated with the English language. The gradual growth in the number of schools that teach IB programmes through other languages is indeed encouraging. There is, however, an association between international education and the English language, which derives from both its history and its current demography, which is worrying. It is worrying because it can give the impression that international education is a stalking horse for the growing dominance of the English language (a spread that is not wholly being halted by the growth of new centres of power in countries such as China, India and Brazil).</p>
<p>It is also worrying educationally, for two reasons. First, this is because very few students in internationally–minded schools, outside certain bilingual and plurilingual countries, grow up with the experience of learning part of their curriculum through the medium of a second language. This deprives them of the advantages that come from levels of linguistic competence that begin to approach that of bilingualism. Students who follow dual language programmes for part of their schooling make much faster progress than they otherwise would in the second language, do not fall behind in the medium term in their first language, do not fall behind in subjects taught through the second language, and gain significant cognitive benefits from being able to operate within two language systems simultaneously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1475240912461219">Baker, 2011</xref>: <italic>passim</italic>).</p>
<p>Second, the persistence of English-based monolingualism is worrying because enclosure within one language (the experience of a minority, not a majority, of humankind) limits the range of one’s thought and makes impossible the cross-fertilization that comes from trying to understand and explain things within two or more different sets of mental structures. The latest book by the French linguist <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1475240912461219">Claude Hagège (2012)</xref>, <italic>Contre La Pensée Unique</italic>, shows how the history, structures and vocabulary of the two languages, English and French, can be radically different and how the creeping spread of English in parts of the francophone world limits not just how things are said and written but how they are thought and whether or not it is any longer possible for them to be thought at all. What is true of French is even truer of some of the many other languages that do not share common origins in the way that English and French do.</p>
<p>There are huge practical obstacles to the kind of foreign language education that pushes students towards some form of bilingualism. A greater recognition of the limitations of being monolingual would, however, be a first move in the right direction.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>This article has set out to identify some of the key issues that need to be taken into account in developing a concept of <italic>international</italic> education that transcends, but does not abandon, the literal meaning of the word. The issues discussed – notions of citizenship and multiple identities, the dangers of utopianism, the nature of ‘service’ and of ‘rights’, the role of transmission and enquiry, attitudes towards happiness, adversity and language – are all central to the intellectually demanding task of educating young people for life in the 21st century. One of the achievements of the so-called ‘French theory’ of the second half of the twentieth century, often opaque and indigestible though it was, was to show us, building on the insights of Marx, how much of our discourse and how many of our ideas were to a large extent determined by the social, cultural, political and ideological context in which we lived. As the sociologist Pierre Bourdieu put it, we are ‘spoken for’ more often than we ‘speak’ (in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1475240912461219">Tate, 2011</xref>: 52). One of the challenges for international education, which this article has tried to illustrate, is to ensure that we understand better how what we say, think and do is often externally determined and, in freeing ourselves from at least some of these manacles, to expand the boundaries both of our own freedom and that of our students.</p>
