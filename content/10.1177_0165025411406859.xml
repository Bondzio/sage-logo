<p>In the current study we tested whether <italic>ADRA2B</italic> moderates stress regulation of Holocaust survivors as indexed by their diurnal cortisol secretion and cortisol reactivity to a stressor. Salivary cortisol levels of 54 female Holocaust survivors and participants in the comparison group were assessed during a routine day and in response to a stress-evoking procedure (an adapted version of the Trier Social Stress Test [TSST]). <italic>ADRA2B</italic> did not moderate differences between Holocaust survivors and participants in the comparison group in terms of cortisol reactivity to the TSST. Holocaust survivors with the wildtype <italic>ADRA2B</italic>, however, displayed higher diurnal cortisol levels than did participants in the comparison group with the same genotype, whereas no difference was found between these groups in carriers of the deletion variant, previously associated with more reexperiencing of traumatic events. Carriers of the deletion variant might have been driven in the long run to resolve their vividly remembered experiences, and therefore currently show less stress dysregulation as evident from their cortisol levels.</p>

<body>
<p>Holocaust survivors show alterations of diurnal cortisol secretion as well as in response to stress more than half a century after their traumatic experiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0165025411406859">van der Hal-van Raalte, Bakermans-Kranenburg, &amp; van IJzendoorn, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0165025411406859">Fridman, 2011</xref>). However, survivors may respond differently when subject to the same traumatic experiences, and thus further influencing factors such as gene–environment interactions should be examined. The deletion variant of the <italic>ADRA2B</italic> gene has been associated with more vividly reexperiencing traumatic events in Rwandan Civil War refugees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0165025411406859">De Quervain et al., 2007</xref>). Here we examine the potential moderating role of <italic>ADRA2B</italic> on the long-term effects of the Holocaust on HPA-axis functioning of survivors.</p>
<p>The Holocaust is the most widely studied example of a genocide with traumatic consequences for its survivors, and understanding the biological mechanisms that underlie survivors’ vulnerability or resilience may help gain better understanding of the adaptation of victims of other, more recent genocides that took place in countries like Cambodia, Nigeria, Rwanda, Sudan, and former Yugoslavia. In a recent meta-analysis involving 12,746 participants (from 71 samples), Holocaust survivors were found to be less well adjusted than their age mates who did not experience the Holocaust. In particular, they showed substantially more posttraumatic stress symptoms. At the same time, they also seemed rather well adapted in the areas of physical health and cognitive functioning, suggesting remarkable resilience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0165025411406859">Barel, van IJzendoorn, Sagi-Schwartz, &amp; Bakermans-Kranenburg, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>However, traumatization may be present “under the skin,” and be manifested in neurobiological functioning. Stress regulation, as assessed by the HPA-axis functioning, is one possible candidate for indexing such covert long-term effects of trauma. The development of the HPA axis has been shown to be modified by early environmental stressors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0165025411406859">Liu et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0165025411406859">Meaney et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0165025411406859">Tarullo &amp; Gunnar, 2006</xref>). For example, atypical patterns of daily cortisol secretion were found among Ukrainian children in institutional care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0165025411406859">Dobrova-Krol, van IJzendoorn, Bakermans-Kranenburg, Cyr, &amp; Juffer, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0165025411406859">Dozier et al., 2006</xref>). Such dysregulation has been observed even more than 6 years after adoption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0165025411406859">Gunnar, Morison, Chisholm, &amp; Scheuder, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>In the short run, cortisol reactivity to acute danger promotes survival. However, if activated chronically, the HPA axis may exert detrimental effects on individuals’ health, with cardiovascular and metabolic consequences, and immune suppression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0165025411406859">Denson, Spanovic, &amp; Miller, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0165025411406859">Sapolsky 2003</xref>). Posttraumatic stress may continue to burden HPA-axis functioning if traumatic memories remain intrusive and persistent, and are not set aside as belonging to a past that will never return (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0165025411406859">McGaugh, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>In healthy young adults the deletion variant of the <italic>ADRA2B</italic> gene has been shown to be associated with individual differences in emotional memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0165025411406859">De Quervain et al., 2007</xref>), perhaps due to differential amygdala activity during encoding of emotional memories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0165025411406859">Rasch et al., 2009</xref>). Rwandan Civil War refugees were more likely to reexperience traumatic events when they were deletion variant carriers rather than wildtype carriers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0165025411406859">De Quervain et al., 2007</xref>). These findings suggest that variants of the <italic>ADRA2B</italic> gene moderate the processing of traumatic memories, and may also be implicated in long-term effects of traumatic experiences on stress regulation. Here we test whether <italic>ADRA2B</italic> moderates stress regulation of Holocaust survivors as indexed by their diurnal cortisol secretion and cortisol responses to a stressor.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<sec id="section2-0165025411406859">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>Participants were recruited from a population-wide demographic-information base provided by the population registry administered by the Israeli Ministry of Interior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0165025411406859">Sagi-Schwartz et al., 2003</xref>). Two groups were compared: female Holocaust survivors who had experienced the Holocaust in their childhood and were selected if they had suffered at least the loss of both parents due to the Holocaust, and a matched comparison group of females who were born in Europe and immigrated with their parents to the British Mandate of Palestine (pre-state of Israel) just before the Second World War. For the purpose of the current study, we contacted 106 participants. However, by time of the current data collection, 10 participants of the earlier phase of the study had passed away, and for reasons of health and personal problems, only 79 (75.4%) women were eligible for participation. Of them, 65 (82.3%) agreed to take part in the study (32 Holocaust survivors, and 33 comparison respondents). Their age ranged from 71 to 84 years (<italic>M</italic> = 76.98, <italic>SD</italic> = 2.99).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0165025411406859">
<title>Procedure</title>
<p>Data were collected at the participants’ homes for their convenience. Cheek cells for genotyping were collected first, followed by the stress task and the completion of some questionnaires. The research assistant was available to answer the participants’ questions and to offer emotional support throughout the entire session. She could also be reached by phone at any time after the data collection session. The study was approved by the ethics committee of the Institute for Education and Child Studies, University of Leiden, the Netherlands, and participants signed a written informed consent.</p>

<title>Measures</title>
<sec id="section5-0165025411406859">
<title>Physical health</title>
<p>Physical-health status was assessed by a questionnaire developed by the Herczeg Institute on Aging (Tel Aviv University). This questionnaire is widely used for sociodemographic research in Israel and was used in previous Holocaust studies (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0165025411406859">van der Hal-van Raalte et al., 2008</xref>). Participants were asked to rate their health on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 1 = <italic>very unhealthy</italic> to 5 = <italic>very healthy</italic>. They were also asked to indicate which of 19 listed health problems they suffered. Participants could add more health conditions if they wanted, resulting in an overall list of 40 problems. The total number of health problems ranged from 0 (no health problems) to 15. The correlation coefficient between the two health measures was <italic>r</italic> = .62 (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .01).</p>

<sec id="section6-0165025411406859">
<title>Trier Social Stress Test (TSST)</title>
<p>The TSST (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0165025411406859">Kirschbaum, Pirke, &amp; Hellhammer, 1993</xref>) is a procedure that includes both social-evaluative threat (speaking in the presence of a critical audience) and lack of control (an arithmetic task that is impossible to complete within the time constraints). The combination of the public-speaking task and the impossible arithmetic task has indeed been shown to be one of the most effective psychosocial stressors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0165025411406859">Buske-Kirschbaum et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0165025411406859">Dickerson &amp; Kemeny, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>According to standardized instructions, participants were asked to convince university experts that their grandchild would deserve a scholarship. They were told that after a short preparation period they should introduce themselves in free speech to the video camera that was placed in the room, and that the video cassette would be seen by University of Haifa experts who were trained to assess both verbal and nonverbal behavior. Following these instructions, participants were given 5 minutes to prepare for their talk without written notes. After 5 minutes they were asked to sit in front of the camera and give their speech. Whenever the participant finished her speech in less than 5 minutes, the research assistant responded in a standardized way: “You still have some time left. Please continue!” If the participant still finished the talk before the allotted time was over, the research assistant became quiet for 20 sec and then asked some standard questions such as “why do you think you/your grandchild is the best candidate for this job/scholarship?”</p>
<p>After the 5-minute speech participants were asked to serially subtract the number 13 from 2,083 as fast and accurately as possible, and they were told that their results would be evaluated by university experts. In order to increase stress, a metronome was turned on with 40 beats per minute, and every minute the research assistant made a comment, regardless of the participant’s performance (e.g., “Please be more accurate”; “Please try to be more focused”). On every failure the participant was asked to start all over again. After three failures, participants were given the option to start from 1,022, instead of 2,083. The task was stopped after 5 minutes, and the research assistant informed the participants that no video analysis would in fact be conducted and that the comments were standard regardless of their performance. For the purpose of relaxation and recovery afterwards, the TSST participants watched 25 minutes of the nature movie <italic>Flying Birds</italic>.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0165025411406859">
<title>Cortisol levels</title>
<p>Cortisol levels were measured on two separate occasions: once during the home visit around the TSST, and the second time during a regular day. Cortisol reactivity to stress was measured three times following the stressful procedure: 20, 30, and 40 minutes after the onset of the TSST, respectively. Participants were not allowed to eat or drink anything but water until all saliva samples were collected. Mean cortisol sampling times were 12:50 p.m. (<italic>SD</italic> = 3:29, baseline), 13:14 p.m. (<italic>SD</italic> = 3:29), 13:25 p.m. (<italic>SD</italic> = 3:28), and 13:35 p.m. (<italic>SD</italic> = 3:28). Since time of baseline sample varied, it was used as covariate in the analyses. Only participants with all four cortisol samples were included in the analysis (<italic>n</italic> = 38).</p>
<p>Participants’ daily cortisol secretion was measured by assessing their salivary cortisol levels at six points of time during a regular day. During the home visit participants received sampling kits, including the material needed for collection and detailed written instruction how to obtain the samples, which were also elaborated face to face. Participants were asked to collect saliva six times: immediately after awakening, half an hour after awakening, an hour after awakening, before lunch time, before dinner, and before bedtime. Research staff telephoned the participants the day before the observation day to remind them of collection. Mean cortisol-sampling times were 6:58 a.m. (<italic>SD</italic> = 0:51), 7:31 a.m. (<italic>SD</italic> = 0:55), 8:01 a.m. (<italic>SD</italic> = 0:57), 13:01 p.m. (<italic>SD</italic> = 1:03), 19:13 p.m. (<italic>SD</italic> = 0:40), and 22:44 p.m. (<italic>SD</italic> = 1:03). Participants were not allowed to eat or drink anything but water at least 30 minutes before sampling. Missing samples were only imputed for participants who had maximally two missing samples per day. Samples were stored at −18 °C until being assayed by the Research Center for Psychobiology at the University of Trier.</p>

ADRA2B
</title>
<p>Buccal swabs collected from individuals were incubated in lysis buffer (100 mM NaCl, 10 mM EDTA, 10 mM Tris pH 8, 0.1 mg/ml proteinase K, and 0.5% w/v SDS) until further processing. Genomic DNA was isolated from the samples using the Chemagic buccal swab kit on a Chemagen Module I workstation (Chemagen Biopolymer-Technologie AG, Baesweiler, Germany). DNA concentrations were quantified by OD260 measurement and by agarose gel electrophoresis. The average yield was approximately 4 ug of genomic DNA per buccal-swab sample.</p>
<p>Typical polymerase chain reactions (PCR) contained between 10 and 100 ng genomic template DNA, 10 pmol of forward and reverse primers, 100 uM dNTP, 3.3% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), 10x buffer supplied with the enzyme, 2.5 mM Mg2+ and 0.25 amplitaq gold (5U/μl) in a total volume of 30 ul. For amplification of the <italic>ADRA2B</italic> fragment, primers 5′- AGAAGGAGGGTGTTTGTGGGG-3′ (5′ labeled with carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester [FAM]) and 5′- ACCTATAGCACCCACGCCCCT-3′ were used. The fragment was amplified by an initial denaturation step of 10 min at 95 °C, followed by 40 cycles of 30 sec 95 °C, 30 sec 58 °C, 1 min 72 °C, and a final extension step of 10 min 72 °C.</p>
<p>The length of the PCR amplification product was determined by size fractionating the fragments on an ABI-3100 automated sequencer (Applied Biosystems, 2010, 2nd Edition, Base-Clear Leiden, The Netherlands), and the size data was analyzed using GeneMarker software. Based on the length of the amplified fragments, the difference between the deletion and wildtype variant was readily visible with a resolution of +/−5 basepairs. Genotypes were in Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium, χ<sup>2</sup>(1, <italic>N</italic> = 61) = 0.11, <italic>p</italic> = .74.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0165025411406859">
<title>Statistical analyses</title>
<p>
<italic>ADRA2B</italic> gene was dichotomized to wildtype carriers and deletion variant carriers because of the relative small number of deletion homozygous carriers. Both cortisol measures were inspected for outliers, which were defined as values with <italic>SD</italic> greater than 3.29 above the mean (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0165025411406859">Tabachnick &amp; Fidell, 2007</xref>). Because the distributions of cortisol measurements were positively skewed, log<sub>10</sub> transformations were used for analysis. Outliers in the daily distribution were made to fit in the specific curve of the individual respondent. No outliers were detected in the stress reactivity measures. Cortisol measures were analyzed by multivariate analyses of variance with repeated measures (the participants’ cortisol levels at six or four time points, respectively) with group (Holocaust survivors vs. participants in the comparison group) as between-subjects factor, and time of baseline sample as a covariate in the analyses of cortisol reactivity.</p>
<p>Moreover, because we employed a mathematical task as a stress trigger, we took into consideration the possibility that the task might not have been interpreted or experienced by all participants as equivalently stressful. In order to address this potential caveat we used two complementary assessments: a well-established gerontology-based interview for examining cognitive capacities (e.g., long-term and short-term memory, orientation to time and place, attention, language and abstraction) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0165025411406859">Beeri, Werner, Davidson, Schmidler, &amp; Silverman, 2003</xref>), and participants’ subjective rating of stress or threat as they appraised the math task. No differences were found between wildtype carriers and deletion carriers on these measures. Therefore we regard the stress trigger as equally stressful for all participants.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Our findings point to a gene–environment interaction effect, given that in wildtype <italic>ADRA2B</italic> carriers, Holocaust child survivors who immigrated to Israel as orphans after the Holocaust showed higher diurnal cortisol levels than participants in the comparison group, whereas no difference was found between Holocaust survivors and participants in the comparison group if they were deletion carriers. Holocaust survivors in the wildtype group showed higher cortisol levels across all time points than participants in the comparison group, both in their daily curve and during the TSST, and no difference was found between Holocaust survivors and participants in the comparison group in the deletion group. <italic>ADRA2B</italic> did not significantly moderate cortisol reactivity to the TSST.</p>
<p>Previous research showed that the deletion variant was associated with more vivid traumatic memories in survivors of the Rwandan Civil War, and may lead to elevated levels of posttraumatic stress relatively shortly after the traumatic events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0165025411406859">De Quervain et al., 2007</xref>). However, in the long run survivors who carry the deletion variant may not be able to live with repression of their vivid memories. More than the carriers of the wildtype variant they may be driven to work through the traumatic events over the long time span of several decades. As a consequence they may end up with a less dysregulated HPA axis.</p>
<p>Along a similar line of gene environment interaction, vulnerability to develop a lifetime posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) was recently found for carriers of a specific variant of the <italic>SLC6A4</italic> gene, which encodes for serotonin transporter, in survivors of the Rwandan genocide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0165025411406859">Kolassa et al., 2010</xref>). Short-allele carriers of <italic>SLC6A4</italic> were at high risk for developing PTSD, even when exposed to few traumatic events. Genetic differences became less relevant when traumatic exposure reached extreme levels as the prevalence of PTSD approached 100%. Short-allele carriers of <italic>SLC6A4</italic> were also at higher risk of developing attachment disorganization (a precursor of dissociative issues) and attachment insecurity compared to carriers of the long alleles in a sample of Ukrainian preschoolers living in orphanages or within families (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0165025411406859">Bakermans-Kranenburg, Dobrova-Krol, &amp; van IJzendoorn, 2011</xref>). In the current study, the <italic>ADRA2B</italic> gene seems to play an important moderating role in the prevalence of posttraumatic stress dysregulation, as wildtype and deletion <italic>ADRA2B</italic> carriers display different levels of cortisol secretion while both groups had been exposed to massive genocidal trauma. The gene–environment interaction we observed in our study may not be unique to Holocaust survivors, but might also explain variance in resilience and vulnerability in other, more recent victims of genocidal traumas around the globe.</p>
<p>The current study is limited because of its small sample size. Because of the slightly skewed distribution of the two gene variants replication in larger samples is critically needed, and therefore the current study should be considered exploratory. Also, although we suggested elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0165025411406859">Sagi-Schwartz et al., 2003</xref>) that the industrial extermination of Jews by Hitler and his Nazi regime did not leave much room for differential survival on the basis of individual (genetic) strengths or weaknesses, it should be realized that differential participation in the study due to different mortality or disability levels between the genetic variants during or after the Holocaust cannot be ruled out. In the current study, however, the distribution of the two variants did not differ much between Holocaust survivors and participants in the comparison group, nor did it differ from the student sample of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0165025411406859">De Quervain et al. (2007)</xref>.</p>
<p>In future studies the mechanism of the moderating role of <italic>ADRA2B</italic> should be studied more carefully. For example, the hypothesized link between the deletion variant, more vivid memories following the trauma, and the urgency to work through these traumatic memories need to be examined as a cascade leading to a better regulated HPA system in the long run. Thus, assessing reexperiencing symptoms and other behavioral data in the two groups could shed more light on the mechanism speculated to explain the moderating role of <italic>ADRA2B</italic>. Furthermore, interactions between <italic>ADRA2B</italic> and other genes that are involved when considering the risk for stress dysregulation or PTSD should be further explored (e.g., dopamine-related genes: see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0165025411406859">Comings, Mulhelman, &amp; Gysin, 1996</xref>; or glucocorticoid receptor genes: see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0165025411406859">McGowan et al., 2009</xref>), as it seems unlikely that a complex phenomenon like dysregulation of the HPA axis would only be dependent of a single genotype. Lastly, the role of methylation as a potential interface between traumatic experiences and gene expression should be taken into account (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0165025411406859">van IJzendoorn, Caspers, Bakermans-Kranenburg, Beach, &amp; Philibert, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Here we propose that the <italic>ADRA2B</italic> gene moderates the long-term effects of a traumatizing genocide on its survivors, even after more than 60 years, because carriers of the deletion variant are speculated to have been driven to resolve their vividly remembered experiences in the long run and therefore currently show less stress dysregulation as evident from their cortisol levels. We suggest that wildtype carriers might be protected against the devastating effects of genocide in the short term, but they may become at risk for permanently altered HPA-axis functioning in the long run.</p>
<p>“It is the storyteller who makes us what we are, who creates history. The storyteller creates the memory that the survivors must have – otherwise their surviving would have no meaning” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0165025411406859">Achebe, 1996</xref>, p. 10). Having vivid memories might be facilitative for survivors who are allowed or even urged to make meaning of them, whereas repressed memories might haunt survivors forever. Resolution might be advantageous in the long run, whereas repressing incomprehensible memories might be adaptable in the short term.</p>
