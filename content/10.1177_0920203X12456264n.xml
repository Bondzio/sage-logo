<p>Jeremy E. Taylor’s <italic>Rethinking Transnational Chinese Cinemas: The Amoy-Dialect Film Industry in Cold War Asia</italic> is the first English-language research monograph on the Amoy-dialect film industry. But as its title suggests, Taylor also aims to challenge the assumptions that have led people to overlook the ‘third leg’ of Chinese-language cinema (along with Mandarin and Cantonese cinema), and make his study of relevance to anyone interested in Chinese transborder cultures. Most film histories are ‘text-based’. But none of 400-plus Amoy-dialect films (x<italic>iayupian</italic> 厦语片) made mostly in Hong Kong between 1949 and the early 1960s (p. 2) and circulated throughout South-east Asia are available on commercial DVD (p. 15), and few scholars argue for the aesthetic quality of these low-budget productions. But, as Taylor emphasizes (p. xv), a film history can also focus on production regardless of the texts themselves. The same would be true for many other neglected and ephemeral Chinese popular cultural phenomena.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Amoy-dialect cinema does not meet the expectations of existing scholarship on either national or transnational cinemas. In a section of his second chapter (pp. 23–7), Taylor identifies how nativism has driven a recent boom in Taiwanese research on the local-dialect cinema produced on the island during an overlapping period. This scholarship has tried to draw a clear line between locally produced (<italic>taiyupian</italic> 台语片) and the imported x<italic>iayupian</italic>. In fact, both were Hokkien-dialect films; there was a lot of crossover in funding, crews, and actors; and publicity and government statistics of the time often conflated them. Ironically, the tendency to label many <italic>xiayupian</italic> as <italic>taiyupian</italic> has led to the Chinese Taipei Film Archive having the largest collection of surviving prints (p. 124). As for transnational film studies, Amoy-dialect cinema predates the globalization that has sparked celebration of transnational cinema, and its parochial interest in Chinese and more specifically Amoy-dialect culture contradicts any assumption that transnational cinema is necessarily cosmopolitan. Again, how many other Chinese cultural phenomena have we overlooked because of our investments in national cultures or in fantasies of cosmopolitanism?</p>
<p>Having established the broader relevance of his project in his two opening chapters, the core of Taylor’s book is a history of the Chinese cinema industry. In chapter 3, ‘Origins and development’, he shows how the communist revolution stranded a ‘Little Fujian’ community in Hong Kong; the prosperity of the Hokkien community in the Philippines at a time when nationalism was also making them nervous motivated them to invest their money elsewhere; and the market for Hokkien-language entertainment made the production of films via the ‘Little Fujian’ community in Hong Kong worth a try. Chapter 4, ‘The shaping of a cinema’, argues that without a strong financial base in the existing cinema industry, the new Amoy-dialect cinema turned in the early 1950s to the tried and tested opera culture for materials. These were also cheap to film and politically and morally safe with censors across the region, but led to low quality copycat filmmaking. Chapter 5 goes on to show that when audiences began to tire of these materials, the ‘new Amoy-dialect films’ gave the industry fresh energy. New funding came from Singapore and Malaysia for a modern Amoy-dialect cinema with contemporary settings, sex symbol stars and modern music.</p>
<p>Taylor’s sixth chapter, ‘A Cold War industry’, complicates the assumption that the Nationalist government on Taiwan always suppressed Hokkien in favour of Mandarin. In the 1950s, it was willing to work with Hokkien cultural producers in its battle with the communists, and even supported the Amoy-dialect film industry. However, the change in that policy in the 1960s is a key reason for the demise of the industry outlined in Chapter 7, along with the collapse of Philippines funding when the peso was devalued and with Lee Kuan Yew’s uptight new regime in Singapore with its repressive censorship policies.</p>
<p>The distinctive Amoy-dialect cinema highlighted in <italic>Rethinking Transnational Chinese Cinemas</italic> will encourage just that. Not only have Chinese-language cinemas challenged assumptions about national cinema, they are also pushing us to understand that transnational cinema cultures come in more forms than we have realized so far. In this particular case, more work is merited on the ‘exilic’ nature of this cinema, cut off from the place that its very name refers to after the Communist Revolution and also not grounded in any new national space. Here, Hamid Naficy’s work might be at least as useful as the Tamil and Yiddish cinemas Taylor compares it with. I also hope his book sparks more work on the cultures surrounding the consumption of Amoy-dialect cinema, even though traces may be difficult to find. In his preface, Taylor rightly notes that ‘these films formed an integral part of many people’s everyday lives’ (p. xv). I was saddened by – although also impressed with the honesty of – Taylor’s comment that ‘I have not even particularly enjoyed watching many of the Amoy-dialect films’ (p. xiv). But I hope that others who get more out of them may go through the door that this very valuable and provocative research has opened and take us into the spaces of those everyday lives where these films were once consumed so avidly.</p>
