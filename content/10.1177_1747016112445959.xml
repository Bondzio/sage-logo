<p>Stuart Rennie, on his Global Bioethics blog, points out an unfortunate new practice with regard to research deemed to be unethical (either because it lacks ethical approval, deviates from that approval or would contravene common ethical practices such as gaining consent of participants), with seemingly important results. This is that medical journals are now sometimes publishing the results while criticizing the conduct of the research in editorials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1747016112445959">Rennie, 2012</xref>). He gives the example of a recent tuberculosis study published in the <italic>International Journal of Tuberculosis and Lung Disease</italic> comparing two courses of treatment, where he says the researchers:
<disp-quote><p>did not ask participants for informed consent, arguing that: (1) neither of the treatment arms were likely to cause harm (2) the participants were be unlikely to be capable of making a rational choice to decide to participate (3) asking them to participate might lead to selection bias. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1747016112445959">Aung et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1747016112445959">Rennie, 2012</xref>)</p></disp-quote>
</p>
<p>The non-publication of such research has historically performed an important role in discouraging carrying out research of this ilk, since if it cannot be published then why do it?</p>
<p>The justification offered for publishing the article is a common one, given that the harms have already been done; not using and publicizing the results of the research simply compounds those harms since it negates any benefits that those harms might have had. This justification and subsequent debate have risen frequently in medical ethics, in particular with regard to the use of the results of nazi medical research, but in many other areas as well, such as the use of illegal elephant tusks confiscated by the UK border agency in research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1747016112445959">Berger, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1747016112445959">Brassington, 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>It is important to note that part of this argument depends on the incentive structures that are set up – one would hardly think that poachers are likely to hunt more elephants because the confiscated tusks are used in research rather than destroyed. However, if ostensibly unethical research is published then this does create incentives for researchers to sidestep ethical norms, or at least reduces the disincentive to avoid carrying out unethical research. Does the publication of additional editorials criticizing the ethics of the research create a significant disincentive? I suspect not really, since many people will read the article electronically without even seeing the editorials.</p>
<p>Given that the ethical critique itself is unlikely to discourage authors, I think we should be sceptical about the claim that this mitigates the ethical quandary the journal finds itself in, and if the journal wants to hold themselves to the highest ethical standards, they are better to reject the article outright rather than publishing it with a critique.</p>

<p>This issue focuses on the issue of ethical review in social sciences and whether it is justified, with a number of articles responding to the controversial article by Zachary Schrag in the 4th issue of volume 7 of this journal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1747016112445959">Schrag, 2011</xref>). We have published four of these articles thus far, having received eight responses, but we would be very interested in further responses from readers, and should be receiving a response from Schrag to these articles.</p>
<p>Should we make a strong distinction between research regulation in social sciences and in medical practice as Schrag argues for and arguably we do in the UK? I must admit to being sceptical: while no doubt medical research will often involve greater physical risks than social science research, this does not mean that the risks involved are ethically negligible. Nor should we assume that physical risks are the most important to regulate – ethics committees rightly are concerned about a number of ethical issues such as autonomy and justice which do not focus on purely physical harm. So it is not clear that just because the risks are different the regulation should be different. We might, of course, wish to adopt the mantra of proportionality of review, where the level of regulation should match the level of risk involved in research, but as I have argued elsewhere it seems difficult to assess the level of risk involved without something like a full research ethics committee scrutinizing the research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1747016112445959">Hunter, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>The four articles focus on different aspects of Schrag’s argument. The first article, <italic>Social science and ethics review: A question of practice not principle</italic>, by Stuart Nicholls et al., argues that Schrag does not prove the strong case he sets out to show, but does show a need for improvements in practices and training for research ethics committees to minimize the issues he raises (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1747016112445959">Nicholls et al., 2012</xref>). In the second article, <italic>The problems of presumed isomorphism and the ethics review of social science: A response to Schrag</italic>, Adam Hedgecoe stridently attacks Schrag for attempting to discuss all research ethics committees as a whole instead of treating each as a product of its own history and culture/circumstances. I must admit that some of the fault here probably should fall to me, since when I invited Schrag to submit an article I did request that he addressed his concerns with the process of ethical review more generally rather than his specific critiques of the US system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1747016112445959">Hedgecoe, 2012</xref>). The third article, <italic>Response to Schrag: What are ethics committees for anyway?</italic>, by Sean Jennings, takes on board some of Schrag’s criticisms and aims to chart a way forward for social science review in the UK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1747016112445959">Jennings, 2012</xref>). The final article on this topic, <italic>Ethical imperialism or ethical mindfulness? Rethinking ethical review for social sciences</italic>, by Tim Bond, focuses on the warrant of research ethics committees and concludes that they play an important role in supporting and underwriting trust in science (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1747016112445959">Bond, 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>Moving away from the topic of social science ethics review, the final research article in this issue, <italic>Human tissue biobanks: The balance between ‘consent’ and ‘the common good’?</italic>, by <italic>Z</italic>isis Kozlakidis et al., argues that biobanks have to be careful not to become racially biased, and this may warrant a relaxing of informed consent to ensure that they contain representative samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1747016112445959">Kozlakidis et al., 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>Finally in this issue we have a very interesting topics article, <italic>Ethical and safe: Research with children about domestic violence</italic>, by Anita Morris, Kelsey Hegarty and Cathy Humphreys, which outlines both key ethical concerns in this area of research and how these concerns might be addressed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1747016112445959">Morris et al., 2012</xref>).</p>
