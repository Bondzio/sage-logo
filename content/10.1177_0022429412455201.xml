<abstract>
<p>The purpose of this study was to investigate intermediate musicians’ self-regulated practice behaviors. Thirty sixth- through eighth-grade students were observed practicing band repertoire individually for 20 min. Practice sessions were coded according to practice frame frequency and duration, length of musical passage selected, most prominent musical objective, and practice behaviors. The 600 min of video were parsed into 234 practice frames for analysis. Practice sessions also were rated for overall degree of self-regulation. Reliability of the observational procedures (three observers, 95% to 100% agreement) and self-regulation ratings (two raters, coefficients of .89 to .96) was excellent. Analyses revealed an average of 7.8 practice frames with a mean duration of 2 min 45 s across sessions. Participants most frequently addressed the musical objective pitch accuracy and most commonly selected passages of nine measures in length or greater. The most common practice behaviors were varying tempo, repeating fewer than four measures, repeating more than four measures, and irrelevant playing. Significant relationships were found between self-regulation ratings and frequencies of the behaviors writing on music (<italic>r</italic> = .55), varying tempo (<italic>r</italic> = .42), repeating four or more measures (<italic>r</italic> = .41), and irrelevant playing (<italic>r</italic> = −.59). Implications for future research and practical applications are discussed.</p>

<p>Instrumental music teachers often expect students to spend a great deal of time practicing their ensemble music independently and outside of the school day. Unfortunately, researchers have found that beginning and intermediate musicians were not likely to be productive when practicing on their own (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0022429412455201">Hallam, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0022429412455201">McPherson &amp; Renwick, 2001</xref>). Students who were particularly poor at regulating their own practice behavior also were more likely to become bored or frustrated with music participation and to drop out from music instruction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0022429412455201">McPherson &amp; Davidson, 2002</xref>). Although teachers may be able to estimate how much time students do or do not practice on their own, most could not predict accurately what types of practice behaviors or approaches their students employed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0022429412455201">Duke, Flowers, &amp; Wolfe, 1997</xref>). Moreover, researchers have determined that teachers, even at the university level, had difficulty demonstrating efficient and effective practice methods for their students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0022429412455201">Barry, 1991</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0022429412455201">2007</xref>). Identifying how beginning and intermediate musicians choose to spend their time while practicing can provide a valuable step toward designing pedagogical approaches that may help students become better practicers.</p>
<p>In contrast to the large number of studies dealing with musicians’ motivation to practice or self-reported practice habits (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0022429412455201">Hamann, Lucas, McAllister, &amp; Teachout, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0022429412455201">McPherson &amp; McCormick, 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0022429412455201">2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0022429412455201">Miksza, 2009</xref>), in-depth behavioral analyses of developing musicians’ practicing are rare. This is especially problematic given discrepancies that have been found between musicians’ self-reports of practice behavior and observed practice behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0022429412455201">Hallam, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0022429412455201">Madsen, 2004</xref>). Although there are several examples of research that include observational analyses of practice behavior exhibited under strict controls (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0022429412455201">Miksza, 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0022429412455201">2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0022429412455201">2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0022429412455201">Williamon &amp; Valentine, 2000</xref>), most research that has incorporated novice musicians and more naturalistic environments, specifically, has been limited to case studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0022429412455201">McPherson &amp; Renwick, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0022429412455201">Renwick &amp; McPherson, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0022429412455201">Rohwer, 2005</xref>). It is clear that there is a dearth of observational research designed to investigate novice musicians’ practice.</p>
<p>One way to conceptualize students’ self-sufficiency in their practice is through the social-cognitive theory of self-regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0022429412455201">Zimmerman, 1986</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0022429412455201">1998</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0022429412455201">Zimmerman and Martinez-Pons (1988)</xref> defined self-regulated learners as those who are “metacognitively, motivationally, and behaviorally active participants in their own learning process” (p. 284). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0022429412455201">McPherson and Zimmerman (2002)</xref> highlighted several dimensions of self-regulated learning that are relevant to investigations of music learning, with three being particularly important for observational studies of music practice behaviors: (a) method, (b) behavior, and (c) time use. The <italic>method</italic> dimension refers to the selection and application of both physical and mental learning strategies, whereas the <italic>behavior</italic> dimension essentially refers to individuals’ abilities to self-evaluate and monitor their own learning. The <italic>time use</italic> dimension refers to elements such as concentration and organization of time usage. Although it is not clear as to whether these labels were arrived at via factor analysis or other empirical means, taken together, the method, behavior, and time dimensions represent issues of resource management, metacognitive strategy use, and adaptive learning strategies in general.</p>
<p>The process of becoming a self-regulated learner is theorized as a developmental trajectory and, as such, is thought to occur across a long period. Findings in music education research indicating that beginner musicians demonstrated very rudimentary and inefficient approaches to practicing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0022429412455201">McPherson &amp; Davidson, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0022429412455201">McPherson &amp; Renwick, 2001</xref>) are consistent with this theory. Evidence of more independent approaches to practicing usually did not occur until intermediate stages and then has been found to shift gradually across many years (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0022429412455201">MacNamara, Holmes, &amp; Collins, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0022429412455201">Manturzewska, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0022429412455201">McPherson, 1997</xref>). Given these trends, it seems especially important to examine the practice behavior of intermediate instrumentalists. Unfortunately, the majority of in-depth behavioral analyses of practice behavior have been conducted with advanced musicians (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0022429412455201">Chaffin &amp; Imreh, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0022429412455201">Duke, Simmons, &amp; Cash, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0022429412455201">Maynard, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0022429412455201">Nielsen, 1999</xref>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0022429412455201">Sosniak (1985)</xref> documented the development of independent and effective approaches to practice among expert pianists, as determined by international contest awards. Her study revealed three relatively distinct developmental stages: early, middle, and late periods. In the early period, participants practiced an average of 6 days a week, 45 to 90 min a day, and about half of them practiced with a parent at their side. The middle period included practice that was more intrinsically motivated and more clearly focused on strategy use, rather than simply time spent practicing. The late period included a heavy increase in time spent practicing (e.g., 4 to 7 hours a day) and a focus on the personal value of music-making. A similar shift in practice sophistication was detected by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0022429412455201">McPherson (1997)</xref>, who examined cognitive strategy use (i.e., playing by ear, improvising, playing from memory, mental rehearsal) in the practicing of 43 advanced wind players across 3 years of study. McPherson found that the students reported incorporating strategies that were relatively sophisticated more frequently over time. In addition, those who used more sophisticated strategies also had higher scores on several objective measures of performance achievement (e.g., rehearsed music, sight-reading, playing by ear).</p>
<p>Whereas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0022429412455201">Sosniak (1985)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0022429412455201">McPherson (1997)</xref> studied advanced musicians, studies of intermediate musicians may reveal critical perspectives regarding when and how self-regulated practicing begins to emerge. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0022429412455201">Rohwer and Polk (2006)</xref> examined the observed and self-reported practice behavior of 65 eighth-grade band students. Participants who reported a greater number of practice strategies also were those who performed better on an objective measure of performance achievement. The authors observed the participants practicing a 24-measure etude during a 5-min session and categorized the individuals as either holistic (e.g., tend to play straight through) or analytic (e.g., tend to break the music down into chunks) practicers. Analytic practicers were found to have significantly higher performance achievement scores than holistic practicers. Similar studies designed to examine the practice behaviors of intermediate musicians during longer sessions and with greater detail would be helpful to determine how students could approach their practicing with more self-regulation and efficiency.</p>
<p>The purpose of this study was to investigate intermediate band students’ self-regulated behavior during individual music practice. The specific research questions addressed were as follows: (a) How do intermediate band students organize their practice sessions with respect to frequency of practice frames, duration of practice frames, and length of musical passage practiced? (b) What musical objectives (i.e., rhythm, notes, dynamics, articulation) do intermediate students choose to focus on when practicing independently? (c) What strategies do intermediate band students use to address particular musical objectives when practicing independently? and (d) What differences in practice organization (i.e., frames, length of musical passage), choices of musical objectives, and observed practice behaviors are evident between students exhibiting varying degrees of overall self-regulation?</p>

<title>Method</title>
<p>Participants for this study were 30 middle school band students who were attending a weeklong summer music clinic hosted by a large university in the southwestern United States. The summer music clinic included 62 students total and was a nonauditioned program that drew attendees from 30 separate middle schools across a single state. The program was based primarily on large ensemble band instruction. Brass (<italic>n</italic> = 13), woodwind (<italic>n</italic> = 13), and percussion (<italic>n</italic> = 4) students were represented in the sample. At the time of the study, students were entering grades 6 (<italic>n</italic> = 1), 7 (<italic>n</italic> = 14), or 8 (<italic>n</italic> = 15). There were 21 males and 9 females, and the average age was approximately 12 years old (<italic>SD</italic> = 0.91). Given the detailed behavioral analyses pursued in the current study as well as sample sizes employed in previous studies that have incorporated similar detailed observational approaches (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0022429412455201">Chaffin &amp; Imreh, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0022429412455201">Duke et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0022429412455201">Ginsborg, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0022429412455201">Maynard, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0022429412455201">Miksza, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0022429412455201">Williamon &amp; Valentine, 2000</xref>), we considered a sample size of 30 participants to be appropriate. All participants and their parents provided university institutional review board–sanctioned informed consent to take part in this study.</p>
<p>The participants were pulled out of their summer clinic rehearsals and were video-recorded practicing for 20 min in a practice room by themselves. All participants spent at least 1 day in the summer clinic rehearsing their band repertoire prior to participating in the study. The participants brought the band repertoire from the summer clinic to the practice room. The selections of band repertoire the students practiced were grade-level 2. They each were asked to “please practice your band music as if you were working on it at home” and were told that “you can work on any of the pieces you want to or any combination of the pieces.” The participants were given the opportunity to practice any or all of their music in an effort to try and match the naturalistic practice conditions they would experience when practicing at home. Only a music stand, a chair, and a pencil were provided. A digital timer was used to determine when the 20 min had elapsed, at which point the participants returned to the summer clinic rehearsal. Video recordings were made of the participants’ practicing using Insignia NH-DCC5HB09 digital video cameras. The camera was aimed to capture the students’ speech and actions. The recordings were burned as Quicktime files to DVD-Rs in random order for analysis.</p>
<p>The behavioral observation scheme designed for this study was an adaptation of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0022429412455201">Maynard’s (2006)</xref> practice frame approach, which itself is rooted in Duke’s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0022429412455201">1999/2000</xref>) conception of rehearsal frames. This approach allows for a detailed analysis of practice behavior over time such that an implied organizational structure of the practice session may be revealed (see sample evaluation scheme, Appendix A, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jrme.sagepub.com/supplemental">http://jrme.sagepub.com/supplemental</ext-link>). To achieve the greatest degree of objectivity, we defined a practice frame in the current study as an interval of time in which the participant played a particular passage of music. A new practice frame was documented each time the participant stopped playing a passage and jumped to a section of the same piece that was at least four measures from the last spot he or she played or shifted to another piece of music altogether. The frequency and duration of practice frames were recorded for each participant. The length of musical passage practiced during any given frame also was documented as (a) fewer than or equal to four measures in length, (b) five to eight measures in length, or (c) greater than or equal to nine measures in length. The musical objective that appeared to be most prominent also was documented for each frame (i.e., pitch accuracy, rhythm accuracy, articulation, dynamics). Lastly, the occurrence of the following practice behaviors was documented for each frame: singing or whistling; writing on music; counting aloud; clapping, tapping, or patting; silent fingering; buzzing; wind patterns; varying tempo; varying articulation; varying dynamics; playing rhythm on a single pitch; “bopping” rhythm; repeating four measures or fewer; repeating four measures or more; whole-part-whole repetition; chaining; use of metronome; use of tuner; finding partial; and irrelevant playing. These practice behaviors were chosen on the basis of previous studies of music practicing (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0022429412455201">Gruson, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0022429412455201">McPherson &amp; Renwick, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0022429412455201">Miksza, 2011</xref>) and consultation with two experienced public school instrumental music teachers.</p>
<p>Reliability was established with three independent observers who each had at least 4 years of public school instrumental music teaching experience. The observers established a baseline of agreement by coding the practice videos of three pilot-test recordings and then independently coding 5 of the 30 recordings used as data for the study. Percentage agreement for frequency of practice frames, musical passage length, musical objective for each frame, and occurrence of practice behaviors in each frame was 100%. The recorded duration of practice frames varied slightly across observers with an approximate agreement of 95%. The remaining 25 recordings were divided up among the independent observers for behavioral analysis.</p>
<p>Participants’ practice sessions also were rated for evidence of self-regulated behavior by two additional independent raters (i.e., distinct from those performing the observational analyses) using a researcher-created self-regulation scale. These raters also had a minimum of 4 years of public school instrumental music teaching experience. The rating scale comprised 12 items that addressed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0022429412455201">McPherson and Zimmerman’s (2002)</xref> method, behavior, and time-use dimensions of self-regulated learning, with 4 items representing each dimension (the rating scale may be found in Appendix B, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jrme.sagepub.com/supplemental">http://jrme.sagepub.com/supplemental</ext-link>). The items were created in accordance with McPherson and Zimmerman’s interpretation of self-regulated learning in the context of music practicing. The items also were presented to three experienced instrumental music teachers to verify their relevance to intermediate band students’ practicing. Each item was rated with a 5-point Likert-type scale ranging from 1 = <italic>student’s practice is not at all characteristic of this description</italic> to 5 = <italic>student’s practice is completely characteristic of this description</italic>), resulting in a total possible score range of 12 to 60, with higher scores indicating relatively greater degrees of self-regulation. Internal consistency of the rating scale was excellent across both judges with Cronbach’s alpha coefficients of .94 and .96. Interjudge reliability was also excellent (<italic>r</italic> = .89).</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>Participants’ mean number of practice frames was 7.8 (<italic>SD</italic> = 4.35), with a minimum of 3 and maximum of 22 (median = 7; mode = 4). Mean practice frame duration was 2 min 45 s (<italic>SD</italic> = 1 min 24 s; minimum = 45 s; maximum = 6 min 38 s). Analyses of mean practice frame durations over time indicated a trend of longer frames at the beginning of the session and shorter frames at the end of the session (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0022429412455201">Figure 1</xref>). A dependent-samples <italic>t</italic> test revealed a significant difference between the average duration of the participants’ first two practice frames (<italic>M</italic> = 3 min 11 s; <italic>SD</italic> = 108.75) and the average duration of their remaining practice frames (<italic>M</italic> = 2 min, 19 s; <italic>SD</italic> = 74.89), <italic>t</italic>(28) = 2.63, <italic>p</italic> = .01, <italic>d</italic> = –.48. Across all practice sessions, 70% of participants did not practice musical passages less than or equal to four measures in length, 53% of participants did not practice musical passages five to eight measures in length, and all participants chose musical passages greater than or equal to nine measures in length. Twenty percent of participants were observed practicing all lengths at least once.</p>

<p>Practice frames also were coded according to the musical objective that appeared to be the focus of the participants’ attention. All participants were observed practicing pitch accuracy as a primary objective in most or all practice frames. Only 23% (<italic>n</italic> = 7) of participants were observed practicing dynamics, and 10% (<italic>n</italic> = 3) of participants were observed practicing rhythmic accuracy. Those who did practice dynamics addressed that musical objective in only three or fewer frames. Those who addressed rhythmic accuracy did so in two or fewer frames.</p>
<p>The occurrence of practice behaviors was documented for each practice frame, as well. Listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0022429412455201">Table 1</xref> are the percentages of participants who exhibited each behavior, the maximum number of times any given behavior was exhibited by a single participant in the entire practice session, and the mean and standard deviation for the number of times each behavior was exhibited across all participants and practice frames. The mean number of discrete behaviors observed per participant was 5.13 (mode = 4, minimum = 3, maximum = 10). The practice behaviors most commonly observed among participants were varying tempo (63.3%), repeating fewer than four measures (96.7%), repeating more than four measures (80%), and irrelevant playing (50%). Thirty percent to 40% of the participants exhibited the behaviors writing on music (36.7%); clapping, tapping, or patting (36.7%); and finding partial (33.3%). Twenty percent of the participants exhibited the behavior counting aloud. Fewer than 10% of participants exhibited the behaviors whole-part-whole repetition, varying dynamics, chaining, wind patterns, varying articulation, and use of metronome. No participants exhibited the behaviors buzzing, playing rhythm on a single pitch, “bopping” rhythm, and use of tuner.</p>

<p>Descriptive analyses of the self-regulation ratings of participants’ practicing revealed a mean of 30.86 out of a possible score range of 12 to 60 and standard deviation of 8.66, suggesting a good deal of variation across the sample. Skewness (.13) and kurtosis (–1.2) figures suggested a relatively normal distribution of self-regulation ratings. A significant positive relationship was found between self-regulation ratings and the participants’ total number of discrete observed practice strategies (<italic>r</italic> = .44, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05): Participants with higher self-regulation ratings tended to employ a greater number of discrete practice strategies. Spearman correlations also were calculated between self-regulation ratings and the frequency of the observed practice behaviors exhibited by at least 35% (<italic>n</italic> &gt; 11) of the sample. Self-regulation ratings were significantly correlated with the frequencies of specific practice strategies writing on music (<italic>r</italic> = .55, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01), varying tempo (<italic>r</italic> = .42, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05), and repeating four or more measures (<italic>r</italic> = .41, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05), with those who were rated as more self-regulated also tending to exhibit greater frequencies of writing on their music, varying tempo, and repeating passages of music four or more measures in length. Last, a significant, negative correlation was detected between self-regulation ratings and frequency of irrelevant playing (<italic>r</italic> = –.59, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01), suggesting that those who were rated as less self-regulated overall also exhibited more instances of irrelevant playing in their practice sessions.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study was designed to examine the self-regulated practice behaviors of intermediate band students. The observed frequency of practice frames was quite varied across participants, highlighting the importance of examining individual differences in intermediate students’ practicing. The mean duration of practice frames across the sample was somewhat short at 2 min 45 s, although the participants tended to begin their sessions with relatively longer durations of continuous playing. This may suggest a lack of prioritized strategies or students’ attempts at diagnosing potential trouble spots in the repertoire. In addition, the average durations of the later frames tended to become shorter and shorter, which could imply a loss of attention or focus toward the end of the session that was perhaps due to fatigue. This would be consistent with prior research that has shown beginning and intermediate musicians to be generally inefficient in their practicing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0022429412455201">Hallam, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0022429412455201">McPherson &amp; Davidson, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0022429412455201">McPherson &amp; Renwick, 2001</xref>). However, anecdotally, in some very rare cases, participants were observed practicing in shorter frames in a manner that may have been indicative of a strategic approach, such as reviewing problem areas in the repertoire. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0022429412455201">Austin and Berg (2006)</xref> also found that a small number of intermediate band and orchestra students were able to report strategic approaches to practicing. It would be valuable to consider observational approaches that allow researchers to examine how practice frame length, degree of goal-directed behavior, and use of isolation strategies may be related. This would be particularly valuable for determining effective approaches to self-regulation when a less-than-optimal amount of practice time is available for a learner.</p>
<p>The length of musical passages the participants chose to practice also was examined. All students chose to practice material greater than eight measures in length during at least one practice frame, whereas less than half of the sample chose shorter musical passages to practice during individual frames. The tendency of students to focus on relatively longer passages of music could reflect the difficulty inherent in diagnosing and isolating specific musical challenges. For example, the only musical objective focused on by every participant during his or her practicing was pitch accuracy. Only a few students were observed practicing with the intention of improving dynamics, rhythm, or articulation. This is in direct contrast to studies with advanced musicians who tended to isolate very specific segments of music and apply content-dependent strategies to overcome distinct musical challenges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0022429412455201">Chaffin &amp; Imreh, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0022429412455201">Nielsen, 1999</xref>). Although such information was not collected in the current study, it would be valuable for researchers to collect information on participants’ familiarity with the music they are practicing because this may impact their focus of attention.</p>
<p>Repetition of musical material was by far the behavior that most participants employed. Repetition is a commonly observed practice behavior regardless of whether novice (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0022429412455201">Miksza, 2007</xref>) or advanced musicians (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0022429412455201">Maynard, 2006</xref>) are observed. The next behavior most commonly used was varying tempo, which often entailed slowing material down for mastery. Irrelevant playing was exhibited by 50% of the participants, indicating that the students were not wholly attentive to their band repertoire during the practice sessions. The irrelevant playing observed included activities that may have been tangentially related to the task at hand, such as playing scales, solo literature, études, and band repertoire not included in the study. However, many examples of experimenting with unorthodox sounds or “goofing around” also were observed. It is important to note that the irrelevant playing could have served as a source of motivation for these students to continue practicing in this particular session. For example, researchers have reported that informal approaches to practice could be an important source of motivation for instrumental musicians (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0022429412455201">Moore, Burland, &amp; Davidson, 2003</xref>). The remaining behaviors reflected common rehearsal techniques used in instrumental music, such as silent fingering, writing on music, singing, and clapping, tapping, or patting rhythms or tempo. It appears that most students were not aware of or did not know how to apply more sophisticated strategies, such as whole-part-whole repetition and chunking. An alternative explanation could be that the participants simply were not motivated to apply practice strategies given the nature of the repertoire or the task they were presented with in this particular study. This is in contrast to previous findings indicating a wider range of practice strategies among advanced musicians (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0022429412455201">Duke et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0022429412455201">Miksza, 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0022429412455201">2011</xref>). Students may acquire a greater repertoire of strategies as they mature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0022429412455201">McPherson, 1997</xref>).</p>
<p>Several significant relationships between independent ratings of participants’ self-regulation and observed practice behaviors were found. Those participants who were rated as more self-regulated also exhibited a greater number of discrete practice behaviors and fewer instances of irrelevant playing. In addition, students who were more self-regulated engaged more often in varying tempo and repetition of passages of music greater than four measures in length. This is similar to the findings of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0022429412455201">Rohwer and Polk (2006)</xref>, who reported significant relationships between the number of practice strategies participants reported and objective measures of performance achievement. It is important to continue to investigate links between practice behavior, general self-regulation capacities, and performance outcomes among intermediate musicians.</p>
<p>The results of this study have many implications for instrumental music teaching. Participants’ tendencies to (a) work almost exclusively on note correction, (b) play through large passages of music for relatively long durations, and (c) incorporate relatively longer practice frames at the beginning of their sessions suggest that instruction in how to choose musical objectives and how to parse time efficiently is essential. Given that participants exhibited practice behaviors that were highly similar to common rehearsal techniques, it is important that teachers continue to model practice approaches for their students. There may be a particular need for teachers to model individually oriented or instrument-specific techniques specifically.</p>
<p>The observational method or self-regulation rating scale employed in this study could be valuable for those who wish to assess their students’ ability to regulate their own practicing. This would be an important first step toward differentiating practice instruction across students. This could be especially helpful given the tendency for students who are poor practicers to become disinterested in instrumental music or even to drop out (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0022429412455201">McPherson &amp; Davidson, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>The results of the current study also suggest many directions for future research. Combining observational procedures, such as those used in this study, with think-aloud approaches that reveal students’ underlying thought processes would be valuable to inferring student intent and degree of goal-oriented behavior. In addition, whether the results of this study generalize to broader populations of instrumentalists needs to be explored in future research with larger and more varied samples of students. A large cross-sectional sample may provide preliminary evidence of developmental trends in self-regulated practice behavior. However, a longitudinal study that tracks cohorts of students over time would be most valuable in determining how and/or whether students’ approaches to practice increase in sophistication and variety. Ultimately, studies of this nature could inform interventions that help students become better practicers. Interventions that emphasize self-analyses of practicing using the behavioral observation procedure could be helpful to orient students toward focusing on musical outcomes and employing specific behaviors rather than focusing simply on time spent practicing.</p>
<p>Developing musicians encounter difficulties as they grow into independent learners. This study offers a multifaceted perspective on how intermediate wind and percussion students self-regulate practicing. The observational analyses, strategic approach to analyzing practice sessions, and incorporation of independent ratings of self-regulation included in the current study provide information that is unique to the body of existing research. We hope that this research ultimately can aid in the development of methods for helping children become self-sufficient music learners.</p>
