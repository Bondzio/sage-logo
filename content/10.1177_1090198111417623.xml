<abstract>
<p>Previous research has found that religiosity may protect against risky alcohol and drug use behaviors among adolescents, but the social mechanics underpinning the relationship are not well understood. This study examined the relationship between religiosity, heavy drinking, and social norms among U.S. adolescents aged 12 to 17 years, using the 2007 National Survey on Drug Use and Health (<italic>n =</italic> 14,556). Based on a vicarious learning networks theoretical perspective, the effect of religiosity on heavy drinking behavior was hypothesized to be exerted indirectly through the norms of key reference groups in the social network (close friends and parents). Support was found for reference group norms as one underlying mechanism of the religiosity–alcohol relationship. Religiosity and nonpermissive drinking norms of parents, close friends, and peers maintained a strong protective association with adolescent heavy drinking. Supplementary analyses elaborated on the role of competing and complementary normative orientations among reference groups in the social network.</p>

<p>Although the minimum legal drinking age in the United States is 21 years, the majority of adolescents aged between 12 and 17 years have consumed alcohol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1090198111417623">Johnston, O’Malley, Bachman, &amp; Schulenberg, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1090198111417623">O’Malley, Johnston, &amp; Bachman, 1998</xref>). Past research has shown that 39% of 8th graders have consumed alcoholic beverages, whereas 58% of 10th graders and 72% of 12th graders have reported consuming alcohol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1090198111417623">Johnston et al., 2009</xref>). Moreover, 10% of 8th graders and 20% of 10th graders reported heavy drinking within the past 2 weeks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1090198111417623">Patrick &amp; Schulenberg, 2010</xref>). Adolescent alcohol use—particularly heavy alcohol use—is associated with a number of negative outcomes including drunk driving (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1090198111417623">Adlaf, Mann, &amp; Paglia, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1090198111417623">Escobedo, Chorba, &amp; Waxweiler, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1090198111417623">Grovenor, Toomey, &amp; Wagenaar, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1090198111417623">Riala, Hakko, Isohanni, Järvelin, &amp; Räsänen, 2004</xref>), impaired performance at school (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1090198111417623">O’Malley et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1090198111417623">Simons-Morton et al., 1999</xref>), high-risk sexual behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1090198111417623">Bonomo et al., 2001</xref>), decreased cohesion with friends and family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1090198111417623">Windle &amp; Davies, 1999</xref>), and hospitalization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1090198111417623">P. B. Johnson &amp; Richter, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1090198111417623">Riala et al., 2004</xref>). With a variety of negative outcomes found in past research, it is not surprising that studies continuously attempt to identify variables that can decrease the risk of heavy alcohol use by adolescents. One variable that has been found to buffer against risky alcohol use by adolescents is religiosity. Although the relationship between religiosity and alcohol use has been studied (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1090198111417623">Bahr &amp; Hoffman, 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1090198111417623">2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1090198111417623">Brown, Parks, Zimmerman, &amp; Phillips, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1090198111417623">Sinha, Cnaan, &amp; Gelles, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1090198111417623">Wills, Yaeger, &amp; Sandy, 2003</xref>), there remains much to learn about the complex array of mechanisms by which religiosity exerts its protective effects. In the current study, we used a theory-informed approach to examine the role of reference group norms in the relationship between religiosity and alcohol use among adolescents in the United States.</p>

<title>Religiosity and Adolescent Alcohol Use</title>
<p>National data measuring religious affiliation, religious service attendance, and church youth group participation show that religion is a part of life for the majority of U.S. adolescents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1090198111417623">Smith, Denton, Faris, &amp; Regnerus, 2002</xref>). Recent years have seen a growing number of studies that have focused on the relationship between adolescent religiosity and health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1090198111417623">Dew et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1090198111417623">Stewart &amp; Bolland, 2002</xref>). These studies have produced fairly consistent evidence that religiosity can buffer negative health behaviors and outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1090198111417623">Cotton, Zebracki, Rosenthal, Tsevat, &amp; Drotar, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1090198111417623">Dew et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1090198111417623">Regnerus, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1090198111417623">Rew &amp; Wong, 2006</xref>). With regard to alcohol use, a similar pattern has been found: Religiosity is negatively associated with alcohol use among adolescents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1090198111417623">Bahr &amp; Hoffman, 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1090198111417623">2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1090198111417623">Brown et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1090198111417623">Sinha et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1090198111417623">Wills et al., 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Although the negative association between religiosity and adolescent alcohol use has been well established, the pathways through which this association is manifested have been a source of contention. Religiosity is a complex phenomenon, embedded and interwoven throughout various social networks in adolescents’ lives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1090198111417623">Smith, 2003a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1090198111417623">2003b</xref>). This makes it particularly difficult to detail the indirect effects that religiosity has on youth (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1090198111417623">Regnerus, 2003</xref>). Studies have used a variety of statistical mediation analysis techniques to examine the underlying mechanisms responsible for religiosity’s potent effects on heavy drinking, albeit many examine the college student population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1090198111417623">Brown et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1090198111417623">Chawla, Neighbors, Lewis, Lee, &amp; Larimer, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1090198111417623">T. J. Johnson, Sheets, &amp; Kristeller, 2008</xref>) or use data that are not nationally representative (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1090198111417623">Brown et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1090198111417623">Stewart &amp; Bolland, 2002</xref>). A prospective study with continuation high school students found that religiosity/spirituality no longer predicted a composite measure of substance use once personal beliefs toward the morality of substance use were controlled (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1090198111417623">Sussman, Skara, De Calice, Hoffman, &amp; Dent, 2005</xref>), which could indicate that the protective effects of religiosity are indirect through its influence on morality beliefs. Past research focusing on alcohol use specifically has found that parental style (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1090198111417623">Stewart &amp; Bolland, 2002</xref>), social support (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1090198111417623">Brown, Salsman, Brechting, &amp; Carlson, 2007</xref>), personal attitudes toward alcohol use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1090198111417623">Chawla et al., 2007</xref>), and approval of others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1090198111417623">Chawla et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1090198111417623">T. J. Johnson et al., 2008</xref>) can all function as indirect pathways through which religiosity can affect alcohol use.</p>

<title>Theoretical Perspectives</title>
<p>Several theoretical perspectives or concepts were applied to frame the present inquiry, including the social norms approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1090198111417623">Borsari &amp; Carey, 2003</xref>), social learning theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1090198111417623">Bandura, 1969</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1090198111417623">1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1090198111417623">Maisto, Carey, &amp; Bradizza, 1999</xref>), religious network closure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1090198111417623">Smith, 2003a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1090198111417623">2003b</xref>), and vicarious learning networks (VLNs; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1090198111417623">Gryczynski &amp; Ward, 2011</xref>). The widely used social norms argument identifies two types of social norms that influence alcohol use behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1090198111417623">Borsari &amp; Carey, 2003</xref>). The first, injunctive norms, refers to the attitudes people hold regarding a behavior and the conditions under which it is viewed as acceptable. The second, descriptive norms, refers to the actual behaviors in which persons engage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1090198111417623">Borsari &amp; Carey, 2003</xref>). Both types of norms are powerful predictors of heavy alcohol consumption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1090198111417623">Neighbors, Lee, Lewis, Fossos, &amp; Larimer, 2007</xref>). For these norms to affect drinking behavior, they must first be learned. The process of vicarious learning is one natural venue through which social norms are transmitted and absorbed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1090198111417623">Ward &amp; Gryczynski, 2009</xref>). During this process, continual learning occurs through observations, communications, and interactions with others, without direct reinforcement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1090198111417623">Bandura, 1969</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1090198111417623">1977</xref>). Both injunctive and descriptive norms are conveyed by various individuals and groups, such as peers, friends, and parents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1090198111417623">Borsari &amp; Carey, 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1090198111417623">2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1090198111417623">2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1090198111417623">Fenzel, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1090198111417623">Neighbors et al., 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Although these perspectives offer conceptual guidance on the relationship between social norms and alcohol use, they provide less insight into how <italic>religiosity</italic> protects adolescents from risky drinking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1090198111417623">Bahr &amp; Hoffman, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1090198111417623">Brown et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1090198111417623">Sinha et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1090198111417623">Wills et al., 2003</xref>). In a series of studies on religiosity among U.S. adolescents, Smith (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1090198111417623">2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1090198111417623">2003a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1090198111417623">2003b</xref>) found empirical evidence supporting the idea that an adolescent’s religion can create “dense networks of relational ties within which youth are embedded,” what he terms as <italic>network closure</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1090198111417623">Smith, 2003a</xref>, p. 260). These networks consist of not only an adolescent’s parents but also other persons who are either directly or indirectly involved with an adolescent’s life and can convey specific attitudes and practices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1090198111417623">Smith, 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1090198111417623">2003a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1090198111417623">2003b</xref>). However, the religious network is not the only social network in existence: an adolescent also operates within other networks formed through a number of contexts (e.g., an adolescent’s school, involvement in extracurricular activities).</p>
<p>Drawing from the social norms approach and social learning theory, the concept of VLNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1090198111417623">Gryczynski &amp; Ward, 2011</xref>) was used to guide the present analysis. Broadly, VLNs refer to the behavioral reference groups that make up an individual’s social universe. Individuals coalesce into reference groups based on certain shared characteristics, and the ecological collection of reference groups creates an infrastructure for social learning through norm diffusion. The relative power of a reference group to influence behavior is a function of its positioning within the social topography, including network distance and the balance of reinforcing and countervailing forces exerted by other groups and actors in the social network.</p>
<p>Network distance is an important feature of the VLN concept and refers to the relative positioning of a given reference group in the social network. Two aspects of network distance include exposure (the frequency and scope of interactions with members of the reference group) and relational significance or identification (the meanings attached to relationships with actors in the group and the group as a whole). In general, individuals within reference groups that are positioned further in the social network in terms of exposure and relational significance will exert weaker influences on behaviors than individuals in more proximate groupings. However, because individuals are the elemental vehicle for norm diffusion, even more distant reference groups could have significant influences on behavior if group membership is large, exposure is high, and there is a high degree of identification with the group. From a VLN perspective, the most entrenched behaviors (whether health promoting or health demoting) are produced when there is triangulation of concordant normative messages from different reference groups in the social network. Conversely, a shift in the perceived norms of a single well-positioned reference group could potentially offset other social influences (e.g., serving to either promote or buffer against health-risking behavior).</p>
<p>External forces and conditions, as well as intrinsic features of the individual, can shape the contexts and human relationships that give rise to a VLN. Religiosity is one such variable. In most cases (except, perhaps, in small and secluded communities), religiosity would be expected to structure the norms and attitudes of proximate reference groups more so than groups on the outer boundaries of the social network. For example, religiosity could play a pivotal role in shaping an adolescent’s family system and relationships with close friends but would not have much bearing on the attitudes and norms of peers in an adolescent’s broader school district. Consistent with this conceptualization, previous research with college students has documented that the norms of friends have a stronger indirect effect on the relationship between religiosity and alcohol use than the norms of more socially distal “typical students” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1090198111417623">Chawla et al., 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>In households where religion is an organizing feature of family life, parents may be more likely to convey injunctive norms against alcohol use by young people and model descriptive norms that further discourage heavy drinking. These norms would be reinforced by the teachings and expectations of the broader religious community wherein the family is involved. Thus, religiosity in the family system would influence parents’ attitudes and expectations regarding alcohol consumption by their adolescent offspring. Likewise, involvement in organized religion and internalization of religious beliefs would affect the venues and contexts in which adolescents develop friendships and could affect the adolescent’s own propensity to gravitate toward others who share a common set of behavioral characteristics (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1090198111417623">Bahr &amp; Hoffman, 2008</xref>, for a useful discussion of the religiosity–substance use relationship viewed through social learning and control lenses).</p>
<p>Drawing from these theoretical perspectives, we hypothesized that three patterns of religiosity’s effect on adolescent heavy alcohol use would be found. First, we expected to find that adolescent religiosity would have a direct negative effect on heavy alcohol use. Second, we expected that nonpermissive alcohol use norms of key reference groups in the social network would have direct, negative relationships with heavy alcohol use. Third, we expected that the protective effects exerted by religiosity would be partially mediated by the alcohol use norms conveyed by an adolescent’s parents and close friends. A supplementary analysis guided by the VLN concept was also conducted to examine the impact of different combinations of reference group norms on adolescent heavy drinking.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<sec id="section4-1090198111417623">
<title>Data and Sample</title>
<p>This study used data from the 2007 National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH), obtained from the Inter-University Consortium for Political and Social Science Research. The NSDUH is an annual survey that collects nationally representative data from all 50 states and the District of Columbia, with its respondents representing the civilian, noninstitutionalized U.S. population age 12 years and older. Details about the methodology of the NSDUH can be found elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1090198111417623">Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration [SAMHSA], 2008</xref>). The NSDUH uses a complex sampling design and weights to achieve national representation. In 2007, the NSDUH had a 73.9% weighted interview response rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1090198111417623">SAMHSA, 2008</xref>), resulting in 55,435 observations in the public-use NSDUH data file. The analysis focused on the adolescent subpopulation aged 12 to 17 years, of which there were 17,727 respondents. The analysis sample was subsequently restricted to cases with valid data for the variables of interest (described below), yielding a final unweighted <italic>n</italic> = 14,556. Some of the missing cases were due to the features of the survey design (e.g., some questions of high conceptual importance were legitimately asked only of those who were enrolled in school). Where possible, the findings presented herein were confirmed using the full available adolescent sample. Stata/SE 11 was used for the analyses, all of which accounted for the survey sampling design to yield more accurate estimates.</p>

<title>Recent heavy alcohol use</title>
<p>Respondents were classified as engaging in recent heavy drinking (0 = <italic>no</italic>, 1 = <italic>yes</italic>) if they reported consuming five or more alcoholic drinks within a couple of hours, on at least one occasion within the past 30 days. This reflects the definition of “binge drinking” used by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1090198111417623">SAMHSA (2002)</xref>.</p>

<sec id="section7-1090198111417623">
<title>Religiosity</title>
<p>A single composite measure of religiosity was created as a scale (range: 4-16) by summing four items available in the NSDUH. The first three items (all coded 1 = <italic>strongly disagree</italic>, 2 = <italic>disagree</italic>, 3 = <italic>agree</italic>, 4 = <italic>strongly agree</italic>) included in the scale were (a) my religious beliefs are very important to me, (b) my religious beliefs influence the decisions I make in life, and (c) it is important that my friends share my religious beliefs. The final item measured (d) the number of times the respondent attended religious services in the past year (1 = <italic>0 to 5 times</italic>, 2 = <italic>6 to 24 times</italic>, 3 = <italic>25 to 52 times</italic>, 4 = <italic>more than 52 times</italic>).

<sec id="section8-1090198111417623">
<title>Reference group norms</title>
<p>Social norms regarding alcohol use were captured by a single variable for each reference group. These measures included (a) parents and (b) close friends would <italic>strongly disapprove</italic> of the respondent having one or two drinks of alcohol nearly every day (1 = <italic>yes</italic>), as opposed to <italic>somewhat disapprove</italic> or <italic>neither approve nor disapprove</italic> (0 = <italic>no</italic>). Thus, the norms of parents and close friends were assessed as injunctive norms using uniform survey question structure. As shorthand throughout this article, we use the term <italic>nonpermissive</italic> to refer to strong disapproval of alcohol use by parents or close friends. We use the term <italic>permissive</italic> to refer to the opposite (not strong disapproval).</p>

<title>Control variables</title>
<p>The following dichotomous measures were used as control variables (all 0 = <italic>no</italic>, 1 = <italic>yes</italic>): male, race/ethnicity (a series of dummy variables including non-Hispanic White, non-Hispanic Black, Hispanic, and non-Hispanic other, with non-Hispanic White treated as the reference category), good academic performance (“B” grades or higher in school), and parent–child communication (respondent reports talking to parents about problems). Two final control variables included age (in years, range: 12-17) and a scale created to represent the degree of support received by the adolescent from his/her parents (range: 4-16; α = .78). This scale included the following items: how often in the past year had parents (a) checked to see if the adolescent had done his/her homework, (b) helped with his/her homework, (c) let him/her know she/he had done a good job, and (d) told the adolescent that they were proud of him/her (all coded 1 = <italic>never</italic>, 2 = <italic>seldom</italic>, 3 = <italic>sometimes</italic>, 4 = <italic>always</italic>).</p>
<p>In addition to the injunctive norms of parents and close friends, information was also available on the descriptive norms of a more relationally distal reference group: the perceived drinking patterns of school peers. A dichotomous variable was created to capture whether the respondent perceived that none/a few other students in the respondent’s grade drink alcohol (1 = <italic>yes</italic>), as opposed to most/all other students (0 = <italic>no</italic>). In keeping with the convention described above, we adopt the nonpermissive versus permissive shorthand in reporting this variable.</p>

<title>Descriptive Characteristics</title>
<p>Overall, 10.6% of adolescents reported recent heavy drinking in the past month. The majority of adolescents reported that their parents (90.0%) and close friends (65.5%) would strongly disapprove of them having one or two drinks regularly. Slightly more than half (54.7%) reported that no/few peers in their grade drank alcohol. On average, adolescents fell in the middle range of the religiosity scale (<italic>M</italic> = 10.02; <italic>SD</italic> = 3.20). Fifty-one percent were male, and the average age was 14.7 years (<italic>SD</italic> = 1.67). The majority were non-Hispanic White (62.2%), followed by Hispanic (16.9%), non-Hispanic Black (14.2%), and non-Hispanic other (6.7%). Most respondents reported having grades of “B” or higher (71.7%) and reported talking to their parents about problems (68.9%). Adolescents received relatively high levels of support from their parents as measured by the supportive parenting scale (<italic>M</italic> = 13.2; <italic>SD</italic> = 2.76).</p>

<title>Analyses</title>
<p>A series of logistic regression models were estimated to examine the indirect effects of parent and close friend norms, using two complementary approaches to assess mediation of the relationship between religiosity and alcohol use. Mediation analysis is used to test whether the effect of an explanatory variable <italic>X</italic> (religiosity) on an outcome <italic>Y</italic> (heavy drinking) is carried indirectly through another variable <italic>M</italic> (reference group norms; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1090198111417623">Figure 1</xref>). First, a product-of-coefficients test was used to assess the statistical significance of the indirect effect of religiosity through the norms of parents and norms of close friends in simple mediation models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1090198111417623">Aroian, 1947</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1090198111417623">Preacher &amp; Hayes, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1090198111417623">Sobel, 1982</xref>). In addition to determination of statistical significance, the magnitude of the indirect effect was calculated as the proportion of total effect that is mediated, a useful gauge of effect size in large-sample mediation analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1090198111417623">MacKinnon, Warsi, &amp; Dwyer, 1995</xref>). Traditional product-of-coefficients approaches pose particular challenges in the presence of binary mediator or outcome variables due to the use of nonlinear models in which coefficients exhibit different scaling depending on whether the variable is an outcome or predictor. To remedy this problem, we properly standardized the estimates in this approach using formulas detailed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1090198111417623">MacKinnon and Dwyer (1993)</xref>.</p>

<p>In addition to the product-of-coefficients test with simple mediation models, the causal steps approach was used to confirm the findings while controlling for a spectrum of potential confounding variables (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1090198111417623">Baron &amp; Kenny, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1090198111417623">Preacher &amp; Hayes, 2008</xref>). By the traditional logic of the causal steps approach, three conditions need to be satisfied in order to determine that mediation is present. First, there needs to be a significant effect of <italic>X</italic> on <italic>Y</italic> (<italic>Path c</italic>). Next, there also needs to be a significant effect produced by <italic>X</italic> on <italic>M</italic> (<italic>Path a</italic>). Finally, when controlling for the effect of <italic>M</italic> on <italic>Y</italic> (<italic>Path b</italic>), the effect of <italic>X</italic> on <italic>Y</italic> (<italic>Path c</italic>′) needs to be less than the effect of <italic>X</italic> on <italic>Y</italic> in the absence of the hypothesized mediator (<italic>Path c</italic>). If the direct effect of <italic>X</italic> is at or near zero in the third step, full mediation is indicated, whereas partial mediation occurs if <italic>X</italic> remains significant but decreases in a nontrivial way (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1090198111417623">Baron &amp; Kenny, 1986</xref>). Although this traditional approach does not provide a quantitative metric of the indirect effect in the case of binary mediators and/or outcomes (due to the use of nonlinear regression models as described above, such that <italic>c</italic>′ − <italic>c</italic> ≠ <italic>ab</italic> in the standard mediational model; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1090198111417623">MacKinnon &amp; Dwyer, 1993</xref>), it can provide a useful indication of whether any significant relationships found between <italic>X</italic> and <italic>M</italic> (<italic>Path a</italic>) and <italic>M</italic> and <italic>Y</italic> (<italic>Path b</italic>) remain intact when controlling for potential confounders. Mediation was assessed separately for norms of parents and close friends, with the other mediator included with the other control variables in each step of the process.</p>

<title>Inference of Mediation in Multivariate Models Using the Casual Steps Approach</title>
<p>The causal steps approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1090198111417623">Baron &amp; Kenny, 1986</xref>) was used to confirm the findings of the product-of-coefficients analyses, while simultaneously controlling for the other hypothesized mediators and a variety of potential confounding variables. The first step involved determining whether religiosity had a significant effect on the outcome in the absence of each hypothesized mediator (table not shown).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1090198111417623">1</xref></sup> Religiosity was associated with significantly lower odds of heavy alcohol use in the absence of the parent norms variable (odds ratio [OR] = 0.924, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.898, 0.952; <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001) and in the absence of the close friend norms variable (OR = 0.921, 95% CI = 0.896, 0.948; <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001), meeting the first condition of the causal steps approach for both hypothesized mediators. The second step in this approach is to determine if <italic>X</italic> has a significant effect on <italic>M</italic> (table not shown). The results of these models showed that significant relationships among religiosity and the norms variables exist in the expected directions, thereby satisfying criteria for this step. Higher levels of religiosity were associated with increased odds of respondents reporting strong disapproval for him/her drinking by their parents (OR = 1.072, 95% CI = 1.044, 1.101; <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001) and by their close friends (OR = 1.070, 95% CI = 1.052, 1.089; <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001).</p>
<p>With the first two conditions in the causal steps approach met, the final condition to satisfy full mediation is for the independent variable to no longer have a significant effect when the mediators are included in the model. Otherwise, if the independent variable remains significant but its effect is attenuated, partial mediation is said to occur (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1090198111417623">Baron &amp; Kenny, 1986</xref>). The final logistic regression model in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1090198111417623">Table 2</xref> shows the direct effects of religiosity and reference group norms. Religiosity continued to have a significant negative association with recent heavy drinking (OR = 0.930, 95% CI = 0.903, 0.957; <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001). Thus, the causal steps models confirm the findings of the product-of-coefficients analysis, in that relationships between key variables of interest are significant in a pattern consistent with partial mediation.</p>

<title>Impact of Different Combinations of VLN Reference Group Norms</title>
<p>To elucidate the impact of different combinations of reference group norms on adolescent recent heavy drinking, predictive margins were calculated from the final fitted model for all possible combinations of parent, close friend, and peer norms variables (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1090198111417623">Table 3</xref>). The predictive margins represent the predicted probability of the outcome when the reference group norm variables are fixed at specified values. As expected, uniform alignment of parent, close friend, and peer reference group norms in the permissive direction produced the highest predicted probability of recent heavy drinking (28.7%). Likewise, the lowest predicted probability was seen when parents, friends, and peers were all viewed as nonpermissive (3.0%). This is a stark contrast, representing more than a 950% change in the predicted probabilities of recent heavy alcohol use with normative alignment of all three reference groups in a permissive versus nonpermissive orientation. Computed linear combinations of coefficients mirrored these findings: Compared with those who perceived all three reference groups as being nonpermissive, adolescents reporting permissive drinking norms across all three reference groups had dramatically higher odds of recent heavy drinking (OR = 16.587, 95% CI = 12.827, 21.448; <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001).</p>

<p>The findings for the various combinations of reference group norms indicate that, in general, change in the perceived norms of even one reference group has an impact on the predicted probabilities of recent heavy alcohol use. For example, even among those with nonpermissive close friends and peers, the average predicted probability of engaging in recent heavy alcohol use was 6.7% for respondents with permissive parents, over twice as high as when all three reference groups were viewed as having nonpermissive alcohol use norms. Peer norms produced the largest change in predicted probabilities relative to uniform normative alignment of all three reference groups, although norms of parents and close friends also had sizable impacts.</p>

Our first hypothesis was that adolescent religiosity would have a direct negative effect on heavy alcohol use. Support for this hypothesis was found. Second, we hypothesized that nonpermissive alcohol use norms would have a negative effect on adolescent heavy drinking. Again, we found strong support for this hypothesis with each reference group. The third hypothesis was that the protective effects exerted by religiosity on adolescent heavy drinking alcohol use would be partially mediated by the alcohol use norms of parents and close friends. Using the product-of-coefficients approach in simple mediation models, significant indirect effects were found for both reference groups (although religiosity’s indirect effect through close friend norms was stronger than through parent norms). The significant relationships between religiosity, norms, and heavy drinking were confirmed in more elaborate models using the causal steps approach. Although the relevant steps of this process were satisfied, both religiosity and reference group norms continued to have strong, independent associations with recent heavy alcohol use in the final model. These significant direct effects are consistent with past research findings regarding religiosity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1090198111417623">Bahr &amp; Hoffman, 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1090198111417623">2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1090198111417623">Brown et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1090198111417623">Sinha et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1090198111417623">Wills et al., 2003</xref>) as well as social norms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1090198111417623">Borsari &amp; Carey, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1090198111417623">Neighbors et al., 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>The supplementary analyses of different combinations of reference group norms are on the whole consistent with the VLN conceptual framework. The perceived alcohol use norms of key reference groups in the adolescent’s social network had a considerable impact on drinking behavior, with the strongest influences on heavy alcohol use manifesting with uniform normative alignment of parent, close friend, and peer reference groups. Importantly, these findings suggest that, to some degree, parents who convey nonpermissive expectations regarding alcohol use may be able to offset the influences of more permissive groups operating in the social network. The injunctive norms of parents had similar effects to those of close friends with respect to the magnitude of the negative association with heavy drinking. However, these findings also highlight that parental norms, on balance, are less strongly associated with adolescent heavy drinking than are the descriptive norms of peers. The perceived drinking behavior of peers, defined as other students in the respondent’s grade, had the strongest impact on recent heavy alcohol use among the three reference groups examined. Although it may appear counterintuitive, this finding is explained by a tenet of the VLN model, which holds that distal reference groups can have stronger influences on behavior than proximate groups if the distal group is composed of a large number of people (i.e., many learning pathways for norms transmission) and exposure and group identification are both high. Our findings are consistent with previous research conducted with college students, which found that descriptive norms of “typical students” were stronger predictors of drinking behavior than injunctive norms of close friends or parents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1090198111417623">Neighbors et al., 2007</xref>). Recent research highlights that individuals are able to distinguish between norms of different reference groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1090198111417623">Larimer et al., 2009</xref>) and that the association between alcohol use and perceived norms is stronger with higher levels of identification with a reference group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1090198111417623">Neighbors, LaBrie, et al., 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Although the VLN model presents a plausible explanation for these findings, there are competing explanations as well. Importantly, the current study cannot fully disentangle reference group from norm-type effects. This is because the NSDUH assessed parent and close friend norms as injunctive norms (perceived <italic>disapproval</italic> of drinking), whereas peer norms were assessed as descriptive norms (perceived drinking <italic>behavior</italic>). To the extent that descriptive and injunctive norms exert unique effects, this measurement imprecision limits the ability of this study to adequately illuminate the inner workings of the VLN model. It would be much preferable to have common measures of both injunctive and descriptive norms for each reference group. This would alleviate the potential confounding and allow for much richer comparisons of different norm effects in different reference groups. Few studies on alcohol use have compared injunctive and descriptive norms directly. In one such study with college students, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1090198111417623">Cho (2006)</xref> found that descriptive norms of generic campus peers were more strongly associated with alcohol consumption than injunctive norms of friends among some categories of drinkers, a finding in line with the current study. However, descriptive norms of friends were the most salient predictors of alcohol use among occasional heavy and frequent heavy drinkers. Thus, part of the reason behind the stronger effect found for descriptive peer norms may be that descriptive norms are inherently better predictors of alcohol use than injunctive norms. It is also possible that the relative influence of injunctive and descriptive norms could vary as a function of individual characteristics such social desirability and age, as could adolescents’ degree of susceptibility to peer influences in general. The role of norms could also differ based on norm type and reference group proximity. In a study with college students, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1090198111417623">Neighbors and colleagues (2008)</xref> found that perceived approval of alcohol use by distal peers was negatively associated with drinking frequency after controlling for personal attitudes, peer descriptive norms, and injunctive norms of parents and friends.</p>
<p>The findings of the current study have a number of implications for future research. It would be beneficial for future researchers to continue to seek an understanding of the indirect effects by which religiosity influences alcohol use and other health behaviors. Yet this is no easy task: Mapping the various avenues of religiosity’s indirect effects is difficult (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1090198111417623">Regnerus, 2003</xref>), and the question does not easily lend itself to research designs that can produce the most conclusive answers (e.g., randomized studies). In conducting research on how religiosity influences alcohol use and other health behaviors, theory can be an indispensable tool. Although social-behavioral theories commonly applied to substance use are an important component, future research should also incorporate theoretical arguments specific to religiosity, such as Smith’s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1090198111417623">2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1090198111417623">2003a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1090198111417623">2003b</xref>) concept of network closure. Future research should also examine the role of different reference group norms in relation to those of other reference groups operating in the VLN. Further dissection of the nuances of normative influences through VLNs could allow for a better understanding of the social conditions under which the impact of certain reference groups on behavior is minimized or maximized. Work in this area could also lead to better understanding of the social pathways through which religiosity (and other variables with a strong social learning component) may indirectly affect alcohol use.</p>
<p>Several limitations of this study should be noted. Although the NSDUH allowed for a large and representative sample, it was a secondary, cross-sectional data source that only allowed for testing associations at a single point in time. Furthermore, we had to rely on the available survey items to operationalize religiosity and reference group norms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1090198111417623">Berry, 2005</xref>). Although this is a common limitation when using survey data, it warrants some caution for interpretation. The use of dichotomous measures, necessitated by the limitations of the data and the technical constraints of mediation analysis, has the undesirable effect of reducing variance and diminishing statistical power (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1090198111417623">Aiken &amp; West, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1090198111417623">Cohen, 1983</xref>). In addition, survey questions asked in the NSDUH allowed this study to consider only three broad reference groups (parents, close friends, and school peers), which obscures the rich complexity and dynamism of actual VLNs. As described above, it is unknown the degree to which the stronger direct effects of peer norms were a function of this variable tapping descriptive (as opposed to injunctive) norms. Although <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1090198111417623">Baron and Kenny’s (1986)</xref> causal steps is the most widely used approach to test for mediation, increased favor is being given to more advanced techniques relying on resampling strategies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1090198111417623">Preacher &amp; Hayes, 2008</xref>). However, at the time of this writing these techniques have not been fully adapted for use in complex survey data with dichotomous mediators/outcomes. We were able to mitigate this limitation by also using a product-of-coefficients approach for simple mediation models, in which we adjusted estimates to account for both the complex survey design and the use of dichotomous variables in the analyses. Finally, although the analysis was informed by theory, we examined mediation in a statistical sense only.</p>
<p>Even considering these limitations, the present research sheds light on the relationship between alcohol use, religiosity, and social norms among U.S. adolescents. Both religiosity and social norms are strongly associated with recent heavy alcohol use behavior, with unique effects for the norms of different reference groups in the social network. With respect to the relationship between religiosity and alcohol use, the evidence is consistent with a discernible indirect effect via social norms; however, much of the relationship remains to be explained. More research, preferably with more sensitive measures of religiosity and social norms, is needed. Using theoretically informed models such as the VLN approach can lead to a better understanding of not only what type of effect religiosity has on adolescent alcohol use but also of the hidden social mechanisms that may propel this effect.</p>

<title>Implications for Practice</title>
<p>This study has implications for preventing alcohol abuse among adolescents as well as broader implications for understanding and intervening in health risking behaviors. Our findings support previous research that has found a robust protective effect of religiosity against adolescent substance use behaviors that could compromise their future health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1090198111417623">Bahr &amp; Hoffman, 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1090198111417623">2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1090198111417623">Brown et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1090198111417623">Dew et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1090198111417623">Gryczynski &amp; Ward, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1090198111417623">Rew &amp; Wong, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1090198111417623">Sinha et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1090198111417623">Wills et al., 2003</xref>). Furthermore, the findings are consistent with the idea that some of religiosity’s protective properties may be attributable to features of the social relationships that religion itself plays a hand in shaping. Adolescence is a critical and impressionable time in the lifespan of an individual in terms of health behavior. For adolescents who drink alcohol, there is not only the acute threat of elevated risk taking but also the threat of learning unhealthy behaviors that lead to adverse and potentially devastating health outcomes in the longer term. The assertion of independence that is the hallmark of adolescence can result in young people distancing themselves from the normative attitudes and belief systems that help guard an adolescent from engaging in adverse health behaviors.</p>
<p>In some circumstances, it may be appropriate for alcohol abuse prevention/intervention strategies to encourage youth who are experiencing mixed normative signals to maintain or strengthen a preexisting connection with friends in their religious community. However, it is important to note that religious beliefs (or lack thereof) are often a deeply personal thing. Thus, although intervention approaches that acknowledge and are responsive to these beliefs could be useful in practice, clinicians and health educators should weigh carefully how to appropriately address youth religiosity in service planning and delivery. In many cases, it may be most appropriate to avoid addressing religiosity directly, instead focusing on the relationships and social norms that seem to drive at least some part of religiosity’s protective benefits. Furthermore, the diversity of religious affiliation among U.S. adolescents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1090198111417623">Smith et al., 2002</xref>) adds another layer of complexity to addressing religiosity in intervention design and practice. One method for successfully navigating these intricacies may be for practitioners to form partnerships with faith-based organizations and places of worship that are interested in championing healthy behaviors and preventing alcohol abuse among young people in their communities. Public health partnerships with faith-based organizations could leverage their ability to create opportunities for adolescents to form supportive friendships that promote nonpermissive substance use norms.</p>
<p>This study also holds implications for the design of intervention approaches that seek to change behavior by providing feedback about norms or correcting erroneous perceptions about norms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1090198111417623">Carey, Scott-Sheldon, Carey, &amp; DeMartini, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1090198111417623">DiClemente, Marinilli, Singh, &amp; Bellino, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1090198111417623">Lewis &amp; Neighbors, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1090198111417623">Neighbors, Lewis, et al., 2010</xref>). Research has shown that norm misperceptions are common (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1090198111417623">Larimer et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1090198111417623">Martens et al., 2006</xref>) and that education about actual norms has the potential to change behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1090198111417623">Lewis &amp; Neighbors, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1090198111417623">Neighbors, Larimer, &amp; Lewis, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1090198111417623">Neighbors, Lewis, et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1090198111417623">Schultz, Nolan, Cialdini, Goldstein, &amp; Griskevicius, 2007</xref>). There is also evidence that normative comparisons targeted to individual characteristics can be more effective than generic feedback (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1090198111417623">Lewis &amp; Neighbors, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1090198111417623">Neighbors et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1090198111417623">Neighbors, Lewis, et al., 2010</xref>). Our findings support a powerful relationship between social norms and heavy alcohol use. The finding that the descriptive norm of distal school peers is a strong predictor of heavy drinking, even after controlling for injunctive norms of proximate reference groups, implies that descriptive norms feedback may be beneficial even where groups closest to the adolescent are more approving of alcohol use. It is also encouraging that, compared with those who perceived permissive drinking norms throughout their social network, the predicted probabilities for heavy drinking were considerably lower if adolescents viewed even one reference group as nonpermissive. Our findings suggest that it might make sense for health education practitioners delivering norms-based interventions to highlight and increase awareness of multiple reference groups or subgroups that hold less permissive alcohol use norms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1090198111417623">Larimer et al., 2009</xref>). As advanced by the VLN concept, the norms of distal reference groups can be quite powerful given adequate levels of exposure and identification and should not be ignored by practitioners.</p>
