         <title>History of Lung Transplantation</title>
         <p>Lung transplantation became a life-prolonging treatment option for end-stage lung disease in the 1980s. Cystic fibrosis (CF), COPD, IPF, and idiopathic PAH (IPAH) are a few of the conditions in which a lung transplant can be curative.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0897190012466048">1</xref>
            </sup> This review will highlight the most common indications for lung transplantation, immunosuppressant medication commonly used posttransplantation, and common complications seen after transplant. The focus will be on the pharmacotherapy commonly seen by the pharmacist on the multidisciplinary health care team taking care of this patient population.</p>
         <p>The first lung transplants were performed in the early 1900s, with single-lobe transplant experiments in animals. The early human lung transplants in the 1960s were met with defeat and frustration as the surgeons learned more about the surgical technique and the importance of immunosuppression. In 1981, the first successful human heart–lung transplant was performed by Dr Bruce Reitz.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0897190012466048">1</xref>
            </sup> Since the 1980s and the development of potent immunosuppressant medications, such as cyclosporine in 1978, lung transplantation has become a lifesaving surgery for some patients.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0897190012466048">1</xref>
            </sup>
         </p>
         <p>Approximately 1500 lung transplants were performed in 2008, a number which has almost doubled from 1999 at 864 patients per year.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0897190012466048">2</xref>
            </sup> The majority of the patients receive their lung transplant between the age of 50 and 64. In 2007, adjusted survival rates at 3 months was 92%, at 1 year was 9%, at 5 years was 52%, and at 10 years was 21%.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0897190012466048">2</xref>
            </sup> Most patients remain on the transplant list waiting for 3 months, up to 2 years.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0897190012466048">2</xref>
            </sup>
         </p>
         <p>In general, patient selection becomes one of the most important factors, as patients must be sick enough from their primary disease to require a lung transplant; yet they also must be strong enough to survive the procedure and have a meaningful recovery.</p>

            <title>Cystic Fibrosis</title>
            <p>Cystic Fibrosis is considered the most common lethal genetic disease of caucasian people worldwide. The life expectancy currently of a person diagnosed with CF is approximately 37 years, although experts are predicting this age to be increased to the mid-50s in the future with newer technologies and treatment options.<sup>
                  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0897190012466048">3</xref>
               </sup> The disease is caused by a mutation in the gene that codes for the CF transmembrane conductance regulator protein (CFTR). This protein is exposed in epithelial and blood cells, and it functions as a chloride channel, although many other regulatory roles have been identified within the CTFR protein.<sup>
                  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0897190012466048">3</xref>
               </sup> There are 4 proposed mechanism of how the genetic mutation leads to the classic presentation of CF. The CTFR dysfunction leads to excess sodium and water resorption that reduces the lubrication layer between the epithelial cells and mucus that caused cilial dysfunction and inability to clear mucus secretions. The excess of salt and chloride in the periciliary layer causes disruption of the body’s natural immune processes, including de-activation of natural antibiotic molecules. This immunosuppressed state predisposes the CF patient to serious bacterial infections. Inflammation plays an important role in the pathogenesis of CF. Abnormally high levels of inflammatory markers, interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, and tumor necrosis factor, have been identified in the CF cell cultures of infected and uninfected lungs. Another mechanism of pathogenesis is in the presence of a functional CTFR protein; <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> binds the CTFR and activates the innate immune response. This process does not occur in CF lungs, where the CRFR is dysfunctional, which allows the colonization and subsequent infection of <italic>P aeruginosa</italic> in patients with CF. Diagnosis of CF can occur at any age, but usually occurs before age 2, when a child presents with any of the signs of CF including but not limited to failure to thrive, salty-tasting skin, chronic diarrhea or abdominal pain, cholestasis, and recurrent pneumonias. Newborn screening is supported by the US Center for Disease Control and Prevention and the definitive diagnostic test remains the chloride sweat test.<sup>
                  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0897190012466048">3</xref>
               </sup> A diagnosis is made if the concentration of chloride is &gt; 60 mmol/L with clinical features. The manifestations of CF deregulated chloride channels include pulmonary disease, pancreatic insufficiency, endocrine disorders, and reproduction problems. The pulmonary disease occurs early in life. The lungs become inflamed, infected, and chronically colonized with organisms; usually <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> and <italic>Haemophilus influenza</italic> first as an infant, then <italic>P aeruginosa</italic> later on in life. <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> over time produces an alginate coat biofilm that becomes impossible to clear. Mucoid <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> will persist in the lower respiratory tracts of CF patients and is associated with increased mortality. Other infection-causing organisms seen in CF are <italic>Burkholderia cepacia</italic>, <italic>Mycobacterium </italic>spp including tuberculosis, <italic>Stenotrophomonas maltophilia</italic>, and <italic>Aspergillus fumigatus.</italic> These pathogens are also seen to cause pneumonia in the lungs of transplanted CF patients.<sup>
                  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0897190012466048">3</xref>
               </sup> The chronic infection leads to hypoxemia, air trapping, and hypercarbia. It is estimated that pulmonary disease is responsible for 80% of the CF-related deaths.<sup>
                  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0897190012466048">3</xref>
               </sup>
            </p>
            <p>Treatment for CF is central to the management of pulmonary exacerbations and supportive treatment of concomitant disease such as diabetes, pancreatitic insufficiency, and malnutrition. Exacerbations must be aggressively treated once they are recognized. The patients will receive intravenous (IV) fluids, IV antibiotics, plus inhaled antibiotics. Lung transplantation will be considered when the forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV<sub>1</sub>) is &lt;30% predicted. Certain factors including patient age, gender, lung infection or colonization, and rate of lung function decline will affect the surgeon’s decision on whether or not to operate.<sup>

               </sup> Transplanted CF patients have a 50% survival rate at 6 years’ posttransplant; therefore, this treatment option is reserved for the very ill CF patients.<sup>

               </sup> Symptoms of airway disease do not develop until a significant loss of lung function occurs. According to the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) guidelines, a diagnosis can be made when the FEV<sub>1</sub> is &lt;80% predicted, and a FEV<sub>1</sub>:forced vital capacity (FVC) ratio is less than 0.70<sup>3</sup>, and the patient is nonresponsive to albuterol.<sup>
                  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0897190012466048">4</xref>
               </sup> Additionally, these patients are different from those with asthma because they lack the bronchoconstriction response seen after a methacholine challenge, whereas patients with asthma will experience bronchoconstriction. There is overlap in pathology and diagnostic testing between asthma and COPD; therefore, the patients’ smoking status and family history play an important role in the diagnosis. Treatment is aimed at symptom relief, limiting exacerbations and complications and improving function. Smoking cessation is the most important intervention a patient can make to improve survival from the disease. Short-acting inhaled anticholinergic and beta-agonist medications are considered first-line treatment, which will be followed by a switch to long-acting anticholinergic or beta-agonist medications. The patients will require a short-acting bronchodilator to relieve acute symptoms. Inhaled corticosteroids and theophylline are last line for medical therapy for these patients.<sup>
                  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0897190012466048">4</xref>

Supplemental oxygen is recommended by Medicare guidelines when the patients resting PaO<sub>2</sub> ≤55 mm Hg or oxygen saturation ≤88%. Although supplemental oxygen can improve oxygenation and symptoms, some patients experience persistent hypoxemia, developing from ventilation–perfusion mismatching, increased dead space ventilation, and increased carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) production. When a postbronchodilator FEV<sub>1</sub> &lt; 25% is accompanied with pulmonary hypertension, hypoxemia, or hypercarbia, lung transplantation becomes an option for these patients.<sup>

            <p>Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is a common subtype of interstitial lung disease, with a prevalence of 15 to 250 cases in 100000 people. The IPF belongs to a group of idiopathic interstitial pneumonias that are characterized by insidious development.<sup>

               </sup> This process occurs in the alveolar basement membrane; it becomes injured, which triggers proinflammatory mediators and cytokines to be released such as fibroblasts and myofibroblasts. The cytokines, when activated, cause an extracellular matrix to deposit in the damaged epithelium. In healthy lungs, this matrix is removed and the site is re-epithelialized; however, in IPF the matrix deposits onto the cells and leads to fibrosis. It is this fibrosis that causes the ultimate damage to the lung function and the patient. Current treatment options for the disease aim to prevent the fibrosis from developing, as there is no current therapy to target fibrosed tissue. Patients are sometimes treated with the immunosuppressants, azathioprine or cyclophosphamide, prednisone, and oral acetylcysteine. The pharmacotherapy used in IPF is not curative of the disease, and there are limited options for patients who have progressive fibrosis.<sup>

The 6-minute walk test is used to measure the severity of the disease, and the various stages of treatments are aimed at improving this outcome. The vasoconstriction in the pulmonary arterioles is caused by an imbalance of prostacyclin and thromboxane A<sub>2</sub>, which leads to increased vasoconstriction as well as decreased nitric oxide (NO) production. Excess endothelian 1a is observed in IPAH; it is a potent vasoconstrictor of pulmonary vasculature and also causes proliferation of smooth muscle cells, which is an important component of the pathophysiology of the disease.<sup>

Treatment algorithms, based on the patients severity and 6-minute walk test, will take patients through a course of a calcium channel blocker, phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitor, a prostacyclin agonist, or endothelian receptor antagonist.

         <title>Immunosuppression</title>
         <p>Immunosuppression is perhaps the most important part of ensuring allograft lung function after transplant. There are 3 stages of immunosuppression in lung transplantation; induction, maintenance, and treatment of acute rejection. Induction immunosuppression involves a rapid attainment of immune suppression in the host at the time of transplant and in the first few days following transplant. Antibodies and high-dose corticosteroids are the mainstay of induction immunosuppression. The selection of induction agents will depend on the donor and host risk factors such as HLA matching, panel reactive antibodies (PRAs), and cold ischemia time of the organ.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0897190012466048">1</xref>
            </sup> The HLA system of the host is matched to the donor on the basis of 6 antigen matches; a 6 antigen match is considered a perfect match and will have the lowest risk of rejection. PRAs are preformed antibodies to HLA-1 in a pooled sample of donor blood; the test will help determine the likelihood of rejecting the donor tissue. The host blood is mixed with the pooled donors in a laboratory and the percentage of cells lyzed by the host blood equals the percentage of PRAs. A PRA of &gt;25% is considered significant and carries an additional risk of hyperacute rejection of the new organ.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0897190012466048">1</xref>
            </sup> Previous transplants, receiving blood product transfusions and pregnancy, will elevate the PRA. Retransplantation of the same organ, or transplantation of a new organ, can increase the patients’ risk for acute rejection.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0897190012466048">1</xref>
            </sup> If the PRA &gt;25%, then a prospective B lymphocyte cross match will be preformed to check for antidonor-specific antibodies in the organ recipient patient. A positive cross match will usually cancel the surgery. Contraindications to receiving a lung transplant include human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, active malignancy, active hepatitis B or C, active bacteremia or sepsis, or a donor over the age of 60 years. Some institutions will transplant donor lungs that fall into the extended criteria category, for example a donor lung with active infection, advanced donor age, or chest radiography infiltrates. Extended criteria donor lungs are less than ideal, however the benefit to the patient outweighs the risk.<sup>

            <p>A commonly used agent for induction is antithymocyte globulin, a polyclonal antibody product derived from the serum of inoculated horses or rabbits. The animal is inoculated with human lymphocytes and the animal immunoglobin (Ig) G antibodies are removed from the serum via plasmapheresis and then purified. These antibodies are potent killers of human T lymphocytes and can induce lymphopenia for up to a year in some cases. The antibodies are nonspecific, as the name polyclonal suggests, as they bind multiple sites on the T cell causing apoptosis. Thymoglobulin is the rabbit-derived product, and ATGAM is the horse-derived product.<sup>

               </sup> The rabbit-derived product is the agent of choice due to a higher potency. In a head-to-head trial when compared to the equine-derived product for induction immunosuppression, thymoglobulin was associated with a 40% relative risk of death, graft loss, or rejection at 5 years’ posttransplant.<sup>
                  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0897190012466048">10</xref>
               </sup> The first dose of thymoglobulin is usually given to the patient intraoperatively; patients will usually receive a total dose of 2.5 to 5 mg/kg total, given over the course of 3 to 4 days. Concurrent to the polyclonal antibody, patients will receive high-dose corticosteroids such as methylprednisolone 500 mg daily for 3 days, with the first dose to be given in the operating room (OR). Corticosteroids will be discussed further in the maintenance immunosuppression section. Antilymphocyte-depleting antibodies are an animal-derived product; therefore, they are associated with infusion-related reactions, cytokine release, and serum sickness.<sup>

The corticosteroids used as premedications to the antibody infusion are the high-dose corticosteroids also being used for induction. Antithymocyte globulin serum sickness is a rare side effect, a reported incidence of up to 27% in kidney transplant recipients.<sup>

            <p>Glucocorticoids have historically been the backbone of maintenance immunosuppression. They have been used in lung transplantation since the beginning and continue to play an important role in the prevention and treatment of rejection. Prednisone is the most common corticosteroid studied and is given in a taper form after the initial induction of high-dose methylprednisolone.<sup>
                  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0897190012466048">16</xref>
               </sup> A typical daily dose of prednisone is 5 to 10 mg daily. The side effects of glucocorticoids include hyperglycemia, hypertension, peptic ulcer disease, osteoporosis, and cushingoid side effects. Due to the adverse side effect profile when taken for prolonged periods of time, clinicians have worked to develop strategies to reduce glucocorticoid use in maintenance immunosuppression. Such strategies may include increasing the doses of other immunosuppressant medications to compensate for the steroid reduction.<sup>

            <p>Calcineurin inhibitors such as tacrolimus and cyclosporine are important components of maintenance immunosuppression. They both work to prevent IL-2-mediated CD4+ T cell activation. Cyclosporine binds to cyclophilin which prevents calcineurin dephosphorlyation of nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT).<sup>
                  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0897190012466048">17</xref>
               </sup> Tacrolimus binds to immunophilin, and FK-binding protein also inhibits calcineurin, therefore inhibiting NFAT. The early preparation of cyclosporine was an oil-based emulsion, Sandimmune. This product was associated with erratic absorption and an unpredictable oral bioavailability of approximately 1% to 89%.<sup>

               </sup> Common dosing for tacrolimus is 2 to 5 mg twice a day, but doses are individualized based upon the trough concentration. Both cyclosporine and tacrolimus are associated with a host of adverse side effects. They both are associated with a dose-related decrease in renal function, via vasoconstriction of the afferent arterioles in the nephron.<sup>

            <p>T cell proliferation inhibitors such as mycophenolate (Cellcept© and Myfortic©) and azathioprine are used in combination with calcineurin inhibitors for maintenance immunosuppression.

Its mechanism of action is to halt DNA replication and induce apoptosis in CD28 cells, causing T cell destruction. It is commonly used when mycophenolate cannot be tolerated from adverse side effects or otherwise. It must be adjusted for renal function, and serum drug monitoring is not routinely done. Prior to initiation of azathioprine, it is recommended to test for thiopurine methyl transferase (TPMT) activity.<sup>

            <p>Mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors such as sirolimus and everolimus are used in maintenance immunosuppression, in lieu of tacrolimus.

For example, patients are commonly started on a lipid-lowering medication soon after the transplant. To treat the new onset diabetes, they will be started on antihyperglycemic medication, sometimes requiring insulin. The long-term side effects of calcineurin inhibitors and glucocorticosteroids are such that researchers are searching for ways to minimize their exposure in low-risk patient populations. Calcineurin inhibitor minimization or withdrawal regimens have been described,<sup>

               </sup> The CMV is the most common virus known to cause infection. The virus is transmitted from the donor tissue to the recipient at the time of transplant. It is recommended that all transplant recipients receive prophylaxis with valganciclovir for at least 3 months or longer, depending on the risk of infection. Donor-positive, recipient-negative matches are at the highest risk of developing disease, and it is recommended to prophylaxis for 6 months. This mismatch was historically a risk factor for increased mortality,<sup>

Donor positive or negative, recipient-positive patients will require viral prophylaxis for 3 months with valganciclovir. Patients may present with general malaise, fever and leukopenia,<sup>

               </sup> The CMV is diagnosed with a blood polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test that can quantify the viral burden in the blood. It is possible for a patient to have a positive PCR and not have invasive lung disease; therefore, biopsy of the lung will help correlate the positive PCR to actual CMV pneumonitis. Other viral pathogens known to cause disease are HSV, respiratory synctial virus (RSV) influenza A and B, and parainfluenza virus.<sup>

Patients will receive PCP prophylaxis with trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole as a first-line agent. An advantage of trimethoprim–sulfemethaxole is the thrice weekly dosing regimen, and it also prophylaxes against <italic>Nocardia</italic>, <italic>Listeria</italic>, and <italic>Toxoplasmosis</italic>.

The oral antifungal is usually given for 3 months posttransplant, and the inhaled antifungal is usually given for 10 days. Posaconazole, itraconazole, and voriconazole have been shown to be effective for routine prophylaxis, although voriconazole has been associated with higher rates of hepatotoxicity.<sup>

         <title>Summary</title>
         <p>Lung transplantation is a complex treatment that is reserved for the sickest of patients with end-stage lung disease. There are specific listing criteria that may vary based on the surgeon, individual institutions, and the insurance payer. The surgery itself is associated with a host of potential complications as well as management of immunosuppression during the process. The goal of maintenance immunosuppression is to block T cell activation and proliferation, in turn preventing antibody development to the transplanted organ. Immunosuppression must be balanced with the risk of infection, including nosocomical infections and opportunistic pathogens. The role of the pharmacist spans the inpatient management of acute complications to the medication selection and management of maintenance immunosuppression as well as monitoring for adverse drug reactions and drug–drug interactions. A multidisciplinary collaborative approach must be taken to ensure the best outcomes for this patient population.</p>
