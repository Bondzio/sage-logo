<p>“The most American thing you can do is stand up for someone else.”</p>

<p>The death of Florida A&amp;M drum major Robert Champion Jr. has been a headline in every major news outlet in the United States. Robert’s death brought national attention to an aspect of marching band few had previously considered. The events surrounding his loss raise questions and concerns about the cultural underpinnings surrounding the band experience, most specifically, the problem of hazing. While no empirical data exist on the frequency of hazing in high school or college marching bands, it would be foolish and naive to assume it does not exist. Reaction to the news that hazing might be occurring within band programs has been significant. For example, the school board in DeKalb County in Decatur, Georgia, cancelled all marching band activities because of possible hazing events occurring among high school music students. There are no words to describe the tragedy and absurdity of the loss of a young man killed by a community of people he was trying to impress. It seems illogical to think an ensemble capable of such beauty, precision, and community could also be capable of something so malevolent. Unfortunately, hazing occurs within numerous places in our culture: fraternities and sororities, the military, athletic teams, professional teams, and other types of clubs and organizations.</p>
<p><italic>Hazing</italic> refers to any activity expected of someone joining a group, or maintaining full status in a group, that humiliates, degrades, or risks emotional and/or physical harm, regardless of the person’s willingness to participate (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.hazingstudy.org/publications/hazing_in_view_web.pdf">http://www.hazingstudy.org/publications/hazing_in_view_web.pdf</ext-link>). There are numerous myths about hazing that should be discredited. These examples are adapted from Susan Lipkins’s <italic>Preventing Hazing: How Parents, Teachers, and Coaches Can Stop the Violence</italic> (San Francisco, CA: Jossey-Bass, 2006):</p>
<list id="list1-0027432112438179" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Hazing is a problem only in fraternities and sororities.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Hazing is just foolish horseplay that sometimes goes awry.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>As long as there is not malicious intent, and no one gets hurt, a little hazing is okay.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Hazing is an effective way to teach esprit de corps.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>If someone agrees to willingly participate, it is not hazing.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>It is difficult to determine what is hazing and what is horseplay.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Hazing mainly occurs with men, not women.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>These myths may allow leaders of clubs and organizations to dismiss the severity and harmfulness of hazing. Additionally, hazing is often underreported due to shame individuals feel about their individual experience or the shame the experience might bring to the organization.</p>
<p>I contacted numerous band directors to ask their advice about hazing. Each shared a simple counsel: <bold><italic>Be acutely aware of your music community</italic></bold>. Music educators are in a unique position to recognize behaviors of their students. Music educators who teach middle school, high school, and college ensembles often retain the same students in their ensembles over the course of many years. Because of the unique nature of the ensemble experience, coupled with the opportunity for extended instruction, music teachers can closely monitor students.</p>
<p>Music educators are in a position to meaningful influence young people. With the tragedy of Robert Champion Jr. in mind, I encourage the music education community to start an open dialogue with both students and colleagues about the dangers of hazing. For more information on preventing hazing, I encourage you to join the dialogue on NAfME Advocacy Groundswell at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://advocacy.nafme.org/">http://advocacy.nafme.org/</ext-link> and to visit the following websites:</p>
