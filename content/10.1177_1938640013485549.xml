<p>“Medical care and in particular surgery is an intimidating prospect for almost everyone.”</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Like me, many of you probably think to yourself or articulate to a patient, “If this was my mother (or father, sister, brother, wife, husband, son, or daughter), I would recommend this course of treatment.” We always feel that if we keep that attitude in mind, we will always do what is best for the patient. I believe it is a great way to guarantee providing excellent and ethical care.</p>
<p>While we provide caring and sound recommendations and treatment to our patients, have we considered what they and their family are going through, especially when it comes to surgery?</p>
<p>Earlier this month, my 15-year-old daughter needed surgery. She is a very mature, self-sufficient teenager who rarely lets anything bother her, yet was terrified, of all the things, the IV. She has always had a fear of needles but was especially concerned about the IV for the procedure. Additionally, she was quite uptight about the prospect of waking up in the middle of the procedure. She has been in the operating room with me since she was 4 years old and knew the likelihood of waking up during a procedure was rare, but nonetheless, it really bothered her. The night before the procedure, she lay in bed and told me about all her fears going into the surgery. It was a rare situation where she completely let her guard down, became emotional, and really had an effect on me.</p>
<p>Her surgery was scheduled for the middle of the afternoon so I worked my normal morning schedule, and interestingly, my second surgery of the day was a 15-year-old young lady. She had all of the same fears as my daughter. I pride myself on the compassionate care that I provide, but on that day, given the conversation I had with my daughter the night before, I was even more caring and understanding with this patient. I sat down next to her and talked about what was going on and what she should expect. I took far more time than usual during a busy surgical schedule, and it seemed to make a big difference. She calmed down, and at her postoperative visit a week later, her parents and she profusely thanked me for the way in which I had treated her and the overall care they received.</p>
<p>So back to my daughter’s story . . . I got to the hospital and she had already gotten to a preoperative room and changed her clothes and was laying on a gurney. Now, I became the parent of the patient. Wow, what a different experience than being the surgeon! There is a lot of waiting and wondering. Many people are coming and going and asking lots of questions. Sign this. Sign that. Then the nurse who will start the IV arrived. Our nurse was awesome. He was calm and compassionate and told her everything that was being done and when something would hurt and when it would not. It could have been different and I have certainly seen it differently, but the extra time and care he provided turned a scary situation into one that was tolerable.</p>
<p>The surgeon is a friend of mine and invited me to watch the surgery. It was comforting that he was confident in his skills to have the patient’s father in the room for the procedure. The ride from the preoperative holding to the operating room is intimidating. She is on the gurney and being wheeled down a brightly lit corridor not knowing what is at the end of the ride. Once in the operating room, she is asked to move over to the other bed, slide down that way, all the while people are moving this way and that, monitors placed on her, people getting ready for the surgery, people talking, people laughing . . . all of this is normal daily stuff, but her eyes got big and she was looking around, and I could read her face, “What is going on?”</p>
<p>I stayed to the side and despite having momentary shaky legs handled myself perfectly well. Her surgery went well and she went on to recovery without any problems. While the anesthesia was wearing off in the recovery room and my daughter was cracking me up with her drug-induced comments and questions, I began to reflect on the whole experience from this side.</p>
<p>Medical care and in particular surgery is an intimidating prospect for almost everyone. For the medical professionals providing the services, it is our daily jobs. Sometimes we lose that extra bit of compassion to understand the magnitude of the situation to the patients and family. It is not that we do not care. It is more a product of busy schedule and the routine we fall into that we may forget some of those little things that can help people through a stressful time.</p>
<p>Next time you are in the preoperative holding area or in the operating room before the patient is anesthetized, take a look around and listen and observe what the patient might be hearing or seeing.</p>
<p>Sometimes we need to put ourselves or our loved ones in a situation to really appreciate it. So while you are telling your next patient, “this is what I would do if it was my daughter,” you really mean it.</p>
