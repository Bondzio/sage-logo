               <title>Purpose</title>
               <p>To compare tear type of surgically proven discoid lateral meniscus between adults and children, and to analyze diagnostic performance for tear type of discoid lateral meniscus using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).</p>

               <title>Material and Methods</title>
               <p>Knee MR examinations of 53 children and 84 adults who had discoid lateral menisci identified at arthroscopic surgery were retrospectively evaluated with consensus by two radiologists for tear type including displacement of torn meniscus. MRI findings were compared with surgery as the reference standard. The difference of tear type and displacement of torn meniscus between children and adults in arthroscopic finding was analyzed using the Fisher's exact test or the Chi-squared test with Bonferroni's correction.</p>
            </sec>
            <sec>
               <title>Results</title>
               <p>At arthroscopy, complex tear (children, <italic>n</italic> = 22; adults, <italic>n</italic> = 56) and peripheral tear (children, <italic>n</italic> = 17; adults, <italic>n</italic> = 8) differed significantly between children and adults (<italic>P</italic> = 0.006 for complex tear, <italic>P</italic> = 0.002 for peripheral tear). Displacement of torn meniscus was seen in 28 cases of children and 41 cases of adults, not a statistically significant difference. In children, the positive predictive value (PPV) for horizontal tears was 90%, for peripheral tears 60%, and for complex tears 57%. PPV in adults for horizontal tears was 78%, peripheral tears 25%, and for complex tears 89%.</p>

            <sec>
               <title>Conclusion</title>
               <p>Complex tears were more commonly found in adults than children and peripheral tears were more commonly found in children than adults. MRI has a high PPV for diagnosing the type of tear in discoid lateral meniscus for horizontal tears in children and adults and for complex tears in adults.</p>

         <title/>
         <p>A discoid lateral meniscus is a common normal variant that is manifested by a thickened and disc-shaped meniscus, covering a greater area of the tibial plateau than the normal semilunar meniscus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-475442C1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-475442C3">3</xref>). In the general population, the reported prevalence of discoid lateral meniscus ranges from 0.4% to 16.6% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-475442C4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-475442C7">7</xref>). Compared with normal meniscus, the discoid lateral meniscus is more susceptible to tear, with tears of discoid lateral meniscus found in children as well as adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-475442C1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-475442C4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-475442C5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-475442C8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-475442C10">10</xref>). In a previous report, meniscal tears of discoid lateral menisci were more than twice as frequent than in normal lateral menisci (20.4% <italic>vs.</italic> 9.9%) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-475442C4">4</xref>). In arthroscopic surgery, meniscal tears in discoid lateral meniscus have been reported to have frequencies ranging from 38% to 88% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-475442C1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-475442C4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-475442C5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-475442C10">10</xref>). In previous studies, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings with the reference standard of arthroscopic surgery or arthroscopic findings for tear patterns of the discoid lateral meniscus in children and adults were reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-475442C11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-475442C12">12</xref>) but to our knowledge, a comparison study for tear types of discoid lateral meniscus between children and adults has not been reported before.</p>
         <p>The purpose of this study was to compare tear types of surgically proven discoid lateral meniscus between children and adults and to analyze diagnostic performance for tear type of discoid lateral meniscus using MRI with the arthroscopic findings regarded as the reference standard.</p>

            <title>Patients</title>
            <p>Institutional Review Board approval and waiver of informed consent were obtained for this retrospective study. We searched the computerized medical records for patients who underwent arthroscopic surgery of the knee by one experienced orthopedic surgeon and subsequently were diagnosed with discoid lateral meniscus at arthroscopic surgery between December 1997 and December 2008. We found 481 cases. Among them, we excluded 11 patients who had history of previous knee surgery and 317 patients who underwent MRI at an outside institution. Therefore, 153 patients who underwent MRI at one institution and subsequently had discoid lateral menisci identified at arthroscopic surgery were included in this study. These patients were 84 adults (33 men and 51 women; age range, 16–67 years; mean age, 35 years) and 53 children (29 boys and 24 girls; age range, 3–15 years; mean age, 10 years). Among them, six adults and nine children had discoid lateral meniscus in both knees. Thus, MR images of 90 knees in adults and 62 knees in children were included in this study. Patients underwent arthroscopic surgery at a mean 84 days (range, 0–354 days; median, 61 days) in children and a mean 99 days (range, 1–360 days; median, 80 days) in adults after MRI.</p>

            <title>MRI protocol</title>
            <p>MRI was performed on a 1.5 T MR scanner (Signa: GE Healthcare, Milwaukee, WI, USA) with a dedicated knee coil or a 3T whole body MR scanner (Gyroscan Intera Achieva; Philips Medical Systems, Best, The Netherlands) with a receive-only eight-element phased-array coil. Two types of image parameters were used according to the Tesla strength of the MR scanners. On the 1.5T MR scanner, proton density weighted (PDW) fast spin echo (FSE) images with fat saturation in the axial plane, PDW FSE images in the sagittal and coronal planes or coronal oblique planes, and T2-weighted FSE images in the sagittal and coronal planes were obtained. The ranges of repetition time (TR) and echo time (TE) were variable (1880–4000/22–28 ms for PDW FSE and 3000–5600/80–110 ms for T2W FSE). The other imaging parameters were as follows: matrix, 256 × 192–400 × 400; field of view, 12–16 cm; slice thickness, 4 mm; and number of signals averaged, 2. On the 3T MR scanner, PDW FSE images with fat saturation in the axial plane, PDW FSE images in the sagittal, coronal, and coronal oblique planes, and T2-weighted FSE images in the sagittal plane were obtained. The ranges of TR and TE were variable (1900–4200/20–30 ms for PDW FSE and 3800–5300/100 ms for T2W FSE). The other imaging parameters were as follows: matrix, 240 × 240–320 × 320; field of view, 12–18 cm; slice thickness, 1.5 mm for sagittal PDW FSE images and 3 mm for other sequences; and number of signals averaged, 1.</p>

            <title>Image analysis</title>
            <p>Two musculoskeletal radiologists (CSH and JYJ with 10 and 6 years of experience, respectively) who were blinded to the arthroscopy result evaluated retrospectively MR images by consensus. Images were evaluated using a picture archiving and communication system (PACS) (Centricity Radiology RA 1000; GE Healthcare, Chicago, IL, USA).</p>
            <p>Discoid menisci were divided into three types using the classification described by Watanabe <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-475442C13">13</xref>): complete; incomplete; and Wrisberg's ligament type. The presence or absence of meniscus tear in surgically confirmed discoid lateral menisci was evaluated according to established criteria. Abnormal signal within the meniscus that extended to the meniscal articular surface or abnormal morphology of the meniscus were considered to indicate a meniscus tear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-475442C14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-475442C15">15</xref>). Meniscus tears were classified into one of six types using previously described criteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-475442C11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-475442C16">16</xref>). A horizontal tear is parallel to the tibial plateau and separates the meniscus into upper and lower parts, a longitudinal tear is vertical (perpendicular to the tibial plateau) and propagates parallel to the main (circumferential) axis of the meniscus, a radial tear is vertical and propagates perpendicular to the main axis, an oblique tear is vertical and propagates obliquely to the main axis of the meniscus, a peripheral tear is in the periphery (outer rim) or the peripheral 10–15% of the meniscus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-475442C11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-475442C17">17</xref>), and a complex tear comprises two or more tear configurations. Also, individual tear types which constitute complex tear were evaluated. However, for statistical analysis, no attempt was made to differentiate individual tear component of complex tear with arthroscopic surgery as the reference standard. Lastly, two radiologists evaluated the presence of displacement of torn menisci. The arthroscopic findings were regarded as the reference standard.</p>

            <title>Arthroscopy</title>
            <p>All arthroscopic surgery was performed by one orthopedic surgeon (AJH with 36 years of experience) and MR images were available to the surgeon at the time of the surgery. Arthroscopy was performed under general anesthesia, by using a 4-mm diameter surgical arthroscope with a 30° forward oblique view. Anterolateral, anteromedial, and suprapatellar portals were routinely used to introduce the arthroscope and accessory portals, including a posterolateral portal, were used when necessary. During arthroscopy, the entire joint was carefully examined and the menisci were carefully probed. Based on operative records and video recording or photograph for arthroscopic surgery, an orthopedic surgeon analyzed type of discoid lateral meniscus, presence and type of meniscus tear, presence of displacement of torn meniscus according to the same criteria used to analyze MRI.</p>

         <sec id="s2e">
            <title>Statistical analysis</title>
            <p>We analyzed the statistical difference of tear type in arthroscopic finding between children and adults using the Fisher's exact test or Chi-squared test with Bonferroni's correction. Also, we analyzed the statistical difference of displacement of torn meniscus in arthroscopic finding between children and adults using the Chi-squared test with Bonferroni's correction. A <italic>P</italic> value &lt; 0.05 was considered to indicate a statistically significant difference. The sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value (PPV) with a 95% confidence interval (CI) for diagnosing presence of tear, types of tear, and displacement of torn meniscus using MRI were calculated with the operative findings regarded as the reference standard in both children and adults.</p>

            <title>Arthroscopic findings</title>
            <p>Arthroscopic surgery confirmed tear of discoid lateral meniscus in 56 cases (90%, 56/62) of children and 87 cases (97%, 87/90) of adults. In torn menisci, types of discoid meniscus were 51 complete types and five incomplete types in children, and 72 complete types and 15 incomplete types in adults with no Wrisberg's ligament type.</p>
            <p>Among tear types of discoid lateral meniscus (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="AR-475442TB1">1</xref>), complex tear was the most common type in both children (39%, 22/56) and adults (64%, 56/87). Complex tear was more common in adults than children (<italic>P</italic> = 0.006) and peripheral tear was more common in children (30%, 17/56) than adults (9%, 8/87) with a statistically significant difference (<italic>P</italic> = 0.002). Other types of tear had did not differ statistically between children and adults. In complex tears, horizontal tears combined with other tear component occurred in 12 cases (55%, 12/22) of children and 27 cases (48%, 27/56) of adults. Total cases of horizontal tear alone and horizontal tear combined with other component tear were found in about 50% of torn meniscus in children (28/5633/66) and adults (44/8739/77) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="AR-475442F1">1</xref>). Among complex tears, arthroscopic findings showed partially worn-out menisci with shaggy and irregular edges in 10 cases (45%, 10/22) of children and 25 cases (45%, 25/56) of adults. Displacement of torn meniscus was more common in children (50%, 28/56) of children than adults (47%, 41/87), but did not differ statistically. In torn menisci with displacement, complex tear was common in both children (61%, 17/28) and adults (83%, 34/41). In particular, partially worn-out meniscus among complex tears was found in nine cases (32%, 9/28) of children and 21 cases (51%, 21/41) of adults. Peripheral tear including peripheral tear alone and peripheral tear combined with another tear component comprised 16 cases (57%, 16/28) in children and 11 cases (27%, 11/41) in adults.

            <p>The type of torn discoid meniscus was correctly interpreted in 54/55 (98%) for complete type and 4/7 (57%) for incomplete type in children, 73/74 (99%) for complete type and 13/16 (81%) for incomplete type in adults. Although the type of discoid meniscus was difficult to diagnose on MRI in cases of torn meniscus with displacement, large displaced segment of torn meniscus was classified as complete discoid meniscus. The sensitivity, specificity, and PPV for the diagnosis of meniscus tear were 95% (95% CI, 85–99%), 100% (54–100), and 100% (93–100) in children; 97% (90–99), 100% (31–100), and 100% (96–100) in adults, respectively.</p>
            <p>Type of meniscus tear was correctly categorized in nine of 16 horizontal tears, nine of 17 peripheral tears, and 16 of 22 complex tears in children, and 14 of 17 horizontal tears, two of three longitudinal tears, one of two oblique tears, four of eight peripheral tears, and 39 of 56 complex tears in adults (Tables <xref ref-type="table" rid="AR-475442TB2">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="AR-475442TB3">3</xref>). The sensitivity, specificity, and PPV with a 95% CI for diagnosing type of meniscus tear in children and adults at MRI with arthroscopic surgery as reference standard were varied (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="AR-475442TB4">4</xref>). MRI findings for tear type were incorrectly interpreted in several cases. In arthroscopically proven horizontal tears, MRI findings were incorrectly interpreted as complex tears consisting of horizontal and peripheral tear in four cases of seven misinterpreted cases in children and one case of three misinterpreted cases of adults. In surgically confirmed peripheral tears, MRI findings were incorrectly interpreted as complex tear consisting of peripheral and horizontal tear in seven cases of child (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="AR-475442F2">2</xref>). In surgically confirmed complex tears, MRI findings of partially worn out meniscus were incorrectly interpreted as peripheral tear in four cases of eight misinterpreted cases in children and 10 of 15 misinterpreted cases in adults (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="AR-475442F3">3</xref>). The sensitivity, specificity, and PPV for the diagnosis of displacement of torn menisci were 96% (95% CI, 82–99%), 82% (65–93), and 82% (65–93) in children, and 90% (77–97), 96% (86–99), and 95% (83–99) in adults, respectively.

         <p>The discoid meniscus is more susceptible to mechanical forces than the normal meniscus on account of its thickness, hypermobility, poor vascularization, and weak posterior attachment to the capsule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-475442C18">18</xref>). The shape, size, and degree of stability varies in discoid lateral meniscus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-475442C19">19</xref>) and tear pattern could be influenced by various factors, but we hypothesized that a difference of tear pattern could be seen between children and adults because the period that discoid lateral meniscus endured a mechanical force is different.</p>
         <p>In our results of arthroscopic surgery, the most common type of tear was complex tear in both children and adults. Particularly, complex tear was more commonly found in adults than children (<italic>P</italic> = 0.006). By contrast, peripheral tear was more common in children than adults (<italic>P</italic> = 0.002). Displacement of torn meniscus was commonly found in both children (50%, 28/56) and adults (47%, 41/87) and these findings were mainly identified in partially worn out meniscus among complex tear in adults and peripheral tear including peripheral tear combined with horizontal tear in children.</p>
         <p>There have been several reports about tear patterns of the discoid lateral meniscus. Our results for tear patterns of discoid lateral menisci are comparable to previous studies by some investigators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-475442C11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-475442C20">20</xref>). In a previous report, arthroscopic findings of 77 discoid lateral menisci (age range, 10–67 years; mean age, 27 years) showed that peripheral tear alone and peripheral tear with horizontal tear were the most common type of tears, and multiple tears (<italic>n</italic> = 34, 48%) were common and displacement of the torn segment was frequent (<italic>n</italic> = 51, 72%) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-475442C11">11</xref>). In another study, arthroscopic findings revealed a peripheral detachment in 28.1% (36/128) of discoid lateral menisci (age range, 1 month – 22 years; average age, 10 years) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-475442C20">20</xref>).</p>
         <p>Our results show that MRI had a variable sensitivity, specificity, PPV for diagnosing tear type of discoid lateral meniscus. However, the PPVs of MRI for the diagnosis of several tear types were superior to those of previous report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-475442C11">11</xref>). PPVs of a previous study were 56% (horizontal tear, 5/9), 46% (peripheral tear, 19/41), 67% (horizontal tear combined with radial tear, 2/3), and 76% (peripheral tear with horizontal tear, 16/21) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="AR-475442C11">11</xref>). Our PPVs were 90%, 78% for horizontal tears in children and adults, 60% for peripheral tears in children, and 89% for complex tears in adults.</p>
         <p>Explanations for several low values of MRI interpretation in our study are possible. In surgically confirmed horizontal tears without displacement, MRI of seven cases was incorrectly interpreted in children. Among these, four complete discoid lateral menisci were classified as complex tear, consisting of horizontal and peripheral tear with displacement because MRI showed that the peripheral portion of the meniscus had very thin irregular margins and thick complete discoid meniscus was bulged toward the intercondylar notch. Also, type of tear was difficult to diagnose using MRI in cases of torn meniscus with displacement. Among misinterpreted cases for tear type on MRI, arthroscopic surgery revealed displacement of torn meniscal segment in 11 cases (50%, 11/22) of children and 16 cases (59%, 16/27) of adults. In particular, among complex tears, MRI of partially worn-out menisci with displacement was incorrectly interpreted as peripheral tears with displacement in four cases of children and in 10 cases of adults. In six cases of peripheral tear with displacement, MRI findings were incorrectly interpreted as complex tears which consist of peripheral and horizontal tear with displacement in children. Although there were several low values of diagnosis for the tear types on MRI in our study, the sensitivity, specificity, and PPV for the diagnosis of meniscus tear were high as follows; 95%, 100%, and 100% in children; 97%, 100%, and 100% in adults, respectively.</p>
         <p>This study has several limitations. First, two musculoskeletal radiologists who analyzed the MRI were aware that all patients underwent arthroscopic surgery. This may have increased the sensitivity of MRI for diagnosing tears. However, that knowledge would not be expected to influence the classification of tears. Second, a selection bias can occur because we included only patients who underwent arthroscopic surgery. Third, although arthroscopy was regarded as the standard reference available for this study, it is an operator-dependent method. Thus, misinterpretation at arthroscopy was a possible source of error. Also, the orthopedic surgeon had reports of MRI available at the time of the arthroscopy. That might have biased the arthroscopic categorization of the tears. Fourth, the location of tear was not evaluated in this study. Lastly, the sample size was too small for longitudinal, oblique, and radial tears.</p>
         <p>In conclusion, complex tear was more commonly found in adults than children and peripheral tear was more commonly found in children than adults. MRI has a high PPV for diagnosing type of tear in discoid lateral meniscus for horizontal tear in children and adults, and for complex tears in adults.</p>
