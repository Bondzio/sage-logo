<abstract>
<p>The use of empirically supported treatment (EST) has been shown to enhance treatment outcome. The purpose of this case study was to suggest that ESTs further encourage effective reconceptualisation and the ongoing delivery of effective treatment, especially in the case of complex or atypical presentations or response to treatment. This report describes the case of an adolescent girl who underwent Maudsley family-based treatment for anorexia nervosa (AN) for a period of 12 months. Atypical response lead to an understanding of her presentation as representing a primary conversion disorder, within which AN symptoms were conceptualised as another somatic conversion of emotional distress. The report details her clinical presentation and management over the course of her illness. The case offers an important opportunity to explore the central role of the use of ESTs in guiding effective treatment delivery.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Anorexia nervosa (AN) is a complex and frequently chronic disorder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1359104512447313">Steinhausen, 2002</xref>), characterised by a refusal to maintain weight at or above an expected level for age and height, marked fear of fatness, and distorted body image. In menarchal women, amenorrhoea is a current diagnostic criterion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1359104512447313">American Psychiatric Association, 2000</xref>). Although relatively rare in the general population, AN is among the most common of psychiatric illnesses affecting adolescent girls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1359104512447313">Lucas, Beard, O’Fallon &amp; Kurland, 1991</xref>) and is characterised by significant risk, including comparatively high mortality and attempted suicide rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1359104512447313">Franko &amp; Keel, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1359104512447313">Franko, et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1359104512447313">Harris &amp; Barraclough, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1359104512447313">Steinhausen &amp; Seidel, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1359104512447313">Sullivan, 1995</xref>). Risk of death notwithstanding, the medical and psychological consequences of malnutrition have likewise been documented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1359104512447313">Bryant-Waugh &amp; Lask, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1359104512447313">Katzman, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1359104512447313">Keys, Brozek, Henschel, Mickelsen &amp; Taylor, 1950</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1359104512447313">le Grange &amp; Lock, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1359104512447313">Pike, 1998</xref>), and lend further support to the pervasive impact of the illness.</p>
<p>Despite this, few empirically supported treatment options (ESTs) exist. Improved methodological rigour in research has been named as a priority by clinical practice guidelines and experts in the field alike (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1359104512447313">Agras, et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1359104512447313">American Psychiatric Association, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1359104512447313">Fairburn, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1359104512447313">National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1359104512447313">Wilson, Grilo &amp; Vitousek, 2007</xref>). While no EST has been named for adult sufferers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1359104512447313">Agras &amp; Robinson, 2008</xref>; Treasure, Claudino &amp; Zucker, 2009), current treatment guidelines recommend the use of family therapy in the treatment of younger anorectic adolescents with brief duration of illness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1359104512447313">American Psychiatric Association, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1359104512447313">National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1359104512447313">Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Among the most studied of the family therapies in the treatment of AN is the manualised Maudsley model of family-based treatment (FBT) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1359104512447313">Lock, le Grange, Agras &amp; Dare, 2001</xref>). Treatment is divided into three phases, the first of which focuses exclusively on supporting parents to refeed their child to a healthy weight range. The model holds that young people with AN are not in a position to make good decisions around food and eating. Phase 1 therefore sees these decisions handed temporarily to parents. Parents are considered an important treatment resource and siblings are engaged in supporting their sister when distressed. Phases 2 and 3 support the young person in gradually reclaiming control over eating, as well as addressing underlying issues predating the eating disorder (ED) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1359104512447313">Lock, et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1359104512447313">Rhodes, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>The efficacy of Maudsley-style FBT has been evaluated in numerous randomised, controlled trials (RCTs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1359104512447313">Eisler, et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1359104512447313">Eisler, et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1359104512447313">Eisler, Simic, Russell &amp; Dare, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1359104512447313">le Grange, Eisler, Dare &amp; Russell, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1359104512447313">Robin, et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1359104512447313">Russell, Szmukler, Dare &amp; Eisler, 1987</xref>), rendering FBT the most promising current approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1359104512447313">Agras &amp; Robinson, 2008</xref>). This model has therefore been adopted as the primary mode of outpatient treatment for adolescents with AN within the present treatment team, and typically follows an inpatient admission for weight restoration. Its adoption has resulted in a significant reduction in the number of readmissions following treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1359104512447313">Wallis, Rhodes, Kohn &amp; Madden, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Despite its recommendation, however, treatment outcome is not necessarily positive for all. A review of recent treatment trials cited recovery rates of 47-95%, suggesting there is a cohort of patients who do not respond to this treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1359104512447313">Lock &amp; Gowers, 2005</xref>). Conjoined family therapy (both patient and family present in sessions) has also been shown to be contra-indicated for families with high expressed emotion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1359104512447313">Eisler et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1359104512447313">Eisler et al., 2007</xref>). Moreover, concerns have been raised about whether it is Maudsley-style treatment or more general aspects of FBT which account for positive outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1359104512447313">Fairburn, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1359104512447313">Lock &amp; Gowers, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1359104512447313">Wilson et al., 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Acknowledging these concerns, and despite an ongoing debate about the difficulties of implementing efficacious treatments in real-world settings, the value of using ESTs has been expounded (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1359104512447313">Chambless &amp; Ollendick, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1359104512447313">Kazdin, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1359104512447313">La Roche &amp; Christopher, 2009</xref>). The original development and dissemination of ESTs were intended to enhance treatment outcome and support clinicians in maintaining a current knowledge base (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1359104512447313">Chambless &amp; Ollendick, 2001</xref>). Meta-analysis has indeed shown that ESTs consistently yield superior outcomes to usual practice for youth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1359104512447313">Weisz, Jensen-Doss &amp; Hawley, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>While it is acknowledged that the use of an EST, especially in the field of EDs, does not guarantee success, it is posited here that the use of a well-supported treatment serves both to enhance the likelihood of success in treating a complex illness, and to alert practitioners to alternative treatment pathways in the case of atypical treatment outcome. Two recent reviews have suggested that it is important to report on unusual outcomes in AN research due to the absence of effective treatments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1359104512447313">Bulik, Berkman, Brownley, Sedway &amp; Lohr, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1359104512447313">Shapiro, et al., 2007</xref>). Thus, the documentation of atypical treatment responses can provide opportunity for improved clinical practice.</p>
<p>This paper therefore introduces the case of an adolescent girl who presented for treatment of AN. Despite her original presentation, successful treatment of ED-related symptoms seemed to give rise to increased anxiety and somatisation. While comorbidity and complexity are frequent companions to primary AN, it is well known that some symptoms such as anxious, depressed or obsessional presentations may represent features of the illness secondary to starvation, and can remit with re-feeding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1359104512447313">Keys et al., 1950</xref>). Likewise, it is not unusual for a patient in remission from an ED to be referred for further therapy to address persistent comorbid issues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1359104512447313">Lock et al., 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>However, in this case, the patient’s atypical response to a well-supported treatment model gave rise to a reconceptualisation of her ED presentation as having emerged within the context of a primary conversion disorder. Thus, disordered eating was seen to have represented a symptom rather than a primary diagnosis. This complex presentation offers a unique learning opportunity and is presented below.</p>

<title>Case history</title>
<p>Claire<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1359104512447313">1</xref></sup> was a 14 year old girl living with her parents and sister in Sydney, Australia. She was transferred from a regional hospital to a specialist ED program at a large university children’s hospital in July 2007, due to severe medical complications associated with recent weight loss.</p>
<p>Prior to this, Claire had presented twice to a regional hospital, initially with thoughts of self-harm, depressed mood, food refusal and weight loss. She was naso-gastrically (NG) fed for three weeks and commenced on fluvoxamine, an anti-depressant medication. She later re-presented with similar symptoms, complicated by anxiety and panic. She was observed to exhibit ‘hysterical’ behaviour, and was diagnosed with AN and a major depressive disorder. Claire’s mother, Patricia, noted a history of disordered eating and depression, which included symptoms of non-responsiveness, hypersomnia (excessive sleep) and feelings of faintness. As her AN was considered primary, Claire was transferred to the specialist ED program.</p>
<sec id="section3-1359104512447313">
<title>Assessment</title>
<sec id="section4-1359104512447313">
<title>Eating disorder assessment</title>
<p>Claire was admitted at a weight of 37.95kg, equivalent to 63.5% of her Ideal Body Weight (%IBW).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1359104512447313">2</xref></sup> She met criteria for AN, restricting subtype, and was diagnosed in accordance with the DSM-IV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1359104512447313">American Psychiatric Association, 2000</xref>), using the Eating Disorder Examination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1359104512447313">Fairburn &amp; Cooper, 1993</xref>). She denied purging, laxative or diuretic use, but exercised intensively, and had been researching nutrition and body image on the internet. While the somatic nature of her presentation was noted, Claire’s ED symptoms and low weight were the primary focus of initial treatment.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1359104512447313">
<title>Family and psychosocial assessment</title>
<p>The family were invited to an assessment during Claire’s admission, to confirm whether FBT would be an appropriate outpatient treatment option. They evidenced some chaos in the lead-up to the assessment, and cancelled two appointments before presenting late. Claire’s father, Craig, was out of town on business and did not attend despite consistent and firm requests that everyone in the family be present. Claire was seen with her mother and sister, Gabrielle (20). Gabrielle’s fiancé, who also lived in the family home, failed to attend.</p>
<p>At assessment, Claire’s mother Patricia reported that the family was very close, and reported a positive marriage. Craig worked as a contractor and spent lengthy periods interstate. Patricia worked on a farm and said the family would be unable to do without her income. Hence, they had not relocated closer to Craig’s current work, though this was frequently discussed, and plans around this were made and changed regularly. Claire expressed distress at her father’s absence. Patricia reported a very close relationship between Gabrielle and Claire: they shared very similar interests, including dance, and spent a lot of time together. At assessment, Gabrielle was engaged and intended to get married the same year; she had postponed wedding plans due to Claire’s illness.</p>
<p>Patricia reported her mother had suffered from severe panic attacks and Claire had witnessed these as a young girl. She described Claire as a clingy and dependent child, who had always had difficulty separating from her. She had a history of being teased and bullied at school, and did not have close friends.</p>
</sec></sec>
<sec id="section6-1359104512447313">
<title>Treatment</title>
<sec id="section7-1359104512447313">
<title>Inpatient treatment</title>
<p>Given her medically unstable condition, Claire was treated initially naso-gastrically as part of a behavioural re-feeding program. Interventions during her initial period in hospital included supported meals, individual supportive psychotherapy, group therapy, and family counselling. During her stay she was commenced on fluvoxamine and olanzapine (an atypical antipsychotic) to manage mood and anxiety.</p>
<p>During her admission, Claire was observed to experience significant anxiety. On insertion of the NG tube, she became distressed, exhibiting symptoms of hyperventilation and panic. During panic attacks, she was observed to experience muscular jerking in her legs, chest pain, headaches, general body aches, temperatures, abdominal pain and she frequently expressed feeling as though she was going to faint. Throughout the admission, when required to consume a high energy liquid food supplement, Claire’s body was observed to shake uncontrollably. Multiple duress calls were made during Claire’s admission, for profound ‘unconsciousness’. At these times, nursing staff were unable to rouse Claire; she did not respond to painful stimuli. She was observed to ‘fall asleep’ during meals, becoming completely unresponsive. The staff did not consider Claire to be feigning illness and saw these symptoms as outside her conscious control. Neurological investigations failed to demonstrate evidence of underlying pathology. Claire’s anxiety and hypersomnia reduced moderately during her admission, attributed to increased trust in staff, and the positive effect of medication.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1359104512447313">
<title>Outpatient treatment</title>
<p>FBT following the Maudsley<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1359104512447313">3</xref></sup> model was initiated following Claire’s discharge from inpatient treatment. She was discharged at 89.8%IBW. While Maudsley FBT remains agnostic in its belief regarding why the ED might have developed, the synthesis of aspects of numerous treatment approaches within the model affords the family therapist the opportunity to conceptualise cases from a range of perspectives. Claire had a history of anxiety, especially on separation. Thus, it was considered likely that her ED symptoms emerged in the context of continued uncertainty around her father’s presence in the family. The family’s safety and stability likewise remained in question, given that the possibility of relocation remained unresolved.</p>
<p>It was not surprising that Claire’s symptomatology emerged in the context of Gabrielle’s imminent wedding and departure from the family home. Claire’s symptoms might therefore be considered an opportunity to invite Gabrielle’s continued presence in the family system, literally drawing wedding preparations to a halt.</p>
<p>With the above hypotheses in mind, treatment focussed on attempting to re-engage Craig in the family. Craig was able to take Claire’s ED seriously, and to offer Patricia some backing in taking control of her eating behaviour. However, FBT did not succeed in supporting Patricia and Craig to achieve structural change, resolving their separated living arrangements and uncertainty regarding relocation.</p>
<p>Despite this, Patricia, Gabrielle and Claire attended sessions regularly, and Claire gained weight consistently throughout Phase 1. Patricia took charge by making and supervising all meals. The family were able to externalise AN, learning to refrain from senseless arguments with the ED. Gabrielle became an important resource, using her closeness with Claire to distract her after meals. Claire evidenced reduced pre-occupation with food and expressed a feeling of relief at having her mother take control of decisions regarding meals.</p>
<p>Following 10 weeks of treatment, Claire had reached approximately 100% IBW, and in collaboration with the family the decision was made to transition to Phase 2. However, following this decision, Claire began to evidence a change in her symptoms. She indicated increased body image concerns, school refusal, low mood, and suicidal ideation. Considered unsafe, she was readmitted to the inpatient unit. Claire’s eating alternated between severe restriction and periods of binge eating.</p>
<p>Phase 1 was reinstated following Claire’s discharge, and the family again took successful steps to manage Claire’s binge eating, within the framework of FBT. However, each time the family achieved success, Claire’s symptoms changed. Symptoms included severe depression and suicidal ideation leading to multiple inpatient admissions; food and fluid refusal; stomach aches; and school refusal, lasting a number of months. During Claire’s inpatient admissions, she evidenced little concern about her weight or shape, but expressed distress around discharge from treatment and a fear of returning to school. Again symptoms escalated. Refusing to speak outside of hospital, Claire became mute, communicating by writing on a portable chalkboard, though communication via this method remained very limited. Claire’s periods of ‘unconsciousness’ also returned, precipitating further admissions. During this time, Claire’s continued binge eating lead to significant weight gain. Throughout this period, Patricia reported feeling disempowered and exhausted.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1359104512447313">
<title>Reconceptualising the case</title>
<p>Given the established effectiveness of FBT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1359104512447313">Eisler et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1359104512447313">Eisler et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1359104512447313">Eisler et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1359104512447313">le Grange et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1359104512447313">Russell et al., 1987</xref>), as well as the team’s own success with its use, the ongoing emergence of increasingly severe symptoms in Claire’s case constituted a notably atypical response. This served to alert the team to the need for a more flexible treatment approach. The result was that, while Claire’s initial emaciation and compromised medical stability had necessitated a focus on her ED as primary, the continued development of somatic symptoms supported the team in understanding Claire’s AN as a symptom of an underlying conversion disorder.</p>
<p>Falling under the broad banner of somatisation disorders, conversion disorder involves the ‘conversion’ of intrapsychic distress into neurological symptoms. This is intended to reduce anxiety and keep such intrapsychic conflict from conscious awareness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1359104512447313">American Psychiatric Association, 2000</xref>). The symptom is not intentionally feigned and therefore does not constitute malingering; and despite medical investigation, cannot be explained by a medical condition. Importantly, these disorders can be characterised by a high demand on treatment services, with the patient conceptualised as unconsciously obtaining ‘secondary gain’ from maintaining the ‘sick role’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1359104512447313">Crimlisk &amp; Ron, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1359104512447313">Hurwitz, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Claire’s seizures, panic symptoms, suicidal ideation, fatigue, mutism and varied patterns of eating can therefore be seen as converted symptoms of psychological distress, most likely triggered by ongoing separation from significant attachment figures. Thus, every time a subsequent phase of treatment was introduced representing the possibility of progress and treatment success, Claire’s distress escalated, leading to the emergence of further symptoms and increasing the likelihood of extending treatment. While Maudsley FBT had supported the family in managing the ED-related aspects of her presentation, a shift to an effective treatment approach for conversion disorder seemed indicated.</p>
<p>Therapy therefore moved to take a more behavioural focus in managing Claire’s ongoing treatment-seeking as a primary means of communicating distress. Claire’s frequent hospital admissions were considered to be maintaining her in the sick role, and undermining the confidence of her parents to manage her anxiety. This understanding was offered to the family. Firm boundaries were set around hospital admissions and Claire’s school absence, and the family were referred for ongoing family therapy, with a focus on resolving attachment/separation issues.</p>
<p>While conversion symptoms need to be understood as part of an individual’s emotional response to threat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1359104512447313">Kozlowska, 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1359104512447313">2007</xref>), recent ‘biobehavioural’ models of childhood illness acknowledge both the internal and external environments, including the family, in influencing the psychological and physiological health of the child (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1359104512447313">Wood, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1359104512447313">Wood, Klebba &amp; Miller, 2000</xref>). Indeed, the intensity with which an individual responds physiologically to stress and the family environment have been shown to have a reciprocal influence on one another (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1359104512447313">Wood, 1993</xref>); a model revision further proposed that it is the quality or security of parent-child attachment that stands to either foster or protect a child against the emergence of illness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1359104512447313">Kozlowska, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1359104512447313">Wood et al., 2000</xref>). Given that the escalation of Claire’s symptoms frequently occurred in the context of the absence of a key attachment figure, it was hypothesised that family therapy aimed at addressing attachment insecurity may further support Claire in resolving attachment-related anxiety and managing distress in more helpful ways, less dependent on a physiological expression.</p>
<p>At 12 month follow-up Claire still evidenced some chaos in her eating patterns, but was assessed to show an absence of body image disturbance or distress. She was assessed to be at 117% of IBW. Claire’s mood was assessed to have improved, with a noted ‘brightness’ reported by the interviewer, and an absence of reported incidences of panic. While the family had still failed to resolve the distance in their living arrangements, Claire evidenced gains in terms of her own quality of life. She had embarked on obtaining a trade certificate, and had returned to dance where she was also involved in a teaching role. Perhaps of greatest relevance to the current paper, the family reported an absence of eating- or anxiety-related presentations to hospitals.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This paper described the case of an adolescent girl who presented for treatment of AN. While treatment of EDs is known to be complex, the Maudsley model of FBT has been shown in several RCTs to be successful in treating adolescents under the age of 18 years, with treatment duration of less than three years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1359104512447313">Eisler et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1359104512447313">Eisler et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1359104512447313">Eisler et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1359104512447313">le Grange et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1359104512447313">Russell et al., 1987</xref>). Should pre-existing concerns remain, the treatment model recommends that they become the focus of the brief third phase of treatment, or that of additional therapy to address the particular pathology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1359104512447313">Lock et al., 2001</xref>). However, in this case, successful management of AN symptoms using the Maudsley model appeared to lead to increasingly severe somatic symptoms. Rather than the slavish adherence to a manualised treatment protocol, the absence of anticipated improvement represented an important opportunity for flexibility of approach. Thus Claire’s somatisation, when treated appropriately, yielded an overall positive treatment outcome. Within this context, FBT remained a successful treatment for those symptoms characterised by AN, but needed to make way for alternative treatment approaches to address the underlying pathology.</p>
<p>The outcomes of this case are limited by the absence of a control condition. Thus the change in Claire’s presentation cannot be said to be the definitive result of reconceptualising her case, and it is indeed possible that other non-specific factors might have accounted for the improvements in her presentation. However, given her subsequent treatment response, it is plausible to consider that the flexible treatment approach demonstrated here might have accounted for this change, supporting Claire’s reduced use of body image-driven eating pathology to communicate distress.</p>
<p>While the treatment of persisting or comorbid symptoms would appear a simple example of good treatment practice, the opportunity presented by this case lay in the unusual presentation of AN as a symptom itself. Although the treatment of EDs frequently requires flexibility and an ability to manage complexities including comorbidity, guided by the use of ESTs, clinicians remain in a positive position to respond flexibly to the changing needs of their patients, enhancing the likelihood of successful treatment outcome.</p>
