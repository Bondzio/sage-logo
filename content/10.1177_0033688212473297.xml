<p>Since the RELC Journal was established over 40 years ago, it has sought to provide a forum for the exchange of ideas about language teaching in the region and beyond and for the publication of examples of exemplary research and practice from both established and emerging researchers and teacher educators. Over the years, the RELC Journal has established itself as a source for original and significant articles on a wide range of issues of interest to teachers, researchers, and teacher educators. In order to do this, each issue generally contains a number of different kinds of articles: survey articles that provide an overview of an important issue in the field; small-scale research articles based on a variety of research methods that illustrate how particular issues in language teaching can be investigated; reports of larger-scale research projects that are likely to have interest well beyond the contexts in which the research was undertaken; and book reviews of recent publications in language teaching and applied linguistics. Contributions that address any of these areas are always welcome, book reviews in particular.</p>
<p>The current issue is a good example of how the aims of the journal are realized. The first article <italic>Curriculum Approaches in Language Teaching</italic> examines the assumptions and practices underlying three different curriculum design strategies: <italic>forward design, central design</italic>, and <italic>backward design.</italic> The framework I present in the paper provides a useful way of looking at how seemingly disparate practices and trends in language teaching methodology and curriculum design can be understood. In the second article <italic>Relationships between Chinese College Test Takers’ Strategy Use and EFL Reading Test</italic>, Limei Zhang and Lawrence Jun Zhang describe a study that investigated students’ test-taking strategies, and provide valuable information on how strategy choice can affect students’ performance on tests. In the following article <italic>Why Not Non-native Varieties of English as Listening Comprehension Test Input?</italic> Priyanvada Abeywickrama addresses the important issue of the role of ‘non-native’ varieties of English in listening tests – a topic of growing interest in view of the role of English as a lingua franca. In the fourth article in this issue <italic>Examining Transcription, Autonomy and Reflective Practice in Language Development</italic>, Simon Cooke describes how transcription activities can help students become more aware of features of their own speech and thus contribute to their own autonomous language development. Next, Heather Weger in <italic>Examining English Language Learning Motivation of Adult International Learners Studying Abroad in the US</italic> presents the results of a study that provides fascinating insight into the role of motivation in adult language learning. Teacher education is the focus of the final article, <italic>Two Mentor Practices that Generate Teacher Reflection without Explicit Solicitations</italic>, in which Hansun Zhang Waring reports on a study of mentoring practices in a graduate TESOL program. The issue concludes with reviews of two recent and important books: <italic>Written Corrective Feedback in Second Language Acquisition</italic> and <italic>Writing</italic> and <italic>Designing and Analyzing Language Tests.</italic></p>
<p>As the brief overview above suggests, this issue includes articles on a wide range of important topics. The issue as a whole helps to increase our understanding of key issues of interest to teachers, researchers, and teacher educators, which is the primary goal of the RELC Journal.</p>
