            <p>The purpose of this project was to correct inaccurate information about Novo Nordisk products in drug references and medical textbooks. Twenty-six commonly used drug references (print or electronic) and 11 medical textbooks were reviewed for accuracy of information for all Novo Nordisk products; errors or omissions were identified in 32 of the 37 references reviewed. Inaccurate drug information most commonly involved product omissions or outdated product information. Letters describing the identified errors and suggested corrections were sent via US mail or e-mail to the authors, editors, or publishers. Within 18 months of sending the letters, 21 of the 32 references reviewed had published updated editions, which were then reviewed again to assess the impact of the communication. A total of 190 of 448 identified errors (42%) had been corrected.</p>

         <title>Introduction</title>
         <p>Health care is an industry that revolves around gathering and acting on information.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0092861511427875">1</xref>
            </sup> Physicians and other health care professionals (HCPs) are inundated daily with more medical information than they are able to keep up with. In 2010, the Food and Drug Administration issued approvals for 544 original new drug, original abbreviated new drug, and supplements to new drug applications and 1051 label revisions for branded and generic prescription drugs.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0092861511427875">2</xref>
            </sup> In this rapidly changing treatment landscape, HCPs need to stay abreast of new drugs and changes to the labeling of existing agents (ie, changing indications, important contraindications, interactions with other drugs) to optimize treatment and avoid serious adverse events.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0092861511427875">3</xref>
            </sup> It has become increasingly difficult for clinicians to stay current on the prescribing requirements for medications, particularly for recently approved drugs.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0092861511427875">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0092861511427875">4</xref>
            </sup> Questions about prescribing are among the most common that enter the primary care physician’s mind, although the answers to these questions may or may not be pursued, according to one study.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0092861511427875">5</xref>
            </sup>
         </p>
         <p>There are so many medical resources available to HCPs, with new editions/issues being published in print as frequently as every month or year. In addition, the Internet has made it possible for publishers to provide the latest updates at the click of a button, which has dramatically increased the amount of information available. These published resources (eg, manuals, handbooks, textbooks, journals, online references) offer key, concise drug information and are used by practitioners when selecting drugs and determining how to prescribe them. However, these resources may contain incorrect or outdated information or omit information that is critical to a drug’s use. For example, in one study evaluating the accuracy of drug information, <italic>Medscape Drug Reference</italic> (based on searches conducted on March 12, 2008) was shown to have 4 factual errors and 14 errors of omission.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0092861511427875">6</xref>
            </sup> It was also noted that the <italic>Physicians’ Desk Reference </italic>(<italic>PDR</italic>) often failed to provide full information about the range of effective doses for a given medication.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0092861511427875">7</xref>
            </sup> Inaccurate drug information and errors of omission may lead to product misuse, patient safety issues, reduction of potential therapeutic benefit of a product, an effective product not being used, lack of reimbursement, or misrepresentation of a product by competing pharmaceutical, biotechnology, or device companies.</p>
         <p>Prior to 2007, company employees periodically contacted Novo Nordisk’s Medical Information Department when they noted inaccurate product information in drug references; the Medical Information group would then contact the publisher to request the correction(s). The purpose of the current initiative was to screen commonly used drug references and medical textbooks, identify inaccurate information about Novo Nordisk’s products, request corrections using a standard process, and measure the impact of these suggested revisions.</p>

         <title>Methods</title>
         <p>The Publication Surveillance &amp; Response Team was created in October 2007 to identify medical inaccuracies and, when necessary, contact authors, editors, or publishers to ensure Novo Nordisk products were accurately represented with the most up-to-date information. A guidance document was developed internally, outlining a standardized process to handle product inaccuracies to ensure consistency in addressing published errors.</p>

            <title>Identification of Drug Information Sources</title>
            <p>Twenty-six commonly used drug references (16 print, 10 electronic) and 11 medical textbooks (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0092861511427875">Table 1</xref>) were identified in collaboration with the Novo Nordisk Library and the Medical and Scientific Affairs team. Drug references were selected based on popularity of use by HCPs, and medical textbooks were identified based on therapeutic relevance to Novo Nordisk. From November 2007 to December 2008, the Novo Nordisk product information in these references was reviewed for accuracy and/or omission and compared with each product’s most current prescribing information (PI). To decide if a correction letter was warranted, errors and omissions were evaluated based on the following criteria:</p>

            <p>The initial drug reference review was completed between November 2007 and December 2008 by an external medical communications company, MedVal Scientific Information Service, LLC. Based on the criteria above, a correction request letter was drafted by the external company for references containing errors and a contact person identified for each publisher. The letter was internally reviewed and approved by assigned Novo Nordisk medical employees within the Medical Information, the Medical and Scientific Affairs, and the Strategic Scientific Communications Departments. The final letter was sent by the Medical Information Department; each communication package included the PI for the products mentioned in the letter. Correction letters were sent to authors, editors, and publishers via US mail or e-mail, and copies were saved in the Novo Nordisk Medical Information database for future reference. Between January and June 2009, drug references and medical textbooks with new editions/updates were identified and reviewed to determine if the proposed changes had been incorporated.</p>

            <title>Time Spent and Division of Labor</title>
            <p>The external medical communications company used about 1100 hours from initial review to evaluate new editions/updates, with approximately 100 hours for project management (ie, obtaining access to references, identifying contact person for references, tracking progress of initiative) and 1000 hours in clinical review of Novo Nordisk product information in references and drafting the correction letters, if needed. Novo Nordisk medical employees within Medical Information, Medical and Scientific Affairs, and Strategic Scientific Communications Departments spent approximately 400 hours total on clinical review of each reference to ensure all errors, if any, were identified and valid, as well as verified the accuracy of the drafted letters. Finally, a Novo Nordisk employee submitted the correction letters to the editors/publishers.</p>

         <title>Discussion</title>
         <p>This project aimed to improve the quality of information about Novo Nordisk products in these commonly used references. A significant number (&gt;600) of errors or omissions related to Novo Nordisk products were identified in 32 of 37 references reviewed from November 2007 to December 2008. When subsequent editions were available for two-thirds of these references, approximately 42% of the identified errors had been corrected. The highest correction rate (53%) was for drug reference books, and the lowest (28%) was for electronic resources, although the reason for this difference is not clear. We were unable to confidently state which references may be more accurate than others simply by analyzing the number of errors and the correction rate because of multiple variables that do not allow for equal comparison of the references such as the level of detail and quantity of product information (ie, the more detailed and amount of information that is provided, the more likely the risk of error occurring) and the target audience for the reference (ie, reference for pharmacists may not be as detailed as for other health care professionals).</p>
         <p>There are some limitations when assessing the impact of this initiative. It is unknown how many of the correction letters were actually reviewed and considered by the authors, editors, or publishers. Although several did reply with written confirmation of receiving our correction letters, we did not request a confirmation response, so most did not. Thus, it is impossible to determine how many of the total changes were directly related to our correction letters or if the editors realized it on their own. The timeframe between the letter being sent and the new edition being published may not have been sufficient (ie, our letters may not have been received in a timely manner with respect to the publisher’s production schedule, obviating the editor’s ability to incorporate these corrections in the 2009 editions, especially textbooks that could have a significant lead time between content generation and publication). For this initiative, we were unable to qualitatively measure its business impact, but these corrections have the potential to avoid product misuse (eg, inaccurate pregnancy category), minimize risk of adverse events (eg, inaccurate storage recommendations), prevent a decision not to use a product (eg, exclusion of new indication for marketed product), avoid leverage by competitors (eg, inaccurate pharmacokinetic properties compared to competing product), and prevent lack of reimbursement.</p>
         <p>The types of errors identified varied along with the potential impact to health care professionals and patients. For example, some references included discontinued Novo Nordisk products, and health care professionals prescribing these may lead to delayed treatment initiation, potentially affecting clinical outcomes for the patient. References also omitted relevant Novo Nordisk products and failed to provide full or new product indications; thus, prescribers and patients may not be provided with all the available options for treatment of their condition. Also, prescribers may not consider use of a product without an approved indication. Incorrect pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic profiles were seen in references that might lead to inaccurate administration recommendations (eg, incorrect insulin duration of action), leading to potential adverse event for patients (ie, hypoglycemia for insulin products). Patient harm may also occur from outdated warnings/precautions such as omission of new warnings (eg, not to use in a certain patient population). In addition, outdated storage recommendations (ie, number of days that insulin may be stored at room temperature) might cause patients to prematurely discard remaining product in which extended storage times were approved.</p>
         <p>Our experience in attempting to correct errors and omissions provided several key lessons. First, publishers appear to be amenable to manufacturers’ suggestions related to objective, factual errors versus subjective interpretations or author conclusions. Second, identifying the correct contact person is critical for success. At the outset of the initiative, it was found that contacting authors or editors entailed many difficulties, such as obtaining current contact information for authors and editors, as they may have changed academic affiliation from the time of publication. Furthermore, we received no feedback from authors or editors to indicate our communication was received. Therefore, we changed our approach to identify a contact person at the office of the publisher who was specifically responsible for content updates. Third, editors/publishers may be more likely to respond when requests are sent via e-mail versus US mail because of the added convenience of electronic correspondences.</p>

         <title>Conclusion</title>
         <p>This type of initiative is an excellent fit for medical information departments, which have the required product knowledge and communication skills. Taking on this role in the organization can also raise the visibility of the medical information department and further demonstrate the value this department provides.</p>
         <p>It has been noted that the most common therapeutic intervention in medicine is writing a prescription,<sup>

            </sup> and it is critical that commonly used prescription references be based on the most complete and up-to-date information possible. Medical information professionals can apply “lessons learned” from this initiative when planning similar projects to address information inaccuracies and omissions for their companies’ products.</p>
