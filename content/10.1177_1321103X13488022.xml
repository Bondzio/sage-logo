<p>It is a great honor to undertake the position of Editor of <italic>Research Studies in Music Education</italic>, and this issue marks my full entry into this role. Over the past 9 months, the journal has undergone a period of editorial transition as Margaret Barrett (Outgoing Editor) and Tammy Jones (Outgoing Assistant Editor) stepped down to take on new and exciting challenges. I would like to take this opportunity to thank both Margaret and Tammy for their tireless and outstanding contributions to the journal. During their tenure, <italic>Research Studies in Music Education</italic> has grown in stature and has greatly benefitted from the affiliations with SEMPRE and SAGE, which were negotiated by Margaret. The journal management systems set up by Tammy and Margaret have considerably facilitated my entry into editorial processes. The indefatigable and highly efficient Samantha Dieckmann joins me as Assistant Editor, and Margaret’s and Tammy’s ongoing support as we assumed our new responsibilities has been invaluable. The support of the publication team at SAGE, especially Louise Skelding, Rosie Sheridan and Amy Goggins, has also been much appreciated and I am grateful to Graham Welch and SEMPRE for their warm welcome.</p>
<p>In conjunction with the new editorial team, <italic>Research Studies in Music Education</italic> has commenced a new system of online submission of manuscripts, streamlining the process of manuscript review through to publication (see details on the journal website). My editorial thanks go to Niall Booth, SAGE Online Project Manager, for implementing the system to the benefit of authors, reviewers and editorial staff. The system assists with timeliness of feedback to authors and ensures that the journal processes continue to demonstrate current best practice.</p>
<p>The new editorial team is ably assisted by the Associate Editors and the Editorial Board, members of whom are drawn from a broad range of geographical locations and who represent wide-ranging areas of disciplinary expertise. I would like to welcome a number of new members of the Editorial Board and thank retiring members who have consistently provided their time and valuable advice to authors, many over a lengthy period of time. I would particularly like to thank Peter Dunbar-Hall, who, as Associate Editor for many years, has reviewed countless manuscripts and produced several Special Issues of the journal as guest editor. I would also like to echo the thanks of Margaret Barrett to the many selfless reviewers who expand the capacity of the Editorial Board to provide advice to authors, enabling appropriate and careful appraisal of the seemingly myriad topics that form the focus of manuscripts submitted to <italic>Research Studies in Music Education</italic>.</p>
<p>The articles in this issue reflect several contemporary concerns in music education and highlight the contextual complexity of these concerns in relation to music learning and teaching in schools, homes and residential facilities, tertiary institutions and community-based projects. Through ethnographic case studies, Graham McPhail (New Zealand) and Joseph Pignato (USA) interrogate approaches to informal modes of music transmission involving popular music within formal school settings, and the personal, curricular and institutional factors that aid or constrain such approaches. In contrast, informal approaches to learning utilising the affordances of technology are examined by Gianna Cassidy and Anna Paisley (Scotland), whose exploratory empirical case study investigates the potential of music-games to encourage young people to engage in further music participation in formal contexts, to their broader benefit.</p>
<p>Cassidy and Paisley’s study appears in a special <italic>Perspectives in Music Education</italic> section devoted to The Power of Music, and curated by Susan Hallam and Raymond MacDonald. Hallam and MacDonald’s invited introductory essay surveys recent research findings regarding the extra-musical benefits of music. Two complementary articles relating to a large-scale research project investigating the effects of music participation on the wellbeing of older adults complete this section. Researchers Andrea Creech, Susan Hallam, Hilary McQueen and Maria Varvarigou (UK) first provide an overview of the mixed methods project and its outcomes across three contexts in London and northern England. Specific outcomes in one context are then outlined in a detailed phenomenographic study, authored by Varvarigou, Hallam, Creech and McQueen.</p>
<p>The effects of participation of older adults in performance and co-construction of songs and song lyrics are also the focus of an article by Julie Ballantyne and Felicity Baker (Australia). However, Ballantyne and Baker’s study emphasizes the insights that provision of these musical experiences brings to the providers, students engaged in university music education and music therapy courses, and the benefits of reflexive practice. Utilization of reflexive practice in university training of music teachers is also the underlying theme of articles by Deborah Blair (US) and Dave Knowlton (US). Using a narrative inquiry lens, Blair investigates the process of identity construction as a music education student moves into the role of teacher in successive stages, whereas Knowlton’s study reveals that reflexive practice requires certain conditions in order to result in metacognition.</p>
<p>As demonstrated throughout this selection of articles, there are both anticipated and unanticipated outcomes of music education endeavor. I invite readers to explore the resulting themes and engage with the authors’ discussion.</p>

<bio>
<p><bold>Kathryn Marsh</bold> is Associate Professor and former Chair of Music Education at the Sydney Conservatorium of Music, University of Sydney. With a PhD in ethnomusicology and a professional background in music education, Kathryn Marsh’s research and teaching interests include children’s musical play, children’s musical creativity, primary music education, cultural diversity in music education, the influence of the media on children’s learning and creation of music and the role of music in the lives of refugee children. She has written numerous scholarly and professional publications and is regularly invited to present the results of her research internationally. Her book <italic>The Musical Playground: Global Tradition and Change in Children’s Songs and Games</italic>, published by Oxford University Press (2008), won the British Folklore Society’s Katharine Briggs Award and the American Folklore Society’s Opie Award and has been widely acclaimed. She is a member of the editorial boards of <italic>Psychology of Music</italic> and the <italic>International Journal of Play</italic> and recently served on the editorial boards of the <italic>International Journal of Music Education</italic> and <italic>Research Studies in Music Education</italic>, and the International Advisory Board of the <italic>British Journal of Music Education</italic>. She was also a section editor of the seminal <italic>Oxford Handbook of Music Education</italic>.</p>
<p>Professor Marsh has been the recipient of major national research grants which have involved large-scale international cross-cultural collaborative research into children’s musical play in Australia, Europe, the UK, the US and Korea. Her field recordings from this research are now held as a special collection in the British Library. Current national grants from the Australian Research Council and Office of Learning and Teaching are enabling her involvement in research and tertiary teaching projects that respectively investigate the interface between intergenerational transmission of Aboriginal performance genres and schools, and develop tertiary students’ cultural competence through service learning with Aboriginal communities.</p>
<p>As a member of a cross-disciplinary research team, she conducted the National Review of School Music Education for the Department of Education Science and Training, exploring the status and quality of music education in Australian schools. She is frequently invited to advise on curriculum development at state and national levels and has been a visiting fellow at the University of Washington and University of London.</p>
