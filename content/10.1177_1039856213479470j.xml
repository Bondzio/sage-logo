<p>Following the establishment of an ‘Early Career Psychiatrists’ Special Interest Group’ to better address the needs of early career psychiatrists, the RANZCP is pleased to announce a workshop will be held on Saturday May 25<sup>th</sup> 2013 at the Four Points by Sheraton Darling Harbour in Sydney, immediately preceding the RANZCP 2013 Congress workshops.</p>
<p>In line with the objectives of the group, the workshop will focus on issues aimed at supporting, nurturing and mentoring Fellows in the early stages of their career. Sessions will focus on topics such as managing your own mental health, leadership in public practice and pitfalls in psychotherapeutic practice, among others.</p>
<p>Workshops will be led by a range of presenters and include an interactive component, allowing attendees the opportunity to benefit from the experiences of established psychiatrists in an informal and relaxed atmosphere. A social event will follow the workshop, providing attendees the opportunity to socialise and network with peers and colleagues.</p>
<p>Fellows who are in their early years of Fellowship (generally the first five years of Fellowship), or who are expecting to be admitted to Fellowship of the RANZCP in the near future, are eligible to attend the workshop. Places are limited, so please register your interest early.</p>
<p>If you are an early career psychiatrist and would like to register your interest for the workshop or be kept informed of group activities please contact RANZCP Membership Services on 03 9640 0646 or email <email>membership@ranzcp.org</email>.</p>
