<abstract>
<p>This article describes the characteristics of transactional analysis counseling groups and identifies specific aspects that differentiate them from transactional analysis therapy groups. The author offers a definition of transactional analysis counseling and then focuses on the group setting and the group leader’s role. These reflections are based on experiences in which transactional analysis was used as a methodology for group counseling. A group experience with adolescents is provided as an example.</p>

<body>
<p>Eric <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0362153713486111">Berne (1961</xref>, p. 165) presented transactional analysis as a “method of group therapy because it is a rational, indigenous approach derived from the group situation itself” (p. 165). He began doing group treatment in a U.S. military hospital during World War II, and these meetings with soldiers were given formal recognition by the Ministry of War as “therapeutic” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0362153713486111">Berne, 1966</xref>, p. viii). From then on, Berne continued to meet with his patients in groups. It was thus in a group setting that transactional analysis was born, thanks to Berne’s observations about the relational dynamics that emerged among group members.</p>
<p>Since then, transactional analysis methods have been applied far beyond the strictly therapeutic field. Until the 1990s, nonpsychotherapy applications were defined as <italic>special fields </italic>(see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0362153713486111">Cornell, 2013</xref>). Today they are divided into three specific areas: educational, organizational, and counseling fields, each with core competencies and methodologies oriented toward specific goals and contracts. In all of these fields, the group setting is used, although in different ways.</p>
<p>In Berne’s (1966, p. 3) writings we can find a distinction between treatment groups and groups with different goals. For him, counseling groups were allied activities that must be clearly differentiated from treatment groups. They were not included in Berne’s definition of treatment groups because they were not meant for psychiatric patients.</p>
<p>Actually, in the transactional analysis literature there are few reflections about the differences between transactional group counseling and transactional analysis group psychotherapy. The counseling group has some elements in common with the groups defined by Berne as Type I groups, that is, compulsory support groups organized in prisons or hospitals. He described these as banal because they do not lead to dynamic change and are characterized by pastiming and predictability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0362153713486111">Berne, 1966</xref>, p. 105). In both Type I groups and counseling groups, for instance, pastimes are used to enhance participant socialization and the exchange of helpful information.</p>
<p>My experience as a teacher and transactional analysis group counselor, and later as a trainer and a supervisor, have provided me with the opportunity to reflect widely on the characteristics of transactional analysis counseling groups, including their importance, complexity, and unpredictability, as well as on the elements that make them different from psychotherapy groups.</p>
<p>My work has also focused on discerning what is specific to groups in the counseling field, although many of the aspects I have identified are common to groups in the organizational and educational fields of transactional analysis as well. I have been animated by an ethical urge to find a clear definition for the characteristics of transactional analysis group counseling in order to provide my trainees with tools that enable them to create a setting oriented toward transactional analysis counseling goals.</p>
<p>To provide a foundation for further discussion of this process, I offer here some definitions and examples that clarify what I mean by <italic>transactional analysis group counseling</italic>.</p>
<sec id="section1-0362153713486111">
<title>Transactional Analysis Counseling</title>
<p>The <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0362153713486111">European Association for Transactional Analysis (EATA) (2008)</xref> defines transactional analysis counseling as follows:
<disp-quote>
<p>TA Counselling is a professional activity within a contractual relationship. The counselling process enables clients or client systems to develop awareness, options and skills for problem management and personal development in daily life through the enhancement of their strengths, resources and functioning. Its aim is to increase autonomy in relation to their social, professional and cultural environment. (Section 5, p. 2)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>I have added some additional considerations to this official definition: Transactional analysis counseling is a helping relationship in which the qualified professional, using TA methodology, enhances Adult awareness in the client or in the group from a problem-solving perspective. Transactional analysis methodology is applied in order to bring about change through an appropriate technique based on the here and now, the aim being to enhance cognitive and emotional awareness related to a specific problematic area (difficulties in relationships or performance).</p>
<p>Counseling thus becomes an intentional learning environment in which the goal is to facilitate the development of the client’s ability to identify his or her limits and resources in specific behavioral areas. Counseling privileges a type of intervention that aims at reaching a state of well-being based on social and personal needs that are not specifically clinical. Such interventions are based on a methodology organized into three strategic stages (alliance, decontamination, relearning) that seeks to help the client (individual, group, system) to acquire new competencies and to identify constructive options intended to enhance the development of the client’s own social identity.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0362153713486111">
<title>The Transactional Analysis Counselor</title>
<p>In his last book, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0362153713486111">Berne (1972</xref>) wrote that it is enough for a counselor to be a good listener, whereas a therapist needs to be both a listener and a repairman (p. 361). This view of a counselor appears rather limiting and simplistic nowadays.</p>
<p>Although I agree on the importance of being a good listener, I view transactional analysis counselors as qualified professionals who, after specific training, acquire competencies in managing helping relationships, such as enhancing change processes, conducting interviews, and leading groups with the intention of developing awareness of both problems and resources and strengths as well as the ability to manage important changes. Their competencies are related both to promoting and cocreating (together with the individual and/or the group) skills connected with personal well-being and an improved quality of life. Counselors are more effective when they work toward a shared goal in synergy with specialists from other fields.</p>
<p>Fassbind-Kech (personal communication, 20 May 2011) underscored that one of the most important competencies for counselors is being able to identify and focus on the client’s existing resources. This reinforces the client’s strengths rather than his or her weaknesses and suggests the following ways to activate such resources:
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item>
<p>Use transactional analysis theory to activate the Adult, analyze psychological games, and enhance new decisions</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Focus on positive experiences from the past to establish a connection with the present in order to support a person’s identity</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Focus on the client’s creativity in order to build new visions and perspectives about the future (e.g., visualize a problem that has already been solved in order to identify, together with the counselor, the steps that were required for the solution)</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Use bodily perceptions to increase the client’s awareness of his or her level of stress, strengths, and personal processes for handling stress</p>
</list-item>
</list>Fassbind-Kech also remarked on how counselors are qualified professionals by reason of their awareness of their own limits, their continuous reflection on their ethical attitudes, and their reflection on their work in the context of continuous supervision and exchange of opinions with colleagues.</p>

<title>Transactional Analysis Group Counseling</title>
<p>Transactional analysis group counseling is conducted by a TA counselor who structures a group setting in order to facilitate the accomplishment of the goals established in the counseling contract (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0362153713486111">Table 1</xref>). The group becomes the place in which views are exchanged and sharing takes place. Such processes enhance the development of the Adult competencies of group members. Transactional analysis methodology facilitates the accomplishment of the work plan established in the counseling contract.</p>

<p>Thanks to the group leader’s stimuli and the participants’ feedback, group members are able to develop awareness of their relational styles and intrapsychic dynamics. The transactional analysis counselor, as a group leader, creates a helping relationship that is both structured and structuring.</p>
<p>The main objectives of a counseling group are improving communication among group members, developing awareness of communication styles (stroke economy, transactions, games, drivers), facilitating the expression and management of emotions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0362153713486111">Cornell &amp; Hine, 1999</xref>), developing clients’ resources, and preventing distress. The leader facilitates the exchange of opinions among group members. What emerges from such exchanges, in accordance with the counseling contract, is shared with the others in an Adult-oriented process. This aspect is easier when the contract has been clearly defined and involves common goals. The change process is thus delineated around a central problem shared by all group members. The group focus therefore becomes “care rather than cure” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0362153713486111">Loomis, 1982</xref>, p. 52).</p>

<sec id="section4-0362153713486111">
<title>Set and Setting of Transactional Analysis Group Counseling</title>
<p>“The group is a containing envelope that keeps people together, containing thoughts and words, and allows the construction of an inner space and its own time dimension” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0362153713486111">Anzieu, 1981</xref>, p. 87).</p>
<sec id="section4a-0362153713486111">
<title>Set</title>
<p>The <italic>set</italic> as described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0362153713486111">Miglionico (2000</xref>, p. 116) is the physical and material dimension of the group, all those practical arrangements that characterize the environment and are important for making sure the counselor’s work is carried out properly. For example, a circular seating arrangement is preferred, and the distance between people should foster intimacy and a sense of belonging but also protect group members from feeling that their personal space is being invaded. Counseling groups can start in several kinds of set (community or reception centers, hospitals, antiviolence centers, sports centers, schools, private offices, etc.). However, such sets might prove inappropriate if they fail to protect group members enough (e.g., unsuitable rooms, background noise, external people who enter the room where the group is, telephones ringing, etc.). It is thus important for the group leader to evaluate carefully any sources of interference presented by a given set and whether they might interfere with the healthy development of the group.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4b-0362153713486111">
<title>Setting</title>
<p>The <italic>setting </italic>as described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0362153713486111">Moiso (1998</xref>, p. 55) consists of the laws, rules, and procedures that define the group atmosphere and the nature of the counselor-client relationship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0362153713486111">Novellino, 1998</xref>, p. 55). Formally, the setting is made up of a series of rules group members must abide by in order to build a relational environment suitable for the accomplishment of counseling goals. As it explicitly defines interpersonal characteristics and techniques of a specific helping relationship, the setting is thus the framework that protects both the leader and the group. Among the main rules are maintaining confidentiality (group members must agree not to talk outside the group about what happens in group meetings) and a commitment to remaining nonviolent (participants agree not to behave violently, either physically or verbally, to themselves or to others).</p>
<p>When explaining the setting, clear information must be given about how often the group meetings occur, their duration, their cost, and any possible collaboration with other specialists from different fields. Further, the specific competencies of the counselor and his or her methodology should be clearly explained so as to make clients aware that counseling is different from psychotherapy (e.g., regression exercises will not be carried out) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0362153713486111">Vinella, 2000</xref>). It is also appropriate to explain that feedback can be freely given by the members of the group but that they will be managed by the group leader, who may even stop them if he or she considers them harmful to participants.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4d-0362153713486111">
<title>Contracts</title>
<p>The contract is an explicit bilateral commitment to a well-defined course of action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0362153713486111">Berne, 1966</xref>, p. 362). A basic element of group work is defining the counseling contract such that the leader and group identify the problem, thus making it possible to understand it cognitively (social control contracts). This means that the counselor takes into account life experiences from the past (which may even emerge spontaneously during the work) and uses his or her competent strategies to connect these episodes with the here and now, the focus of the work being to activate the Adult.</p>
<p>I believe it is essential that the contract be the result of the work of the group, that is, participants are invited to define together the objectives and goals of the counseling. The role of the leader is to help group members identify a common path to be followed. In this way, the objective of the contract will be shared by all members. Following a common path implies focusing more on relational aspects among group members than on individual problems. This aspect is one of the most important differences between a counseling group and a therapy group.</p>
<p>For instance, in a community of elderly people, the contract might be defined through a mutual commitment (leader and group) to common goals (e.g., improving either communication between members and staff or time management inside the structure) so that the work will be carried out with the whole group and the change will affect the entire group.</p>
<p>I have observed that the elements that enhance the definition of a group contract are having a group that is homogeneous, closed, and time limited.</p>
<p>The term <italic>homogeneous</italic> refers to the clients themselves and not to the problems they may have (e.g., they are all parents, elderly people, adolescents, teachers, etc.). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0362153713486111">Berne (1966</xref>, p. 5) wrote that with therapy groups, it was best to choose patients randomly or in any way that would make the group as heterogeneous as possible in terms of the pathologies that needed to be addressed. In counseling groups, homogeneity is preferable because then common goals for change are easier to find. Homogeneity makes it easier to establish a group contract and facilitates communication among group members.</p>
<p>In a closed group the participants remain the same from the beginning to the end, which favors cohesion among members and the growth of the group as a whole.</p>
<p>A limit to the duration of the group (e.g., 6-10 meetings of 2-3 hours each) leads to a clearer definition of the group boundaries and the development of a counseling work plan.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0362153713486111" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methodology and Counseling Plan</title>
<p>The group leader can use tools typical of transactional analysis methodology to create a helping relationship and enhance the accomplishment of the goals that have been established in the counseling contract. Among these tools are analyzing functional ego states, transactions, the stroke economy, and psychological games. They can be integrated with techniques derived from different fields, such as the client-centered interview developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0362153713486111">Rogers (1970</xref>) or systemic-relational theory as developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0362153713486111">Horewitz (1978</xref>) and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0362153713486111">Massey (1985</xref>), the latter of whom translated many concepts typical of systemic theory into a transactional-analytical perspective and terminology.</p>
<p>There are also several intervention techniques that can be used. For example, Berne’s therapeutic operations (interrogation, specification, explanation, confrontation, illustration, and confirmation) are quite effective. Such techniques, the purpose of which are to clarify and reinforce Adult ego state boundaries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0362153713486111">Berne, 1966</xref>, p. 242) and to enhance a level of Adult awareness about one’s own communicative style and emotional competence, allow the group to follow the counseling plan. Interpretation, on the other hand, is an operation that is specific to a therapeutic plan because of its regressive nature. Berne (p. 242) wrote that interpretation deals with the pathology of the Child. Its purpose is to deconfuse the Child through decoding the patient’s past experiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0362153713486111">Novellino, 1990</xref>, p. 128). The therapist uses interpretation to establish a connection between the here and now and the there and then. It thus implies a therapeutic contract and plan and the practitioner’s specific competency in relation to transference phenomena. Accordingly, it must be underscored that it is not part of a legitimate counseling contract.</p>
<p>There are other techniques that can be useful in counseling groups. Crystallization can be used as a support technique to reinforce the awareness acquired by the client during the decontamination phase. Helpful support can be offered through stimulus exercises carefully chosen by the leader to be consistent with the group contract, group climate, and/or group expectations. The purpose is to provide stimuli that lead group members to reflect on communication styles, emotions, and strategies for alternative behaviors. However, such exercises are merely a tool leading to the central moment of group feedback wherein the leader has an active role as the facilitator of communication.</p>
<p>The counseling plan is the general direction the counselor follows to accomplish the goals established with the group in the contract. The counseling plan is mainly developed by observing transactions and psychological games. In my view, script aspects are not the focus of a counseling contract when they are primarily used for intrapsychic work and lead patients to emotional contact with the there and then. Likewise, working on protocol decisions and archaic injunctions is far from the objective and nature of counseling. Instead, script aspects that emerge in a counseling group can be used as a stimulus to facilitate clients’ awareness of their own way of “conferring meaning” to things in life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0362153713486111">Cornell, 1988</xref>, p. 280).</p>
<p>This view is close to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0362153713486111">English’s (1977)</xref> thinking in that she considered script to represent a precious heritage focused on the future and on the client’s resources rather than something that is stuck in the past. Script decisions according to which we decide our path are those connected with the present and thus focus on individuating strategic resources both to recognize positive aspects and to reduce suffering. If, during the group process, script aspects are identified that cannot be analyzed without regressive analysis or problems emerge that go beyond the contract, an ethical approach to the relationship implies referring the client to a therapeutic setting. In this sense, cooperation with other professionals is recommended.</p>
<p>The strategic stages of a counseling plan include developing a working alliance, decontamination, and relearning (deconfusion is typical of a therapeutic path). However, while these are the same as the stages in a therapeutic plan, they are so in name only. In fact, they differ because of the basic approach and the underlying contract. The work plan of a transactional analysis counseling group is aimed at enhancing awareness and supporting the expression of problematic areas; the intention is not to analyze or cure problems but to contain them inside a dimension of listening and emotional sharing. The purpose is to enhance awareness that may be helpful in recognizing problem areas.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0362153713486111">
<title>The Role of the Leader</title>
<p>Transactional analysis counselors facilitate the dynamics of exchange that emerge in the relationship among group members, offer information, structure learning experiences, make group contracts, and focus on group process. Counselors study how problems can be handled in the group so as to accomplish group work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0362153713486111">Clarke, 1981</xref>, pp. 169-170). Using basic transactional analysis concepts, counselors provide stimuli for reflection in the group.</p>
<p>The first ethical principle counselors need to keep in mind is <italic>primum non nocere </italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0362153713486111">Berne, 1966</xref>, p. 62): first do no harm. With this Berne reminded us that only great awareness enables us to identify occasions when our clients could be hurt. It is, therefore, fundamental that the transactional analysis counselor be a competent professional who understands group dynamics so as to establish a healthy empathic relationship and thus be able to work creatively with his or her group.</p>
<p>Any kind of contractual abuse must be prevented because it is an abuse of ethics and exposes both the leader and group members to risks brought about by inappropriate or even harmful interventions. A transactional analysis group counselor should be able to:
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item>
<p>Structure a group set and setting</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Establish a group counseling contract and lead the group in accordance with the contract</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Plan a path, the goal of which is to foster change as a result of the activities of the group</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Handle group dynamics</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Choose stimulus exercises that facilitate communication among group members and foster respect for the atmosphere, stage, and goals of the group</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Facilitate the construction of a serene and friendly atmosphere using an empathic approach</p>
</list-item>

<title>Differences Between Transactional Analysis Group Counseling and Transactional Analysis Group Therapy</title>
<p>In the transactional analysis literature, several authors have recognized the difficulty of defining the boundaries between counseling and psychotherapy in terms of efficacy, ethics, and institutional aspects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0362153713486111">Grégoire, 1998</xref>). Other authors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0362153713486111">Fassbind-Kech, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0362153713486111">Tudor, 1997</xref>) underscore how a linear and rigid boundary between fields can be too constricting. However, as a counselor-trainer, I consider it helpful to provide trainees with a clear framework to use in constructing group counseling paths and for defining ethical, methodological, and contractual boundaries.</p>

<title>Transactional Analysis Group Counseling in the Educational and Organizational Fields</title>
<p>The characteristics of transactional analysis group counseling as just described coincide, in many ways, with those of TA groups in the educational and organizational fields. However, each field has its own specific setting, contracts, and objectives, and the approaches remain distinct for each field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0362153713486111">Grégoire, 1998</xref>). Those who lead organizational, educational, or counseling groups develop working plans aimed at achieving goals that are coherent with their own field of application.</p>
<p>A specific characteristic of counseling groups in the organizational field is, for instance, that the focus is not only on the relationship between group members but also on relationships between group members and the group and the organization, or the organization itself, including its structures, tasks, and technology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0362153713486111">Tudor, 1999</xref>, p. 179).</p>
<p>In the educational field, on the other hand, the focus of intervention is based on how people learn and how education and training can be more effective. An educational counselor’s competencies are oriented toward how to facilitate learning through different educational approaches, such as experiential learning, student-centered education, self-directed learning, and learning styles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0362153713486111">Fregola, 2011</xref>). The group can thus be a helpful tool in terms of a certain perspective on learning, and the specific context is therefore training and educational agencies.</p>
<p>It is, nevertheless, common to find some overlap in settings and methodologies among different fields. Counseling, for example, can involve teamwork (characteristic of the organizational field), whereas in the organizational field mentoring and training activities can be carried out that are characteristic of the educational field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0362153713486111">Napper, 2010</xref>). Thus it is important for practitioners to have an in-depth knowledge of different fields and the boundaries separating them so as to prevent confusion about roles and noncoherent approaches in a group.</p>

<title>Transactional Analysis Group Counseling with Adolescents</title>
<p>To illustrate the characteristics of group counseling, I will now describe my personal experience leading a group of adolescents in southern Italy. I was hired as an expert in communication for a project on health education at a vocational high school where students were quite disruptive.</p>
<p>For this project, a counselor external to the school was required. The purpose was to offer students a more engaging and emotional story that was different from the usual educational activities experienced at school. The project aims were thus in line with counseling objectives. I had to obtain parental authorization for students to participate in the project. I also had to communicate my commitment to working with the teachers on the group processes identified during the project to the extent possible while maintaining confidentiality about the content of group sessions.</p>
<p>In this case, the setting was typical of the educational field, however, although both the intervention itself and the practitioner’s competence characterized an intervention typical of the counseling field. The project consisted of 10 meetings of transactional analysis group counseling (20 hours total) and several interventions mainly meant for giving information. The course was addressed to 18 students in their fourth year of high school who voluntarily chose to participate in the project.</p>
<sec id="section10-0362153713486111">
<title>Set</title>
<p>The group meetings took place in one of the school classrooms. There were some desks and chairs, a small window, and a blackboard. The group always met in the morning while other classes had regular lessons. This created some problems: The group was sometimes disturbed by the school employees or by other teachers who entered the room if they heard laughter or loud voices because they wanted to keep the school quiet.</p>
<p>A simple intervention regarding the setting, agreed on by the students at the beginning, was to protect the set and transform the space for the group. We put up a “Do Not Disturb” sign outside the door, and the desks were removed while equally spaced chairs marked the boundary of the group. For many of the students, this was already something new. They had been together for years in school but experienced for the first time sitting in a circle without desks to protect them.</p>
<p>Many of the students resisted this simple change. At first they were sarcastic about the arrangement and said that they felt like they were at an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting. Later, however, they moved the desks and arranged the set so they could talk to each other even before I entered the room. In this way, the external boundary of the group was even more defined.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0362153713486111">
<title>Setting</title>
<p>Clearly defining the setting of transactional analysis group counseling and respecting the rules are, in themselves, change-oriented operations. Starting from the rule of confidentiality, to which appropriate discussion was dedicated in the group, other basic rules emerged:
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item>
<p>Avoid violent behavior (physical and verbal)</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Talk about oneself directly</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Listen to everything everybody has to say</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Switch off mobile phones for the entire time of the group</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Do not leave the group before the break</p>
</list-item>
</list></p>
<p>These rules, which might seem obvious to people who conduct therapy groups, were not easily accepted by the students because they were not used to listening to each other or themselves, to speaking in the first person to the whole group or looking into each other's eyes, and to keeping their phones off for 2 hours. Therefore, defining the set and setting and reaching agreements about them were already significant change-oriented operations. I then provided general information on the characteristics of transactional analysis group counseling, my competencies, and the methodology I was going to use for developing the group process.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0362153713486111">
<title>Group Contract</title>
<p>After the set had been defined and the main rules had been established, group work focused on analyzing the students’ expectations (e.g., “to know myself better,” “to understand why I get easily discouraged when I study,” “to communicate more with my classmates,” etc.) and then defining the group contract. The contract they settled on was, “We want to understand how to improve the communication between us and with others.”</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-0362153713486111">
<title>Methodology and Treatment Plan</title>
<p>Meetings developed in three stages: (1) a brief theoretical definition of key transactional analysis concepts (ego states, transactions, strokes); (2) stimulus exercises that would provide a reflection of the students’ ego states and communication styles; and (3) group feedback. I organized the meetings in such a way as to increase awareness and improve communication within the group. I chose stimulus exercises of different kinds that I thought might help accomplish the plan.</p>
<p>In the meetings, I often used colored sheets of paper and colored felt-tip pens for the exercises. The students were enthusiastic about drawing because they had not had the chance to draw creatively in years. In fact, they had hated drawing lessons at school because the focus was on learning technique, and they were not free to express themselves.</p>
<p>I chose activities to help the students identify ego states, both their own and others’, and transactions through structured simulations (simulations of dialogues at the bus stop, in cafés, at school, and so on) that we then taped. The students chose stories and roles from a list I proposed, and then they presented them before a video camera. My task was to help them observe and ascertain the differences between perception, episodes from real life, the image in the video, and their classmates’ feedback. There was no intention to interpret, only to facilitate observation and awareness of their communication styles. Watching themselves gave the students an opportunity to become conscious of their own image and to verify their relational styles as well as to increase awareness of the communicative methods they used. The goal was to compare their self-perception (the way they saw themselves) with reality (the way they saw themselves in the video) with the image they conveyed to others (the way others saw them) in order to acquire greater awareness of their verbal and nonverbal communication.</p>
<p>Video offers more than a mirror because it catches the way we behave with other people. It goes beyond the physical aspect and, for this reason, watching it can be experienced as traumatic. Watching the video of the simulations, many of the students hardly recognized themselves or were ashamed of their image or their voice. They saw themselves more or less rigid than they thought of themselves as being. As a result, the most significant part of the work was watching the film together and commenting on it. The feedback revealed interesting realizations: S. had thought he was being funnier than what he saw in the film, P. had perceived himself as more aggressive than what the video showed, E. became upset when he realized he was speaking exactly like his father and saying the same things he hates to hear. The group members reflected on these for a long time and identified the difference between their inner worlds and what emerged on video.</p>
<p>During the exchange of feedback, I integrated Berne’s operations with the technique of active listening and an empathic approach. In particular, in the first stage of the group I used some Parental interventions (support, reassurance, persuasion, exhortation) that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0362153713486111">Berne (1966</xref>, p. 248) defined as other approaches to be used in special situations. In counseling, they can actually prove quite helpful in supporting cohesion and safety in the group.</p>
<p>For example, at the end of each meeting, the students asked for my opinion about their group and their work: “Are we good?” “Are we different?” “Have we grown?” In a therapeutic context, such a request is usually approached or analyzed, and parental statements are avoided. In a counseling group, I accepted the request for positive feedback, considering it to represent a healthy need for reassurance. I replied with a support intervention, noting the strengths and changes identified by each member of the group.</p>
<p>Although the direction of the work plan was oriented by the feelings and needs of the here and now, we dedicated time to listening to personal dimensions of the students’ lives. For example, during an exercise about symbolic self-representation, one girl gave herself permission to acknowledge the serious eating disorder she had been suffering from for a while. This allowed her to recognize the importance of asking for help from a specialist. I said I would be available to meet with her parents, and I suggested a referral to a transactional analysis psychotherapist with whom I often collaborate. The synergy of these interventions also fostered our work in the group.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-0362153713486111">
<title>Time Structuring in the Group</title>
<p>With this kind of group, particular attention must be given to time structuring. In my experience with adolescents, in addition to the activities just described, I have focused on confronting their tendency to withdraw and contrasted it with the centrifugal force coming from within the group. They try to discover what is happening outside the set so as to avoid physical and emotional contact within the group.</p>
<p>As for time structuring in groups through pastiming, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0362153713486111">Berne (1966</xref>, p. 230) always considered it to be an evasive maneuver. However, it can also become a way to get to know each other better and a means to express a personal opinion (not stereotyped) about something.</p>
<p>In the student group we spent only a limited time analyzing psychological games because I think dealing with them requires a more protected context and a longer time. Therefore, I simply explained the roles in the drama triangle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0362153713486111">Karpman, 1968</xref>), which the students easily recognized in themselves.</p>
<p>Moments of intimacy are generally rare in groups. In fact, Berne warned about the risk of encouraging affectionate expression among group members unless its authenticity has been carefully evaluated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0362153713486111">Berne, 1966</xref>, p. 231). In my experience, however, some adolescents have proved able, although for a short time, to experience deep, sincere emotional contact with the whole group in a new condition of affectionate closeness and acceptance of others.</p>
<p>Great relevance was given to the final phase of the group. This represents an important moment for defining clear boundaries for the group experience. The group leader’s central task is to accompany the group to a serene closure, without significant questions remaining unresolved, and to make sure that everyone can leave the group with positive feelings. The choice of stimulus exercises oriented to this goal is important. In my experience with the student group, the final phase centered on analyzing what they had learned from the meetings. It was clear that they could now recognize their functional ego states, and they were more aware of their communication styles as well as more capable of expressing themselves directly and speaking for themselves. Their knowing each other better and the new awareness they acquired helped them to reflect on their identity and well-being.</p>
<p>The final part of the project consisted of meeting with the teachers to share the most relevant points of the group process and to plan together the next strategies for intervention.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Transactional analysis group counseling has specific characteristics that differ from those of therapy and other types of groups. They are typically homogeneous, closed, and time limited, and they mainly focus on participants’ resources and the prevention of distress. The group counselor should be able to structure a group setting, establish a group counseling contract, handle group dynamics, and develop a counseling plan that is conducive to change in accordance with the format and contract. The methodology is a specific transactional analysis methodology applied to counseling, and it can be integrated with techniques derived from different fields (e.g., humanistic psychology or systemic-relational theory).</p>
<p>To conduct a counseling group, specific transactional analysis training in the field of counseling is required as is knowledge of the boundaries defined for that field. It is, however, important to develop awareness of one’s own professional identity and the resources and potentialities of one’s role as a counselor rather than to focus merely on the ways that it is not like psychotherapy. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0362153713486111">Fassbind-Kech (2011</xref>) wrote, “It is high time for us counselors to disengage from historically-determined patterns of identity and to distinguish ourselves by our competencies, rather than defining ourselves by what we are not and what we are not allowed to do” (p. 21). The transactional analysis counselor, with appropriate protection (through supervision peer groups, personal therapy, and ongoing training), can conduct groups in different social areas and propose paths conducive to communication and sharing with objectives and goals oriented more toward well-being than pathology. One can thus foster both the development of Berne’s idea of transactional analysis as a social psychiatry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0362153713486111">Berne, 1961</xref>) and the positive psychology style <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0362153713486111">Allen (2003</xref>) wrote about as “focuse[d] on health, good feelings, hope, gratitude, flow, intimacy, mindfulness, and repair of ruptures in communication” (p. 141).</p>
<p>In my view, it is important to continue discussing transactional analysis group theory and to develop in-depth research about applications of groups in the counseling field as well as in the educational and organizational fields (e.g., how to deal with transference and countertransference phenomena or how to work with emotions and aspects of script). This will help prevent confusion about professional roles, and practitioners will thus acquire awareness of the possibility of working in synergy toward a complex, ever-changing society.</p>
