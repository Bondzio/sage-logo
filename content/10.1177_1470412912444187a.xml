<p>I can’t remember if I read Berger first before I heard him speak or if it was the other way round. What I do know is that I can’t read him now without hearing the voice, and I think it has always been that way. It has the same timbre and rhythm as Jonathan Miller’s: urgent, masculine, and measured in a way that makes you think he might be prone to gabbling, of going ‘off on one’. When I first heard Berger’s voice I felt I was listening to the sound of a different set of commitments, a sound quite distinct from the luxuriously delivered descriptions of a more patrician class of cultural commentators that I was used to hearing on TV and radio. Berger’s oh so serious voice (a world away from the frenetic shtick of today’s commentators and presenters) told you what to consider, how to consider it, but not what to conclude.</p>
<p>I first read <italic>Ways of Seeing</italic> in the transition between an art foundation course and a degree in fine art (probably in 1980 or 1981). I read it as someone who made pictures. My abiding memory is of reading pages 27 and 28 (in the Penguin edition). At the bottom of page 27 there is a small black and white reproduction of van Gogh’s <italic>Wheatfield with Crows</italic>. Above it is written: ‘this is a landscape of a cornfield with birds flying out of it. Look at it for a moment. Then turn the page.’ I dutifully did as requested. Turning the page you find the same image reproduced at the top of page 28 but this time there is handwriting beneath it telling you that ‘this is the last picture that van Gogh painted before he killed himself.’ The handwritten message (though of course it is a printer’s version of handwriting) suggests it is not Berger saying or writing this. Below this we pick up Berger’s typed voice again: ‘It is hard to define exactly how the words have changed the image but undoubtedly they have. The image now illustrates the sentence.’</p>
<p>The energies and conflicts of art school education, as I experienced it in the early 1980s, were animated by a struggle between expressivist tendencies (or tendencies underwritten by an ideology of expressive individualism) and tendencies informed by semiotics and a broad Marxist–Feminist agenda (although any close scrutiny of this period would easily complicate such a generalized account). I was on the side of Marxist–Feminist semiotics (<italic>of course</italic>) and I made slightly overwrought and cloying ‘image–text’ photo works. I fashioned myself as an over-eager young Victor Burgin dedicated to creating scripto–visual tableaux that would generate semiotic and psychic dissonance that would unshackle the Subject from the Patriarchal Bourgeois Economy of Signs. Yikes. When I look at what is left of that work now (there’s not much but I still have to look at it through my fingers), I see a boy pleading to be loved. My expressivist tendencies mobilized the obscure intricacies and complexities of Lacanian psychoanalysis and ‘<italic>Screen</italic>-Theory’ instead of globs of, what I heard described at the time as, ‘coloured mud’ (paint – in all its forms). Paint, in the early 1980s had to be treated ironically or you were in danger of being seen to side with those who supported the Royal Academy’s <italic>A New Spirit in Painting</italic> (1981), a show that managed to concoct an entirely women-free exhibition with 38 painters in it. Armoured by theory, and utilizing Helvetica Letraset and black and white photography, I was invulnerable should anyone accuse me of a sentimentalism that I clearly suffered (and suffer) from.</p>
<p><italic>Ways of Seeing</italic> was often recruited as a primer by lecturers teaching contextual studies to art students. It was – for some of us anyway – a gateway to the royal road that would eventually lead to THEORY. You could use it to slough off layers of aesthetic ideology that had taught you to look for meaning in the intentionality of artistic genius (however tautological that might be). Berger’s request to ‘turn the page’ was to get you to recognize the way that specific utterances anchor the image by what can seem like an uncontestable, unbreachable meaning (here is the ‘last’ painting: see it as the shadow of death that it is). You might never be able to turn the page back (and where could you turn in a world where Don McLean’s <italic>Vincent</italic> was a perennial favourite of Radio One DJs and where every now and again you could chance upon Kirk Douglas wrestling with his easel in a field where the birds act like the crop-duster in <italic>North by Northwest</italic>?) but at least you could begin to see the force-field of relations that enshrined it.</p>
<p>It was only later, towards the end of the 1980s, that I came across another Berger, who was really the same Berger that was there in <italic>Ways of Seeing</italic> all along. In two books that were published either side of <italic>Ways of Seeing</italic>, John Berger and the photographer Jean Mohr constructed critically caring and loving portraits of a rural community and a migratory labour force. In <italic>A Fortunate Man</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1470412912444187">1968</xref>) and <italic>A Seventh Man</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1470412912444187">1975</xref>), Berger and Mohr made books where the circulation and relationship of images and words differed from the illustrative one exemplified by the picturing of <italic>Wheatfield with Crows</italic> as van Gogh’s last painting. Written in a range of registers (poetry, economic statistics, letters, descriptions, dialogue), and syncopated by images of landscapes, of labour, and of faces, these two books are the practice for which <italic>Ways of Seeing</italic> is the meta-critical explanation. If <italic>Ways of Seeing</italic> was a necessary way of unlearning how to look, <italic>A Fortunate Man</italic> and <italic>A Seventh Man</italic> were about relearning how to look. To turn the page in these books is to be surprised and challenged: these books don’t unfold as a linear argument but build up a series of registrations, of ‘ways of seeing’ and ‘ways of telling’ that in their heteroglot forms substantiate a portrait of a complex cultural experience. The image is not mobilized as illustration, or proof, but as a disconcerting singularity. This isn’t a realism that would ask you to forget the presence of a photographer: but nor is it a photography that insists on your recognizing, endlessly and finally, the photographer’s constructed vision. Likewise we may hear Berger’s voice across this heteroglot text but we are not made to be curious as to whether there is some other more authentic meaning <italic>behind</italic> the voice.</p>
<p><italic>Ways of Seeing</italic> rails against the mystifying language of connoisseurial formalism; it endlessly bemoans the indignities of voyeurism; and it is unflinching in its condemnation of the veiled cynicism of property relations. But its rage is motivated – in the end – by a sense that all of this results in the numbing of our sensoria, of a lessening of a world of sensorial possibilities. <italic>Ways of Seeing</italic> is a melancholic book by a writer whose humanism (or anti-humanism if you prefer) found its most pertinent form in a series of books that took us far away from the metropolitan centres of galleries and museums: books where turning the page didn’t confront us with the poverty of sensorial life, but with the opportunities of seeing anew the sensorial lives that impoverished people fashion.</p>
