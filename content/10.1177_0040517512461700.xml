<abstract>
<p>In this study, the effects of the number and position of fabrics treated with phase-change materials (PCMs) on thermo-regulating properties in four-layer garments were investigated. Nanosilver-coated nonadecane was employed as a PCM and coated onto cotton fabrics for the study. The heating and cooling effects of this PCM were evaluated by measuring temperature changes in the air layers of the microclimate within clothing using a Human–Clothing–Environment simulator. Results showed that increased incorporation of PCM-treated fabrics in a garment led to increased heating and cooling effects. In cases in which the number of PCM-treated fabrics incorporated into a garment was the same, the effects of the PCM differed according to the PCM-treated fabrics’ positions in the garment. It was found that the outer layer of a garment ensemble is the more appropriate position for the effects of the PCM.</p>

<p>Clothing comfort is at least partially determined by the heat and moisture transfer capability of the fabric. In order to improve wearer comfort, many researchers have developed methods to control heat and moisture transfer through clothes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0040517512461700">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0040517512461700"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0040517512461700"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0040517512461700"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0040517512461700"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0040517512461700"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0040517512461700"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0040517512461700"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0040517512461700"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0040517512461700"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0040517512461700"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0040517512461700"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0040517512461700">13</xref></sup> Most previous studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0040517512461700">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0040517512461700">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0040517512461700">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0040517512461700"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0040517512461700"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0040517512461700">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0040517512461700">13</xref></sup> resulted in methods that impart only passive functionality on the fabric, while more recent studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0040517512461700">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0040517512461700">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0040517512461700">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0040517512461700"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0040517512461700"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0040517512461700">12</xref></sup> have sought to develop active control of heat transfer within the fabric. Clothing manufacturers are now seeking ways to actively maintain the clothing microclimate within the comfort zone through heat emission or heat absorption by the garment. Such characteristics can be implemented by using microencapsulated phase-change materials (PCMs) that can detect temperature changes within the fabrics.</p>
<p>PCMs change physical state in response to temperature changes within a certain range. If the ambient temperature increases to the melting point of the PCM, the PCM absorbs latent heat from the surroundings during the melting process, and the physical state of the PCM changes from solid to liquid. When the temperature is subsequently reduced, the PCM emits heat at its crystallization temperature and converts back to a solid state.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0040517512461700">14</xref></sup> These phase-change characteristics make PCMs useful for the treatment of fabrics for control of the clothing microclimate. If the right PCM is chosen for incorporation into a garment, the garment may be designed to automatically adjust to the wearer’s comfort zone condition by decreasing the temperature range of the clothing according to changes in environmental conditions.</p>
<p>Common PCMs used in clothing include hydrated inorganic salts, fatty acids and esters, polyethylene glycols (PEGs) and linear chain hydrocarbons.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0040517512461700">14</xref></sup> Pioneering research on the heat insulation of clothing related to PCMs was carried out by Vigo and Frost.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0040517512461700">15</xref></sup> They measured the heat absorption and heat emission of fibers treated with hydroxide inorganic salts. They determined that, compared with untreated fabrics, PEG-treated fabrics exhibited heat absorption and heat emission that was 1.2–2.5 times higher for polypropylene hollow fibers and 2.2–4.4 times higher for rayon hollow fibers. They confirmed that PCMs contributed to thermal regulation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0040517512461700">16</xref></sup> Various methods have been used to further study the thermal regulation of clothing made using PCMs. Vigo and Bruno<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0040517512461700">17</xref></sup> used an infrared camera, and Vigo and Frost<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0040517512461700">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0040517512461700">16</xref></sup> and Bruno and Vigo<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0040517512461700">18</xref></sup> used differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) to measure the latent heat effects of the PCMs. However, DSC results cannot be directly converted to the thermal resistance of fabrics,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0040517512461700">19</xref></sup> so Pause<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0040517512461700">20</xref></sup> developed the concept of and a measurement method for dynamic thermal insulation.</p>
<p>PCMs must be investigated using a dynamic heat transfer measurement instrument; the thermal resistance of PCMs continuously changes with time because of the latent heat generated during a phase change. In addition, the measurement device should be capable of quickly and easily changing the environment, and it should ideally be capable of mimicking the use of several layers of clothing; in this case, the predictability for heat transfer characteristics under actual wearing situations would be improved. In actual use, clothing undergoes many environmental changes according to the movement of the wearer and, with the exception of clothing typically worn in warm or hot environments, garments are usually composed of several layers. Therefore, the skin model, which can be configured for multilayer wearing and can easily adjust for environmental changes, is thought to be a highly predictable and appropriate method for the measurement of thermal properties of clothing treated with PCMs. A Human–Clothing–Environment (HCE) simulator, which is a recently developed skin model, is considered capable of forecasting wearer comfort well; the HCE simulator uses acrylic rings to simulate multilayer clothing by the wearer, and it is able to adjust for both low- and high-temperature environments.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0040517512461700">21</xref></sup></p>
<p>There is disagreement in the literature surrounding the ability of PCMs to control heat transfer in garments. Some researchers claim that PCMs are effective for heat control<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0040517512461700">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0040517512461700">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0040517512461700">23</xref></sup> on the contrary, others report that latent heat effects would not be sufficient to affect the thermal comfort or body temperature of a wearer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0040517512461700">24</xref></sup> or that the differences between PCM-treated and untreated vests in wearer trials are insignificant.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0040517512461700">25</xref></sup> For this reason, further understanding of the effects of PCMs through the use of a HCE simulator will help to clarify the effectiveness of PCMs for heat control in garments.</p>
<p>The effect of a PCM in a garment is determined by the heat storage capacity of the PCM and the quantity of PCM incorporated into the garment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0040517512461700">20</xref></sup> Shin et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0040517512461700">26</xref></sup> informed that the heat storage capacities of PCMs varied according to the type of PCM and, in general, the greater the quantity of PCM in clothing, the greater the thermal effects. However, fabrics treated with large amounts of PCM were typically stiff and rough. Their cost also rises with increasing PCM quantity, so it is necessary to maximize the effects of a PCM while considering practical incorporation and cost.</p>
<p>McCullough and Shim<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0040517512461700">27</xref></sup> investigated the latent heat effects of two layers of PCM-treated fabrics under the environmental conditions of 23 and 11℃. In this case, phase change was not observed for either fabric layer at 23℃ and was observed only in the outer layer of fabric at 11℃. The researchers reported that the latent heat effects of a PCM vary according to environmental conditions and, in some cases, according to the location of the PCM-treated fabric, even when environmental conditions are identical. This work showed that the location of the PCM-treated fabric in a garment is an important factor in determining the rate of heat loss. The phase change occurred only in the outer layer of two fabrics when the external environment was 11℃. However, latent heat effects may have arisen or not because latent heat in the outer layer can easily be transferred to the surrounding environment. In other words, the location of the PCM-treated fabric influenced the heat transfer capability. Pause<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0040517512461700">20</xref></sup> also emphasized the importance of appropriate location and noted that a large difference in the effect would be observed according to the location.</p>
<p>If a garment consists of only PCM-treated fabrics, a high thermal regulation effect is anticipated because the amount of PCM will affect temperature changes in the air layers in the garment. In practice, it is unlikely that all PCM-treated fabrics in a multilayer garment will have the same thermal regulation effects, because phase change occurs according to temperature, which varies throughout a garment in practical use. In addition, garments in which all layers are composed of PCM-treated fabrics are not expected to be economical. Therefore, identification of the effective location(s) for PCM-treated fabrics in garments will be advantageous to industry.</p>
<p>In this study, we investigated the effects of PCMs for heat control in fabrics. We chose the linear hydrocarbon nonadecane for coating of fabrics. Nonadecane is a paraffin that is known to be non-corrosive, non-toxic, hydrophobic, cheap and readily available; in addition, it has a high heat capacity and is widely used in coating mixtures.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0040517512461700">28</xref></sup> To date, most of the research using linear chain hydrocarbon PCMs has employed octadecane. However, nonadecane was expected to be a more appropriate material for clothing applications because its phase changes occur at temperatures that more closely match body temperature. Because the changes in thermal properties of PCM-treated garments are due to the dynamic heat transfer phenomenon, we measured latent heat effects using the HCE simulator as the skin model. Measurement by the HCE simulator offers high predictability of wearer comfort, because the model can adjust the environment to closely match that of a multilayer garment.</p>
<p>Our goal was to investigate the effects of the number and position of the PCM-treated fabrics within a garment so that latent heat effects could be maximized in clothing design. This was done by measuring the latent heat effects by both the number and the arrangement order of PCM-treated fabrics in the garment, using the HCE simulator.</p>
<sec id="sec1-0040517512461700"><title>Experimental details</title>
<p>The incorporation of PCMs into garment fabrics is expected to influence the comfort of clothing, especially when the wearer transits between low- and high-temperature environments. The heat control capabilities of PCMs based on the number of PCM-treated fabrics and on the arrangement of PCM-treated fabrics were investigated by measuring temperature changes in air layers within a multilayer garment.</p>

<p>The fabric samples used in this study were provided by Shilla Nanotech Ltd., Korea. Microcapsules containing nonadecane (C<sub>19</sub>H<sub>40</sub>) were coated with nanosilver. The particle diameters of the microcapsules were between 8 and 30 µm; most of the microcapsules had particle sizes between 10 and 15 µm. The fabric was 100% cotton with a weight of 275.2 g/m<sup>2</sup> and a thickness of 0.48 mm. Cotton fabrics were treated with the prepared microcapsules in an acrylic binder (250 nm) using the knife-over-roll coating method (150 yard/m, 120℃).</p>
<p>The phase-change temperature of the nonadecane was determined by DSC (DSC Q20 V24.4 Build 116, TA Instruments, USA). The microcapsules in the fabrics were heated and cooled at a rate of 2℃/min in the range of 10–50℃ under a N<sub>2</sub> atmosphere. It was shown that the exothermic range was 19–31℃, and the exothermic peak was between 26 and 29℃. The endothermic range was 19–34℃, and the endothermic peak was at 28.97℃ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0040517512461700">Figure 1</xref>).

<p>The temperature changes in air layers within a garment were measured using a HCE simulator in order to understand the latent heat effects of PCM-treated fabrics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0040517512461700">Figure 2</xref>). The HCE simulator consisted of three parts: two chambers to maintain either a high- or low-temperature environment; an acrylic ring section that could model clothing wearing; and a computer that collected and displayed the results of the air layer temperature measurements. Two chambers were separated by a predetermined distance facing each other, and had coupling apertures to which the acrylic ring section was coupled. A guide rail was disposed between the hot chamber and the cold chamber. The acrylic ring section was suspended from the guide rail to be able to shuttle between the hot chamber and the cold chamber and could rotate about a vertical axis. Temperature sensors were installed to measure the temperature in air layers formed by fabrics on the acrylic ring (diameter 25 cm). The hot plate was controlled at 34 ± 0.5℃.

<sec id="sec5-0040517512461700"><title>Temperature changes in air layers</title>
<p>The garment was composed of four fabrics. The first fabric layer was the one closest to the hot plate, and the remaining layers were designated as second, third and fourth, based on their increasing distance from the hot plate. Therefore, the first air layer in the garment corresponded to the air layer between the hot plate and the first fabric layer. The low-temperature condition was 10℃, and the high-temperature condition was 34℃. To examine the heating effects, the fabrics were placed on the acrylic rings of the HCE simulator, which were first stabilized at 34℃ for more than 1 hour. The direction of the acryl ring section was changed and was coupled to the coupling aperture of the cold chamber. The temperatures in the air layers within the garment were measured every 15 seconds over a 30-minute period at the low temperature (10℃). After 30 minutes, the direction of the acrylic section was again changed and was coupled to the coupling aperture of the hot chamber (34℃); the temperature changes in the air layers were determined over a 30-minute period. All experiments were performed in triplicate, and the results were recorded as average values.

For example, in the average values (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0040517512461700">Table 3</xref>), the largest temperature difference in garments with four PCM-treated fabrics was 1.17℃. In the test garment with three PCM-treated fabrics, the largest average temperature differences were 0.80 and 1.07℃, in the test garments with two PCM-treated fabrics, the largest average temperature differences were 0.60 and 0.86℃, and in the test garments with one PCM-treated fabric, the largest average temperature differences were 0.20 and 0.84℃.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0040517512461700">Tables 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0040517512461700">3</xref> showed that the largest maximum and average temperature difference values were exhibited in the fourth air layer, except for the cases of p-p-p-np and p-p-p-p. However, in the case of p-np-np-np, the average temperature difference values were 0.2 in the second layer and 0.17 in the fourth layer. The largest average temperature difference value was presented in the second layer, but the temperature difference between the second and the forth layer was only 0.03℃. Therefore, even though the number of PCM-treated fabrics was the same, the heating effect differed according to the location of the PCM-treated fabric.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec8-0040517512461700"><title>Cooling effects</title>
<p>As shown in the previous section, PCMs can help regulate the temperature in air layers within clothing by emitting heat during the phase change from liquid to solid when the environmental temperature decreases. On the other hand, when the environmental temperature increases, PCMs can also be used to delay the rise of temperatures within clothing by absorbing the heat generated by solid-to-liquid PCM phase changes. In this case, the PCM can provide a cooling effect to the wearer of a garment made with PCM-treated fabrics. To investigate this endothermic effect, environmental conditions were increased from 10 to 34℃, and the temperature changes in air layers within the test garments were measured over a 30-minute period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0040517512461700">Figures 3</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0040517512461700">6</xref>).</p>
<p>In the figures, the data starting at 35 minutes correspond to the high-temperature exposure tests. Because of the heat absorption effect caused by the presence of the PCM, the temperature in air layers inside the test garments made with PCM-treated fabrics increased more slowly than temperatures in garments made with only non-PCM fabrics. It was found that a lower number of PCM-treated fabrics in the garment led to smaller temperature differences within the air layers.</p>
<p>To investigate in detail the endothermic temperature changes, the temperatures in the air layers were measured at 5 and 10 minutes after exposure to high temperature (34℃). The results are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0040517512461700">Figures 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0040517512461700">8</xref>.

<p>As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0040517512461700">Figures 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0040517512461700">8</xref>, the highest temperature was reached when the garment was composed of only non-PCM fabrics, because the temperature rise inside this test garment was the most rapid. The lowest temperature change was observed for the garment made with four PCM-treated fabric layers, because the rate of temperature rise was lowered by the heat absorption effect. The greater the number of PCM-treated fabrics in the garment, the lower the temperature in air layers within clothing. In the case of having the same number of PCM-treated fabrics, the temperatures in air layers inside clothing in which the PCM-treated fabrics were located on the inside were higher than those inside clothing in which they were outside. It was shown that fluctuation of temperatures by the location of PCM-treated fabrics has become more evident as the air layer of the garment had gone from the inner to the outer layer.</p>
<p>The temperature in the fourth air layer is higher than that in the third layer after several minutes, because the fourth air layer is most exposed to outside heat. The temperatures of the third and fourth layers after 5 and 10 minutes are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0040517512461700">Figures 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0040517512461700">8</xref>, respectively.

<sec id="sec9-0040517512461700" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title>
<p>PCMs have thermo-regulating properties by exothermic or endothermic reactions according to the environmental temperature. Owing to the properties of PCMs, a garment with PCM-treated fabrics can make wearer comfort improve. As shown above, the thermo-regulating properties of PCMs appeared as either heating effect by exothermic reaction or cooling effect by endothermic reaction, depending on the environmental condition, and were influenced by the number and location of PCM-treated fabrics.</p>
<p>When the garment with PCM-treated fabrics was exposed to low temperature (10℃) after stabilizing at 34℃, the temperature changes in the air layers within it were higher than those in the air layers within clothing with only non-PCM fabrics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0040517512461700">Figure 3</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0040517512461700">Figure 1</xref>, the exothermic temperature range of the nonadecane used in this study was 19–31℃, and it exhibited exothermic peaks at 26.2 and 29.1℃. Therefore, it was shown that the exothermic phenomenon occurred via phase change in the fourth (outermost) fabric immediately upon exposing the garment to the low temperature. The phase change occurred after about 7 minutes in the third fabric layer and after about 20 minutes in the second fabric layer. Heat released by the exothermic reaction of PCMs resulted in the higher temperature in the air layers inside the garment with PCM-treated fabrics.</p>
<p>As seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0040517512461700">Figure 3</xref>, the temperature changes in the air layers inside the garment with PCM-treated fabrics were always higher than those in the non-PCM fabrics, but this result does not mean that the phase change of PCMs happened in the four PCM-treated fabrics. It was thought that the exothermic reaction did not occur in the first fabric layer, since the temperatures in the first air layers were above the exothermic temperature range of the nonadecane. Nevertheless, the temperatures of the first and second air layers of the PCM-treated fabrics were shown to be higher than those in non-PCM-treated fabrics, because the heat emission by exothermic reaction of the third and fourth fabrics influenced all the air layers within the test garment. From the above results, it is presumed that when a man moves from high to low environment wearing a garment with PCM-treated fabrics, he will feel warmth due to the heat released by exothermic reaction of PCMs. It was identified that the thermo-regulating property of PCMs caused the heating effect.</p>
<p>Another effect by the thermo-regulating properties of PCMs is the cooling effect. When the garment with PCM-treated fabrics was exposed to high temperature (34℃) after exposure at 10℃, the temperature increases in the air layers within the garment were slower than those in the non-PCM fabrics cases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0040517512461700">Figure 3</xref>). As soon as the garment was exposed at 34℃, the temperatures in the air layers inside the garment increased, passing through the endothermic range of nonadecane. While the temperatures in the air layers within clothing increased rapidly, the PCM changed solid-to-liquid state by absorbing heat; consequently, the phase change of PCMs induced a delay of the temperature increases in the air layers inside the garment. It is assumed that a garment with the PCM-treated fabrics will protect a wearer from the thermal impact by the PCMs’ cooling effect of putting off the temperature increase in air layers in it when the wearer shifts from a low to high-temperature environment.</p>
<p>The heating and cooling effects of PCMs were shown to decrease when the number of PCM-treated fabrics inside a garment reduced. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0040517512461700">Figures 3</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0040517512461700">6</xref> show that the reduction of the temperature differences between garments with PCM-treated fabrics and with only non-PCM fabrics occurred in accordance with the decrease of the number of PCM-treated ones. The smaller the number of PCM-treated fabrics in the garment, the lower the thermal-regulating effects caused by the PCM.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0040517512461700">28</xref></sup> In addition, it was indicated that the heating and cooling effects on the microclimate differed according to the location of the PCM-treated fabric. In the case of heating effect, it was revealed that the maximum and average temperature differences were affected by the location of the PCM-treated fabrics (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0040517512461700">Tables 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0040517512461700">3</xref>). It was thought that the location of the PCM-treated fabrics determined the occurrence of the phase change of PCMs and the rate of heat loss to the outside.</p>
<p>The same trend was also observed in the cooling effect. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0040517512461700">Figures 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0040517512461700">8</xref>, the temperature changes were higher in the p-p-p-np, p-p-np-np and p-np-np-np test garments than in the np-p-p-p, np-np-p-p and np-np-np-p test garments, respectively. The effect of the number of PCM-treated fabrics on the heat absorption is clearly exhibited in the first and second layers, but was reduced considerably in the third and fourth layers. The temperatures in the third and fourth layers changed significantly because of the differences in the locations of the PCM-treated fabrics in the garments. It was concluded that the more effective location, with respect to heat control, for the PCM-treated fabric is on the outside of the garment, because the fourth (outermost) layer experiences the endothermic range (19–34℃) immediately upon exposure to the high-temperature condition and is able to thoroughly complete the phase change of nonadecane.</p>
<p>In order to ascertain the effects of the number and location of PCM-treated fabrics, the average temperature difference values between the garment with and without PCM-treated fabrics while exposing the garment to 10℃ are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0040517512461700">Figure 9</xref>. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0040517512461700">Figure 9</xref>, fewer PCM-treated fabrics in the garment led to smaller temperature differences between the garments with PCM-treated fabrics and the garments with only non-PCM fabrics.
<fig id="fig9-0040517512461700" position="float"><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><p>Average temperature differences between air layers with phase-change material (PCM) and without PCM (temperature difference = |temperature of air layers with PCM fabrics – temperature of air layers with four non-PCM fabrics|).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0040517512461700-fig9.tif"/>
</fig></p>
<p>Although possessing the same number of PCM-treated layers, much larger temperature differences were exhibited when the PCM-treated fabrics were located in the fourth (outermost) layer rather than in the first layer closest to the hot plate. Location effects such as these were expressed as a ratio of the average temperature difference values in cases with an np layer located near the outside (A) to the average temperature difference values in cases with an np layer located nearest the hot plate (B) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0040517512461700">Tables 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0040517512461700">3</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0040517512461700">Table 2</xref>, the temperature difference values for the fourth np layer were about 68% of the values for the first np layer in cases with three PCM-treated fabrics. The ratio decreased to 61% in cases with two layers of PCM-treated fabrics, and the ratio decreased to 33% in the case with only one layer of PCM-treated fabric. An outer layer exhibited greater influence on the temperature rise inside the garment than did an inner layer, because the exothermic reaction occurred earlier when PCM-treated fabrics were located in the outer layer during exposure to the low temperature. Even though heat loss also occurred from outer layers faster than from the inner layers, the phase change of the PCM occurred faster when the PCM-treated fabric was located in the outer layer. As a result, it was concluded that a significant heating effect was achieved because of sufficient phase change in spite of heat loss. In addition, the temperature differences according to the location of PCM-treated fabrics were revealed more clearly when there was one layer of PCM-treated fabric. The heating effect of a PCM-treated fabric located in an inner layer was about 33% of that for one located in an outer layer.</p>
<p>From these results, it was concluded that a lower number of PCM-treated fabrics led to a greater location effect. Thus, the proper selection of the location for PCM-treated fabrics is very important, and it is most advantageous to place PCM-treated fabrics on the outside of a garment to maximize thermal-regulation properties.</p>

<sec id="sec10-0040517512461700" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Rapid temperature changes can cause discomfort for wearers of garments. This fact has led to the development of treatments for fabrics that can improve wearer comfort by absorbing or emitting heat under such situations. In particular, PCMs that actively react to changes in the external environment can impart thermal-regulation properties on fabrics. In this study, we measured the clothing microclimate using a HCE simulator in order to evaluate the effects of both the number and location of PCM-treated fabrics in a garment. By measuring temperature differences in air layers within test garments, it was found that garments made using PCM-treated fabrics exhibited higher heat control effects than garments made using non-PCM fabrics. This result was attributed to the PCM’s exothermic phase change upon temperature decrease and to the corresponding endothermic phase change upon temperature increase. Thus, PCMs were found to be promising candidates for increasing wearer comfort in garments worn when frequently moving between environments of high and low temperatures. It was also found that the higher the number of PCM-treated fabrics in a garment, the larger the heating and cooling effects within the garment. However, the temperature changes in air layers within clothing did not necessarily mean that the phase change occurred in all layers in a multilayer garment. Instead, the PCMs underwent phase changes according to their locations in the test garment. The first (innermost) layer generally did not exhibit a phase change. The temperatures in the air layers varied significantly according to the location of the PCM-treated fabrics in the test garments, even in cases in which the total number of PCM-treated fabrics was the same. The heating and cooling effects were greater when the PCM-treated fabrics were located on the outside of the garment rather than on the inside closest to the hot plate, and the lower the number of PCM-treated fabrics in the test garment, the more obvious this phenomenon was. It was found that in four-layer garments in which not all of the layers are made using PCM-treated fabrics, the selection of the location of the PCM-treated fabric is important. In particular, if only one PCM-treated fabric layer is incorporated into a garment, it should be located on the outermost layer in order to maximize the heat control properties of the garment.</p>
