<abstract>
<p>A 20-year-old male was involved in a motor vehicle accident and computed tomography revealed a completely transected right mainstem bronchus. An Emergency Department (ED) right anterior thoracotomy was necessary soon after arrival at our institution secondary to acute desaturation that was unresponsive to ventilator and chest tube management. This allowed direct intubation and ventilation of the right middle and lower lobes directly through the thoracotomy incision, which stabilized the patient for transport to the operating room. Once there, percutaneous cardiopulmonary support (CPS) was initiated to allow primary surgical repair of the transected bronchus. Post surgery, the patient was transported to the surgical intensive care unit on CPS which he required for an additional two days. The patient eventually did well and was discharged home. To our knowledge this is the first successful reported case of using the Avalon Elite dual lumen veno-venous cannula for CPS in a patient with complete right main-stem bronchus transection and bilateral pulmonary contusions.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Tracheobronchial injuries (TBI) are serious and life-threatening if not treated aggressively once discovered<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0267659111420321">1</xref></sup>. With advances in pre-hospital care and triage, many of these patients are surviving to admittance at tertiary trauma centers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0267659111420321">2</xref></sup>. Medical management addresses the physiologic side effects of a pneumothorax, tension pneumothorax, or associated pulmonary contusions. Prompt surgical repair is the treatment of choice and is usually performed utilizing independent lung ventilation of the uninjured lung<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0267659111420321">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0267659111420321">3</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Cardiopulmonary support (CPS), or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), is an adjunctive therapy that has been used for a wide variety of pathologic conditions. Oxygenation with CPS can be achieved via either veno-arterial (VA) or veno-venous (VV) cannulation. Veno-venous oxygenation redirects deoxygenated blood from the body through the CPS circuit where it is oxygenated prior to being returned to the venous system. This oxygenated blood then mixes with intrinsic venous return, increasing the mean level of oxygen entering the lungs. VV CPS has seen a recent increase in use, primarily due to the pandemic experiences around the world with the H1N1 virus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0267659111420321">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0267659111420321">5</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>In 2009, Avalon Laboratories received FDA approval for marketing of their Elite Dual Lumen Veno-venous Cannula in the United States. In some institutions, this cannula has been shown to have significant benefits in treating adult populations with respiratory failure that is refractory to medical management<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0267659111420321">6</xref></sup>. The main benefits of this cannula are that clinicians are able to access the patient’s vascular system with a single cannulation site percutaneously, while providing adequate flows and minimizing intrinsic return of unoxygenated blood to the lungs to maintain adequate oxygen delivery to the tissues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0267659111420321">7</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>CPS has historically been limited to non-trauma cases, primarily due to the concern of systemically anti-coagulating trauma patients with multiple injuries; however, several recent publications have shown its use in traumatic lung injury<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0267659111420321">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0267659111420321">9</xref></sup>. Higher tolerances in decreasing the activated clotting time (ACT), as well as recent advances in heparin bonding technology, have allowed for low-dose heparin to be used<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0267659111420321">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0267659111420321">11</xref></sup>. Tracheobronchial injuries are commonly accompanied by pulmonary contusions, which may lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). If this condition is unresponsive to common lung protective strategies, then CPS may be considered as a bridge to recovery<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0267659111420321">11</xref></sup>.</p>

<title>Case Report</title>
<p>A 20-year-old male in good health was involved in a motor vehicle accident. He was stabilized at an Outside Hospital (OH) and then transferred to a level I trauma hospital. He presented in critical condition with suboptimal oxygenation despite maximal oxygen delivery via a properly placed dual lumen endotracheal tube (ETT); arterial saturation was in the low 90s. There was a massive air leak present from a chest tube in the right pleural space placed at the OH. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0267659111420321">Figure 1</xref>) Computed tomography (CT) at the OH revealed that the right mainstem bronchus had completely transected, there was a right-sided hemopneumothorax and the patient was intubated via the left bronchus with a dual lumen ETT. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0267659111420321">Figure 2</xref>) Other notable injuries included mandibular fracture, left temporal bone fracture without intracranial hemorrhage, bilateral pulmonary contusions, and a C2 vertebral body fracture.</p>

<p>During examination, the chest tubes were manipulated on and off suction in an attempt to improve saturations. During this manipulation, the saturations dropped abruptly. Despite returning the chest tubes to baseline, the saturations continued to drop to the 30s. This continued for several minutes as different manipulations of the chest tube, endotracheal tube, and ventilation strategies provided no noticeable change. A blood gas was drawn and noted to be very dark, and later confirmed to show an arterial PaO<sub>2</sub> of 25 mmHg. (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0267659111420321">Table 1</xref>) After approximately five minutes of trying different ventilatory strategies and chest tube manipulations, the patient began to develop hypotension and relative bradycardia, yet he was able to maintain an adequate pulse and blood pressure.</p>

<p>It was at this time that the decision was made to perform an Emergency Department (ED) right anterolateral thoracotomy. Once the right thorax was opened, immediate manual clamping of the right hilum was performed in an attempt to minimize shunting, which resulted in no improvement of the arterial saturations. At this point, a #5 cuffed ETT was then passed directly through the thoracotomy into the transected right mainstem bronchus. There was not adequate right mainstem bronchus remaining to get an air-tight seal to ventilate all three lobes of the right lung, therefore, the ETT was guided distally into the bronchus intermedius, allowing direct ventilation of the middle and lower lobes. Ventilation was achieved by ventilating his left lung via mechanical ventilation and his right lung via an Ambu bag. This resulted in an increase of the arterial saturations to the low 80s and a PaO<sub>2</sub> of 54 mmHg. (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0267659111420321">Table 1</xref>) The inability to adequately oxygenate after bilateral lung ventilation had been achieved supports the diagnosis of respiratory insufficiency secondary to bilateral pulmonary contusion. Due to the inability to adequately oxygenate the patient, the decision was then made to transport the patient to the operating room and place the patient on cardiopulmonary support (CPS). This would also safely allow primary surgical repair of the bronchus.</p>
<p>Once in the operating room, a 27Fr. Avalon® Elite dual lumen veno-venous cannula (Avalon Labs, Grand Rapids, MI) was placed percutaneously, using the Seldinger technique, into the right internal jugular vein, with the distal venous port positioned in the inferior vena cava. Placement was verified via transesophageal echocardiography, with the flow from the arterial infusion port directed towards the tricuspid valve, which was verified by Doppler flow measurement. CPS was continued for the duration of the surgery. The CPS circuit consisted of: The Bigger Better Bladder (Circulatory Technology Inc., Oyster Bay, NY), Maquet Rotoflow and Quadrox-D (Maquet Inc., Wayne, NJ) oxygenator, CDI 500 blood gas analyzer (Terumo, Grand Rapids, MI), and a Minntech HPH-400 hemofilter (Minntech, Minneapolis, MN). (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0267659111420321">Figure 3</xref>) The patient’s weight was 68 kg. Flows of 3.0-3.9 L/min were maintained for the duration of the case without any noticeable hemolysis or venous line chatter. The transected bronchus was repaired through the anterolateral thoracotomy, primarily using a posterior running membranous 4-0 PDS ™ suture (Ethicon), and several interrupted figure-of-eight 4-0 PDS ™ sutures, telescoping the distal bronchus as much as possible into the proximal bronchus.</p>

</fig>
<p>Upon completion of surgery, the patient was unable to be weaned from CPS, thereby, confirming our suspicion of severe, bilateral pulmonary contusions. He was, therefore, transported to the surgical intensive care unit on CPS. The lungs were protected by using “rest” ventilator settings with a tidal volume of 7.4 ml/kg and a respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute. Lung pressures were tolerable and compliance initially was quite low at 16.1 ml/cmH<sub>2</sub>0, which dramatically improved to 50 ml/cmH<sub>2</sub>0 on the day of extubation. Chest radiography showed the cannula in good position, and lungs that were well aerated, but obviously contused with edema. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0267659111420321">Figure 4</xref>) Coagulation parameters monitored were: thromboelastograph, platelet count, fibrinogen, ACT, prothrombin (PT), prothrombin time (PTT), and international normalization ratio (INR). The ACTs were maintained between 150-180 seconds. Despite regular monitoring and treatment of the patient’s coagulation profile, the patient’s bleeding continued while on CPS. Blood was present in both the right and left chest tubes, with more volume in the right. On post-operative day (POD) 2 the patient was taken back to the operating room for exploratory surgery due to excessive bleeding. At the time of exploration, no surgical bleeding was noted, but approximately one liter of old clot was removed from the right thoracic cavity. In an attempt to eliminate the need for heparin, the patient was trialed off CPS and was successfully weaned and treated by conventional ventilation only. The patient was on CPS for a total of 42 hours. The patient was extubated to nasal cannula on POD 8.</p>

<p>The patient received a total of: 28 units of packed red blood cells (PRBC), 16 units of fresh frozen plasma (FFP), 6 units of apheresis platelets, and 30 units of cryoprecipitate. Five days following the removal of CPS, the chest radiograph showed marked improvement in aeration, as well as vascular markings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0267659111420321">Figure 5</xref>). Just prior to discharge, the patient’s chest radiograph demonstrated a well-aerated right lung, with both lungs well expanded (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0267659111420321">Figure 6</xref>). Discharge occurred on POD 17 without any significant deficits. Five weeks following the discharge, the patient had no neurologic sequelae despite having a C2 fracture and sustained hypoxemia.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>With recent advances in extracorporeal technology, CPS is being applied to certain patient populations where previously CPS was not aggressively used<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0267659111420321">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0267659111420321">9</xref></sup>. Most recently, extracorporeal circuits similar to the one discussed above have been used in Australia and New Zealand for the stabilization and treatment of patients who have experienced acute respiratory failure secondary to H1N1 flu infection. Reports of a survivability of 79% have motivated some centers in North America to be more aggressive in their use of CPS for both traumatic and non-traumatic lung injury<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0267659111420321">4</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>One main concern for this injury is that of emergency airway management. Placement of an endotracheal airway with a suspected tracheobronchial injury can result in further damage and, therefore, should be avoided if possible. For this patient, intubation was necessary to support ventilation. The ED clinician had very little choice in establishing adequate oxygen delivery to the functioning lung for this patient. Emergent tracheostomy or cricoidotomy could have been performed. In this case, the placement of the double lumen ETT was the proper therapy as it allowed independent ventilation of the patient’s left lung. Ventilation through a cricoidotomy or tracheostomy in this case would have resulted in either a massive air leak or a tension pneumothorax.</p>
<p>Emergent vascular access for CPS is always a challenge. The use of the Avalon Elite cannula enables a team to quickly deploy support with a single cannulation site, using a modified Seldinger technique, reducing the time necessary to initiate veno-venous support. However, great care must be employed when inserting this product as there is a risk of intracardiac injury. Verifying placement via transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) or fluoroscopy is required. This cannula enables the arterial flow to be directed through the tricuspid valve, reducing the amount of recirculation present. Traditional VV CPS involves accessing both the femoral vein and right internal jugular vein, which increases the complexity of managing the patient’s body position and care during long-term support, as well as increasing potential sites for contamination. Our team prefers to institute CPS in the cardiac operating room if at all possible.</p>
<p>This patient received large quantities of blood products to support, not only intravascular volume, but the coagulation pathways as well. We do not suspect that this patient experienced transfusion-related lung injury (TRALI). He was unable to oxygenate himself prior to homologous transfusion, with both the left lung only and the bilateral independent lung ventilation following the ED thoracotomy. This respiratory insufficiency prompted the use of CPS.</p>
<p>While CPS has been used before for trauma management, this case report describes what we believe to be the first successful use of the Avalon Elite dual lumen veno-venous cannula for CPS that allowed the stabilization and treatment of an otherwise fatal injury in a patient who sustained both a complete transection of a major bronchus as well as severe, bilateral pulmonary contusions. Although uncontrolled hemorrhage in the face of systemic heparinization is always a major concern in multiple trauma patients, its risk must always be weighed against its potential benefits when considering CPS.</p>
