<abstract>
<p>Because pedagogical content knowledge (PCK) includes teachers’ understanding of how students learn, or fail to learn, specific subject matter, the development of PCK is an important goal to focus on in professional development programs. The research literature clearly indicates the complex nature of PCK as a form of teachers’ professional knowledge that is highly topic, person, and situation specific. This implies that professional development programs aimed at the development of teachers’ PCK cannot be limited to supplying teachers with input, such as examples of expert teaching of subject matter. Instead, such programs should be closely aligned to teachers’ professional practice and, in addition to providing teachers with specific input, should include opportunities to enact certain instructional strategies and to reflect, individually and collectively, on their experiences.</p>

<p>In their 2011 article in <italic>Educational Researcher</italic>, Jennifer Merriman Bausmith and Carol Barry draw attention to the importance of pedagogical content knowledge (PCK) as a focus of teacher professional learning communities (PLCs). In particular, the authors propose to compile an (online) library of video lessons, based on the research literature and taught by expert teachers, to be studied and discussed within PLCs as a way to enhance teachers’ PCK. They call on researchers and practitioners to suggest other “potential levers for change” (p. 176). As teacher educators and researchers of teacher knowledge and development, we feel compelled to respond to the ideas of Bausmith and Barry in order to problematize some of the issues raised in their article.</p>
<p>To begin with, we agree with the authors on the importance of forms of professional development for teachers that are built on collaboration, collegial interactions, and the fostering of relationships. There seems to be consensus in the literature that “the opportunity for teachers to participate actively and collaboratively in professional communities is an essential component of high-quality [professional development]” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0013189X11431010">Borko, Jacobs, &amp; Koellner, 2010</xref>, p. 550; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0013189X11431010">Hawley &amp; Valli, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0013189X11431010">Little, 2006</xref>). At the same time, however, there is limited research evidence on the effects of such forms of professional development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0013189X11431010">Vescio, Ross, &amp; Adams, 2008</xref>). In particular, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0013189X11431010">Hargreaves (2010)</xref> argued that teacher communities often suffered from weak leadership and that “mandated coaching and collaboration often turned genuine teacher inquiry into rituals of contrived or enforced collegiality that actually made teachers inclined to collaborate less” (p. 290). In other words, there are reasons to be skeptical about the effects of PLCs, and it is important to focus on approaches that, at least potentially, may enhance their effectiveness. In this respect, we share the concern of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0013189X11431010">Bausmith and Barry (2011)</xref> that teacher communities tend to ignore issues related to teaching and learning subject matter even though the research literature has demonstrated the importance of a focus on subject matter learning in programs of teacher professional development (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0013189X11431010">Fishman, Marx, Best, &amp; Tal, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0013189X11431010">Kennedy, 1998</xref>). Because PCK includes teachers’ understanding of how students learn, or fail to learn, specific subject matter, the development of PCK is an important goal to focus on in such programs.</p>
<sec id="section1-0013189X11431010">
<title>Teachers’ Pedagogical Content Knowledge</title>
<p>By mentioning only studies that were reported up until 1997, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0013189X11431010">Bausmith and Barry (2011)</xref> give a rather limited account of research on PCK. More important, stating that this research “yielded great insight into what expert teaching across disciplines looks like” (p. 176) seems to us to completely miss the essence of empirical studies on PCK. Not only is PCK specifically related to topics <italic>within</italic> certain disciplines (e.g., “force” within the domain of physics), but also research on PCK typically does not result in a description of “expert teaching” as if there would be one ideal or optimal way to teach certain subject matter (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0013189X11431010">Shulman, 1987</xref>). On the contrary, this research has demonstrated the complex nature of PCK as a form of teachers’ professional knowledge that is highly topic, person, and situation specific (for overviews see, e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0013189X11431010">Abell, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0013189X11431010">Kind, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0013189X11431010">Van Driel &amp; Berry, 2010</xref>). For instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0013189X11431010">Hashweh (2005)</xref> proposed to consider PCK as a repertoire of pedagogical constructions that teachers acquire when repeatedly teaching a certain topic. Even within one school, the same teacher may experience that an effective way to teach “force” on Monday morning in Grade 9 may not be half as effective on Wednesday afternoon in another Grade 9 class. An expert teacher, in our view, is sensitive to such differences and is flexible enough to adapt his or her approach, on the spot, to how students respond. Thus, PCK includes knowledge of enhancing student learning in a variety of ways.</p>

<sec id="section2-0013189X11431010">
<title>Implications for the Professional Development of Teachers</title>
<p>By focusing on “online videos of lessons taught by expert teachers that are indexed to the Common Core State Standards” (p. 176), it seems to us that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0013189X11431010">Bausmith and Barry (2011)</xref> view PCK as the enactment of a set of specific guidelines to teach certain subject matter, which can be captured on videos of “expert teachers” and subsequently used as input in large-scale professional development programs. Although the creation of an online library of such video lessons may serve certain purposes, we think this resource will be of limited value when it comes to fostering the development of teachers’ PCK. Apart from the discussion about who will qualify as “expert teachers,” we know from research that this approach does not do justice to how teachers actually develop their PCK. Such research has shown that the development of PCK is never a linear process (e.g., teacher knowledge development precedes changes in teacher behavior, which is then implemented in practice, and finally leads to certain student outcomes; cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0013189X11431010">Guskey, 1986</xref>). First, this development is rooted in teachers’ specific professional contexts and influenced by factors such as characteristics of the school culture and its population, available time, and local support for professional development (see, e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0013189X11431010">Little, 2006</xref>). Moreover, individual teachers perceive these factors differently, even when they work in the same school (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0013189X11431010">Kennedy, 2010</xref>). Finally, teachers usually hold strong personal beliefs about issues such as what they view as good teaching, how they think students learn, and which standards they wish to stress in a curriculum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0013189X11431010">Van Driel, Bulte, &amp; Verloop, 2007</xref>; cf. the notion of “orientations towards teaching” in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0013189X11431010">Magnusson, Krajcik, &amp; Borko, 1999</xref>). In short, we think that programs aiming at the development of PCK, like other recent forms of professional development, should be based on constructivist and situative theories rather than on behavioral approaches (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0013189X11431010">Borko et al., 2010</xref>). Of course, we agree that teachers should be focused on student learning, and in countries where a national curriculum or set of standards (such as the Common Core State Standards in the United States) is implemented, student learning needs to be geared toward such standards. To state, however, that this can be achieved by professional development providers who “might help schools translate such lessons and work to align local instructional efforts to the college and career readiness standards” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0013189X11431010">Bausmith &amp; Barry, 2011</xref>, p. 177) is ignoring the complexity of PCK development and the fact that there are many ways in which teachers can develop their PCK, adapted to their local contexts and the needs of their students, to contribute to these goals.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0013189X11431010">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>To conclude this commentary, we assert that the development of PCK goes beyond the acquisition of instructional strategies and techniques, per se, to include an understanding of how students develop insights in specific subject matter. The research literature clearly demonstrates that PCK development is a complex process that is highly specific to the context, situation, and person. This implies that professional development programs aimed at the development of teachers’ PCK should be organized in ways that closely align to teachers’ professional practice, including opportunities to enact certain (innovative) instructional strategies and materials and to reflect, individually and collectively, on their experiences. The research also shows that providing teachers with specific input can contribute to the development of their PCK. Examples of instructional practices, either “good” or flawed, can serve as input, as can evidence from the research literature and other resources. In this context, PLCs can have a very useful role in helping teachers to explicate and discuss key notions of teaching and learning a specific topic, thus contributing to the identification of a collective PCK, that is, a shared or common form of teachers’ professional practical knowledge about teaching certain subject matter. At the same time, there should be, of course, room for individual teachers to adapt this shared knowledge to and complement it with their own situations.</p>
