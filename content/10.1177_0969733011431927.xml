<title>Overview of 12<sup>th</sup> ICNE Conference: 7–8 September 2011</title>
<p>As an independent lay member of the University of Surrey Ethics Committee I had the opportunity to attend this year’s ICNE Conference at the University of Surrey campus in Guildford, UK. The following represents my layperson’s overview of proceedings.</p>
<p>Approximately 70 participants attended over the day-and-a-half long event, drawing participants from 16 countries around the world, thereby ensuring opportunities for cross-cultural aspects to enhance the experience. The dual themes of the Conference were ‘Researching Nursing Ethics’ and ‘The Ethics of Research’. The conference comprised eight plenary sessions (two open to the public) and three parallel sessions during which 30 papers were presented. The papers presented ranged over diverse aspects of nursing ethics and research topics/projects and ensured that the objectives of the Conference were met, namely:<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item>
<p>strengthening interaction/networking of researchers, teachers, practitioners and students in nursing and healthcare ethics;</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>developing international dialogue around ethics and research;</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>providing an opportunity to reflect critically on nursing ethics as a developing discipline;</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>anticipating and preparing for ethical challenges in health and social care research in a global context.</p>
</list-item>
</list>
</p>
<p>All of these aspects emerged over the two days from the presentations and the subsequent discussions that ensued – both formally and informally.</p>
<p>Towards the end of the Conference it was fitting that many of the values that had been discussed and highlighted over the two days were illustrated in the activities and achievements of the respective recipients of the Human Rights and Nursing Awards. These are presented annually in recognition of outstanding commitment to human rights and exemplifying the essence of nursing’s humanistic philosophy. On this occasion the presentations were made by the Vice-Chancellor of the University of Surrey, Professor Christopher Snowden. One award went jointly to Masitsela Mhlanga and Thabsile Dlamini from the Swaziland Nursing Association for their respective contributions over many years. The other went to Ana Luisa Aranha e Silva from the School of Nursing at the University of Sao Paulo, Brazil for her work in the field of mental health.</p>
<p>At the conclusion of the Conference it was announced that the 2012 ICNE Conference will be in Turkey, organized by Leyla Dinc and colleagues – details will be available soon.</p>
