<abstract>
<p>There has been little exploration of emotional labor in researching the learning of adults, and emotional labor on the part of research contractors has scarcely featured in published debates. The article explores the role of emotion in this context from a critical feminist perspective, drawing on life history data from a study of the learning biographies of more than 100 adults across the United Kingdom. The discussion is informed by analyses of data from interviews with Patricia (39) among a cohort of 30 participants who were interviewed as part of this study. The author first considers the ontological position of the article and critical feminist perspectives on women’s experiences of work. Second, the author examines the theory of emotional labor and the ongoing challenge of accounting for exploitative power relations in field work. Finally, the author suggests that the nexus of emotional labor and empathy/complicity in research is an area worthy of further investigation.</p>

<p>This article draws on the experience of working as a CRF<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0741713611402050">1</xref></sup> (Contract Research Fellow) in Learning Lives,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0741713611402050">2</xref></sup> an ESRC (U.K. Economic and Social Research Council) funded research project that used life history to study the learning of adults. Learning Lives was a large-scale project that aimed to deepen understanding of formal and informal learning and identify ways in which the learning of adults could be enhanced. Across the United Kingdom, data were gathered at four sites, each of which approached the research aim from a different perspective. The approach adopted at the institution where I was temporarily employed was through working lives.</p>
<p>The purpose of this article is to offer a critical exploration of emotional labor in field research from the perspective of a temporary and contingent worker. I describe exploitative relations that have continued to trouble me. Although the Learning Lives project had emancipatory aims, the role of the CRFs, on whose emotional labor the data collection in the project depended, remained underestimated and underanalyzed. I describe CRF emotional labor in qualitative data gathering and argue that its accomplishment in this context involves empathy and complicity. The nature of “acting” in emotional labor presents particular challenges for critical reflexivity that is a key resource in feminist writings.</p>
<p>In this article, I will first consider critical feminist perspectives on women’s roles in educational hierarchies and refer to debate about the role of emotion in education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0741713611402050">Ecclestone, Hayes, &amp; Furedi, 2005</xref>). Second, I will describe a Marxist feminist theory of emotional labor to operationalize a central concept of acting with emotion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0741713611402050">Hochschild, 1983</xref>). Third, I will develop this concept in a case study based on interviews with Patricia (39),<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0741713611402050">3</xref></sup> to examine conflictual experiences in researching women’s learning: I highlight the ongoing challenges of empathy and complicity. Finally, I suggest that critical feminist reflexivity is needed to support rich and nuanced understandings of emotion in field research. This is rendered more complex, however, because emotional labor challenges our capacities for criticality, making the nexus of emotional labor and empathy/complicity in field research an area worthy of further investigation.</p>

<title>Critical Feminist Perspectives</title>
<p>In this section, I will first consider the ontological position from which the article is written, drawing on feminist writing that critiques the status quo. I will then explore the role of subjectivity and emotion in education debates.</p>
<p>Hierarchical power relationships continue to position many women as “marginal citizens” in the academy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0741713611402050">Acker &amp; Dillabough, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0741713611402050">Olivier, in press</xref>). Some research has highlighted the way that domestic roles are recreated in universities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0741713611402050">Acker &amp; Dillabough, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0741713611402050">Thorn &amp; Hochschild, 1997</xref>), reinforcing women’s overrepresentation at the lower ends of educational hierarchies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0741713611402050">Quinn, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0741713611402050">Riddell &amp; Tett, 2006</xref>). Despite feminist engagement with the problem of women’s positioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0741713611402050">Cotterill &amp; Letherby, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0741713611402050">Grummell, Devine, &amp; Lynch, 2009</xref>), very little has been written from the perspective of those at the bottom end of these hierarchies. This means that problems arising from the marginal position of some academic staff, for example, CRFs who are outsiders in the research community, are neglected. Professional marginalization and the insecurity of being a contingent worker rarely enter academic debates. Many contract researchers in education are women, and in large research projects the emotional labor of these workers is essential to the writings of career academics. Despite this, the experiences of the CRF remain “shadow labour” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0741713611402050">Hochschild, 1983</xref>, p. 167). The CRF’s work is hidden, due in part to the need to move on at the end of a contract and the lack of (paid) opportunity to bring their insights into academic writing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0741713611402050">Wahlberg, Diment, Davies, Colley, &amp; Wheeler, 2004</xref>). The neglected perspective of the CRF is adopted in this article not as a narrative device, but as an arguably advantageous marginal standpoint (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0741713611402050">Wylie, 2004</xref>) that signals critical feminist engagement with the issues discussed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0741713611402050">Archer &amp; Leathwood, 2003</xref>, p. 231).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0741713611402050">4</xref></sup></p>

<title>Emotion in Adult Learning Debates</title>
<p>Although feminist writing has engaged with emotion and subjectivity in research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0741713611402050">Frith &amp; Kitzinger, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0741713611402050">Letherby, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0741713611402050">Ramsay, 1996</xref>), the role of emotional labor has not been explored in the working lives of academics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0741713611402050">David, 2004</xref>). It is acknowledged that constructions of subjectivity need to be accounted for as part of the epistemic positions from which research is written, but the handling of subjectivity and emotion presents challenges. Problems arise from the positioning of emotion within an individualized and confessional subjectivity. The view drawn on in this article is that the configuration of emotion as private and individual, rather than political and shared (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0741713611402050">Boler, 1999</xref>), makes it liable to exploitation.</p>
<p>Work that highlights these problems in adult learning policies identifies an unwelcome “therapeutic ethos” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0741713611402050">Ecclestone et al., 2005</xref>). In a critique of the potentially disempowering effect of emotion in post–compulsory education, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0741713611402050">Ecclestone et al. (2005)</xref> raise questions about the legitimacy of too much attention to emotion and of including emotional well-being as an educational aim. Pedagogies that account for the emotions of learners can be disempowering, focusing on learner vulnerability. According to this argument, a “diminished self” is a symptom of the growing interest in learners’ emotions, and therapeutic professionalism undermines possibilities for critical educational interventions, based on political insights. State intervention in the lives of learners and teachers is evidenced in “performativity” that sanctions interference in people’s lives, justified by the need to help groups of learners who are configured as “hard to reach,” emotionally illiterate, and vulnerable. Emotional well-being is seen as an easier educational goal than developing knowledge and skills, and there are dangers in essentializing particular social groups and ascribing to them particular emotional needs. The authors argue that in educational research, “such notions have created growing interest in methodologies based on life history, biography and narrative” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0741713611402050">Ecclestone et al., 2005</xref>, p. 187).</p>
<p>This debate about the place of emotion in education and the dangers of a depoliticization of pedagogies has continued in the United Kingdom (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0741713611402050">Hayes, 2010</xref>). Recent work critiques English school education policies that focus on children’s emotional well-being. The authors discern a move away from the aims of liberal education, to learning that is low on curriculum content, and creates “images of humans as emotional subjects who need an appropriately affective curriculum” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0741713611402050">Ecclestone &amp; Hayes, 2009</xref>, p. 379). These arguments point to concerns that underlie the analysis in this article: if we are experiencing a therapeutic turn in education then we need to subject the role of emotion to critical, sociopolitical analysis.</p>

<title>Perspectives on Emotional Labor</title>
<p>Although I have incorporated some analytical insights from psychoanalysis and ethnography to identify emotions in the research process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0741713611402050">Frith &amp; Kitzinger, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0741713611402050">Hoffmann, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0741713611402050">Rustin, 2003</xref>), I draw primarily on Hochschild’s theorization of emotional labor that locates it in the social world of shared interactions. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0741713611402050">Arlie Hochschild (1983)</xref> was the first to attempt to give a definition of emotional labor in workplaces in advanced Western societies. Although Hochschild is the originator of the concept and theory, her ideas have been taken up by many others in almost three decades, and alternative perspectives have emerged. There has been a plethora of writing, and the diversity of responses to emotional labor is considerable (see, e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0741713611402050">Colley, 2006</xref>;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0741713611402050">Hughes, 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0741713611402050">2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0741713611402050">Price, 2001</xref>). Some psychoanalytical writings are sympathetic to Hochschild’s ideas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0741713611402050">Mazhinder, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0741713611402050">Rustin, 2003</xref>), as is some writing in the fields of education and social welfare (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0741713611402050">Avis &amp; Bathmaker, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0741713611402050">Gunaratnam &amp; Lewis, 2001</xref>). Other authors, for example, in work and organization studies, critique the notion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0741713611402050">Hughes, 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0741713611402050">2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0741713611402050">Payne, 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0741713611402050">2009</xref>), perceiving the idea of emotional labor to be disempowering. They identify a one-dimensional depiction of workers as passive subjects who suffer alienation as a result of the demands made. They argue that workers have agency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0741713611402050">Payne, 2006</xref>), contribute to, as well as reflect, the circumstances of their employment and are not passive subjects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0741713611402050">Hughes, 2005</xref>) who follow an imposed managerial agenda.</p>
<p>Much criticism has focused on the idea that Hochschild has portrayed emotional labor in terms that are too negative. Recently, she has acknowledged this and emphasized that emotional labor is not always a bad experience, but one that is underrewarded and underrecognized by employers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0741713611402050">Hochschild, 2010</xref>). In fact, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0741713611402050">Hochschild (1983)</xref> stated in her original study that emotional labor can be satisfying. This has been further explored in studies of caregivers, for example, which found that workers go beyond contracted obligations and retain a sense of control over the “bounded emotionality” they perform in their work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0741713611402050">Ashforth &amp; Tomiuk, 2000</xref>). There is a balance to be struck between the need for criticism of work conditions and avoiding negative interpretations of workers as victims who lack agency. Work conditions in the knowledge economy are complex, requiring scrutiny, and the social and economic conditions in which work is framed are a key aspect of this and of emotional labor: it is these that Hochschild criticizes.</p>
<p>Others have drawn on the criticality of Hochschild’s theory, focusing on the problem of commodifying emotions and recommending emotional labor theory as the basis for developing a more detailed understanding of work interactions. Poynter, for example, has linked emotional labor to structural inequalities between the worker and “the object of her/his emotions, usually the customer”(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0741713611402050">Poynter, 2002</xref>, p. 250). He describes how health service workers are subject to the “evaluation of the enactment of emotional labour,” linked to the “quantification of the patient’s or client’s experience of it” (p. 256). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0741713611402050">Helen Colley’s (2006)</xref> study of the emotional labor of trainee nursery nurses focuses on the embedding of emotion in a work/learning context and distinguishes different forms of emotion work. She points out that emotional labor is not intrinsic but socially constituted in social and economic conditions: It is the worker and not the client or pupil who performs it. She highlights the specific nature of Hochschild’s definition of emotional labor, emphasizing that the power relations that frame emotional labor are essential to Hochschild’s critique.</p>
<p>Marxist feminist analysis is central to Hochschild’s theory of emotional labor, connecting it closely to the position of the person who undertakes it and making it particularly relevant to the work performance of low-status individuals. The fact that emotional labor has been associated mainly with women’s work has been attributed to women’s weaker status and the notion that they have an important role in enhancing the well-being of others. Other research has suggested that when men perform emotional labor they lose status and earnings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0741713611402050">Bhave &amp; Glomb, 2009</xref>). I now turn to the theory of emotional labor that underpins the subsequent analysis of field data.</p>

<title>Hochschild’s Theory of Emotional Labor</title>
<p>By positioning my analysis within institutional relationships, I seek to move the account of emotion in work and learning from the personal to “collective and collaborative terrain” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0741713611402050">Boler, 1999</xref>, p. 6) that is public and political as well as private and individual, positioning emotional labor as a social process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0741713611402050">James, 1989</xref>), influenced by social conditions. I will now review the main conceptualization of emotional labor that informs the subsequent data analysis and discussion.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0741713611402050">Hochschild’s (1983)</xref> insights are based on the idea that emotion has replaced traditional structures and norms that guide our actions in the workplace. Through empirical research with university students, flight attendants, and debt collectors, she developed her theory of emotional labor, proceeding from an emancipatory standpoint in relation to the position of women and from a critical view of exploitative employment practices.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0741713611402050">Hochschild (1983</xref>, p. 147) defines emotional labor as work that</p>

</list>
<p>The problem that Hochschild identifies is the exploitative nature of emotional labor in capitalist and patriarchal conditions of employment where the private emotions of individual employees are placed at the disposal of organizations and contribute to their profits.</p>
<sec id="section5-0741713611402050">
<title>The Private Emotion System and Feeling Rules</title>
<p>Hochschild emphasizes the workings of human emotions as a private emotion system, describing how we use it in our personal interactions with those around us. Feelings are a contribution to the social group surrounding the individual, part of an “arofa” or “gift exchange.” The private emotion system is drawn from our social interaction and is subject to wider societal influences that are structural and material. Within the private emotion system, “feeling rules” regulate emotional interactions, as “standards used in emotional conversation to determine what is rightly owed and owing in the currency of feeling” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0741713611402050">Hochschild, 1983</xref>, p. 18). Through feeling rules we tell what is due in each relation, as part of the natural emotional giving between individuals or the individual and the group. “Feeling rules are what guide emotion work by establishing the sense of entitlement or obligation” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0741713611402050">Hochschild, 1983</xref>, p. 56).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0741713611402050">
<title>Transmutation of Private Emotion for Commercial Gain</title>
<p>The exploitative nature of emotional labor arises when the private emotion system is placed at the disposal of employers in capitalist conditions of production. Through a process of “transmutation,” the private, internal system of emotion becomes a commodity that underpins work-based communication. Transmutation happens when emotion, feeling rules, and social exchange move from the private to the public domain and are supervised for payment. Transmutation is vital to the quality and success of emotional labor. It is the transmutation of the private emotion system and the use of emotions for commercial gain that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0741713611402050">Hochschild (1983)</xref> finds dangerous:
<disp-quote>
<p>What is new in our time is an increasingly prevalent instrumental stance toward our native capacity to play . . . upon a range of feelings for a private purpose and the way in which that stance is engineered and administered by large organisations. (p. 20)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0741713611402050">Hochschild (1983)</xref> sees emotion being “stretched into standardized forms” (p. 13), in bureaucratized control of work processes, transforming its private use into emotional labor that contributes to profits. The results of transmutation are seen in the nature of emotional labor carried out by workers whose performances are judged “by the state of people’s [customer’s] feelings” (p. 154). Feeling rules are no longer at the discretion of the worker, but are laid down, and a system of gift exchange that has been in the private domain is “thrust into a commercial setting” (p. 119).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0741713611402050">
<title>Deep and Surface Acting</title>
<p>Feeling rules encompass the “display function” of emotion that consists in the need to display the appropriate emotion to make our interactions with others meaningful and to support communication. To maintain smooth communication in our private and personal interactions we show appropriate displays of empathy, sadness, or pleasure in different situations. The display function of emotion is taken as “a clue to the operating truth” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0741713611402050">Hochschild, 1983</xref>, p. 33) and is exploited as part of the commercialization of feeling. To describe this exploitation, Hochschild uses the metaphor of the place of employment as a “stage” on which we as employees are actors. Hochschild goes on to describe emotional labor using theories of acting. One way that we manage our feelings is by a process of “deep” acting, which draws on strong empathy, on fully experiencing the role and being able to improvise. Surface acting relies on the actor having some distance to the role, but being able to perform it with great attention to detail and artistic finish. Although deep acting requires actors to experience their roles, surface acting means representing them. Although surface acting relies on the body and gesture to convey emotion, deep acting can be produced in two ways: “by directly exhorting feeling” or “making indirect use of a trained imagination” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0741713611402050">Hochschild, 1983</xref>, p. 36). How we work with deep and surface acting is part of our identity and the natural internal “signal function” of emotions, which is controlled in deep acting. Hochschild believes we search for a central self, but in either deep or surface acting, the actor may separate what it takes to act from the idea of a central self.</p>
<p>Hochschild argues that in Western industrialized economies, organizations and institutions provide “framing” to communicate to workers how they are to feel and act. The extent to which emotion management involves emotional labor is a function of the level of influence that an employer has over how workers’ emotions are managed: the greater the control exercised by the employer, the greater the emotional labor required of the employee. The way a person relates to her feelings changes when “private capacities for empathy and warmth are put to corporate use” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0741713611402050">Hochschild, 1983</xref>, p. 89). When the natural display function is at the disposal of the employer, workers can become estranged from their emotions, with detrimental effects. The gift exchange becomes a commodity and through overuse, strain leads to emotive dissonance. Hochschild argues that in deep acting we deceive ourselves as much as the object of our emotional labor, and “by pretending deeply we alter ourselves” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0741713611402050">Hochschild, 1983</xref>, p. 33). Hochschild found that workers took pride in the performance of emotional labor, and its successful use was satisfying. However, when it was overused, or when the transmutation did not succeed (when the worker was not satisfied with their performance), then stress could result.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0741713611402050">
<title>Gendered Emotional Labor</title>
<p>The social positioning of women that has subordinated them to men and consequently required more emotion management from them is integral to Hochschild’s theory. Women do more emotional labor than men because women have less access to money, power, and status. It is a symptom of women’s low status that they have had to be better actors. Skills of deep acting have brought gains for women. However, in characterizations of women as innately caring, the skills involved in good emotion management have been “mislabelled as ‘natural,’ as part of woman’s ‘being’ rather than something of her own making” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0741713611402050">Hochschild, 1983</xref>, p. 167). Women trade emotion management for economic support, and marriage involves some external exchange of services. For example, one partner fixes the car and one does laundry. The partner who has the lower status, traditionally, has to contribute more, and having a higher status allows greater rewards, including emotional rewards, to be claimed. Attentive listening and appreciative behavior come to seem “normal, even built into personality rather than inherent in the kinds of exchange that low-status people commonly enter into” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0741713611402050">Hochschild, 1983</xref>, pp. 84-85).</p>

<title>Limitations of Hochschild’s Theory of Emotional Labor: Critical Feminist Perspective</title>
<p>In critiques of dominant social relations and social inequalities, critical feminist approaches increasingly emphasize the intersection of race and class alongside gender (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0741713611402050">Jackson, Malcolm, &amp; Thomas, 2011</xref>). The interaction of gender and other forms of oppression does not emerge in Hochschild’s original theory. Hochschild writes that emotional labor is performed mainly by middle classes because working classes work with things and middle classes work with people. In the private emotion system, working class families are more positional and middle class families more personal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0741713611402050">Hochschild, 1983</xref>, p. 156). To say that the feelings of working class people count less—“your feelings don’t count because you aren’t (or won’t be) considered important by others” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0741713611402050">Hochschild, 1983</xref>, p. 159)—reflects the experience of many people who are excluded because of their race, gender or sexuality, as well as class. However, Hochschild does not bring these together and there is a normative aspect of the way class experience is conceptualized. Hochschild identified bricklayers, plumbers, and chambermaids as working class professions who do not need to perform emotional labor. However, working classes have always used emotions in roles as shop assistants and domestic servants, so the characterization of emotional labor as predominantly middle class does not seem accurate. In the new economy, working class people perform emotional labor, particularly in paraprofessional roles as basic-grade nurses or care assistants.</p>
<p>From a reading of literature on emotional labor, I was able to draw on tools for analysis of my work as a CRF. I found that emotional labor was performed in the detailed activity of co-constructing a life, of asking, listening to, and reflecting back the emotions of the interviewee. Although some of the experience described below could occur in any research, I found that the depth of empathy and the extended length and number of interviews made life history a more probable context for emotional labor than some other qualitative approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0741713611402050">Malcolm, in press</xref>).</p>

<title>Emotional Labor in the Field: Emancipatory or Complicit?</title>
<p>I conducted interviews over a period of 16 months before I left Learning Lives to take up another temporary academic post in the same university department (I have since moved to another institution). The interviews lasted around 1½ to 2 hours, and all interviews were recorded, transcribed, and checked by the interviewees. The sample consisted of 19 women and 11 men whom I recruited from a range of workplaces. As CRF, I had responsibility for the recruitment of the sample whose selection I discussed with the principal investigator. I was also responsible for data gathering. Within our theme of work and learning, I argued in favor of a broad definition of work to include that which did not involve paid employment. To find out about the experiences of women who face social exclusion, I made contacts in a part of the city where I was born, where members of my family lived and which, according to a range of indicators over the past 40years, has some of the worst social and economic deprivation in Europe. Here I recruited interviewees from a community project aimed at (women) single parents who wished to enter the employment market.</p>
<p>The data drawn on for this paper included interview transcripts, interview summaries, and my own field notes. In the analysis that follows, I draw on all these sources of data to examine emotional labor in the research field. I will, first, illustrate empathetic emotional labor that involved deep acting and controlling the display of emotion. I will describe my sense of empathy and complicity, among the complex feelings that emotional labor entailed. Second, I will describe how the process of understanding the data and of assimilating what I had heard involved sensemaking and self-critique.</p>
<sec id="section11-0741713611402050">
<title>Deep Acting in Life History Interviewing</title>
<p>In the Learning Lives project, research briefings and team meetings were the mechanisms through which details of the method to be deployed in the research were explained. A key requirement, for example, was that the CRF speak as little as possible during the first interview, minimizing contributions to reduce interference with the life story and encourage the interviewee to speak freely. With some of the interviewees this was effective. However, there were some who found it difficult to talk for an extended period. To facilitate the flow of the narration, I had to create a particular atmosphere and mood, entailing a deep engagement with interviewees. To do this, I had to read signals from the interviewee and keep my emotional display appropriate. I used a range of emotions to respond empathetically when an interviewee recounted something funny, or explained a bad experience, for example. This sometimes involved concealing a response to the interviewee: holding back emotion or displaying tacit agreement that I did not necessarily feel. As I will describe, this had implications for my sense of myself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0741713611402050">Kreber, 2010</xref>) and feelings of complicity.</p>
<p>I met Patricia Carr through community workers who operated in partnership with a Further Education college. Education programs brought people into learning and from there into employment. From meeting participants in classes at college, I was able to recruit a small cohort of interviewees: The voluntary nature of the participation was emphasized and participants could withdraw from the project at any point. Patricia was nearing the end of a first stage program. She thought the program had made a difference to her life and she wanted to talk about this. Hearing Patricia’s story was a great privilege. However, at times it was challenging for both of us. When I say that the interviews were challenging for me, I am describing my experience of a form of emotional labor that is largely unaccounted for in published research. I do not suggest that my discomfort can be put on a par with the life experiences that Patricia recounted, that affected her learning and her confidence, and in the face of which she showed amazing resilience and determination in wanting her story to be heard:
<disp-quote>
<p>I interviewed Patricia in a small windowless room in the college. As a child, her learning was affected by absences from school to undertake domestic duties of cooking, cleaning, and looking after younger children. Her home life was violent and this affected her ability to concentrate at school. In an IQ test she had the second highest score among the girls in her class. Despite obstacles Patricia left school at 15, having obtained three O-levels. She has had a number of periods of formal learning since school. . . . She became pregnant and married at the age of 18 and a few years later had another baby to her [first] husband who was abusive. (Patricia Carr, summary of interviews)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The prescribed method of remaining silent in the first interview was not working and my silences seemed to make Patricia feel uncomfortable. She had told her life story in barely a minute: I had to engage in deep acting and empathetic display to encourage her to tell me more. My empathy with Patricia was genuine. However, the emancipatory aims of the project were not uppermost at that point, and my own position was equivocal: On the one hand, I was supporting Patricia’s wish to give voice to her views and experience, on the other I was being paid to gather data and meet particular requirements of the research project:</p>
<speech>
<speaker>IM<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0741713611402050">5</xref>:</speaker>
<p>What if we go back and just talk in a wee bit more depth about, you know, you started off with your primary school and you’re in the middle of the five so there’s two older than you and two younger.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>PC:</speaker>
<p>Two younger that’s right.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>IM:</speaker>
<p>What about . . . you know your early family experiences? (Interview 1, p. 2)</p>
</speech>
<p>Patricia’s motivation to take part in the project arose from the fact that by anyone’s standards she was a successful learner. Learning had made a difference to her life and she wanted her views on this to be heard. She had already gained qualifications in Psychology, English, and Math; had started Intermediate 2 Communications and Math (equivalent to a high-grade GCSE or AS-level qualification in other parts of the United Kingdom); was taking the European Computer Driving License and a First Aid certificate. By the second interview, she spoke more freely, describing her informal learning. Here Patricia talked about how she developed her understandings of political and social events, without being able to express these in her marital home and at a time when her social interactions were restricted:</p>
<speech>
<speaker>PC:</speaker>
<p>I learned to kind of suppress my opinions although I disagreed with him [Patricia’s first husband]. I had to just it was either black or white and I had to take it if he said black it was black, so I always had to kind of have like control over my opinions and I had to see his way of thinking, his way of doing things, if I’m stupid I was to accept I was stupid. It was like a kind of . . . as if he was brainwashing me now when I can look back and then it was just I was stupid if I had an opinion although it probably was more right than his.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>IM:</speaker>
<p>Yeah uh huh just how do you think your own opinions were emerging . . .</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>PC:</speaker>
<p>I wouldn’t be able to voice my opinion on politics at that time if it was like government or was Mrs. Thatcher right in what she was doing in certain things at that time, I was scared to say anything. (Interview 2, p. 2)</p>
</speech>
<p>Patricia went on to talk about her views of Mrs. Thatcher: How she admired some of her leadership qualities but had disagreed with her policies.</p>
<p>The process of documenting Patricia’s life story involved emotional labor to retain my stance as a researcher, conscious of the precepts of the method, and to control my reactions to Patricia’s story, by suppressing emotions such as sadness or enthusiasm. The excerpts illustrate that by speaking I departed from the prescribed interview approach that had been given much emphasis in the research briefing for CRFs. However, I did not consciously subvert it. Rather, I sought the best way to fulfill the overall brief to collect a certain quantity of data and meet targets for the number of interviews to be completed. What I experienced as my own complex position was compounded by a perception that while the project had emancipatory aims, these, if achieved, may not necessarily be of immediate benefit to Patricia. However, deep acting in emotional labor also meant that I controlled these concerns, “deceiving” myself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0741713611402050">Hochschild, 1983</xref>, p. 33) and placing my ethics of care in tension with the performative requirements of my role.</p>
<p>Although my position in the field was paradoxical, and gave rise to conflictual feelings, nonetheless I developed emotional labor and deep acting, behaving as a “good” researcher. As the interviews unfolded, my facility for emotional labor developed, and I reflected back to Patricia what she said, showing interest and endorsement. Speaking of an occasion when she sought refuge at her sister’s house, Patricia said,</p>
<speech>
<speaker>PC:</speaker>
<p>. . . she [Patricia’s sister] didn’t really want me but in a way it made me stronger, ‘cause it made me react on, go and do it [leave husband], or you’re going to end up dead and I obviously think I would have been if I’d stayed in the relationship, it would have got worse because the violence was escalating.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>IM:</speaker>
<p>It was escalating.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>PC:</speaker>
<p>Uh huh because . . . (Interview 2, p. 8)</p>
</speech>
<p>Although I was deeply in the role of empathetic “friend,” I was not Patricia’s friend and, unlike some interviewees, Patricia never asked me anything about myself; I did not share much personal information with her and I am not sure that she knew that I was from the same part of town.</p>
<p>Patricia’s aims changed over the time of the interviews. Initially her goal was to enter the workplace as soon as possible, but by the third interview she had formulated the ambition to study for a nursing degree at university. Speaking of the application process, she said,</p>
<speech>
<speaker>PC:</speaker>
<p>I’ve got, looking into psychology and there was something else on it [the entry criteria] I’ve got, so they said they possibly could put me in at the second level and then after the second level it’s HND [second year of a UK university degree] and then that gets you into university. (Interview 3, p. 4)</p>
</speech>
<p>Patricia explained her ambition, which appeared, at the same time, to be an emancipatory and gendered choice. Patricia described this, first, as part of her aim to have a recognized position:
<disp-quote>
<p>I think so ‘cause it would be like a recognised position . . . knowing I didn’t want to work in supermarkets and I knew somehow I was a bit better, feel better doing something more fulfilling, more like qualifications behind it, a recognised job. (Interview 3, p. 4)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Second, it was an opportunity to draw on the gendered experience of caring for her brother who had complex health problems. Her role as a carer gave her a sense of an ability that she could build on to get paid employment:</p>
<speech>
<speaker>PC:</speaker>
<p>Like a hands-on experience.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>IM:</speaker>
<p>Uh huh and I mean learning how to deal with diabetes and how to get it stable . . . all that kind of thing and that’s what’s leading you to think nursing?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>PC:</speaker>
<p>Uh huh that is what’s leading me towards that, you know, I care for him and I have got a caring nature, so maybe I’d be better off in that kind of field [nursing]. (Interview 3, p. 6)</p>
</speech>
<p>However, the work of caring and emotion management, which extended to other members of Patricia’s family, was in tension with her ambitions. Patricia cared for the needs of the others, and while this was experience that she could draw on to enter a recognized profession, it sometimes detracted from her achievement of this aim. There were five others in Patricia’s household for whom she did all the domestic work. She described how the need to do this work took time away from her studies:</p>
<speech>
<speaker>IM:</speaker>
<p>That’s a lot of people and there’s all the washing . . .</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>PC:</speaker>
<p>Ay the washing and the ironing and putting it away.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>IM:</speaker>
<p>And the cooking?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>PC:</speaker>
<p>And the cooking for them, I don’t mind doing the cooking because it’s a pleasure to see them enjoying it . . . , but some certain things like they can’t lift a cup off the table to put away . . . (Interview 3, p. 8)</p>
</speech>
<p>Patricia’s experience of her domestic and caring role, “[I] feel I’m more responsible than my mother to him [her brother] . . .” (Interview 3, p. 5) highlighted the way, “The world turns to women for mothering, and this fact silently attaches itself to many a job description” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0741713611402050">Hochschild, 1983</xref>, p. 170): Although Patricia’s role in doing all the caring and domestic work in her household was oppressive, she talked about a strategy for encouraging her family to do more and said they were now responding to this because she had talked to them about her ambition to go to university. When I asked Patricia if she felt that she had the family support she needed to do a university degree, she said, “Not really, but it’s for me to change that” (Interview 3, p. 15). The gendered experience that informed Patricia’s ambitions was also part of my own domestic role as CRF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0741713611402050">Thorn &amp; Hochschild, 1997</xref>) and emotional laborer.</p>
<p>I found that I used emotional labor to manage my responses to Patricia’s story in a tension with what I had been briefed to expect as a “good” researcher (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0741713611402050">Mazhinder, 2003</xref>). Without the use of deep acting, showing empathy, and experiencing myself in the role as a “friend,” it would have been difficult to talk to Patricia about her experiences. However, as an emotional laborer who drew on deep acting, my critical perspective on our interactions and their effect, whether emancipatory or not, was suppressed. When the acting stopped, and I was away from the research field I began to be able to reflect on the experience.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0741713611402050">
<title>Criticality and Analysis</title>
<p>Assimilating the experience of qualitative interviewing has an emotional impact on the researcher. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0741713611402050">Letherby (2003)</xref> quotes Scott (1998) who recounts sleepwalking as part of a somatic response that she connected with understanding her data. I found that reflection was marked by emotion work that continued when the recorder was switched off, as I sought to make sense of the data, in an assimilation process that involved emotion and memory. There was an affective dimension in my analysis, since reading the text recalled lived experience and the recollection of emotional labor. Depending on the nature of the data, the phase after an interview involved a need to “offload” what I had heard.</p>
<p>I used field notes not only as part of data analysis, but also to record conflictual feelings:
<disp-quote>
<p>Although I’ve had reservations about the ethnographer as a person trying to get her head round how other people, [who are socially excluded] can possibly survive, I’m finding that I’m not an onlooker crouched in the corner. (Field notes, p. 1)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>After the interviews, I dreamt about the stories I had heard, which was a way of assimilating the experiences. The self-critique connected to my complex and conflictual role—seeming an empathetic friend, yet needing to mine data—emerged in some of the field notes and is reflected here in the tone adopted in my field diary:
<disp-quote>
<p>I am a collector of stories that permeate my mind.</p>
<p>Floating in my detergent and now flapping in the wind.</p>
<p>I take your tales and pin them</p>
<p>Up on my washing-line, neatly—a yellow peg at each careful corner.</p>
<p>I stand back to admire. (Field notes, written after Interview 2 with Patricia)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This note expressed my sense of a feminized and domesticated role as CRF, my implicit need to “care” for the research participants while engaging with them through my emotional labor, then writing up neat research summaries of their lives and learning for others to read, washing their stories to make them “clean and neat” and presentable as data. This role of the good researcher was in tension with the lived experience of the research encounter, which was marked by a sense of complicity, with broad research aims that may not be of immediate benefit to the participant. The tension around my own use of empathy/complicity and my identity as researcher/friend remained unresolved.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-0741713611402050">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>I will now explore how researchers might respond to the dilemmas of empathetic and complicit emotional labor in field encounters. First, I will discuss the relative significance of the low-status position of the CRF. This is significant to the sociopolitical contextualization that is an important aspect of Hochschild’s theory of emotional labor. Then I will discuss some implications of feminist critical reflexivity as a response to emotional labor in the research process.</p>
<p>Although I have written from the perspective of my experience as a CRF, I am aware of the circulation of power in my own argument in claiming this position as a marginal, oppositional voice. It is certain that aspects of the experience described here will apply to other researchers who have more secure positions, or who are career academics. For the CRF, the activity of field work is directly connected to contractual relations and payment. Field research is a major part of CRF activity and not part of a wider remit as is the case for many career academics. The contractual framing of the temporary researcher’s work is crucial to the form of emotional labor that she performs, locating her in a transitional space where her work is regulated. In a discussion of Hochschild’s theory, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0741713611402050">Poynter (2002)</xref> draws on his own research with health workers to underline the link between the levels of dissonance that the worker experiences and levels of discretion in work. In U.K. higher education, the CRF has less discretion than a permanent member of staff who may have been involved in the development stages of the research proposal.</p>
<sec id="section14-0741713611402050">
<title>Critical Reflexivity and Emotion</title>
<p>Discussion of emotional labor in qualitative research underlines the methodological complexity of subjectivities in data gathering and challenges our handling of reflexivity and power. To introduce reciprocity in the research relationship some researchers invoke reflexivity as an antidote to relations that are “obscured,” where we “strain to white out Self” (Fine, 1994, p. 72, quoted in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0741713611402050">Goodson &amp; Sikes, 2001</xref>, pp. 15-16). Although there is much discussion about how reflexivity can be handled in the research relationship, details of field encounters and research engagement in education are sometimes seen as relying on “idiosyncratic personal dynamics” (Sikes et al., 1996, in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0741713611402050">Goodson &amp; Sikes 2001</xref>, p. 19). In this view of qualitative research, emotions are seen as not susceptible to sociocultural analysis. In life history this treatment configures emotion in commonsense understandings, whereas the complexities of its role in field research remain underexplored. This, in turn, leads to the neglect of the impact of emotion and lived experience in data analysis, with little “investigation and understanding of the emotional side of reflection as an intellectual activity” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0741713611402050">Mazhinder, 2003</xref>, p. 249).</p>
<p>The use of emotion to “induce” talk that reveals the interviewees’ deeper thoughts in probing (see above: <italic>And the cooking?</italic>) raises two problems: first, that an ethic of care or empathy can slip easily into self-righteousness, and second, care and manipulation are not mutually exclusive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0741713611402050">Koehn, 1998</xref>). Displays of emotion can be difficult: At times the researcher may feel she is “holidaying on people’s ‘misery’ and then leaving the respondent to deal with the consequences alone while she goes off with what she came for” (McRobbie, 1982, in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0741713611402050">Letherby, 2003</xref>, p. 111). A nuanced and critical reflexivity is needed to take account of the shift from the researcher’s experience of emotion in the field, to its role in understanding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0741713611402050">Lee-Treweek &amp; Linkogle, 2000</xref>) and its wider implications in power relations. Some feminists highlight problems for reflexivity as an area of ongoing challenges. These are compounded when emotions are positioned as private and individual. In these conditions, reflexivity may encourage researchers to work on themselves as “the site of ‘participation’ in research—reducing and limiting . . . their interventions so as not only to include their subjectivity but even to confine themselves to this” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0741713611402050">Burman, 2006</xref>, p. 316). “Confessional,” rather than “critical” reflexivity, may not produce new research insights, but take power from the participant on whose behalf the researcher presumes to speak. The danger is that reflexivity becomes a “‘new technology’ of subjectivity that normalises some subjective accounts and pathologises and silences others” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0741713611402050">Burman, 2006</xref>, p. 324). Ignoring the sociopolitical and contextual demands that underlie the research and focusing on the identity of the researcher implies that the account is “prior and inner rather than performatively constituted” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0741713611402050">Burman, 2006</xref>, p. 323): Such confessional reflexivity reifies emotion and reduces contextual issues to personal ones.</p>
<p>The presence of emotional labor in the research process raises further important issues about the academic means of production and how research insights in adult learning are obtained. Although the type of critical reflexivity advocated by Burman seems particularly appropriate to underpin our understandings of emotion in research, the nature of acting in emotional labor also challenges our criticality. One important but neglected question is how critical reflexivity can be sustained when qualitative research involves deep acting, or how a feminist ethics of care can be assured when researchers need to pretend deeply. Altering ourselves through deep acting challenges our capacity for critical reflexivity, creating a tension between empathy, criticality, and our own complicity in the way power is used. The tensions identified between ethics of care and performative demands placed on other education professionals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0741713611402050">Avis &amp; Bathmaker, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0741713611402050">Ball, 2003</xref>) have not been analyzed in the working life of the researcher.</p>
<p>A critical handling of emotion and further analysis of the uses of emotional labor are essential to critique discourses that claim to be objective and rational (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0741713611402050">Ball, 2003</xref>), particularly in research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0741713611402050">Walford, 1991</xref>). Locating emotion in a shared terrain of interaction, and not just in individualized experience, emphasizes the context of wider sociopolitical influences that affect our uses of emotion. Emotional labor and the affective dimension of researching adults’ learning are linked to the classed, gendered, and racialized nature of experience.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>It is always easier to critique than to change the status quo.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0741713611402050">6</xref></sup> Changing research relationships to make them more transparent and open to analysis may begin with the recognition and theorization of emotional labor and consideration of marginal experience and shadow working in the academy. This may bring the context of how data are obtained into the mainstream of our considerations, influencing the status quo and changing how research is perceived and rewarded.</p>
<p>I have argued in favor of a critical feminist approach to the role of emotion as socially embedded in the research process and relevant to discussions of researching the learning of adults. I have emphasized the contribution that can be made by feminist understandings of critical, rather than confessional, reflexivity, locating emotions beyond the public/private dichotomy in the sociopolitical sphere of shared experience. Although emotions are important, their emergence is complex and requires ongoing critical engagement to develop strategies that can avoid recognizing some emotional responses and suppressing others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0741713611402050">Perri 6, 2002</xref>). By the end of the interviews, Patricia had submitted two applications to university courses for nursing. This would indicate her involvement in Learning Lives, and sharing her life history was not necessarily a disempowering experience. However, a nuanced analysis is needed of how emotion is used as part of researching adults’ learning, in the nexus of emotional labor, empathy/complicity, and critical reflection.</p>
<p>In this article, I have shown how emotional labor is used as the researcher elicits data, within a particular contextual framing of contingent, women’s academic labor in adult learning research. Although individual stories in the data spoke of power, class, and gender, they were mirrored in the situation of the researcher as I worked between my own ethics of care, the identity of the interviewee, and the requirements of the research project where others took charge of the meanings in data that I labored to produce. It is important to make sense of empathy and complicity in the field experience. Critical self-reflection in adult learning research continues to present challenges: a critical response requires attention to emotion and consideration of exploitative interactions at work and in research relations. These issues are worthy of further investigation in considering how we obtain research insights into the way adults learn.</p>

<label>1.</label><p>The Contract Research Fellow role is significant in U.K. higher education. As elsewhere, it is important for career academics at U.K. universities to obtain external research funding. CRFs are recruited on a temporary basis to work (usually) on data gathering in specific projects, and their salary overheads are costed into the budgets of research proposals. At the end of the research project (or when all the data have been gathered), the CRF has to reenter the job market and look for a new project. Sometimes a CRF is able to make the transition to permanent member of staff in the department where she or he has been working. However, this is dependent on a job being available and is subject to open competition; many low-level lecturer posts are also temporary.</p>
