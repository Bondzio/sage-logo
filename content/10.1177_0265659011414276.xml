<abstract>
<p>The impact of specific language impairment (SLI) on the acquisition of literacy and numeracy skills has been well researched. In contrast little has been written on its impact on the third core subject in the National Curriculum (NC) of science and this article describes a preliminary investigation into the scientific reasoning skills of children with SLI in comparison with those of typically developing (TD) children. In individual assessment sessions 11 pairs of target children with SLI and control TD children in the Key Stage (KS) 2 age span (ages 7–11 years) undertook a series of scientific reasoning tasks appropriate to their age involving receptive and expressive language skills. The children with SLI had for the most part significantly more difficulty with expressive language tasks (ELTs) than the TD children, in spite of the provision of scaffolding, and there was some evidence that they also had greater difficulty with the production of causal connectives, e.g. <italic>because, so</italic>. However, there was no difference between the two groups on receptive language tasks (RLTs) when scaffolding was used. Some possible implications for pedagogy are considered in light of these findings, and problems in matching children with SLI and TD controls are discussed.</p>

<title>I Background</title>
<p>The core subjects of the National Curriculum (NC) in England are English, maths and science; each of these subjects require a high level of language skills (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0265659011414276">Dockrell et al., 2007</xref>) and they make increasing linguistic demands on children as they get older (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0265659011414276">Knox, 2002</xref>). Longitudinal studies of children with specific language impairment (SLI) have found that they perform less well than their TD peers in the core subjects in KS 2 and 3 SATs and at GCSE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0265659011414276">Conti-Ramsden et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0265659011414276">2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0265659011414276">Dockrell et al., 2007</xref>), although they achieve better in science than in English and maths, a finding that these authors do not discuss in detail. A link between SLI and literacy difficulties has, in fact, been the subject of considerable research (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0265659011414276">Glogowska et al., 2006</xref>) and also a link with numeracy difficulties (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0265659011414276">Donlan et al., 2007</xref>), so it is not surprising that children with SLI achieve poorly in public tests in English and maths. However, there is a dearth of literature on any link between SLI and achievement in science, and researchers may be assuming that the visual and practical nature of science makes it a more accessible curriculum area. Nevertheless, the language of science is difficult even for TD children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0265659011414276">Wellington and Osborne, 2001</xref>), and it is therefore an omission not to investigate the competence of children with SLI when performing scientific reasoning tasks.</p>
<sec id="section2-0265659011414276">
<title>1 Research on scientific reasoning skills</title>
<p>Scientific thinking, or reasoning, was described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0265659011414276">Fisher (2005)</xref> as information gathering, questioning, testing ideas and hypothesizing, which involve much technical vocabulary and abstract language. It is therefore of interest in the context of children with SLI that a theme emerging from the literature on the development of scientific reasoning is the use which can be made of visual processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0265659011414276">Lawson, 2004</xref>) or spatial skills (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0265659011414276">Watters and English, 1995</xref>). This suggests that these children may benefit from the visual or spatial presentation of information where possible to aid their understanding. Additionally, the literature provides many examples of the advantages of scaffolding even for TD children, e.g. giving additional prompts to children so that their scientific reasoning skills are boosted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0265659011414276">Kuhn and Phelps, 1982</xref>) and providing increased practice with making predictions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0265659011414276">Keselman, 2003</xref>). These themes are taken up later in the research aims for the current study.</p>
<sec id="section3-0265659011414276">
<title>2 The language of science</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0265659011414276">Fang (2005)</xref> cited three ways in which the language of science causes students difficulties:</p>
<list id="list1-0265659011414276" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Lexical density, referring to the high density of information that can be given by a comparatively small number of words, e.g. ‘Asthma is a disorder in which the respiratory passages narrow significantly’;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Nominalization, where verbs and adjectives expressing concrete ideas are turned into abstract nouns, e.g. ‘how quickly cracks in glass grow’ becomes ‘glass crack growth rate’; and</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Technicalizing, i.e. the extensive use of technical terms.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Additionally, scientific vocabulary can cause confusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0265659011414276">Wellington and Osborne, 2001</xref>) because words might be unique to science (e.g. ‘cathode’) or they might have both scientific and everyday meanings (e.g. ‘energy’).</p>
<p>Very relevant to the difficulties of scientific language is research on the use of logical connectives by secondary school pupils in science. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0265659011414276">Gardner (1977)</xref> collected information from Australian pupils aged 11–15 in order to assess their understanding of logical connectives that link together two propositions, e.g. ‘moreover’, ‘consequently’. He reported that, at best, fewer than 70% of pupils used the logical connectives correctly and they found the more frequently occurring connectives easier, which led him to predict that their comprehension of the unfamiliar logical connectives would improve if they were exposed to them more often.</p>
<p>A similar finding was reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0265659011414276">Byrne et al. (1994)</xref>, who studied Year 9 pupils in an English comprehensive school. The results indicated that most of the 14–15-year-olds could reason logically in non-language-dependent situations, but many of them had difficulty with using logical connectives and so did less well in the language dependent situations. They also performed less well in scientific contexts than in everyday contexts. These results raised the question of whether the teaching of logical connectives should be made more explicit for TD children.</p>
<p>Related to the studies with TD secondary school pupils is research by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0265659011414276">Donaldson et al. (2007)</xref> who investigated how 5–7-year-old children with language impairments handled causal sentences in general contexts. Their informal observations indicated that these children often did experience difficulty and they suggested this is because causal connectives are function words rather than content words. They found that their sample of 30 language-impaired children did not differ from the control group in the overall frequency with which they used causal connectives (‘because’, ‘so’). However, the language impaired children produced fewer causal connectives than controls on tasks involving higher processing demands and also a lower percentage of semantically appropriate responses. This was not surprising given that the cognitive capacity required for such tasks may reduce that available for language production in this group. The stimulus material was pictures of social situations rather than scientific reasoning per se, and the researcher elicited responses in such a way that participants had little doubt that a causal connective was required in the answer.</p>
<p>This methodology was appropriate for the age group and a next step would be to assess the ability of older children with SLI to produce causal connectives spontaneously within a scientific context.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0265659011414276">
<title>3 Reasons for focusing on the KS 2 age group</title>
<p>The KS 2 age group (Years 3–6, i.e. 7–11-year-olds) was chosen for the current investigation because at that stage pupils are expected to make links between ideas and to give explanations using simple models and theories. As stated by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0265659011414276">Parker (2004)</xref> there is a progression in learning implied in the shift from knowing and describing at KS 1 (Levels 1 and 2) to describing and explaining at KS 2 (Levels 3 to 5). It is relevant, therefore, to attempt to investigate the scientific reasoning skills of children with SLI in the KS 2 age span, because explaining will be more challenging for them than merely describing, and will demand of them higher order language skills.</p>
<p>Also, as stated by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0265659011414276">Dockrell and Lindsay (1998)</xref> one would expect by Year 3 that any early minor problems with speech and language will have resolved. This suggests that children who continue to present with speech and language difficulties in Year 3 upwards will be those who have a persisting developmental difficulty and may in some cases be appropriately described as having SLI.</p>

<title>4 The KS 2 science curriculum and its differentiation</title>
<p>The work of AKSIS (Association for Science Education: King’s Science Investigations in School) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0265659011414276">AKSIS, 1998</xref>) categorized the activities involved in classroom science investigations at KS 2, e.g. classifying and fair testing. These investigative procedures require pupils to have confidence in their understanding of the language of science and their ability to reason. Support strategies are documented for TD children, e.g. the use of pictorial representations, concept mapping, role-play, and thinking skills programmes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0265659011414276">Ward et al., 2005</xref>). They are also documented for children with specific speech and language impairments by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0265659011414276">Wellington and Wellington (2002)</xref> who recommend adopting a multi-sensory approach, introducing only one concept at a time, keeping sentences simple and having consistent classroom routines. However, since these strategies are generally applicable to children with SLI throughout the curriculum, the question arises whether science poses particular challenges that they do not address.</p>

<sec id="section6-0265659011414276">
<title>5 Research aims</title>
<p>On the basis of this analysis of previous work our aim in the current study was to investigate the performance of children with SLI in scientific reasoning tasks regarding (1) the benefit they derived from visual and spatial scaffolding, and (2) their ability to generate causal connectives in their expressive speech in this context.</p>
<p>A distinction was drawn between Receptive Language Tasks (RLTs), in which the child follows verbal instructions but does not make a verbal response, and Expressive Language Tasks (ELTs), in which the child follows verbal instructions and does make a verbal response. The aim was to investigate whether the children with SLI could perform RLTs and ELTs when scaffolding was provided and also generate causal connectives in ELTs as competently as the TD children.</p>
<p>A series of tasks, appropriate to the KS 2 science curriculum, were designed by the first author in order to investigate children’s performance in both RLTs and ELTs.</p>
</sec>

<sec id="section7-0265659011414276" sec-type="methods">
<title>II Method</title>
<p>A pre-sampling study was conducted in schools in one London Borough in order to obtain a sample of children with SLI whose language and non-verbal skills fell within specified parameters. Children on the Special Educational Needs register whose primary difficulty was language were put forward by the schools for inclusion in the study with the criteria that they did not have an ASD diagnosis or autistic traits, had no significant behaviour problems and spoke English as their first language at home. Each child was assessed by the first author on five subtests of the ACE 6–11 (Assessment of Comprehension and Expression 6–11; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0265659011414276">Adams et al., 2001</xref>) and five subtests of the Visualization and Reasoning battery in the LIPS-R (Leiter International Performance Scale: Revised; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0265659011414276">Roid and Miller, 1997</xref>) so that a profile of both language and non-verbal skills was obtained. The ACE Standard Scores and the LIPS-R Scaled Scores for each child were averaged and children with average ACE Standard Scores of 8.5 or less and with average LIPS-R Scaled Scores of 7.0 or more were included in the SLI group. The child’s LIPS-R average was always superior to his or her ACE average.</p>
<p>These target children were matched with TD children who had been similarly assessed on the ACE and LIPS-R, found to be functioning linguistically and non-verbally within the average range, were in the same school year in the same school and were of the same sex. It should be noted that overall the potential target group had lower LIPS-R scores than the potential control group and for the purpose of matching pairs a discrepancy was permitted between the average LIPS-R Scaled Scores of ≤ 3, i.e. up to 1 SD. Eleven pairs of target/control children were obtained according to these criteria (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0265659011414276">Table 1</xref>) but a <italic>t</italic>-test revealed a significant difference in the non-verbal ability of the two groups (<italic>t</italic> = 2.89, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01). The conclusions of the main study can therefore only be tentative. The ACE and LIPS-R means and SDs of the overall average scores for the target and control children are given in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0265659011414276">Table 2</xref>, and the mean average scores for children in each school year are given in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0265659011414276">Table 3</xref>.</p>

<p>After a pilot study had been conducted with children with SLI from a special school in order to check on methodology, the first author assessed each target and control child individually on reasoning tasks appropriate to the KS 2 science curriculum. No task involved reading or writing, or the reading and recording of data on charts. A detailed set script was followed throughout (obtainable from the first author). Initially participants undertook warm-up activities, and the tasks described below are the ones that were scored.</p>
<p>In the RLTs the child arranged picture cards on a magnetic board, and the researcher recorded the child’s answers on a pro forma. These were scaffolded in that the child had hands on experience of the task involved and received repeated explanations from the examiner before attempting the RLT. The RLT for each task preceded its ELT and provided scaffolding for it (there was no RLT for Visual Effects). A digital voice recording was made of the whole interview and transcripts made of the ELTs. The tasks are summarized in order of administration in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0265659011414276">Table 4</xref>.

<title>IV Discussion</title>
<p>The emphasis in this study has been on novel task development and the outcome is a pointer to further research. The results have to be treated with caution for three reasons. First of all, although the target and control children all met pre-determined criteria in terms of their LIPS-R performance, the <italic>t</italic>-test conducted on the pre-sampling data showed a significant difference between the target and control children regarding their LIPS-R average scores. It can be argued, therefore, that the control group may have performed better on most of the tests not only because of their superior language skills, but also because of their superior non-verbal skills. However, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0265659011414276">Dockrell and Lindsay (1998)</xref> stated that extraneous variables in a non-verbal task probably impact upon the performance of children with SLI, and the implication is that poorer non-verbal skills in these children might be predicted. Furthermore results from a longitudinal study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0265659011414276">Conti-Ramsden et al. (2001)</xref> indicated that children with SLI scored less well on non-verbal tests as they grew older. These authors suggested that this may be due to the poor development of inner-speech and subsequent problem-solving strategies. Thus the higher non-verbal scores of the control group may reflect an emerging difference between the two populations. This study represents an attempt to profile the effect of these differences on a specific area of the school curriculum.</p>
<p>Second, difficulties with matching children according to the criteria in the current study resulted in there being only 11 target/control pairs and relatively few children in each school year, which is another reason for advocating caution when interpreting the data. Third, most tasks had a maximum score of three or four and were therefore subject to floor effects. The target children may have been successful in the RLTs due to guesswork.</p>
<p>In ELTs scored for facts the target children did significantly less well than the control children in spite of scaffolding in Melting Jelly, Pickdoku ELTs, Logiblocs Facts Prompted and Logiblocs Facts Unprompted. However, there was no significant difference in Crane Facts or in Visual Effect Facts, and these reasons are suggested. Crane was the task which required the greatest discussion when the reliability check was carried out, and it is possible that understanding and explaining density was difficult even for this control group who were of average, rather than above average, ability (density is not taught per se in NC science until KS 3). On the other hand, the scoring criteria for Visual Effects allowed some marks for using appropriate vocabulary. This is a lower level language skill than linking concepts and was within the capacity of many of the target children in the scaffolded situation. It is therefore tentatively suggested that scaffolding of the kind employed in this study is likely to reduce the differences between children with SLI and their TD peers with regard to explaining scientific concepts at the word level.</p>
<p>Logiblocs was the only task where there were scores both for facts and prompts (Logiblocs Facts Prompted and Logiblocs Facts Unprompted). Of these two Facts Unprompted yielded scores that differentiated between the two groups at a more significant level (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .005 vs. <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01). It is therefore tentatively suggested that future research should give attention to evaluating what benefit children with SLI can derive from being given verbal prompts in addition to having hands on experience when giving oral answers to scientific reasoning tasks that involve the logical linking of ideas.</p>
<p>The children with SLI generated causal connectives overall less frequently than the controls in the two tasks that were scored for their production (Crane Language and Visual Effects Language). These results are in line with those of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0265659011414276">Donaldson et al. (2007)</xref> who found that language impaired children produced fewer causal connectives than controls on tasks involving higher processing demands. In the present study the result for Crane Language was not significant (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .06), whilst the result for Visual Effects Language was highly significant (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .003) (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0265659011414276">Table 5</xref>). It should be noted that the result for Crane Facts was also not significant (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .06), and it is suggested that, just as both groups experienced some difficulty with the oral expression of facts regarding the concept of density, there was less difference between them regarding the generation of causal connectives. Overall it is concluded that there is a possibility that children with SLI have more difficulty with generating causal connectives because of their lower level of language skills.</p>
<p>While the limitations in experimental design mean that the data must be interpreted with caution, these findings suggest that children with SLI may have comparatively greater difficulty with expressing scientific reasoning orally as opposed to demonstrating it practically where they can use visual and spatial reasoning skills. They may also have difficulties with expressing themselves grammatically, specifically regarding causal connectives, which is a prerequisite for demonstrating scientific reasoning orally.</p>
<sec id="section10-0265659011414276">
<title>1 Suggested pedagogical implications</title>
<p>Children with SLI are likely to benefit from regular opportunities to demonstrate non-verbal reasoning skills in science lessons as a set activity, e.g. by completing a workbook involving pictures and symbols related to the current topic in class, and being taught through this task actively and explicitly to reason (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0265659011414276">Bell, 2002</xref>). Such an activity will not only help them consolidate the concepts being taught, but will also provide the opportunity for them to show that they are capable of achieving with scaffolding on a par with TD children.</p>
<p>In addition to non-verbal prompts it is suggested that children with SLI may also benefit from verbal prompts given at the same time, and that scaffolding should occur in more than one modality. Children with SLI are likely to require specific support with the oral expression of causal connectives. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0265659011414276">Gardner (1977)</xref> predicted that secondary school pupils’ comprehension of unfamiliar connectives would be improved by increased exposure to them, but in the case of children with SLI even repeated exposure to the common causal connectives may be insufficient. Instead explicit teaching is likely to be required by, e.g. grammar facilitation methods or metalinguistic approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0265659011414276">Ebbels, 2008</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0265659011414276">
<title>2 Future research</title>
<p>It is suggested that further work is carried out using similar tasks appropriate to the KS 2 science curriculum with a larger sample of target and control children more closely matched for non-verbal ability. The findings have indicated the value of these tasks, but have also shown that they need to be extended to avoid the floor effects noted above. The interesting findings on the use of verbal and non-verbal prompts by children with SLI could be confirmed if each task has both a scaffolded and an unscaffolded condition.</p>
