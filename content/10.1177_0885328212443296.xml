<abstract>
<p>In this study, rapid CAD-CAM prototyping of pure hydroxyapatite to replace temporomandibular joint condyles was tested in sheep. Three adult animals were implanted with CAD-CAM-designed porous hydroxyapatite scaffolds as condyle substitutes. The desired scaffold shape was achieved by subtractive automated milling machining (block reduction). Custom-made surgical guides were created by direct metal laser sintering and were used to export the virtual planning of the bone cut lines into the surgical environment. Using the same technique, fixation plates were created and applied to the scaffold pre-operatively to firmly secure the condyles to the bone and to assure primary stability of the hydroxyapatite scaffolds during masticatory function. Four months post-surgery, the sheep were sacrificed. The hydroxyapatite scaffolds were explanted, and histological specimens were prepared. Different histological tissues penetrating the scaffold macropores, the sequence of bone remodeling, new apposition of bone and/or cartilage as a consequence of the different functional anatomic role, and osseointegration at the interface between the scaffold and bone were documented. This animal model was found to be appropriate for testing CAD-CAM customization and the biomechanical properties of porous, pure hydroxyapatite scaffolds used as joint prostheses.</p>

<p>Most current strategies for repairing large bone defects involve bone grafting materials or prosthetic implants.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0885328212443296">1</xref></sup> However, limitations to these approaches, including the restricted availability of bone grafts, the possibility of disease transmission, poor biocompatibility, and failure at the bone-prosthesis interface, have increased the need for alternative strategies such as tissue engineering approaches.</p>
<p>Temporomandibular joint (TMJ) condylar prosthesis has been experimentally described in primates,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0885328212443296">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0885328212443296">3</xref></sup> pigs,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0885328212443296">4</xref></sup> and sheep.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0885328212443296">5</xref></sup> In sheep, artificial and standardized titanium prostheses have been used as substitutes for the condyle, but only a few tissue engineering approaches aimed at producing customized scaffolds for bone regeneration, and no CAD-CAM-prototyped surgical guides and bone plates for bone sectioning and securing scaffolds to bone,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0885328212443296">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0885328212443296">7</xref></sup> have been designed.</p>
<p>In the last decade, bone substitutes have been used in combination with osteogenic cells for the prefabrication of bioartificial bone grafts in several animal studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0885328212443296">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0885328212443296"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0885328212443296"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0885328212443296"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0885328212443296"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0885328212443296"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0885328212443296"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0885328212443296"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0885328212443296">16</xref></sup> The use of multipotent mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) has opened up new therapeutic opportunities for bone substitution.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0885328212443296">17</xref></sup> The scaffold can be implanted into the patient to function as a replacement tissue after in vitro MSC colonization (tissue engineering), or it may be seeded with MSCs during surgery (regenerative medicine).</p>
<p>The success of tissue regeneration is related to the structure of the scaffold and its ability to allow invasion by cells and tissues. Blood vessels begin to grow around and into the construct; as the scaffold dissolves, newly formed tissues are eventually integrated into their surroundings and finally replace the scaffold.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0885328212443296">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0885328212443296"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0885328212443296"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0885328212443296"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0885328212443296"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0885328212443296"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0885328212443296"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0885328212443296"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0885328212443296"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0885328212443296">27</xref></sup> The scaffolds are created from structural elements such as fibers and membranes with alternating voids and pores that can be ordered according to stochastic, fractal, or periodic principles, and are thus reproducible using engineering approaches.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0885328212443296">28</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0885328212443296"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0885328212443296">30</xref></sup> These techniques may be used to construct 3-D artificial tissues that allow the passage of fluids and cells.</p>
<p>Sheep and humans have similar patterns of bone remodeling, and their chewing forces should be at least equal. The TMJ undergoes adaptive changes even when chewing brings only minor displacement of the condylar head. Degenerative articular changes may develop earlier in adults because of their poor aptitude for subchondral bone remodeling. CAD-CAM processing of computed tomography (CT) data could be used to create a scaffold that reproduces the existing condyle perfectly in terms of shape and geometry. From a biomechanical point of view, sheep are also useful because their long daily mastication produces thin articular tubercles and eminences, similar to human TMJs.</p>
<p>The aim of this pilot animal study was to test a new approach using a CAD-CAM-customized porous, pure hydroxyapatite (HA) scaffold to replace the TMJ condyle. We analyzed the interaction between the scaffold and the surrounding tissues (bone and soft tissue) to better understand the biological proprieties of the scaffold (osteointegration and material degradation).</p>

<p>The HA scaffold was created from powder (Finceramica, Faenza, Italy). The pore size and distribution were optimized by setting up a foaming process based on an aqueous suspension of the HA powder (30% volume of solid loading). A ball-milling process lasting 20 h was used to obtain the desired foaming characteristics. The foamed suspension was poured into proper molds and dried in an air-circulating oven for 48 h at 40℃. The samples were then sintered at 1250℃ for 3 h. The sintered samples were analyzed by X-ray diffraction (Cu Kα radiation; Rigaku Miniflex, Tokyo, Japan), scanning electron microscopy (Stereoscan 360; Leica, Cambridge, UK), and Hg porosimetry (Porosimeter 2000 and Macropores Unit 120; Carlo Erba, Milano, Italy) to characterize their physicochemical and morphological features. The material was phase-pure stoichiometric HA with a globular multidimensional porosity amounting to 65–70% of its volume. Large, 150- to 500 -µm pores were interconnected by 70- to 120-µm pores. Smaller micropores (10 µm) were also present.</p>
<p>The mechanical potential of the porous scaffold was assessed before implantation. The scaffold was preliminarily tested under compression (model 1195; Instron, High Wycombe, Bucks, UK) to compare its mechanical performance (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0885328212443296">Table 1</xref>; sample code HA-F70) with that of a similar porous HA scaffold that had previously been developed and tested in vivo (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0885328212443296">Table 1</xref>; sample code HA-S45). The compressive strength of the 3-D porous material used in this study (HA-F70) was nearly twice that of the sample that had previously been tested in vivo (HA-S45); it also had lower overall porosity. These figures highlight the intrinsic improvements in the porous matrix. Similar results were obtained when comparing the mechanical data for HA-F70 and HA-S70: the compressive strength values of the latter were ten times lower than those of the former. Similarly, the technological improvement obtained with materials coded F is demonstrated by the values obtained for samples with 80 vol% porosity, which allows them to surviving handling (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0885328212443296">Table 1</xref>).

<sec id="sec4-0885328212443296"><title>CAD-CAM processing: Customization of the HA scaffold</title>
<p>Starting with a stack of CT slices, a 3-D digital model of the sheep mandible was reconstructed by setting a suitable threshold value using Amira 3.1.1 (Mercury Computer Systems, Chelmsford, MA, USA). Both condyles were then virtually resected from the model to artificially create a bone defect in the mandibular ramus after planning the cut line with the surgeon.</p>
<p>The healthy and resected mandibular rami were printed in 3-D with an acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) plastic material using a Dimension Soluble Support Technology (SST) 3-D printer (Stratasys Inc., Eden Prairie, MN, USA).</p>
<p>Surgical guides and fixation plates were custom-designed using Rhino 4.0 (Robert McNeel &amp; Associates, Seattle, WA, USA). The surgical guides were designed to allow the surgeon to perform the virtually planned surgical excision of the mandible during actual surgery. Customized reference coupling elements were designed to facilitate correct positioning on the bone and two 2-mm-diameter holes were created for bone anchoring using titanium screws (Gebrüder Martin GmbH &amp; Co. Ltd., Tuttlingen, Germany). The fixation plates were designed by thickening the outer surface of the ideal contour of the mandible to firmly secure the HA scaffolds to the bone and to ensure primary stability during masticatory function. To ensure correct positioning of the scaffold with respect to the resected condyle, two reference holes were created in the plates according to the positions of the fixing holes in the surgical guides. An array of 2-mm-diameter holes arranged along the surfaces of the plates was also provided to facilitate the supply of blood to the graft material and to allow the HA scaffold to be fixed to the plate using titanium screws.</p>
<p>The surgical guides and fixation plates were directly manufactured using an EOSINT M270 machine (EOS GmbH, Munchen, Germany). Surgical guides were manufactured from EOS Cobalt-Chrome MP1 and fixation plates from EOS Titanium Ti64, an alloy with excellent mechanical properties and corrosion resistance, as well as low specific weight and good biocompatibility.</p>
<p>A three-axis CNC subtractive automated milling machine (Cortini HS 644 P; Fidia S.p.A., Padova, Italy) was used to prepare the externally designed scaffold to replace the resected condyle. The 3-D automated machining process started from a block of porous HA of the required size (60 × 30 × 20 mm). A machining tool with a 3-mm-diameter spherical milling bur was chosen and the machining process was designed to build a scaffold with a depth of cut of 0.5 mm for the roughing step and 0.2 mm for the finishing step. Before connection to the fixation plate, holes were created in the HA scaffolds for the titanium fixing screws by drilling with a diamond bur at 24 000 rpm with irrigation and axial movement to avoid microfractures in the material. The anatomic landmarks of the screws were made in the scaffolds before surgery using prototyped ABS models of mandibular rami with the same bone defects. The enveloping shape of the customized plates allowed fixation of the scaffolds with a single titanium screw. Finally, the bone-fixing titanium plate and HA scaffold were sterilized with γ-rays (25 kGy) for 6 days.</p>

<sec id="sec5-0885328212443296"><title>Animal housing and anesthetic procedures</title>
<p>This study has been independently reviewed and approved by an ethical board of the National Institute of Health (Decree nr. 51/2009-B). The sheep mandible was examined by CT using a PQS CT scanner (Picker International Inc., Cleveland, OH, USA) under general anesthesia. Sedation was achieved using ketamine (5 mg/kg, intramuscular [IM]) and midazolam (0.4 mg/kg, IM), and induction with propofol (3 mg/kg, intravenous [IV]) and ketamine (1 mg/kg, IV). Data acquisition was carried out at the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine. CT scanning was performed in axial sequence at 120 kV/315 mA with a slice thickness of 2 mm, a 1-mm distance, a reconstruction algorithm for bone, and an image resolution of 512 × 512 pixels. The acquisition yielded 80 slices, which were saved as DICOM files. Three 2-year-old, non-pregnant, 48-kg female sheep were used. This study was authorized by the ethics committee of the University and State. Before and after surgery, the animals were housed in a 3 × 3-m stall with straw and was fed hay. A 1-day fast with no water limitation was imposed before surgery. Surgery were performed under general anesthesia. Ketamine (5 mg/kg, IM) and midazolam (0.4 mg/kg, IM) were administered for sedation. After 20 min, the cephalic vein was catheterized, and fentanyl (4 µg/kg, IV) was administered as an analgesic. A fentanyl patch (100 µg/h) was applied before beginning the surgical procedure to provide analgesia throughout the postsurgical period. Induction was achieved with propofol (3 mg/kg, IV) and ketamine (1 mg/kg, IV). After intubation, anesthesia was maintained with isoflurane (1.5% in oxygen [FO<sub>2</sub> = 0.6]) and a continuous rate infusion of ketamine (1–2 mg/kg/h) and fentanyl (15 µg/kg/h). After recovery, flunixin meglumine (1 mg/kg, IM) (Meflosyl; Intervet/Schering-Plough) was administered to the animals every 12 h. For perioperative prophylaxis, a mixture of procaine benzylpenicillin (8 IU/kg) and streptomycin (10 mg/kg, IM, UI, SID) (Combiotic; Fatro Ozzano, Bologna, Italy) was injected on the day of the intervention and the day after. The sheep showed no apparent pain during the postoperative period and displayed chewing movements immediately after recovery. Rumination was observed after 8 h.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec6-0885328212443296"><title>Surgical procedure and follow-up</title>
<p>A longitudinal 5-cm incision was created on the caudal margin of the ramus mandibulae using the TMJ as a dorsal landmark. The posterior rim of the mandible was identified and the temporal muscle detached from the bone. Muscle and the buccal and zygomatic branches of the facial nerve were pulled down, allowing sufficient access to the whole of the superior mandible ramus. Next, the first surgical guide was attached using two titanium fixing screws. The condylar neck was divided below the point of insertion of the lateral pterygoid muscle with an oscillating saw according to the line in the surgical guide. The TMJ was opened by cutting the capsule and leaving the meniscus on-site. After resection, the proximal fragment was dislocated and ablated. The surgical guide was then removed and the bone prepared to host the scaffold.</p>
<p>The HA scaffold was pre-prepared with the bone plate attached. The screw holes created to fix the surgical guide were used to position and secure the plates and HA scaffold. Fixation was achieved using bicortical screws (9 and 11 mm); the insertion of the lateral pterygoid muscle was preserved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0885328212443296">Figure 1(a)</xref>–(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0885328212443296">d</xref>)).

<p>The animals were cared for at the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, where it was allowed to recover in a stable for 16 weeks. Food and water were not rationed. The animals were sacrificed after 4 months via an IV injection of ketamine (5 mg/kg, IM), midazolam (0.4 mg/kg, IM), and enbutramide (70 mg/kg) plus mebezony (Tanax®; 15 mg/kg). Examination of the skull was carried out post-mortem by CT to compare the anatomic results, in order to detect positional variation with respect to the planned position of the condyles. Next, a specimen was harvested for anatomical and histological examination. The mandibular HA condyles and surrounding ramus bone tissue plus adjacent connective tissue (in the articular area) were harvested as a single block. Collection of the specimen was carried out immediately after CT. The samples were submerged in 10% buffered formalin and delivered to the laboratory for histological analysis.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec7-0885328212443296"><title>Histology</title>
<p>The specimens were processed to obtain macroscopic sections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0885328212443296">Figure 2</xref>). To visualize the sectioned condyle surface, each specimen was sectioned in two ways using an irrigated circular continuous saw: parallel to the long axis of the ramus, from the posterior (caudal) to the anterior part of the scaffold, and parallel to the frontal plane from the lateral to the medial part of the articular surface of the scaffold. The resulting specimens were processed using the Precise 1 Automated System (Assing, Rome, Italy), dehydrated by rinsing in a graded ethanol series, and embedded in glycol methacrylate resin (Technovit 7200 VLC; Kulzer, Wehreim, Germany). After polymerization, the specimens were sectioned parallel to the main section at a thickness of approximately 150 µm with a high-precision diamond disk and ground down to a thickness of about 30 µm using a specially designed grinding machine. Three slides were obtained from the long axis parallel to the ramus (scaffold core) and two slides from the long axis parallel to the frontal plane (condyle surface). The slides were stained with acid fuchsin and toluidine blue and examined with transmitted light under a microscope (Leitz, Wetzlar, Germany).

<p>The reported observations are based on six specimens collected from three animals, implanted bilaterally. We looked at four specific aspects: material structural activity, host-material interactions, material degradation, and joint regeneration.</p>
<sec id="sec9-0885328212443296"><title>Material structural activity</title>
<p>The precision of the cut made with the aid of the designed surgical guides was quantitatively evaluated by comparing the virtually planned cut with the cut made by the surgeon to remove the condyle. The accuracy was evaluated using the shell-shell deviation analysis function in Rapidform XOS2 (INUS Technology, Inc, Seoul, Korea). The 3-D model of the mandible with the planned cut created from pre-operative CT data and 3-D model of the mandible with the actual cut created from post-operative CT data were superimposed to provide a color map of deviations in distance between the two models in the cut area. The mean difference was 0.25 mm; the maximum difference was 2.50 mm. The largest errors (displayed in red) were concentrated in the medial part of the vertical cut area (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0885328212443296">Figure 3</xref>). In two specimens, a macroscopic fracture was evident in the scaffold. However, in all cases, the inferior part of the scaffold (scaffold core) resulted in a firm connection with the mandible. This observation was confirmed during preparation of the histological sections, where, in the same two cases, the upper part of the scaffold (condyle surface) was connected to the adjacent lower part only through a thin layer of fibrous tissue.

<p>Histological analysis showed different types of tissue surrounding the implanted scaffold. In the scaffold core sections, good bonding with the adjacent bone was always characterized by the presence of direct contact without fibrous tissue interposition.

Histological analysis showed the presence of fibrous tissue in contact with the scaffold, but no evidence of bone regeneration. In the scaffold pores, only seams of fibrous tissue were observed. When a fragment of the scaffold was released into the soft tissue, no tissue penetration was observed.

<p>Histological documentation of bone remodelling showed degradation of the material and new bone apposition.

<p>In the condyle section, there was evidence of new organized cartilage on top of the HA scaffold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0885328212443296">Figure 9(a)</xref>). From the top down, we identified the original meniscus, dense fibrous cartilage in transverse layers, and finally a cartilage column ending in subchondral bone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0885328212443296">Figure 9(b)</xref>–(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0885328212443296">d</xref>)).

Histological analysis showed enchondral ossification with a transitional area towards the dense connective tissue of the articular surface, where the disc adhered firmly to the artificial condyle. In the medial part of the condyle, external to the scaffold, new bone and cartilage were present. This new tissue was characterized by new bone trabeculae with evidence of osteoblastic rims, new vessels in the trabecular bone, and thick subchondral bone. A columnar layer of chondrocytes was detected under the superficial cartilage at low and high magnifications. Osteoclasts, isogenous groups, and tide marks were not present, while synovial tissue was evident at the cartilage border. The thickness of the osteochondral layer was 1.25 mm (mean value). The homogeneity of the articular cartilage (bone + cartilage) was present only in the articular areas where the new trabecular bone was newly regenerated.

<p>The aim of this pilot animal study was to test a new approach using a CAD-CAM-customized porous, pure HA scaffold to replace the condyles of the TMJ. Even if the number of the animals used in this study was at minimum necessary to assess the experimental protocol, some conclusions may be drawn for guiding further studies with a higher number of animals.</p>
<p>The most critical aspects in analyses of material integrity are resistance to rapid prototyping (block reduction), screw fixation, and weight-bearing movements during mastication.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0885328212443296">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0885328212443296">32</xref></sup> Metal laser sintering of the surgical guides (Cr-Co) and bone plates (Ti4Al6V) augmented their resistance and increased the precision with which the virtual plan was transferred to the surgical environment. During surgery, the surgical guide was fixed to the bone using two titanium bone screws. It appeared to be very stable and useful for guiding the oscillating saw during condyle resection. The main positioning difficulty related to insertion of the complex scaffold-bone plate into the artificial defect was that the tissues surrounding the defect collapsed, especially in the area of the condyle, and this reduced access for positioning the HA prosthesis. In general, this may cause improper loading on the fixing screw that connect the scaffold to the bone plate, thereby creating microfractures or macrofractures in the material. However, the guide plus plate system allowed precise bone sectioning, simple scaffold positioning, and secure screw fixing. The time required to perform the surgical procedure was reduced to 40 min, and no complications were observed during 4 months of follow-up.</p>
<p>Fractures at the screw-HA interface may occur due to imperfect drilling of the holes for the screws, caused by incorrect axial (lateral) movement of the drill handle during material penetration. Fractures of the material may also occur during the healing period with different histological consequences, depending on the time at which they happen. An evaluation of the specimens showed several fractures in the material and fragments encapsulated by connective tissue (early fractures) or entirely surrounded by new bone (late fractures). During the healing period, part of one condyle fractured and bent down medially to the mandibular ramus. After explantation, no connective tissue enveloping the capsule was found, and the capsule was found to be completely mobile between the muscle fascia and mandibular ramus. The evidence of free movement can explain the complete absence of bone cells in the micropores/macropores of the scaffold. This phenomenon confirms the need for firm primary stability to allow osteoblastic and chondroblastic activity on such material.</p>
<p>Stability in the absence of fracturing confirms the ability of the scaffold to be invaded by host tissue. Optimal osteointegration was demonstrated at the bone edge where contact with the bone implant occurred. There was also evidence of newly formed bone in the scaffold pores. The sequence of bone formation from the periphery to the center of the scaffold was clarified by the presence of more mature bone on the outside and evidence of small vessels in the deeper pores of the scaffold. The main question was about different grades of bone maturations that were simultaneously present, even if there was only one time point for the analysis. We supposed that this finding in this pilot study was related to different penetration in the deeper portions of the scaffold: for those more peripheral, the maturation started as soon as the blood supply contacted the scaffold; for deeper portions, the maturation started only when the blood supply penetrated into, and this might have occurred in a delayed time. Similar observations have been reported by other authors who tested HA scaffolds<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0885328212443296">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0885328212443296">34</xref></sup> or other implants such as allografts.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0885328212443296">35</xref></sup> Similar observations were reported for the contact between the scaffold and surrounding soft tissues, where, in most of the sections, a firm layer of fibrous tissue was evident around the scaffold. Only in a few sections was loose fibrous tissue attached to the scaffold. This was particularly evident when a fragment of the scaffold fractured or where the surrounding muscles generated micromotion in the connective capsule that enveloped the scaffold. However, even in cases where callus formation was evident, new bone formation in small scaffold fragments was limited.</p>
<p>Bone remodelling was documented through histological analysis. The following steps were described: the initial deposition of macrophages onto the pore surface; the organization of multinucleate (osteoclast-like) cells before the initial degradation of the HA; degradation of the material, with HA fragments inside the multinucleate cells and extracellular enzymes degrading the material; polarization of the nuclei of the multinucleate cells at the opposite side of the cytoplasm with respect to the cellular membrane where the lysosomal activity took place; and the final status of the osseous deposition, with the osteoblastic rim that continued the deposition towards the center of the HA pore, leaving the HA intact. Previous studies documented differences concerning the degradation of these substitutes,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0885328212443296">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0885328212443296">37</xref></sup> as well as their biomechanical properties.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0885328212443296">38</xref></sup> Geometrical structural features such as the size, shape, and degree of interconnectivity of the pores are different and characterize the various scaffolds. Scaffolds should have an internal structure that permits osseous invasion.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0885328212443296">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0885328212443296">40</xref></sup> Moreover, the chemical composition of the scaffold is crucial to the osteoconductive properties of the material.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0885328212443296">41</xref></sup> Our findings led us to hypothesize that, after initial degradation of the HA, new bone may be directly deposited onto the degraded layer of HA. The osteoblastic rim deposits enchondral bone onto the internal surfaces of the pores, with complete osteointegration into the material. The initial degradation of the material may ‘prepare for’ the subsequent adhesion of the new bone to the HA, which thereafter remains intact without any resorption for at least 4 months. Additional studies are necessary to determine whether the HA remains unresorbed or whether low-grade resorption occurs over time.</p>
<p>Evidence of lysosomal activity in the multinucleate cells in the HA pores and the newly deposited osteoid tissue was clearly documented.</p>
<p>Several types of hydrogels have been used to provide an initial scaffold for construction of the cartilaginous extracellular matrix component of tissue-engineered osteochondral grafts,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0885328212443296">42</xref></sup> including agarose,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0885328212443296">43</xref></sup> alginate,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0885328212443296">44</xref></sup> polylactic acid (PLA),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0885328212443296">45</xref></sup> polyglycolic acid (PGA)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0885328212443296">46</xref></sup> and its copolymer PLGA,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0885328212443296">47</xref></sup> and polyethylene glycol (PEG).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0885328212443296">48</xref></sup> Some authors have proposed the use of photopolymerizable hydrogels containing PEG-based polymers for the encapsulation of chondrocytes for cartilage tissue engineering.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0885328212443296">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0885328212443296">50</xref></sup> Others have described a bio-hybrid scaffold for osteochondral applications.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0885328212443296">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0885328212443296">52</xref></sup> In our pilot study, new apposition of an osteochondral layer on the articular surface of the condyle was detected. This osteochondral layer was joined to the dense connective tissue of the articular disc, firmly adhering to this surface and giving it the full functional capacity of the TMJ. It was also present in the functional area of the condyle, where the native articular disc (preserved during surgery) became attached to the scaffold. In this particular situation, the connective tissue fibers penetrating the pores of the scaffold provided continuity between the scaffold and dense connective tissue of the articular disc. In addition, the articular capsule was restored. Macroscopic analysis of the scaffold explant showed an intact but unusual articular chamber, with the articular disc firmly adhered to the condyle articular surface such that the chamber was not divided into two areas (upper and lower areas, divided by the disc; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0885328212443296">Figure 5</xref>). The glenoid fossa was intact, and no signs of inflammation were present after four months of healing. Synovial fluid was also present, and the condyle ligaments appeared to be correctly connected to the posterior, medial, and anterior areas of the capsule.</p>
<p>Under the articular surface, newly formed bone with evidence of osteoblastic rims, vessels, and lymphocytes (probably due to the phagocytosis of HA granules) was detected.</p>
<p>On the basis of these observations, this experimental protocol can be considered a reliable method for investigating condyle substitution with a customized HA scaffold. It is reproducible and can be used to investigate the behavior of HA scaffolds when they are used as bone substitutes in critical defects, including defects in the TMJ. In this report, we demonstrated that this model allows the detection of newly formed bone, osteointegration, and functional bone regeneration.</p>
