<p><italic>Anarchism and Syndicalism in the Colonial and Postcolonial World, 1870–1940</italic> is a collection of 11 research papers which aim to understand how anarchism and syndicalism developed as transnational movements, according to Lucien van der Walt and Steven Hirsch, the editors of the book. The editors argue that the book’s approach to its subject matter enables it to transcend Eurocentric narratives that tend to view anarchist and syndicalist movements in the colonial and postcolonial world as ‘mere imitations or extensions of European movements’.</p>
<p>The book is divided into two parts. Part one investigates anarchism and syndicalism in the context of European and Japanese colonialism, whereas part two of the book explores and discusses anarchism and syndicalism in the context of postcolonial situations. Further, the book investigates how anarchists and syndicalists engaged with imperialism, anti-colonial movements ‘and the national question’.</p>
<p>Although this is an academic text, grassroots activists will find it useful too. The book offers deep insights into society and history, and it highlights relevant historical experiences that could benefit social movements worldwide. For instance, in addition to showing that anarchism and syndicalism have always had a proletarian social base in the colonial and postcolonial world, the book illustrates how anarchist and syndicalist movements grappled with racial and ethnic divisions in different countries. It details the methods of struggle these movements employed to advance their agendas.</p>
<p>It must be pointed out, however, that the book does not adequately engage with the fact that anarchists and syndicalist movements tend to understand and to discuss white supremacy and racial divisions through an economic prism. Thus, in his attempt to show how South African anarchist and syndicalist movements valued diversity, van der Walt (p. 71) uncritically quotes the International Socialist League (ISL) as saying that:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>the ‘laws and regulations’ which ‘degrade the native workers to the level of serfs and herded cattle’ – including the ‘denial of civil liberty and political rights’ – existed ‘for the express uses of Capital’, as ‘weapons . . . to be used against all the workers’. Thus, ‘segregation is a policy of capitalism, not of the labour movement’.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The foregoing misunderstands the origins of white supremacy in South Africa. The native worker was not oppressed only for the ‘express uses of Capital’, but rather to also maintain and perpetuate the notion of white supremacy and the status quo of white privilege in the world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0021909611423236">Gillem et al., 2001</xref>). As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0021909611423236">Albert (2006)</xref> argues, there is nothing in capitalism’s defining institutions that says that people of colour should be treated differently. And, although white supremacy often has an economic component, the dominant theme of white supremacy is not economics. It would have been interesting to read how this misunderstanding of the origins of white supremacy sometimes hindered the growth and successes of anarchist and syndicalist movements in colonial and postcolonial world.</p>
<p>In the preface to the book, Benedict Anderson touches on this issue. Anderson writes that, in places like Cape Town, Dublin and Cairo, anarchism had to deal with nationalism which it did ‘not wholly comprehend, and had some good reasons to suspect’ (p. xxiv). This impacted on the alliances forged between anarchists and the nationalists. He points out that alliances between nationalists and anarchists did exist ‘especially where anarchists were themselves ‘natives’’ (p. xxiv).</p>
<p>In places like Cuba, however, Afro-Cubans saw anarchists as white or foreigners, according to Kirk Shaffer. Similarly, in Egypt, anarchism remained a foreign idea associated with Italian immigrants for a long time. As Anthony Gorman writes in the book, anarchism first appeared in Egypt among Italian political refugees in the 1860s. Prior to 1900, native Egyptians were not part of the anarchist circles. My view is that this is partly because anarchist and syndicalist movements in Egypt promoted ‘an international activism that resisted nationality, religion and race as the basis of organization’ (Gorman: 4). Although nationalism, race and religion have extreme and oppressive tendencies, it is not strategic, however, to resist ideas that give meaning to people’s lives. The goal after all is not about having no religion or no race, but about attaining ‘good religion’ in a society that values diversity. Similarly, left struggles are not about not having an economy, rather we struggle for a just and an equitable economic system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0021909611423236">Albert, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>I am of the view that even in an egalitarian society there will be religion, and, racial and cultural differences will exist. After all, the goal is not to attain homogeneity of any kind. The anarchist and syndicalist movements in the colonial and postcolonial world failed to answer adequately the following questions: how do we remove oppression, without obliterating difference? How do we maintain and celebrate difference without violating solidarity? (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0021909611423236">Albert, 2006</xref>)</p>
<p>It is partly because anarchist and syndicalist movements did not have a convincing answer to these questions that they found it difficult to forge alliances with nationalists. It could be argued that, in certain cases, anarchist and syndicalist movements were not prepared to grapple with these questions sufficiently, and hence they did not ‘wholly comprehend’, and at times, were even suspicious of nationalism. The book does not critically engage with this history and these issues as well. The 21st century anarchist and syndicalist movements have yet to sufficiently grapple with these questions too.</p>
