<p>Before we all get too excited about the demise of the News of the World, the dropping of News Corporation’s bid for full control of BSKYB, and of watching Murdoch and son squirm in front of the British Parliament’s Culture Media and Sport select committee (and the cameras), we should be wary of being overly optimistic about the outcomes of the public enquiry set up in July 2011 by British Prime Minister David Cameron and led by Lord Justice Leveson. Senior politicians on both sides of the political divide are no doubt relieved they will not have to “court” Murdoch as before. While the scandal revealed links between politicians, media moguls, and police, these sorts of networks, revealed by sociologists years ago, are not going to disappear from the United Kingdom’s embedded class system and hegemonic media structure.</p>
<p>I confess that the front cover of the satirical magazine, <italic>Private Eye</italic> during the height of the scandal in July 2011 gave me most amusement (<italic>Private Eye</italic>, no. 1293). The headline “Gotcha” (a reference to the infamous Sun front page depicting the sinking of the <italic>Belgrano</italic> during the Falkland’s war) over pictures of Murdock and son and Rebekah Wade, the recently removed chief exec of News International and former editor of the <italic>News of the World</italic> summed up the culture of Murdoch’s UK tabloid papers over the past thirty years. Inside, <italic>Private Eye</italic> provided another mock-up of the Sun newspaper depicting James Murdock with the headline “It’s the son wot done it!” (p. 23), a reference to the Murdock paper’s declaration that is was responsible for the “unexpected” result of the UK general election in April 1992, which gave victory to the Conservatives.</p>
<p>While most scandal news is a direct consequence of the audience building strategy of the media, scandal can often be a productive weapon for opening up an alternative and open terrain of public discourse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1527476411425510">Tumber 1993</xref>). In the United Kingdom, two major scandals have erupted recently, namely, the Members’ of Parliament expenses scandal and more recently the phone hacking one. Modern-day scandals represent the personalization of politics at a time when partisan identities have become weaker and party ideologies tend to converge toward the center. Individuals revealed to have broken a moral or legal code are usually in the center of scandals rather than political parties (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1527476411425510">Tumber and Waisbord 2004a</xref>, 1035-36). The phone hacking scandal has already witnessed the resignation of senior police officers, <italic>News of the World</italic> journalists and executives and more dangerously for David Cameron the British Prime Minister, the loss of Andy Coulson appointed by Cameron as his media chief in 2007 and director of communication in 2010 following the general election. Cameron’s embroilment in the scandal is set to continue as long as the police investigation and the public enquiry progress. Coulson’s role in the scandal, the apparent lack of security vetting of his appointment and the personal links between Cameron and <italic>News of the World</italic> executives threaten to undermine the Prime Minister’s credibility particularly within his own Party if they consider him an electoral risk. Scandals can be the catalyst for the politics of shaming, publicly damaging individual reputations and “serve as social reminders that regardless of their legal resolution, certain acts still constitute moral transgression” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1527476411425510">Tumber and Waisbord 2004</xref>, 1145).</p>
<p>But what of the Leveson inquiry and the likelihood of media reform? “The focus of the inquiry is ‘the culture, practices and ethics of the press’ in the context of the latter’s relationship with the public, the police and politicians” (Leveson, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2011/sep/05/leveson-inquiry-terms-of-reference">http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2011/sep/05/leveson-inquiry-terms-of-reference</ext-link>). The initial wave of the investigation will be to concentrate on the relationship between the press and public, as well as press regulation. The second section of the inquiry will look at the specific phone hacking allegations that arose in the wake of the scandal at the <italic>News of the World</italic> but will only begin once the police investigations have been completed. There is an assumption already that some form of statutory regulatory body will replace the now defunct Press Complaints Commission (PCC) with the details dependent on the outcome of the inquiry’s debate into “what amounts to the public good and to what extent the public interest should be taken into account and by whom” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1527476411425510">Leveson 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Max Hastings, the journalist and former editor made the point that the PCC was irrelevant since its raison d’être was to protect the public from relatively minor media excesses. “The phone hacking scandal represents a serious breach of the criminal law” far beyond the scope of the PCC mandate, “a new regulatory body can contribute nothing towards preventing media criminality” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1527476411425510">Hastings 2011</xref>, 9).</p>
<p>A new press regulator even if it is a statutory body will likely focus attention on redress and protection of privacy and libel tourism. Hopes for dramatic change in the media landscape particularly in reform of media competition will wither as the enquiry takes its course. The Government will try and divert attention to privacy protection and ethics and concentrate on other areas of media change. A new communications act is not due until 2013, but the Coalition Government elected in May 2010 has not been slow in implementing changes to the BBC funding.</p>
<p>In its first year in office, they announced a number of changes to the funding of the BBC. The BBC licence fee was frozen at £145.50 for six years, a cut of about 16 percent in real terms. Emerging out of the negotiations, the BBC agreed to fund the World Service and Welsh-language broadcaster S4C from 2015. The BBC has also agreed to take over funding of BBC Monitoring and to provide £150 million a year for the implementation of superfast broadband to rural areas from 2013 and £25 million a year for local TV and online content. A further one-off capital investment in local TV and online services of £25 million will also come from the licence fee, and the BBC will also underwrite the rollout of the digital radio network nationally. In total, the BBC has committed to spend an extra £340 million of licence-fee money to fund all these undertakings by 2014-2015. Government expenditure from central taxation will fall by an equivalent amount. The World Service’s annual budget is £272 million, S4C’s £102 million, and BBC Monitoring £25 million, have all been cut as part of the government’s comprehensive spending review (see debate on World service cuts, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1527476411425510">Hague 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>The BBC has always been a prominent focus of aggression by the Conservative party. The attacks have come in response to a perceived lack of patriotism during Suez, the Falklands and the Gulf wars or from a more general antipathy toward the BBC’s dominant position in the cultural landscape. Right-wing commentators obviously miffed at the shifting focus during the scandal toward News International and Murdoch’s role within the British establishment, have attempted to bring attention back to their agenda.</p>
<p>During the height of the hacking scandal, Melanie Philips, well-known columnist for the midmarket tabloid <italic>The Daily Mail</italic>, penned a piece headlined “If Miliband Is Such a Hero, Why Won’t He Tackle the REAL Threat to our Way of Life—the BBC?” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1527476411425510">Philips 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Philips asserts that</p>
<p>
<disp-quote><p>the BBC’s monopoly over the media is a running scandal. After all, just imagine if News International had been given the legal power to levy a tax on everyone who bought a newspaper in order to fund the Murdoch empire. Ah, say its defenders, but the BBC is a public service broadcaster, and therefore of course merits a public subsidy as a great British institution which must be preserved at all costs. Well, that argument just won’t wash any more. For the BBC wraps itself in the heroic mantle of a public service remit which it has systematically betrayed. That remit was to educate and elevate public taste, as well as to entertain. But for years now, the BBC has instead been playing to the lowest common denominator, competing in the ratings market as ruthlessly as any commercial broadcaster.</p></disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Phillips believes that Murdoch “ignites passions far more incendiary than are generated by any tyrant or war criminal.” The reason she says is that Murdoch “acts as a kind of lightning rod for Left-wingers—the object of a massive displacement neurosis arising from all their rage and disappointment, not least with themselves.”</p>
<p>Ironically, Phillips displays exactly the same kind of rage toward the BBC as she accuses the left of exhibiting toward Murdoch.</p>
<p>Other commentators have weighed in criticizing the BBC for leading too often on the hacking story when there were more serious economic and political stories that should have gained prominence. For example, David Hughes, <italic>The Daily Telegraph</italic>’s chief leader writer, stated:</p>
<p>
<disp-quote><p>The (phone hacking) story has dominated its (BBC) bulletins; it is getting wall-to-wall coverage on the 24-hour news channel; and the Corporation’s editorial big guns have been wheeled out to explore the implications, political as well as commercial. While the allegations are—in David Cameron’s well-chosen words—“truly dreadful”, do they warrant this level of news overkill? (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1527476411425510">Hughes 2011</xref>)</p></disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Tim Montgomery, editor of <italic>Conservative Home</italic> writing for the <italic>Daily Telegraph</italic>, stated:</p>
<p>
<disp-quote><p>the real power is in the hands of the Murdochs’ arch-enemy: the BBC. When it comes to news, 73 percent of us get most of it from television—and the BBC supplies 70 percent of TV news. Its dominance is even greater when you factor in the high-end, high-impact programs that shape the whole current affairs agenda: the <italic>Today</italic> program, <italic>Newsnight, Question Time</italic>. This dominance wouldn’t matter if the BBC provided fair coverage on all the big issues. But it doesn’t. It is actually a broadcaster with many obsessions. One is public spending cuts. Every morning, the <italic>Today</italic> program provides a platform for anti-cuts lobby groups and misses the bigger picture, such as the fact that Britain is spending twice as much on EU bailouts as George Osborne is saving from domestic cuts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1527476411425510">Montgomery 2011</xref>).</p></disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Business as usual? I fear so.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Rupert Murdoch walks into a bar. The barman says, “Don’t worry about it mate, we haven’t got Sky either.”</p>
