<p>As the title indicates, this text by Morgen Witzel (CLS Fellow at the University of Exeter) aims to examine how thinking about management has evolved and changed throughout history. Witzel states he believes that “Students taking classes in the history of management thought will find this text to be the perfect accompaniment to their studies and [it] will be a captivating read for anyone else”.</p>
<p>Witzel explains that his writing style is narrative, utilizing a quotation from Theodore Levitt that: “colourful and lightly documented affirmation works better than tortuously reasoned explanation”. This narrative style ensures that the text flows well and is enjoyable to read. There are various references to morality, and the theme of good versus evil is mooted on a number of occasions, enhancing the colourful affirmation Witzel strives to achieve.</p>
<p>Chapter 1 begins by providing an overview of the text itself, and touches on some of the main areas to be examined. It also clarifies which areas will not be covered, something which is helpful to know, lest the reader be confused by some of the work in the field that is given little or no attention. Subsequent chapters explore the history of management thought in the context of several of its most important developments, with scientific management and human relations being amongst the developments to receive particular attention. Some chapters explore a particularly interesting time period, while others examine one specific aspect of management thought, delving into its history, subsequent development, and resultant practices.</p>
<p>Witzel takes us on a journey from the very beginning of management thought, with the Egyptian, Indian and Chinese experiences being examined in detail. “Management thought in the age of commerce” (Chapter 3) provides a number of perspectives, taking us from the roles of monastic rules to those of the Islamic merchant, amongst others. More “modern” thinking is then explored, with the resultant changes in management thought discussed in parallel with those writers and theorists Witzel deems significant. The discussion continues with the birth of management disciplines and the concept of management gurus being espoused, culminating in a review of management thought in our current internet age. The conclusions provided are helpful in reviewing the array of material discussed thus far, and although somewhat brief, do pinpoint areas of both crisis and development. Reflection sections are included within each chapter, and are used to highlight themes which Witzel feels deserve more detailed exploration.</p>
<p>This text provides a good overview of organizational and managerial evolution, making it useful to those who specialize not only in managerial history, but also management accounting, as it would provide accounting students with an appreciation of the organizational context in which they will be operating. Those who teach Accounting and Business History modules are also likely to find elements of interest; for instance, Taylor and Chandler and the background to wider economic and structural changes. It is true that Witzel provides little information about developments in accounting, but for those who teach broader courses it should not be dismissed out of hand.</p>
<p>Witzel states that “The purpose, once again, is to come to a better understanding of management thinking in general terms rather than to explore each and every individual strand”. Overall, the book provides a narrative on the evolution of management thought, contains some helpful examples to aid contextualization and provides an exploration of some little known thinkers which expands readers’ knowledge of the emergence of some crucial ideas. However, there is a sense of incompleteness, as some areas are merely touched upon and more detail would have enabled the reader to achieve greater understanding of some very important periods in history. Witzel is unapologetic when detailing the areas which are given little attention, or ignored altogether, but many readers will feel that the omissions are too large to achieve the aims discussed at the outset.</p>
<p>Witzel’s concluding remarks are very interesting, as he makes some fairly strong comments concerning the lack of non-academics publishing in this area. Given the pressure academics are under to produce research output, his concerns possibly deserve more than passing attention.</p>
