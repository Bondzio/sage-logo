<p>If we live, as we are told, in an urbanizing world, then the problem of contemporary political analysis must be tackled by rethinking politics as practices of urbanizing spaces and subjectivities. This article questions whether relational ontologies of urban spatiotemporality and spatialized inter-subjectivity are sufficient as bases for analyses of the contemporary forms of politics enacted within practices and processes of urbanization. I argue that they are not, and suggest instead that urbanization puts into play multiple, overlapping aporetic boundaries between nature and culture, rural and urban, nature and urban, and ultimately between politics and its limits.</p>

<title>Introduction: The Question of Politics in an Urbanizing World</title>
<p>If we live, as we are told, in an urbanizing world, then we must analyze the ways in which the spatiotemporal configurations and subjective practices of politics are being urbanized. The global city<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0304375412465040">1</xref>
</sup> has been taken up across a broad range of literature as an empirical object of analysis, as a methodological tool of analysis, and ultimately as an ontological claim about the contemporary condition of global urban life and its particular political openings and closures. The core claim about the character of the global city hinges on its perceived relationality:<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0304375412465040">2</xref>
</sup> rather than being territorially defined, the global city is understood as a complex network of interactions, exchanges, and flows that function in spatiotemporal terms but cannot be contained within bounded spaces or singular time spans. Similarly, inhabitants of the global city are never fixed in single spaces and simple relationships but are constituted through processes of mutual engagements and forced and unforced migrations. These new relational ontologies of the global city put into play new ontologies of space (as open, networked, unfolding, and becoming) and new ontologies of subjectivity (as disaggregated, embodied but not unified, actants but not agents). From these ontological claims about the global city, and its redefined spatiality and subjectivity, flow a set of attendant political claims, such as what it might look like to gain a “right to the (global) city,”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0304375412465040">3</xref>
</sup> or to develop “a politics of grounded connectedness . . . a relational ethics [that would make possible] very different geographies of affect and of loyalty.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0304375412465040">4</xref>
</sup> In other words, a new relational ontology of the global city is said to offer insight into new political openings.</p>
<p>There are important differences in how a relational ontology of the global city is developed and applied; yet, there is surprisingly little debate about whether it is an adequate place from which to begin our considerations of these complex problems. This article argues that different ways of thinking about the possibility of global urbanization lead to different ways of thinking about and effecting the <italic>urbanization of politics</italic>. Despite their focus on new human and built geographies, arguments about the relational ontologies of a global urban condition lead to a surprisingly common vision of politics as sovereign: if not the sovereignty of the state, then the sovereignty of the self-authorizing individual. This article seeks to shift attention away from the global city and toward urbanization, specifically to narratives about transitions between rural and urban, nature and culture, and state-based and urbanized politics. Against the ontological status of the global city and its invocations of sovereign authority, urbanization enables a political analysis of the complicated, contradictory, and violent processes and practices that are said to be pushing and pulling peoples and places toward an ever-more urban future.</p>
<p>There is a tension between those who say that we are experiencing for the first time a condition of global urbanization and those who argue that we have been living “urbanism as a way of life” for as long as we have been modern.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0304375412465040">5</xref>
</sup> I am not concerned with participating in a conversation over the single, right definition of urbanization understood in either empirical or ontological terms, nor in efforts to date urbanization as a historical condition. Rather, I will argue that attempts to draw boundaries between the premodern and the modern, as well as between the modern and some new condition into which we are supposed to be transitioning, are intimately connected with the range of other boundaries that sustain claims about urbanization as a transition narrative. Thus, this article enacts a pause in the face of these expectations to place itself at a particular moment within these narratives. It attempts to open the space and time necessary to investigate what it is about urbanization and our conceptions of urbanization that challenge our ability to develop political analyses capable of keeping up with the very radical change in political life that urbanization is supposed to entail. The goal is to develop a line of analysis that can provide us with a more nuanced and productive understanding of what we mean, and what effects we produce, when we talk about the urbanization of politics, in both spatiotemporal and subjective terms.</p>
<p>In order to develop an alternative account of the urbanization of politics, I first argue that relationality can be approached not in terms of competing ontologies but as a multitude of <italic>logics</italic> through which co-constitutive interactions can potentially be governed. More importantly, as modes of governing and self-governing, these logics operate as <italic>political logics</italic>, a recognition that is missing in the relational ontologies of the global city and even of urbanization. Second, I argue that the common transition narratives of urbanization would be better understood as aporetic boundary practices, where the relational co-constitution of the terms is continually negotiated, produced, and undermined. Aporetic boundaries have their own distinctive spatiotemporal and subjective configuration, dynamically constructing and subverting their idealized origins and end points. Recognizing the dynamic of aporetic boundaries as the political logic of urbanization begins to explain the distinctive and troubling tendency to re-invoke the politics of sovereignty. As such, I argue that the transition narratives of urbanization mask a much more crucial narrative about the boundary between politics and its limits: within the boundary, politics is possible and without, impossible; yet, the instability of this boundary makes politics continually both necessary and impossible, leading to a consistent pressure to resort to sovereign authorizations to secure politics.</p>
<p>The aporia, as a concept, has been criticized as being too negative to be used effectively as a tool of positive political practice and analysis.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0304375412465040">6</xref>
</sup> More significantly, as a claim about the central characteristic of “the political,” the aporia has been criticized as being intimately connected to practices of political authorization, idealization, and prescription.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0304375412465040">7</xref>
</sup> Of course, such claims lead to the single biggest problem that any such analysis must address, namely, what does this use of the term “politics” mean? As Warren Magnusson argues,<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0304375412465040">8</xref>
</sup> political scientists, political theorists, and others who write with politics in mind are far too quick to use the word and hope that readers will bring to bear a set of assumptions that are close to the ones the author holds, often without knowing it. Taking an aporetic line of analysis seems to compound this problem, as Magnusson suggests that by holding onto a belief in an aporia at the center of politics, we forego the capacity to develop an account of politics. Indeed, he argues that this inability to say anything certain about politics simultaneously opens the door between analyses of the actual and idealizations of the possible and effaces our own academic authorizations of the political ideal. This article makes progress toward a more explicit account of politics that takes this difficulty of aporetic logic as central: not as a single, central aporia of politics, but as multiple aporetic boundary practices, each of which makes claims to center politics by designating the boundary between politics and its limits.</p>
<p>A careful analysis of these aporetic boundary practices is essential for developing an account of politics, but it leads to an account that problematizes any attempts to make politics ontological. Thus, the account developed here does not make claims about the ontological nature of urbanization or of politics, but rather uses aporetic logic to analyze urbanization, opening up the problem of talking about urbanization, and politics itself, in ontological terms. By using relationality to politicize the aporia as a method, and this aporetic method to politicize relationality, I demonstrate how an aporetic political logic can be used to develop a different account of the urbanization of politics and to respond accordingly. Aporetic urbanization undermines any capacity to make ontological claims about the global urban and about politics itself, forcing an ongoing engagement with the practices that create political openings and political closures through contests over the meaning and materiality of rural and urban, nature and culture.</p>

<title>New Geographies of Relational Ontologies</title>
<p>Contemporary literatures on the dramatic shift toward a global urban condition frequently use the figure of the global city to capture the complexities in practices, forms, and spatiotemporal configurations that seem to give rise to and result from this shift. The global city is the result of complex processes: processes of creation and destruction; processes of migration; processes of changing modes of production and consumption; processes, ultimately, of urbanization. Yet attempts to define the global city in processual terms ultimately tend to rely on ontological claims about what the global city is, or must be, to propel their arguments toward what the global city could be, and more often than not, what it should be. In what follows, I focus on works by Ash Amin and Nigel Thrift<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0304375412465040">9</xref>
</sup> and Doreen Massey,<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0304375412465040">10</xref>
</sup> two influential accounts of new geographies suitable to the global city. Both redefine relational ontologies, spatiality, and subjectivity in order to propose, ultimately, a renewed form of politics. Despite Massey’s very effective critique of the universalizing tendencies present in Amin and Thrift’s text, in the end both analyses run into a very similar political problem: their reliance on ontological claims ultimately lead to prescriptions of sovereign modes of politics.</p>
<p>Amin and Thrift state that “process” and “potential” are the watchwords of their new urban ontology.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0304375412465040">11</xref>
</sup> They argue that the global city must be understood in relational terms, by which they mean processes of intersection, mediation, and the emergence of the ever-new.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0304375412465040">12</xref>
</sup> This relational redefinition is both spatial and subjective. First, because the global city encompasses spatial and temporal dislocations and geographic distances beyond the boundaries of any given city, they argue that the relations at the core of the global city must be understood as “distantiated.” This focus on distantiation requires a subsequent redefinition of space and place—away from Cartesian universal space and Aristotelian singular places and toward a sense of place “not so much as enduring sites but as <italic>moments of encounter</italic>, not so much as ‘presents,’ fixed in space and time but as variable events; twists and fluxes in inter-relation.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0304375412465040">13</xref>
</sup> Second, this relational ontology of the global city requires a redefinition of subjectivity: “human subjects which we conveniently describe as a unity of body and purpose are in fact aggregates of numerous subject positions which are parts of numerous networks . . . shuffling between particular spaces and times.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0304375412465040">14</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>The challenge, as they outline it, is to rethink urban community, and ultimately urban politics, in the global city, when political community is no longer based in face-to-face relations between unified subjects in shared places. Teasing out the political implications of their relational ontology leads to an extended discussion on how to renew urban citizenship and democracy. Among their prescriptions, they suggest a form of town-hall conversation that can increase residents’ capacity as citizens<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0304375412465040">15</xref>
</sup> and various policies that can institutionalize practices of engagement in a democratic urban realm.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0304375412465040">16</xref>
</sup> This work to lay out a new ontology of the global city therefore ends with a familiar political vision: effective political relations need to be inculcated face-to-face at the local level, and effective political policies need to be institutionalized by the state.</p>
<p>The notions of multiple networks, intimate connectivity, and distantiation that Amin and Thrift develop are a means whereby everything and everyone are brought into a universal condition of “the global city.” Thus, in contrast to the political <italic>prescriptions</italic> offered by Amin and Thrift, the political <italic>work</italic> that their text effects is ultimately one mode of <italic>urbanizing politics</italic>: the text functions as another means through which the perceived opportunities and possibilities of politics, in its practices, forms, and spatiotemporal configurations, are being urbanized. This reading suggests why there is such an incessant need to stake out new or revised urban ontologies: because what is at stake in claims about the character of this “city,” as object, method, or essence, is a claim about the nature of political relationships into which we are being pulled, pulling ourselves, and pulling others, in ways that are conflicted, painful, and often violent.</p>
<p>However, despite the very political contest at the core of claims about ontologies of the global city, ultimately the relational account proposed by Amin and Thrift serves to renaturalize the city, and thus the process of urbanization. It does this in two ways. First, as I will argue in greater detail below when I consider the transition narratives embedded within urbanization, claims about the city are always already claims about its relationship with and against nature. Thus, ontological claims about the city rely on parallel ontologies of nature, whether implicitly or explicitly. Second, the move to address the city and nature in ontological terms puts the focus on what is inherent, on a state of being in the world, and therefore out of the realm of the contingent effects of human activities and practices. To make an ontological claim is to attempt to circumvent negotiation, to rely on one’s authority to escape the process of contest. Thus to naturalize is to depoliticize,<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0304375412465040">17</xref>
</sup> and attempts to urbanize politics via ontology ultimately serve to depoliticize urbanization. Paradoxically, by renaturalizing and depoliticizing the global city through their relational ontology, the urbanization of politics that Amin and Thrift pursue has the effect of returning to the exact place they hope to avoid: politics is displaced by a form of sovereign authority and urbanization is depoliticized.</p>
<p>Massey’s <italic>For Space</italic>
<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0304375412465040">18</xref>
</sup> is an influential critique of the universalisms and institutionalized politics present in the relational ontology of the global city presented by Amin and Thrift. She is very clear in suggesting that too many relational accounts have universalizing tendencies.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-0304375412465040">19</xref>
</sup> She uses the term “conjunction” to talk about the meeting of the simultaneous trajectories in her relational spatiality, yet also emphasizes the possibility of “disjunction,” or the allowance for the nonmeeting of these trajectories.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-0304375412465040">20</xref>
</sup> This emphasis on different trajectories is presented in social and cultural terms, as practices and ways of life that can exist coevally, but is also given in more directly spatial terms as the possibility of places developing along different paths and into different built and institutional forms. She therefore criticizes the more common move, represented by Amin and Thrift, to align urbanization with globalization as a universalizing process into which all are necessarily being drawn in the same way, and with the same result.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-0304375412465040">21</xref>
</sup> While most global cities literature relies in one way or another on this transition, Massey highlights this as a problematic spatial claim that needs to be complicated, introducing the notion of “place beyond place” in an attempt to find a way that “the local” (as the particular) can continue to exist within a (universal) condition of the global (city).<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-0304375412465040">22</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>However, despite this critique, she is pulled into the conversation about global cities and global urbanization in two significant ways. First, she does not challenge the foundations or implications of using a relational ontology, but rather addresses the weakness of Amin and Thrift<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-0304375412465040">23</xref>
</sup> by offering a new (and arguably more sophisticated) ontology of relationality. She challenges us to see the implications of her relational ontology across a number of related concerns—intersubjective and intercultural relations, as well as rural and urban relations, nature and culture, and local and global—but it is clear that relationality itself is a solution to be developed, not a problematic to be understood. Second, the dominance of the equation between the global city as our contemporary condition and relational ontologies is such that she must still develop her relational spatial ontology in such a way that it can account for the global city. Thus, within her focus on developing an argument for relational space as opposed to closed, universalizing modes of thinking, making, and living space, the global city is present not only as a universal spatiality but also as a particular place where the implications of relational space are seen at their most extreme.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-0304375412465040">24</xref>
</sup> Her relationality attempts to maintain space for the nonurban “place,” while recognizing that the global city is exemplary of relational space. This is especially the case when she discusses the political implications of her spatial ontology, which she reads primarily within the context of the (global) city. In other words, as with many others writing directly and indirectly about the global city and a global urban condition, Massey argues that a relational ontology provides the necessary foundation for developing a political perspective on how processes of global urbanization might be engaged.</p>
<p>The influence of the current practice of urbanizing politics, as defined above, is therefore pervasive: in order to talk about political openings and closures in the contemporary world, one must begin from a particular ontological perspective on the relational global city as our fundamental condition. This starting place has common effects, despite how it is developed in particular cases. Thus, Massey challenges us to consider relational accounts of space (and space-time) as the condition of possibility for politics, understood as relationships unbound by a pregiven, certain future and a pregiven, closed space.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-0304375412465040">25</xref>
</sup> Ultimately, for Massey, there are no “politics” without relationships, and relationships are conditional upon the openness of relational space, and subsequently relational understandings of space and place, rural and urban, nature and culture. And yet her new relational ontology ends at an all-to-similar political claim. Politics, she claims, must involve developing an orientation toward the possibility of meeting others on different trajectories, and the cultivation of an ethic of care and hospitality to all met. The necessary politics, ultimately, is an individualized ethics, an individually held set of values and an individually decided set of practices.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-0304375412465040">26</xref>
</sup> It is, as she says, an <italic>orientation toward</italic> the world, an orientation that indicates both a spatial location and a form of subjectivity. This ethics puts the individual in a particular form of relationship with the world, where questions of uncertainty, negotiation, and conflict are brought back to the individual to decide based on personal value judgments. In this ethicization of politics, sovereignty is smuggled back into the picture in the guise of the sovereign individual subject with the capacity and authority to judge and decide <italic>before</italic> engaging. Thus, her relational ontology of (urban) space leads to a subject who is spatially apart, holding an orientation toward the world, rather than one who is embedded in and defined through practices of negotiating political relationalities.</p>
<p>Attempts to develop new analytical approaches to politics and new (more progressive, democratic, or inclusive) practices of politics by developing new ontologies of the global city therefore seem to lead to a conclusion of naturalized sovereign politics that is precisely what many literatures are hoping to avoid.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn27-0304375412465040">27</xref>
</sup> These accounts argue from a relational ontology of the global city to an ontology of politics, including claims of what and where politics in an urban world is or can be, what sort of subjectivity is produced or can participate, and what configurations of space-time require them or are materialized through them. And yet, there is no concerted analysis of how one might begin to talk about the politics of an urban world in the context of dominant conceptions of what modern politics is, how it is practiced, and its spatiotemporal productions: thus, the route from new ontologies of the global city to old characterizations of politics as sovereignty becomes an ongoing problem.</p>
<p>Rather than try to fix this problem by offering another new ontology of the global city, I want to question why it is that these relational ontologies lead so easily to sovereign politics. I suggest that we can understand the dynamics of this problem by investigating points of departure other than an ontological global city. If the global city is indeed a complex of processes, then we will do well to shift our focus from the global city as an object, toward urbanization as a process. The notion of process is embedded in the very linguistics of the word urbanization, whose suffixes entail the process of becoming like or being made like the urban.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn28-0304375412465040">28</xref>
</sup> What happens, what opens up politically, if we keep the focus on the process of urbanization, rather than the all-too-easily objectified and ontologized global city? I argue that the crucial insights enabled by this shift are political, not the least of which is insight into the politics embedded in this claim of a transition toward new practices, forms, and spatiotemporal configurations of politics on a global urban scale.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0304375412465040">
<title>Transition Narratives and Relational Practices of Urbanization</title>
<p>As noted, shifting analysis to urbanization enables focus to remain on the complex and contradictory processes and practices involved, as the very form of the word means “to become like” or “be made like” the urban. On one hand, this shifts attention away from a condition of being urban and back toward the processes of becoming, a shift that both Amin and Thrift and Massey, in their ways, also pursue. On the other hand, it highlights the complications at work within “urbanization,” in conceptual, practical, and political terms. In conceptual terms, urbanization, as the process of becoming urban or being made like the urban, must logically precede the urban itself, whether conceived as a materialization in space-time<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn29-0304375412465040">29</xref>
</sup> or as a way of life.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn30-0304375412465040">30</xref>
</sup> On this understanding, the process of urbanizing or being urbanized must exist or occur before the state of being urban is possible. However, if urbanization is the process of becoming like or being made like the urban, then the definition of a nonurban state of human community and the possibility of the urban are both logically assumed prior to a process of urbanization. On this understanding, urbanization as a transition from one condition to the other cannot logically be named without the concepts of the nonurban and the urban, yet neither of these can exist except as a result of a process of urbanization. In practical terms, the possibilities of becoming like or being made like the urban emphasize that people are embedded within and participate in urbanization in differential ways. The inter-subjective practices and spatiotemporal configurations of urbanization are engaged, but not necessarily willingly. In political terms, this means that “becoming like” the urban is not at all the same mode of transition as “being made like” the urban. The former suggests a self-directed and self-authorized process, whereas the latter suggests a process guided by an external force or authority. Thus, the difference between “becoming like” and “being made like” denotes another boundary, between claims about being subjects of immanent politics and claims about being subjectivized into transcendent or transcendental models of political community. Ultimately, this strikes at the heart of the more optimistic political claims that global urbanization represents a transition beyond modern sovereign politics.</p>
<p>Thus, it is crucial to give attention both to the transition narratives at play in urbanization and to how these transitions are being effected, asking about the method or modality through which urbanization functions. If urbanization is a process of conflicted and contradictory transitions and transformations, then it is crucial to pay attention to the forms that these transitions are supposed to take. In other words, what are the practices, forms, and spatiotemporal configurations that we are moving away from, and what new forms are taking their place? More importantly, if the goal is to develop a political analysis of urbanization, how are these transitions and transformations being effected?</p>
<p>The fundamental transition narrative focuses on the perceived end point of the process of urbanization—the urban or the city—in which case the opposing pole, the point of origin, is the rural. At its most basic, this account focuses on the transformation of rural populations into city dwellers and on the transformation of rural lands into urban built forms. It also encompasses a more complicated series of registers that articulate the transformation from the rural to the urban in spatiotemporal, sociocultural, economic, material, and psychosubjective terms. All too often, the transition from rural to urban is recast in terms of a transformation of nature into culture. This again is thought across a range of registers, including the economic (the local, face-to-face exchanges of the rural vs. the complex cultures of production and consumption within a global urban condition); the sociocultural (the more “authentic” and sometimes more “brutish” forms of rural life vs. the civil, cultural, and civilizing forces of the city); the material and geographic (the transformation of pristine wildernesses or pastoral land-uses into the highly manufactured and mediated built forms and intensive uses of urban environments); the psychosubjective (the simpler, less neurotic, more inherent modes of rural subjectivity vs. forms of urban neurosis such as Simmel’s protective <italic>blasé</italic> attitude, isolation, and schizophrenia); and the spatiotemporal (the traditional “past” of the rural, with its naive or folk art vs. the modern and even postmodern avant-garde progressive work of the city).<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn31-0304375412465040">31</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>There are powerful spatial and temporal elements within these primary transition narratives, which begin to emerge through the above outline. First, there is the tendency to equate urbanization as a transition from rural to urban with a claim about the transition in the spatial organization of the world, from ways of life that are fundamentally local to ways of life that are becoming irrevocably global. As mentioned above, Massey provides the notion of “place beyond place” to complicate this claim; yet, she also repeats it through her emphasis on the global city as exemplar of the relational ontology of space. Second, it also becomes apparent that this transition narrative embeds a doubly strong claim about temporality. The transition from rural to urban is presented as a transition from the past to the future, from traditional premodernity to modernity, and potentially from modernity to a postmodern beyond. At the same time, the reliance on claims about transitions and transformations maintain a temporal flow that is ultimately linear, and particularly modern.</p>
<p>This central transition from rural to urban, and all its permutations, complications, and resonances, suggests that one of the most consistent patterns in our narratives about urbanization is to cast it as a transition from the innocence of nature to the maturity of the urban. In more complicated terms, as developed within the urban political ecology literature,<sup>

</sup> urbanization is seen as a relational mode of establishing and transforming interactions between nature and the city, as the two dialectical poles of human existence. In more complicated terms still, urbanization becomes the relational process that produces the very possibility of “nature” and “the city,”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn33-0304375412465040">33</xref>
</sup> as we characterize our nostalgic sense of where we believe we have come from as “nature” and our idealizations, imaginaries and visions of where we might yet be going as “the urban.”</p>
<p>And yet it is well known that both “nature” and “the city” already have long and complicated relations, not only with their produced others (“culture” and “the rural”) but also with the production of politics in general and with the production of a claim about a distinctive modern politics in particular. An analysis of the politics of urbanization therefore requires a threefold disruption.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn34-0304375412465040">34</xref>
</sup> First, it requires disrupting the existing role of nature within political thought, as the condition of both impossibility and possibility of politics.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn35-0304375412465040">35</xref>
</sup> Second, it similarly requires disrupting the existing role of the city as both the condition of impossibility and the condition of possibility for politics.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn36-0304375412465040">36</xref>
</sup> Finally, if politicizing urbanization requires disrupting the roles that nature and the urban have played in making particular visions of politics both possible and impossible, then it is unavoidable to raise the question of what is left of “politics” after these conceptual disruptions are pursued, or alternately, how disruptive our political analyses of urbanization can be if these analyses still depend upon an unexamined use of politics itself. What does it mean to talk about politics in the context of urbanization, when the concepts and institutions of politics have been made possible (thinkable) and impossible (unworkable) by the practices that construct nature and the city as distinct but inextricably bound? And what would it look like to politicize urbanization and urbanize politics in modes that engage, rather than reproduce, sovereignty as a powerful practice, with powerful effects, within the problematic constitution of “modern” politics?</p>
<p>In the following sections, I suggest that a relational understanding of urbanization is not, in itself, the problem. Rather, if the goal is to develop a political analysis of urbanization that can be attentive to the existing uses of nature and the city to predetermine an ontology of politics, then the problem lies in thinking about relationality in ontological terms, a practice that effects its depoliticization. I argue in the next section, as an alternative to the ontological arguments of Amin and Thrift and Massey, that the logic of aporetic boundary practices can offer a method for politicizing relationality. I will then argue, in subsequent sections, that embedded within these boundary practices that produce claims about urbanization as a transition from rural to urban, nature to culture, and so on, is a further set of boundary practices that produce claims about urbanization as a transition from one practice, form, and space-time of politics to another. The aporetic logic simultaneously produces a claim about the transition from premodern rural life to the essentially modern character of urbanization and about the transition from the individual subject, the modern state, and the international state system to a system of global cities within the urbanizing process of the comprehensive global city. Both versions of this claim about political transitions depend upon practices that try to determine the boundaries between politics and its limits.</p>

<title>Politicizing Relationality</title>
<p>If urbanization captures a range of relational interactions and transitions, then it is troubling that even a sophisticated account of relationality, which Massey’s most certainly is, still manages to end with a claim about politics that holds practices of sovereignty at its core. The drive to develop new ontologies and new politics of the global city—or, as in Massey’s case, an ontology of space that can open space for a new politics adequate for the complexities of life in a globally if differentially urbanizing world—continues to sit in tension with the forms of politics that are the end point of their analyses. The first step to unraveling this problem, I suggest, is to become far more explicit about the possibility of different <italic>logics of relationality</italic>, as opposed to different <italic>ontologies of relationality</italic>. The second step is to <italic>politicize</italic> this notion of a logic of relationality, understanding it as modes of governing and self-governing relational practices. The third step is to develop an account of a political logic of relationality that explains the puzzling features that keep reappearing: why is it that ontological claims about the global city, or even about urbanization itself, lead us back to a politics of sovereignty?</p>
<p>Massey opens the possibility of thinking about relationality in terms of the “conjunction.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn37-0304375412465040">37</xref>
</sup> The conjunction is particularly useful for investigating the question of the logics of relationality. In grammatical terms, a conjunction is the part of speech that governs and gives meaning to the relations between different parts in a sentence. However, there is more than one conjunction, and each performs a different logical operation within the sentence. Furthermore, a conjunction must be understood as a practice, not as an inherent or immobile meaning: poststructuralism suggests that the logic of a conjunction cannot preexist its performance within a particular sentence. Therefore, just as there are different conjunctions with different performative logics, there are different possible logics of relationality that can only be understood as specific, contextualized practices whose effects are therefore contingent.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn38-0304375412465040">38</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Further, if the logic of relationality <italic>governs</italic> the form of the relation in question, then relationality takes on a political import that is rarely considered. In this sense, relationality must be understood as practices of governing and self-governing the constitutive processes. It is therefore not sufficient to say that the rural and the urban, or nature and culture, are relationally co-constituted; instead, a political analysis must ask how the co-constitutive process is governed, how the interactions are mobilized, shaped, controlled, or negotiated. While Amin and Thrift and Massey have much to say about the political <italic>implications</italic> of a relational reading of space, and of relationality as a condition of possibility for political practices, they do not consider relationality itself as a political practice. Therefore, they smooth over the complicated debates, contests, negotiations, contradictions, and fundamental challenges within and between the logics of relationality, rather than just between the terms, subjectivities, or cultures meeting in the relation.</p>
<p>If the logic of relationality defines how the practice of governing relations is effected, then analyzing the logic of relationality that is at the heart of processes of urbanization enables us to begin to speak of a <italic>political logic of urbanization</italic>. A political logic is not concerned with ontological claims and certainties, but rather with the mode of governing embedded within the proposed form of relationality and with the effects of these governing practices. I have argued that a core feature of urbanization is its claim to complex transition narratives. A relational account of these transitions between rural and urban, nature and culture, and the other pairings, leaves us unable to ever say, exactly and precisely, what the rural <italic>is</italic> or what the urban <italic>is</italic>, what nature <italic>is</italic> or what culture <italic>is</italic>, as these are always changing, not only materially but also conceptually, as a result of the urbanization process. The terms through which urbanization is defined and discussed are undecidable, and thus so is urbanization itself. In other words, urbanization is marked as a site of multiple aporias, and the political problem of urbanization requires us to think about its constitutive relationality in terms of aporetic practices, forms, and spatiotemporal configurations.</p>

<title>Politicizing the Aporia</title>
<p>The “aporia” is a popular concept in contemporary political thought, and yet much work still needs to be done to politicize this term. Magnusson,<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn39-0304375412465040">39</xref>
</sup> discussing Massey’s <italic>For Space</italic>, characterizes an aporia as a black hole, a spatial and temporal zone of fundamental uncertainty. He argues that the reliance on an “aporia of politics” by Massey and others generates a particular political stance: an uncertainty about and inability to know politics that lead to continual appeals to idealizations of politics. In other words, those who hold onto an aporia at the center of politics forego the capacity to develop an account of politics; and indeed, this inability simultaneously opens the door between analyses of the actual and idealizations of the possible and effaces academic authorizations of a political ideal. The reliance on an aporia of politics enables authors to make claims <italic>about</italic> politics without having to risk anything by giving an account of politics. Magnusson argues that instead of the spatial and political black hole of an aporia, we should see political space as “an opening,” an analysis of the opportunities for engaged, transformative practice in relation to a given configuration of political forces.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn40-0304375412465040">40</xref>
</sup> In this section, I outline a careful analysis of the political logic of the aporia as a concept, with its specific spatiotemporal and subjective configurations. In the following section, I demonstrate how and why this aporetic logic provides a method for developing an account of politics that can come to terms with the complexity of urbanization as it plays with and shifts the boundaries of political openings and political closures.</p>
<p>The first step is to ask how an aporia works: how does it manage to generate the cycle of political idealizations that Magnusson notes? And, taking his point that these idealizations are veiled attempts at political authorization and thus return us to a politics of sovereignty, how might the aporetic logic explain why relational ontologies of urbanization so quickly return to sovereign politics in one form or another? By examining the concept of the aporia as developed by Jacques Derrida<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn41-0304375412465040">41</xref>
</sup> and Michel Foucault,<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn42-0304375412465040">42</xref>
</sup> I develop a different, more politicized account than its characterization as a black hole of uncertainty. Instead, I suggest that an aporia can be understood as a particular form of spatiotemporal opening, one that generates a drive to closure that can never be successful, thus returning us to other openings.</p>
<p>Derrida defines an aporia as a line, boundary, or distinction that creates the possibility, necessity, and impossibility of the delimited entities or concepts.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn43-0304375412465040">43</xref>
</sup> As the condition of possibility, the aporetic boundary enacts a separation that creates the concepts or entities on either side. This boundary must necessarily be drawn for the entities to be known as such, and its delimitation conveys necessity in turn to the entities. Their separation raises the issue of their reconciliation, and thus an aporia proposes their reunification as a necessary outcome to their necessary separation. However, an aporia simultaneously generates the impossibility of these entities being considered stable or self-identical and generates the impossibility of reconciling the two entities that are constituted by the split. Thus, an aporia represents, for Derrida, “the difficult or the impracticable, here the impossible, passage” between the constituted entities.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn44-0304375412465040">44</xref>
</sup> Aporetic boundaries do not exist independently but are produced through practices of delimitation, and an aporia cannot be identified in a simple knowing subject/object of knowledge relationship but can only be encountered through a practice of engagement. Ultimately, the nature of an aporia is not given, but its characteristics can be noted and its effects analyzed: it does not exist “as such,” but is simultaneously a concept of understanding, a boundary practice, and a material effect. Understanding an aporia in these terms opens the possibility of identifying the conceptual, discursive, and material practices that produce and unsettle particular aporetic boundaries.</p>
<p>An aporia is therefore brought to life through specific subjective practices, and it takes on a specific spatiotemporal configuration. In the Foucauldian analysis, an aporetic boundary is the site of a “hiatus,” the conceptual, discursive, and epistemic space between the relational terms.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn45-0304375412465040">45</xref>
</sup> However, the hiatus, which Foucault describes purely in spatial terms, is also a temporal figure, denoting a pause, a resting or remaining still within a flow of movement. An aporia therefore also has a specific temporality, a distinctive movement, and a unique momentum: it is a practice of folding and unfolding borders, of inverting and reverting, combining and separating. The space constituted within an aporia opens the capacity for a particular logic of movement that, while attempting to progress, is one of circularity and return.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn46-0304375412465040">46</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>The distinctive spatiotemporal configuration of an aporia points to its inherent instability, the impossibility of ontological certainty that an aporia produces. An aporia is brought into being by boundary practices, tracings that establish a border, constitute entities on either side of the border, and generate the desire to reconcile these entities. By functioning as the possibility, necessity, and impossibility of these entities, aporetic boundary practices both enable and threaten what they create. As Derrida recognizes, “there is a problem as soon as the edge-line is threatened. And it is threatened from its first tracing.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn47-0304375412465040">47</xref>
</sup> Not only are the entities on either side of a boundary threatened with constitutive impossibility, but also, ultimately, the boundary itself is uncertain, unreliable, and threatened. An aporia cannot have ontological status, and neither can the entities—material, discursive, conceptual—that it constitutes, whether that be the global city as political community or the self-authorizing individual as political subject.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0304375412465040">
<title>Urbanization as an Aporetic Political Practice</title>
<p>Therefore, by analyzing the aporia according to the notion of a political logic of relationality as developed above, I argue that it is not simply a spatiotemporal gap or a conceptual black hole but a boundary practice through which relationality is governed according to its particular logic. In other words, an aporia is marked as a practice of establishing, contesting, and redefining boundaries, but it is more than that. It is the source of the distinctive pattern apparent in the way these contests, negotiations, and redefinitions are undertaken, and the distinctive pattern of their effects.</p>
<p>The distinctive spatiotemporal configuration of an aporia is both as an open space-time that is the “hiatus” between the terms under contest and as a momentum that generates new forms of relations and new forms of idealized finality. If the relational boundaries between rural and urban, nature and culture, are not spatiotemporal “transitions” but practices that are governed by an aporetic logic, then the practices that distinguish the pairs of terms and thus constitute them are also the practices that always threaten the terms as constituted. This generates the constant search for a new boundary between rural and urban, nature and culture: a nonlinear momentum of urbanization itself. This in turn leads to the need for continual attempts to resolidify the terms, through practices that police a given balance between rural and urban, nature and culture, on one hand, and that idealize other possible resolutions on the other. The effects of these practices can take institutional and built forms and spatiotemporal configurations, but always contingently. The boundaries between rural and urban, nature and culture are under contest and thus not only always uncertain, but always threatened.</p>
<p>Similarly, an aporia also has distinctive subjective configurations, where subjectivity is always an embodied, intersubjective practice of residing within and shifting the contours of the hiatus by engaging with its multiple boundaries. Rather than possessing universal rights to urban citizenship<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn48-0304375412465040">48</xref>
</sup> or cultivating an ethical orientation of hospitality and openness to peoples and places,<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn49-0304375412465040">49</xref>
</sup> aporetic subjectivity is an ongoing practice of negotiating the boundaries of possibility: spatiotemporal possibility, subjective possibility, communal possibility, conceptual possibility: political possibility in its many registers. Just as the instability of the boundaries can lead to practices of idealization, so too can this subjective instability lead to practices of authorization: attempts to mimic and reproduce the stability and security of an envisioned sovereign subject by laying claim to a right to define and control the boundaries under conflict, particularly but not exclusively the boundaries of the “self.”</p>
<p>If the political logic that governs the relationality of urbanization is an aporetic one, then the politics of urbanization becomes an encounter with the possibility, necessity, and impossibility of “politics.” This analysis both opens the aporia as concept and opens possibilities for developing an aporetic method of political analysis. Instead of a spatiotemporal black hole whose uncertainty makes political analysis impossible, it operates as a hiatus, an opening for spatiotemporal configurations and subjective practices that necessarily create and sustain the possibilities of politics, as well as practices that close it, occlude it, or attempt to secure it and therefore make it impossible.</p>
<p>Rather than escaping the need to give an account of politics, analyzing the logic of relationality at work in practices of urbanization in terms of aporetic boundary practices becomes a means of developing a political account of these practices, in the sense that it offers an account of how these relations are governed in and through concrete and conceptual acts. Further, it provides a much needed account of how the concern for urbanization as an immanent human process continually reverts to attempts to shape, govern, and control urbanization on one hand, and to pursue idealizations of the urban on the other. This reading of an aporetic logic of urbanization, with its processes of constitution through contest, instability and threat, and idealized stability, also provides an account of why “politics” is haunted not only by the image of the <italic>polis</italic>, as Magnusson notes,<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn50-0304375412465040">50</xref>
</sup> but also by the image of the urban (as the idealized end point that we can never reach) and of nature (as the idealized origin to which we can never return). In other words, an aporetic political logic begins to explain the complicated interplay between “becoming like” and “being made like” that is at the heart of urbanization.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0304375412465040">
<title>Politics and Its Limits</title>
<p>Attempts to develop new relational ontologies of global urbanization claim to provide avenues to develop new and more stable spaces, forms, and practices of politics. This shifts analytical attention from the problem of politics as practices that constitute “the world” and frames it instead as a problem of the ontology of a world within which politics is supposed to reside.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn51-0304375412465040">51</xref>
</sup> And yet, the insecurity that is a core feature of an aporetic logic generates the appearance of ontological categories under constant threat, which in turn generates attempts to stabilize and resecure what is threatened by appealing to the possibility for a new, more stable ontology. These appeals to and idealizations of ontological certainty function as regulative ideas in the Kantian sense: in order to make the ideal of ontological stability actual in the world, we must regulate ourselves as if it were the case, despite the impossibility of knowing whether the content of the ontology, or the possibility of ontological stability itself, is true, real, or actual. Thus, an aporia, precisely through the impossibility of ontology that it creates, generates a practice of reconstructing political ontologies through the ongoing articulation of regulative ideas: not only of the urban and of nature but also of the subject, of authority, of modernity, and so on.</p>
<p>More importantly, aporetic instability and the impossibility of ontological certainty generate the notion of political ontology as a regulative idea in itself: an idea of the spaces, forms, and practices of politics that are possible if only politics can be constituted with the certainty that ontology provides. The regulative idea necessarily requires a renewed relationship between the entities on either side of the aporetic boundary, and as long as we can regulate ourselves according to this idea, we have the possibility of enjoying the stability that political ontology would bring. However, as the impassable hiatus between terms, this reconciliation is impossible, simultaneously generating the search for a new ontology, confirming the impossibility of ontological stability, and sustaining the regulative idea of politics as ontological.</p>
<p>Ultimately, therefore, an aporetic reading of the transition narratives of urbanization forces us to confront a final narrative, that of a transition between politics and its limits: its openings and closures, its stabilizations and destabilizations, its fundamental insecurities, and its drive to final security. Urbanization, as an aporetic boundary between rural and urban, nature and culture, apolitical and political constitution, establishes the practices necessary for securing against this threat in the form of a renewed ideal of a balance, unity, or end point, even as these practices continually fail to deliver the desired stability. Thus, the aporetic boundary practices that work with and against each other to produce urbanization constitute the limits of politics in both spatiotemporal terms and subjective terms. I will elaborate only on those aspects that I have gestured toward already, though there are many more.</p>
<p>In temporal terms, this limit is conceived as an origin or as an end point, and in spatial terms, this limit is conceived as either an internal threat or an external one. These limits are often imposed through practices of historicization that attempt to delineated the spatiotemporal boundaries of the “modern” in relation to either a premodern past/outside or an immanent future/beyond to the modern. An effect of this boundary around the modern is that urbanization can be claimed to be a transition from modern to postmodern politics, with the attendant characterizations either of a shift beyond the violent containments of the state to more fluid and more open forms of politics in an urbanization world or of a shift from the stable and secure politics of the state to forms of insecurity and even chaos in this new global urban condition. In either form, urbanization becomes a transition in the practices, forms, and spatiotemporal configurations of politics, and thus functions as the limit to state-based sovereign politics. However, both the content of the claim—a transition from an (idealized) origin to an (idealized) end point—and the mode of the claim—being made in ontological terms—serve to ensure that current narratives of urbanization re-embed sovereignty at the center of politics.</p>
<p>In subjective terms, a similar set of effects emerges. While efforts are made to articulate forms and practices of relational subjectivity, the autonomous subject, with the capacity to be sovereign over itself, continues to reappear as an ideal. And to the extent that the autonomous subject is one more regulative idea of modern politics, it holds a complicated relationship with the concept of the regulative idea as an attempt to secure unstable aporetic boundaries: the regulative idea requires and assumes an autonomous acting subject, and this subject requires the successful regulation of the self according to the ideal of the autonomous acting subject. In other words, practices of idealization that are generated through the aporetic logic of urbanization also serve to reinforce a particular form of (sovereign) subjectivity that can be governed by its capacity to envision an ideal.</p>
<p>It becomes clear that the problematic returns to sovereign politics thus have multiple roots: in claims to the authority to define the world in ontological terms; in claims to determine “the modern” and the capacity to exceed “the modern,” both of which operate as regulative and performative claims about the authority to make such determinations; and in claims to the ability to act according to an ideal of the self-regulating, self-authorizing subject that can follow its ideals, even as this form of subjectivity is acknowledged to be less than ideal.</p>
<p>Thus, the logic of the aporia offers an explanation not only of how but also of <italic>why</italic> these multiple boundary practices generate the search for idealizations and the problem of authorization. It also suggests that rather than being a window into a singular “aporia of politics” (a claim that takes on an ontological stance: politics <italic>is</italic> an aporia), urbanization is better understood as a complex of aporetic boundary practices, each of which makes a claim about the possibilities and impossibilities of politics. These boundary practices work to amplify each other, thus giving the effect of a singular determination of politics; and they simultaneously work to undermine each other, thus giving the effect of the impossibility of politics and the appearance of politics as black hole, a singular aporia. In other words, the logic holding these practices in relation can also be interpreted aporetically, calling into question any attempts to identify urbanization, or politics, as a singular, linear, or coherent transition. The narratives of urbanization as transition therefore function to both threaten existing politics and promise a future politics, thus putting into play complicated dynamics of openings and closures, possibilities and impossibilities for politics.</p>
<p>The challenge that an aporetic reading of the politics of urbanization poses, ultimately, is to change from thinking about urbanization as a series of linear “transitions”—spatiotemporal, subjective, political—to thinking about transformations with a different dynamic. Aporetic urbanization lets us think about urbanization in a way that clarifies the pressure to sovereign politics without having to follow it. Therefore, the political logic of aporetic urbanization is not a magic solution to problems of politics, but rather is a way of understanding the complexity of the political contests underway in and through our claims about urbanization. Crucially, one of the key ways that this contest is being fought is through this narrative of a transition in politics itself: where the global city or urbanization figures as a new form of politics, but where the transition narratives that support these claims re-embed a very old form of politics. By reading the political logic of relationality as aporetic, I argue that we can analyze urbanization as transforming spatiotemporal and subjective configurations without re-inscribing transition narratives, coherent linear progressions, political ontologies, and thus the depoliticizations performed by sovereign politics.</p>

<title>Conclusions: The Urbanization of Politics</title>
<p>The relational ontologies of the global city as developed by Amin and Thrift,<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn52-0304375412465040">52</xref>
</sup> and of global encounters with urbanization as developed by Massey,<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn53-0304375412465040">53</xref>
</sup> smooth over the question of the politics of relationality and ultimately depoliticize relationality. Refocusing on urbanization as a complex of aporetic boundary practices forces us to think about relationality in all its complications. Similarly, a politicized relationality, read as an aporetic logic through which relations are governed and self-governed, contested, negotiated, and left continually open, forces us to think about urbanization in all its complications.</p>
<p>We are therefore brought to a different mode of thinking about the urbanization of politics, one that politicizes urbanization. Rather than a politics that forces everything and everyone to be brought into “the city” as the ontological foundation of politics, this urbanized political theory works with the tensions and complications that an aporetic logic of relationality entails. It brings to the fore the significance of thinking about urbanization as the processes of “becoming like” and “being made like” the city, opening space and time to see the tensions between practices that are both modes of self-government, immanent and self-directed, and practices that are modes of governance, re-invoking claims to idealizations, to authority, and to sovereignty.</p>
<p>In other words, to talk of the urbanization of politics in aporetic terms is not to give it a purely “positive” designation, in the sense that an urbanized politics is magically a reformed politics or inherently a progressive politics. Nor is it to give it a “positive” designation, in the sense that “urbanization” provides a coherent, stable content to the concept of politics. Rather, an urbanized politics of aporetic boundary practices places us always in the hiatus between politics and its limits: its enclosures, its naturalizations, its depoliticizations. It reestablishes focus on the multiplicity, heterogeneity, and contingency of urbanization as a set of political practices, and it seeks to rest in the aporetic hiatus between determinations rather than attempt a definitive determination of politics. In this sense, this analysis does give us a “positive” account of politics,<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn54-0304375412465040">54</xref>
</sup> in that it gives us the tools to provide accounts of the generation of new practices, new institutional, constitutional, and material forms, and new spatiotemporal configurations. An aporetic reading of urbanization is politically effective—in that it effectively accounts for distinctive political features, and in that it performatively enables us to engage with and effect transformations in possible political openings—without relying on a claim about political ontology and thus reinvoking forms of sovereign politics.</p>

<p>The global city has been conceived in three main ways. First, the global city is used as a synonym to the world city: those urban metropolitan conglomerations at the center of global networks of finance, migration, services, and consumption. See John Friedmann and Goetz Wolff, “World City Formation: An Agenda for Research and Action,” <italic>International Journal of Urban and Regional Research</italic> 6, no. 3 (1982): 209–344. Also Saskia Sassen, <italic>Cities in a World Economy</italic> (Thousand Oaks, CA: Pine Forge Press, 1994). Second, the global city as an analytical term is divorced from the geographical, economic, cultural, and political specificity of any particular city and is instead used to describe a global condition of urbanism as a way of life. See Louis Wirth, “Urbanism as a Way of Life,” in <italic>Classic Essays on the Culture of Cities</italic>, ed. Richard Sennett (New York: Appleton Century Crofts, 1969). Also Warren Magnusson, <italic>Politics of Urbanism: Seeing Like a City</italic> (London: Routledge, 2011). Finally, the notion of the global city returns to the city proper and seeks to define new modes of urban built form, urban sociospatial relations, urban political practices, urban economic systems, and so on. When these three approaches are read together, the task at hand appears to be understanding how the practices in and experiences of global cities in the first sense (the major cities of the world) have brought us to the point where we can envision the entire world as a singular global city, from which we can begin to analyze the ways in which any contemporary city can be said to be global rather than local, regional, or national.</p>

<p>In using the term “relationality,” I follow the well-established ground of thinking of co-constitutive modes of interaction, rather than the notion of preexisting entities that come together in some form of relationship. Margaret FitzSimmons noted that the terms rural and urban capture something that only comes into being as a result of the process of urbanization itself (Margaret FitzSimmons, “The Matter of Nature,” <italic>Antipode</italic> 21, no. 2 (1989): 106–20). Since then, relationality has become key in a range of literatures that deal with the global city and urbanization in any or all of the related transition narratives outlined in section three, being used to develop more complex accounts of new urban forms, of relations between nature and the city, of relations within and between space and time, and intersubjective relations. Of course, the notion of relationality has a much longer conceptual history, being traced to Spinoza in Doreen Massey, <italic>For Space</italic> (Los Angeles: Sage, 2005), and sometimes even to Lucretius.</p>

<p>Of course, these transition narratives are subject to many powerful critiques. In consideration of the central question of a transition from nature as the rural to culture as the urban, many have argued in one way or another that human activity and labor is “naturally” transformative, and thus that the city is not opposed to nature, but is a form of environment constructed from a relationship between the biophysical world and human activity. Following the argument about logics of relationality developed in this article, in other work I argue that the dialectical and ecological logics of relationality embedded in these works are also problematic, and ultimately lead to politics consistently fading from view in their analyses (in Tedesco, “Politicizing Urbanization: The Sustainable City Ideal in Kelowna, British Columbia” <italic>Zeitschrift für Kanada-Studien</italic> 32, no. 2 (2012): 84–106). See the following: Harvey, <italic>Justice, Nature, and the Geography of Difference</italic>; Erik Swyngedouw, “The Antinomies of the Postpolitical City: In Search of a Democratic Politics of Environmental Production,” <italic>International Journal of Urban and Regional Research</italic> 33, no. 3 (2009): 601–20; and “Metabolic Urbanization: The Making of Cyborg Cities,” in <italic>In the Nature of Cities: Urban Political Ecology and the Politics of Urban Metabolism,</italic> ed.

<p>There are nearly endless versions of the way in which nature forms the condition of possibility for political thought, whether in natural law traditions, readings of Rousseauian romanticism, or more recently in Marxist materialism. In opposition, Latour outlines how nature has functioned as the condition of impossibility for politics, as that ontological claim that attempts to shift or shut down political debate.

<p>Both Magnusson and Engin F. Isin theorize the city (as a site that gave rise to the <italic>polis</italic> but that exceeds its spatial and political boundaries) as the original condition of possibility for thinking about communal life in political terms. See Magnusson, <italic>Politics of Urbanism</italic>; and Engin F. Isin, <italic>Being Political: Genealogies of Citizenship</italic> (Minneapolis and London: University of Minnesota Press, 2002). Yet, the city has become a subordinate, depoliticized entity within the discipline of political science: the arrogation by the state of political power in the form of sovereign authority constituted the city as a condition of impossibility for politics, the site for the nonpolitical administration of social chaos. See Warren Magnusson, “Politicizing the Global City,” in <italic>Democracy, Citizenship and the Global City</italic>, ed. Engin Isin (London: Routledge, 2000); and Max Weber, <italic>Economy and Society</italic>, 2 vols. (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1978).</p>

<p>By talking about the possibilities of both conjunctures and disjunctures, and by sketching out a form of relationality that does not easily fit within a universalizing logic, Massey seems implicitly aware of this possibility, though she does not address it directly. For Massey, the ontological condition of relationality enables the trajectories (movements across space and through time) of the simultaneous heterogeneous multitude to meet at particular times and places and work themselves out in particular relationships. There is a presumed immediacy within this logic of relationality: while the trajectories may or may not meet (the conjunctures and disjunctures), there seems less possibility that meetings themselves may be subject to fundamental misunderstandings, contradictions, or impossibilities of comprehension.</p>

<p>Latour in particular, in <italic>The Politics of Nature</italic>, develops a strong critique of the ontologization of nature in the political ecology literature.
