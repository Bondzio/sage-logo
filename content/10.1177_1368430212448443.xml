<abstract>
<p>This paper investigates the effects of risk orientation (RO) and social value orientation (SVO) on cooperation and the process of making the decision in a public goods dilemma (PGD). We found in Study 1 that risk-seeking prosocials were more cooperative than risk-averse prosocials in a simultaneous PGD. In Study 2, we found the same effect of RO on cooperation in a real-time PGD. Moreover, we found that risk-seeking prosocials, compared with their risk-averse counterparts, took less time to make decisions and observed fewer preceding cooperation choices before making their decisions. Mediation analysis confirms our model based on the change of K’ index in real-time PGD: The number of preceding cooperation choices being observed by a player mediated the effect of RO on cooperation among prosocials that risk-seekers were more cooperative than risk-averse participants. Our studies illustrate that individual differences such as RO and SVO play an important role in decision processes in PGD that subsequently affects cooperation decisions.</p>

<p>Abundant social dilemma studies focus on the effects of individual differences on cooperation decisions, but not many of them examine these effects on the decision process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1368430212448443">Koole, Jager, Van Den Berg, &amp; Vlek, Hofstee, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1368430212448443">McClintock &amp; Liebrand, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1368430212448443">Parks, 2004</xref>). This paper aims to investigate the effects of risk orientation (RO) and social value orientation (SVO) on not only the cooperation decision but also the decision process in a public goods dilemma (PGD). There are robust findings showing that prosocials are more cooperative than proselfs (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1368430212448443">Balliet, Parks, &amp; Joireman, 2009</xref>). Risk attitude has also been shown to influence cooperation in social dilemmas (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1368430212448443">De Heus, Hoogervorst, &amp; Van Dijk, 2010</xref>). However, these findings have not disentangled how these individual differences affect the ultimate decisions. In Study 1, we examined the interaction effect of SVO and RO on cooperation in a simultaneous PGD. In Study 2, we investigated in-depth the decision process in a PGD played under a real-time protocol that allowed us to examine how decisions made by preceding players changed the payoff structure of the game during the decision process and how this structural change affected cooperation.</p>
<sec id="section1-1368430212448443">
<title>Effect of risk orientation on cooperation</title>
<p>Risk orientation is defined as one’s general preference towards making decisions in uncertain situations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1368430212448443">Rohrmann, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1368430212448443">Weber, Blais, &amp; Betz, 2002</xref>). Its effect on social dilemma has been studied under different names such as risk preference and risk attitude (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1368430212448443">Kanagaretnam, Mestelman, Nainar, &amp; Shehata, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1368430212448443">Parks, 2004</xref>). In general, RO affects cooperative behaviors in social dilemmas (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1368430212448443">De Heus, Hoogervorst, &amp; Van Dijk, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1368430212448443">Dolbear &amp; Lave, 1966</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1368430212448443">Levati, Morone, &amp; Fiore, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1368430212448443">Parks, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1368430212448443">Van Assen &amp; Snijders, 2004</xref>). A review of these studies suggests that risk-seeking individuals are more cooperative than risk-averse individuals in PGD when trials are non-iterative (i.e., members change across trials). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1368430212448443">Parks (2004)</xref> proposed that cooperation in PGD is a risky behavior in non-iterative paradigms. He found that risk-seeking individuals were more cooperative than risk-averse individuals in a five-person prisoner’s dilemma when the risk of others being cooperative was high. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1368430212448443">Van Assen and Snijders (2004)</xref>, however, found the contrary in an iterated paradigm. They showed that risk-averse people tended to cooperate in an iterated PGD, in which group membership did not change throughout all trials. It is quite reasonable that the effect of risk-seeking orientation is different between these two paradigms because the risks involved in iterative games include risks of being retaliated as well as risks of losing reputation in addition to risks of being suckered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1368430212448443">Lam &amp; Leung, 2009</xref>). In this study, we focus on a non-iterative PGD with multiple independent trials. Based on Parks’s findings, we predicted that risk-seeking players would cooperate more than risk-averse players (Hypothesis 1).</p>

<sec id="section2-1368430212448443">
<title>Moderation effect of SVO on cooperation and decision process</title>
<p>SVO is defined as one’s preference towards favoring own and others’ outcomes when these outcomes are interdependent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1368430212448443">Au &amp; Kwong, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1368430212448443">Balliet et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1368430212448443">Bogaert, Boone, &amp; Declerck, 2008</xref>). Broadly speaking, people can be categorized into prosocial or proself. Prosocials are more concerned with collective benefits, while proselfs are more interested in maximizing their own payoffs. Meta-analysis on SVO revealed that SVO accounted for approximately 9% of the variance of cooperative behaviors in social dilemma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1368430212448443">Balliet et al., 2009</xref>). Robust findings show that prosocials contribute more in a PGD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1368430212448443">Abele, Stasser, &amp; Chartier, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1368430212448443">De Cremer &amp; Van Lange, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1368430212448443">Parks, 1994</xref>), take less from a common resource pool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1368430212448443">Budescu, Au, &amp; Chen, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1368430212448443">De Kwaadsteniet, Van Dijk, Wit, &amp; De Cremer, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1368430212448443">Liebrand, 1984</xref>), reciprocate more in trust games (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1368430212448443">Berg, Dickhaut, &amp; McCabe, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1368430212448443">Kanagaretnam et al., 2009</xref>) and allocate more to others in dictator games (Cornelissen, Dewitte, &amp; Warlop, 2009). Meanwhile, proselfs tend to cooperate less in these dilemmas.</p>
<p>Past research shows that SVO moderates the effect of RO in social dilemmas (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1368430212448443">Biel &amp; Garling, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1368430212448443">Brennan, Gonzalez, Guth, &amp; Levati, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1368430212448443">Kanagaretnam et al., 2009</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1368430212448443">Biel and Garling (1995)</xref> argued that proselfs, but not prosocials, would be affected by risk in resource dilemmas. They predicted that risk-seeking egoists, who have the same characteristics as proselfs, cooperated less than risk-averse egoists did. They also suggested that risk would not affect prosocials because prosocials focused on the collective consequence and they were less concerned about uncertainty. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1368430212448443">Kanagaretnam et al. (2009)</xref>, however, found that in a trust game it was not SVO per se but the strength of SVO that affected the effect of RO. They found that risk-seekers who were categorized as neither strongly proself nor strongly prosocial returned more endowments to their partners compared with their less risk-seeking counterparts.</p>
<p>We believe that prosocials are more affected by RO than proselfs in their contributions in PGD. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1368430212448443">Weber, Kopelman, and Messick (2004)</xref> suggested that prosocials were more likely than proselfs to behave differently from their SVO because their prosocial motives could be overwhelmed by their desires to avoid being a sucker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1368430212448443">Kelley &amp; Stahelski, 1970</xref>). Proselfs, however, were more egocentric in making decisions and were more concerned about their personal benefit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1368430212448443">Weber et al., 2004</xref>). We argue that since defection is the dominant choice for proselfs as they can always maximize their own benefits when defecting, the decision involves less uncertainty for proselfs than for prosocials. In other words, the decisions of proselfs will not be affected by RO as much as that of prosocials. We hypothesized that the effect of RO on cooperative behaviors is moderated by SVO—for prosocials, risk-seekers cooperate more; but this effect is weaker for proselfs (Hypothesis 2).</p>

<p>Sixty undergraduate students participated in a 1.5 hr experiment at a rate of RMB 25 (~USD 3.80).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1368430212448443">
<title>Public goods game</title>
<p>Cooperation was measured by participants’ decisions in a multiple-trial simultaneous public goods game with all-or-none contribution and a monotonically increasing payoff function. Participants were randomly assigned to play the game with four to eight others in each trial. They were aware that group sizes and group compositions were different in each assignment. Although group size was systematically manipulated, it is not the focus of this study and it will not be analysed. The experiment was framed as an investment game. Participants were given 20 tokens as an endowment on each trial and 30 seconds to decide independently and anonymously whether to invest all the tokens to a joint account (i.e., cooperation) or to a personal account (i.e., defection). Tokens that were deposited in the joint account were multiplied by a factor of 2.5 and then divided evenly among group members. The payoff for each participant in each trial was their shares of the joint account bonus plus the tokens left in their personal accounts. For example, in a group of five, four members decided to invest in the joint account and one decided to invest in the personal account, the joint account bonus would be 200 tokens (20 tokens × 4 members × 2.5). Those who invested in the joint account would get a payoff of 40 tokens (200 tokens / 5 members), and the member who invested in the personal account would get a payoff of 60 tokens (40 tokens + 20 tokens). All participants played 35 trials. They were given feedback regarding group members’ payoffs after each trial.</p>

<sec id="section7-1368430212448443">
<title>Materials</title>
<p>We used the Risk Orientation Questionnaire to measure RO and the Ring Measure to determine the SVO of each participant.</p>
<p>Risk orientation was measured by the Risk Orientation Questionnaire (ROQ, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1368430212448443">Rohrmann, 2004</xref>) which contains seven statements on “risk propensity” (e.g., “I’m quite cautious when I make plans and when I act on them”, “My decisions are always made carefully and accurately”) and five statements on “risk cautiousness” (e.g., “Even when I know that my chances are limited I try my luck”, “I express my opinion even if most people have opposite views”). All statements are on a 7-point Likert scale. RO is measured by the average score of the responses of the 12 statements. The Chinese translated version of ROQ was used in this study. Cronbach’s α for ROQ was .635.</p>
<p>Social value orientation was measured using the Ring Measure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1368430212448443">Liebrand &amp; McClintock, 1988</xref>). The version we used contained 24 items. Each item contains two choices of resource allocation between two parties. The two numbers in each choice are mapped onto a two-dimensional social orientation space as a coordinate with allocation to self as the x-axis and allocation to the other as the y-axis. Coordinates that fall onto different angle ranges on the two-dimensional space represent different social orientations. For example, a coordinate that falls on the 22.5 to 67.5 degree range indicates a cooperative orientation; one that falls on the 337.5 to 22.5 degree range indicates an individualistic orientation. We translated the original English version to Chinese with back-translation.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1368430212448443">
<title>Procedure</title>
<p>The experiment was conducted on networked computers. There were 12 participants in each session. The experimenter explained verbally to them the rundown of the experiment and gave each of them a printout of the rules of the public goods game. Participants then completed a quiz to measure their understanding of the game. They must answer all questions on the quiz correctly before they could proceed to the public goods game. On each of the 35 trials of the game, the computer screen displayed participant’s identification number, their group identification label, number of group members, trial number, and a timer indicating the countdown of the 30 seconds decision time. Participants were presented with two options to invest in either (a) a personal account or (b) a joint account. If no decision was made within 30 seconds, the program would take it as a decision to invest in the personal account.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1368430212448443">1</xref></sup> Feedback of the trial, including number of personal account and joint account investments as well as individual payoffs was displayed at the end of each trial. The next trial began when participants pressed the “continue” button. When participants finished all the trials, they were asked to complete the ROQ and the Ring Measure. At the end of the experiment, all 12 participants would enter a lucky draw. One of them would be randomly selected to receive a monetary bonus up to RMB 200 (~USD 30.60) associated with her decisions in the PGD games.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>The mean RO of the sample (<italic>N</italic> = 60) was 4.35 (<italic>SD</italic> = .74) on a 7-point scale meaning that our participants tended to be risk-seeking. The result of Ring Measure showed that there were 15 prosocials and 43 proselfs with two invalid data points being excluded. There was no correlation between SVO and RO according to Spearman’s Rho correlation analysis, <italic>r</italic>(56) = .22, <italic>p</italic> = .10.</p>
<sec id="section10-1368430212448443">
<title>Effect of RO and SVO on cooperation</title>
<p>Individual-level cooperation rate was represented by the proportion of cooperation decision (joint account investments) across the 35 trials. On average, participants cooperated 38% (<italic>SD</italic> = 22%) of the time. As predicted in Hypothesis 1, a linear regression revealed that risk-seeking players were more likely to cooperate, β = .10, <italic>t</italic>(58) = 2.82, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01. RO accounts for 12% of the variance. Hypothesis 2 stated that prosocials who were risk-seeking were more cooperative than those who were risk-averse and that this effect was weaker among proselfs. This was confirmed by the significant RO × SVO interaction effect, β = .19, <italic>t</italic>(54), <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05. The two predictors, RO and SVO, accounted for 23% of the variance. Simple slope analysis (Aiken &amp; West, 1991) revealed that RO affected cooperation of prosocials, β = .24, <italic>t</italic>(54) = 3.01, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01, but not that of proselfs, β = .06, <italic>t</italic>(54) = .21, <italic>p</italic> = .20. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1368430212448443">Figure 1</xref> presents this interaction.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1368430212448443">2</xref></sup></p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Our results demonstrate that participants who were more risk-seeking were also more cooperative. This is consistent with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1368430212448443">Parks’s (2004)</xref> findings in general. More importantly, we have also shown that only prosocials’ decisions are influenced by their RO; proselfs’ decisions are not being affected. With a simultaneous protocol of play; however, we could not learn much about the effect of SVO and RO on the <italic>decision process</italic> because players did not have much information and flexibility in making their decisions. In Study 2, we used a real-time PGD to examine the amount and the type of information people attend to during the decision process in a real-time PGD. Moreover, we studied how the cooperation decision information available to the players changed the structure and the K’ index (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1368430212448443">Komorita,1976</xref>) of the game, which in turn affected their cooperation decisions.</p>

<title>Real-time public goods dilemma</title>
<p>The real-time PGD paradigm was introduced by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1368430212448443">Dorsey (1992)</xref>. It is a special case of a sequential PGD. In both the real-time and sequential paradigms, players make decisions one after another. While the order of making decisions is prespecified in a sequential PGD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1368430212448443">Erev &amp; Rapoport, 1990</xref>), the order is decided by players during the game in a real-time PGD. This special property of a real-time PGD allows us to study the decision making process such as decision latency and how other members’ decisions, when available, could change the structure of the game and affect one’s cooperation decision.</p>

<title>Effects of RO and SVO in real-time PGD</title>
<p>Based on the same argument we made for the effect of RO and SVO on cooperation decisions in Study 1 that prosocials are more likely to be influenced by their risk-orientation than proselfs do, we investigated this interaction effect on the decision process in a real-time PGD in Study 2 by examining the effect of the number of preceding decisions on one’s decision.</p>
<p>Previous studies on real-time PGD suggested that players were strategic in their timing of making decisions in a real-time PGD. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1368430212448443">Goren, Kurzban, and Rapoport (2003)</xref> found that lower endowment players contributed earlier in the game whereas those who held critical amounts of endowment waited longer. The timing of making decisions may also be affected by one’s risk orientation. In general, people tend to delay decisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1368430212448443">Diederich, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1368430212448443">Redelmeier &amp; Shafir, 1995</xref>) and seek more information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1368430212448443">Busemeyer &amp; Rapoport, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1368430212448443">Tversky &amp; Shafir, 1992</xref>) when there is a conflict induced by desirability of choices during decision making under uncertainty. More aversive choices induced a longer decision time. The effect of risk on decision time also varies among different types of individuals. Decisive people take less time to make a decision when there is a risk to delay making a decision; indecisive people; however, take the same amount of time to decide regardless of urgency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1368430212448443">Patalano and Wengrovitz, 2007</xref>). It is reasonable to speculate that risk-averse individuals take longer time and seek more information to make a decision than risk-seekers.</p>
<p>In a public goods context, we reasoned that proselfs may not be much affected by their risk orientation for the same reasons discussed in Study 1. Proselfs will focus on their own benefits and be less concerned about what others have decided (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1368430212448443">Weber et al., 2004</xref>). Our results in Study 1 confirmed that proselfs are rather insensitive to the effect of RO. However, according to previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1368430212448443">Weber et al., 2004</xref>), prosocials, compared to proselfs, are more easily influenced by other factors when making cooperative decisions. These factors could be individual differences, such as risk orientation. Because cooperation in a PGD is a risky choice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1368430212448443">Parks, 2004</xref>), risk-averse people are less likely to cooperate. Therefore, we expect risk-averse prosocials, who face the conflict between their SVO and RO, would take more time to make decisions. Therefore, we predicted that RO will only affect prosocials. We hypothesized that, for prosocials, risk-averse players take longer to make decisions (Hypothesis 4). We also hypothesized that risk-averse prosocials are more likely than risk-seeking prosocials to wait for decisions being made by other players before making theirs (Hypothesis 5). These two hypotheses illustrate that risk-averse prosocials do not simply wait longer; they wait specifically for others to make decisions first.</p>
<p>The position in a decision making sequence shall influence cooperation. As we argued and hypothesized earlier, the <italic>K’</italic><sub><italic>S</italic></sub> in a subgame is smaller for players who make decisions later in a sequential PGD compared with those who make decisions in earlier positions. This effect has also been well demonstrated empirically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1368430212448443">Au, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1368430212448443">Chen, Au, &amp; Komorita, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1368430212448443">Erev &amp; Rapoport, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1368430212448443">Potters, Sefton, &amp; Vesterlund, 2007</xref>). It has been found that players assigned to later positions in the decision making sequence contributed less than those in earlier positions. Moreover, since we anticipate that risk-averse prosocials will wait for others to decide before making their decisions and that more preceding decisions will reduce the likelihood to cooperate, we further hypothesized that the effect of risk-seeking prosocials in a real-time PGD being more likely to cooperate is mediated by the number of preceding decisions (Hypothesis 6).</p>

<title>Method</title>
<p>The design and procedure of this experiment was the same as Study 1 except that the decisions of other members were updated every 2 seconds during the 30 seconds decision time. Participants could see the number of joint account and personal account investments, but the identities of the group members were kept anonymous. Participants, therefore, could observe others’ decisions before making their own. Since players were assigned to different groups randomly on each trial, the attention paid to decisions made by any particular individual should be minimized. The measure of cooperation was the number of cooperation decisions in the public goods game.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1368430212448443">3</xref></sup> As Study 1, we measured participants’ RO and SVO using the ROQ (Cronbach’s α = .615) and Ring Measure, respectively.</p>

<title>Preceding cooperation decisions as a mediator</title>
<p>Our original Hypothesis 6 predicted that the number of preceding decisions mediated the effect of RO on cooperation for prosocials. However, as the previous analysis has shown that risk-averse prosocials were not affected by any decisions but only cooperation decisions, we conducted a mediation analysis with the number of cooperation decisions as a mediator. The mediation analysis was conducted following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1368430212448443">Baron and Kenny’s (1986)</xref> procedure. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1368430212448443">Figure 5</xref> presents the results schematically. Multiple regression analyses showed that risk-seekers were more likely to invest in the joint account, β = .15, <italic>t</italic>(28) = 2.89, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01. Risk-seekers also observed fewer cooperation choices before making decisions, β = −.30, <italic>t</italic>(28) = −2.26, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05. Thus, the predictor, RO, predicted both cooperation (i.e., the criterion variable) and the number of observed cooperation decisions (i.e., the mediator). When controlling for the predictor, the mediator also predicted the criterion, β = −.26, <italic>t</italic>(28) = −4.42, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, i.e., seeing less preceding cooperation choices significantly predicted that players cooperated more after controlling for RO. However, when the number of observed preceding cooperation choices was controlled, risk-seeking orientation no longer predicted cooperation, β = .07, <italic>t</italic>(28) = 1.66, <italic>p</italic> = .11. The Sobel test (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1368430212448443">Sobel, 1982</xref>) also showed that the effect of RO on cooperative behavior was mediated by the number of observed cooperators, <italic>t</italic>(28) = 2.01, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05. Hence, in the situation where information about others’ decisions was available, risk-seeking prosocials were more likely to cooperate; this effect was mediated by the number of observed cooperation choices made by others during the decision process. In summary, the fewer cooperation choices that prosocials observed, the more cooperative they became.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1368430212448443">4</xref></sup></p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The results of Study 2 confirm our prediction that more preceding decisions being seen in a real-time PGD leads to less cooperation because the <italic>K’</italic><sub><italic>S</italic></sub> of the subgame decreases as the number of preceding decisions increases. Moreover, risk-averse prosocials spend more time making decisions and wait for more preceding cooperation choices than risk-seeking prosocials in a real-time PGD. Risk-seeking prosocials are also more cooperative than risk-averse prosocials. Mediation analysis further reveals that this effect is mediated by the number of cooperation choices being made by preceding players. We argue that since risk-averse prosocials take more time making decisions and because they see more cooperation decisions being made by preceding players, they are less compelled to contribute according to <italic>K’</italic><sub><italic>S</italic></sub>. Therefore, risk-averse prosocials cooperate less than risk-seeking prosocials who take less time to make decisions and see less preceding cooperation decisions.</p>
<p>Contrary to our prediction that risk-averse prosocials, compared with risk-seeking prosocials, pay attention to both cooperation and defection decisions made by other players they seem to pay attention to cooperation decisions only. We reason that it is because prosocials are more concerned with cooperation information and thus their attention focus on cooperation choices even when defection information is also available. This argument is supported by studies on information seeking behaviors in social dilemmas. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1368430212448443">Kurzban and DeScioli (2008)</xref> studied what information different types of player wanted to know by allowing players to purchase information regarding other people’s contribution behaviors. They found that reciprocators requested information on the median value of the overall contribution while free-riders asked for the lowest contribution value. Also, in our recent study on players’ attention on payoff matrix in a prisoner’s dilemma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1368430212448443">Yam &amp; Au, 2011</xref>), we found, based on eye-tracking results, that prosocials focused more on the payoffs that they would get when both players in the game cooperated. This finding showed that prosocials sought for information that was relevant to their goals to cooperate.</p>

<title>General discussion</title>
<p>In two studies, we examined the interaction of RO and SVO in two types of PGD paradigms. We found that risk-seeking individuals were more cooperative than risk-averse individuals in a simultaneous PGD in Study 1. Furthermore, this effect of RO was moderated by SVO that RO influenced prosocials only but not proselfs. We also found a trend that prosocials took less time making decisions as their risk propensities increased. This effect of RO on decision time was replicated in a real-time PGD in Study 2. Our results show that during the decision process in a real-time PGD, risk-averse prosocials waited longer than risk-seeking prosocials in making decisions while they observed how other players cooperate. Consistent with our model of decreasing <italic>K’</italic><sub><italic>S</italic></sub> value in a real-time PGD, we also showed that players tended to be less cooperative as they saw more decisions already been made by other players. In general, the interaction effect of RO and SVO in a real-time PGD appeared to be similar to that in a simultaneous PGD that risk-seeking prosocials cooperated more than risk-averse prosocials and that RO did not affect proselfs. Nevertheless, we argue that the underlying mechanisms of these two effects are different. In a simultaneous PGD, risk-averse prosocials defect more than risk-seeking prosocials do because risk-averse prosocials are more worried about losing their endowments than their risk-seeking counterparts. In a real-time PGD, risk-averse prosocials defect more than risk-seeking prosocials do because cooperation becomes a less attractive choice, according to <italic>K’</italic><sub><italic>S</italic></sub>, for risk-averse prosocials as they see more cooperation decisions being made by others while they take time to contemplate their decisions. Supporting our argument, mediation analysis shows that the number of preceding cooperation choices mediates the effect of RO on the cooperation rate of prosocials.</p>
<sec id="section24-1368430212448443">
<title>Limitation</title>
<p>In this study we did not empirically examine the underlying psychological processes that mediate the dynamic effect of RO on cooperation in Study 2. Although our mediation analysis showed that the number of preceding cooperation decisions could explain the effect of RO on cooperation, we are aware that a “measurement-of-mediation” design does not imply causation between the mediator and the dependent variable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1368430212448443">Spencer, Zanna, &amp; Fong, 2005</xref>). Specifically, we cannot claim that observing a larger number of preceding cooperation choices cause defection decisions. It could also be the psychological process associated with the number of preceding cooperators, e.g., the increasing greed to free-ride that causes the effect. However, since our hypotheses are derived based on a theoretical model of <italic>K’</italic><sub><italic>S</italic></sub>, we chose to concentrate on demonstrating the effect in this study. Future studies could focus on the psychological changes that take place during the decision process.</p>

<sec id="section25-1368430212448443">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>We examined the effects of RO on cooperation and on decision process in a simultaneous PGD and in a real-time PGD. Even though the effects in both paradigms are about risk-seeking prosocials being more cooperative than their risk-averse counterparts, the underlying mechanisms are different. While risk-seekers cooperate more in a simultaneous PGD because they are less concerned with the uncertain gain of being cooperative; risk-seekers cooperate more in a real-time PGD because they see less preceding cooperation choices which decrease the desirability of cooperation according to <italic>K’</italic> index.</p>

<p>There were 18 of a total 2100 cases (35 trials X 60 participants), i.e., ~0.9% when a participant did not register a decision within the decision period. Only one participant did not make decisions in more than one-third of all 35 trials; this participant did this 13 times. One might be concerned that assigning all indecisions as defection would lead to misinterpretation of the data. However, we did obtain the same patterns of result when we discarded all indecision trials. Thus, we chose to keep these data in the analyses.</p>
</fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn2-1368430212448443">
<label>2</label>
<p>Although averaging the cooperation rate of an individual across trials had already taken data dependency into account, we did verify the results by dividing the 35 trials into three blocks as dependent variables and running mixed model analyses on them to make sure that the results were robust.</p>

<label>3</label>
<p>As in Study 1, if a player has not made a decision after the 30-seconds decision period, the computer program considered it as a defection choice. There were 436 of the total 2100 cases, i.e., ~20.8% that were indecisions. There were 17 participants (of 60) in this study who did not register a decision inn more than one-third of all trials (maximum = 33 times.</p>
</fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn4-1368430212448443">
<label>4</label>
<p>Similar to Study 1, we were aware of the possible concern on data dependency across trials. We verified the results by dividing the 35 trials into three blocks as dependent variables and running mixed model analyses on them to make sure the results were robust.</p>
