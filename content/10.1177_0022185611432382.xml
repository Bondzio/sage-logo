<p>Mining employment has enjoyed a position of some prominence among labour relations scholars as evidenced by the significant national and international literature on the subject. This literature has documented profound changes to the sector, including the restructuring of resource organizations, transformations in the terms and conditions of mine employment, and the impact of mine closures on workers (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0022185611432382">Cheney et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0022185611432382">Eveline and Booth, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0022185611432382">O’Faircheallaigh, 1995</xref>). At the same time, the literature has been somewhat partial because it has primarily involved the ‘radical segmentation between the domains of home and work’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0022185611432382">Pattenden, 2004</xref>: 252), focusing on the workplace as the key (or only) site of analysis and conceptualizing employment and labour relations as distinct from experiences of community and/or family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0022185611432382">Ellem, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0022185611432382">Tonts, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0022185611432382">Wajcman, 2000</xref>). Indeed, while the permeability of boundaries between different life domains is often noted as a general principle in labour relations and other employment-related disciplines (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0022185611432382">Milkman, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0022185611432382">Moore, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0022185611432382">Standing, 2007</xref>), relatively less empirical research has explicitly examined the nuanced connections between the economic sphere of work and social/family spheres.</p>
<p>This article frames the permeability of work–family–community boundaries as spatially constituted and shaped by geographical relationships, thereby contributing to a deeper and more theoretically informed engagement between the fields of labour relations and geography (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0022185611432382">Rainnie et al., 2007</xref>). Through the exploration of a case study of work, family and community immediately following a mine closure in the municipality of Ravensthorpe in the south-west of Western Australia, the article asks the following question: What is the interplay between the new scales and mobilities of labour and capital and work–family–community connections in mining? Following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0022185611432382">Peck (1996)</xref>, an integrative analysis of the local labour market is conducted, not by abstracting labour from its social context, but by concentrating on the ways in which labour is embedded in and shaped by that context. The article begins with a summary of the recent and significant changes to mining-related employment practices in Australia, including how these changes manifest during mine closures, and outlines the limited work available that explores ‘work–family–community’ connections in the sector. A rationale for adopting a spatial-orientation approach to the research is then provided. In the empirical section of the article, the complex relationships between employment, family and community in the significantly transformed resource-affected rural mining sector in Australia are mapped through interviews and focus groups with mine employees, family members and rural residents. The article concludes with a discussion of the broader theoretical implications of the research.</p>
<sec id="sec2-0022185611432382"><title>Changing Labour Relations in the Mining Sector</title>
<p>The mining industry is deeply important to Australia. It is economically central, constituting 37 percent of the total value of exports and directly employing 128,000 people (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0022185611432382">Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS), 2007</xref>), as well as culturally significant, shaping Australians’ experiences, memories, values, identities and notions of place. While the historical male dominance of employment in the industry remains a feature of mining in contemporary times (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0022185611432382">Mayes and Pini, 2010</xref>), substantial changes have nevertheless occurred in labour relations in the sector over the past decade. Such changes have been reflective of the neoliberal discourse of free markets, competition and flexibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0022185611432382">Peck, 1996</xref>) and include organizational restructuring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0022185611432382">Moore and Gardner, 2004</xref>), a transfer in the employment relationship from collectivism to individualism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0022185611432382">Timo, 1997</xref>), a widespread need for skilled labour (Pini et al., forthcoming), an increase in the use of temporary and contract labour and outsourcing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0022185611432382">Bowden, 2003</xref>), an extension in working hours with compressed and extended shifts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0022185611432382">Heiler and Pickersgill, 2001</xref>), and the consolidation of global corporate resource and energy interests through mergers and acquisitions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0022185611432382">Russell, 1999</xref>). Union membership decline has also had a major impact on the industry and has been attributed to technological advances requiring fewer workers on large open-cut sites, increasing numbers of individualized workplace agreements and commute or fly-in/fly-out (FIFO) arrangements, which weaken the bonds of collectivism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0022185611432382">Ellem, 2006</xref>: 376–377). In the coal industry especially, there has also been a move towards continuous production and a focus on labour productivity in overall productivity performance, with less consideration of non-labour variables such as overcapacity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0022185611432382">Barry and Waring, 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>The shift to FIFO and drive-in/drive-out work with long commuting times has been a particularly contentious change to employment arrangements in the mining sector. FIFO mining operations are those that involve work in relatively remote locations where food and lodging are provided for workers at the work site, but not for their families, and where schedules dictate a fixed number of days on-site followed by a fixed number of days at home (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0022185611432382">Storey, 2001</xref>). Impacts of FIFO noted in the literature include significant occupational health and safety concerns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0022185611432382">Di Milia and Bowden, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0022185611432382">O’Faircheallaigh, 1995</xref>), negative effects on the psychosocial well-being of mine workers’ partners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0022185611432382">Kaczmarkek and Sibbel, 2008</xref>) and concerns by many regional authorities about the loss of local benefits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0022185611432382">Storey, 2001</xref>). FIFO arrangements, along with the increasing preference for contractors, splinter the workforce and town, generating discontent and breaking up the traditional physical intimacy of rural spaces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0022185611432382">Ellem, 2004</xref>). Despite these well-documented concerns about the effects of FIFO, commute operations have continued and few new, purpose-built mining towns have been constructed in the past 20 years, due mainly to significant savings by mining companies in capital expenditure on infrastructure such as schools, hospitals and shops, and the avoidance of capital gains on developed properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0022185611432382">Eveline and Booth, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0022185611432382">Storey, 2001</xref>).</p></sec>
<sec id="sec3-0022185611432382"><title>Mining Communities and Mining Families</title>
<p>Illustrative of work examining connections between mining work and communities, and/or mining work and familial aspects as one component of the broader ‘community’, is the seminal study <italic>Coal Is Our Life.</italic> In this book, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0022185611432382">Dennis and colleagues (1956</xref>: 7) explored the influences of ‘work, leisure and the family’ on the social life of an industrial town in West Yorkshire. They demonstrated how the special character of wage labour and the particular features of (coal) mining emphasized certain potentialities of the nuclear family form and inhibited others. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0022185611432382">Warwick and Littlejohn (1992</xref>: 2) replicated this study, mapping the linkages between individuals and households on the grounds of common mining working conditions, kinship, propinquity and friendship, and the development of common traditions, sentiments and values. Also indicative of literature examining mining work and communities is Claire <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0022185611432382">Williams’ (1981)</xref> feminist Marxist study of two open-cut coal mines in central Queensland between 1974 and 1975. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0022185611432382">Williams (1981)</xref> argued that while mining men may face class inequities as manifest, for example, in a lack of control over their jobs, mining women struggle with inequities in their marital relationships as they are typically isolated from family, undertake all domestic labour and have limited opportunities for paid work.</p>
<p>A further body of literature on mining work and communities examines the relationship between these spheres at the point of a mine closure. Mines are notoriously vulnerable not only to planned closures as a result of diminished natural resources, metallurgical problems, environmental requirements and rising labour costs, but to sudden closures due to accidents, health and safety concerns and natural disasters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0022185611432382">Keyes, 1992</xref>). Empirical work on mine closures indicates an inevitably immediate and significant negative economic impact, such as diminished local tax revenue, physical infrastructure and social services, the loss of local businesses and plummeting real estate values (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0022185611432382">Andrews-Speed et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0022185611432382">Laurence, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0022185611432382">Warhurst et al., 1999</xref>). The literature on mine closures has focused predominantly on the nature of these economic impacts and, to a more limited extent, on social impacts such as rising crime and alcoholism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0022185611432382">Laurence, 2006</xref>). The extent of these economic, social and psychological impacts of mine closures in terms of effective community adaptation are dependent on the lifespan of the mine and the degree to which the local economy has become dependent on the mine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0022185611432382">Warhurst et al., 1999</xref>), but also on the structuring policies and approaches of the mining company, unions, government and the community. Important determinants of adaptation and preparing a community for mine closure are multi-skilling and diversification of the local economy, early warning and forward planning, and the provision of services such as counselling, retraining, job search and relocation assistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0022185611432382">Andrews-Speed et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0022185611432382">Neil et al., 1992</xref>).</p>
<p>While these studies provide strong foundational work for considering the way contemporary mining work and mining closures influence familial and community relations, they are also limited on at least four counts. First, much of the literature is now very dated and there is little work that has explored work–family–community connections in the context of the very significant transformations that have occurred in mining. This study constitutes an opportunity to do so. A second limitation of the literature, and one that is addressed here because data access was facilitated via the community rather than the mining company, is that mining research in Australia is sponsored predominantly by the resource sector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0022185611432382">Cheney et al., 2002</xref>), consequently privileging the interests of mining corporations and emerging from unquestioned assumptions around the legitimacy and inevitability of mining.</p>
<p>A third limitation is that readings of mining and the communities that surround it are often dualistic, such as a tendency to caricature mining workers and communities in overly positive terms as strong and resilient or alternatively in overly negative terms as narrow and parochial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0022185611432382">Strangleman et al., 1999</xref>). Similarly, studies that focus on mining-community connections during and following mine closures frequently focus exclusively or primarily on the closure of ‘classic’ mining towns characterized by permanent extractive communities, limited geographic mobility, intermarriage and intergenerational loyalty to industry and place (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0022185611432382">Gibson-Graham, 1991</xref>: 290; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0022185611432382">Neil and Tykkylainen, 1992</xref>). In contrast to classic mining towns, contemporary mining communities are often dynamic, unstable (due mainly to the vagaries of cyclical demand for minerals and fluctuating commodity prices), heterogeneous and based on mixed commodities. The case-study context – the Ravensthorpe mine in Western Australia – is an example of such a community, being a residential site involving a significant financial investment in infrastructure from BHP Billiton and the Western Australian State Government.</p>
<p>Fourth and finally, studies of mining towns and mining closures have, with few exceptions (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0022185611432382">Ellem, 2003</xref>), not attempted to explicitly theorize the spatial relations of employment, despite the inherently geographically constituted labour relations practices that occur within these communities. There is consequently a need for a more nuanced theoretical engagement between labour relations and the spatial dimensions of family and community in resource-affected communities, which is contextualized by a focus on the reconfigured industrial arena of mining work.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec4-0022185611432382"><title>A Spatial-Orientation Approach</title>
<p>Scholarship in the human geography field has drawn attention to the importance of spatial orientations to labour – including notions of social relations that are ‘local’ as well as ‘global’ and the relations between these spheres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0022185611432382">Massey, 1984</xref>). A fundamental premise for a spatial understanding of the social relations of work is that ‘labour market structures and processes vary not only <italic>over time</italic>, but also <italic>between places</italic>’ [emphasis in the original], contingent on a particular historical and geographical conjuncture and stemming from variability in the social and institutional fabric that sustains and regulates employment relations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0022185611432382">Peck, 1996</xref>: 5; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0022185611432382">Gibson-Graham, 1991</xref>). Furthermore, <italic>local</italic> labour markets and <italic>local</italic> regulatory regimes have, with globalization, become more important (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0022185611432382">Ellem, 2005</xref>). This is a critical premise in the mining sector in that ore bodies are not a mobile resource; capital cannot relocate as readily as in some other sectors, but, rather, must contend with the local communities around mine sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0022185611432382">Ellem, 2006</xref>: 370). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0022185611432382">Beynon and Hudson (1993)</xref> usefully contrast the domain of capital as <italic>space</italic> across which greater profits are continually pursued, with <italic>place</italic>, which they describe as the meaningful situation established by labour and in which considerable collective and individual cultural investment is made. That is not to say that workers’ ‘spatial praxis’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0022185611432382">Herod, 1997</xref>: 3) is confined to the intangible or that they are disconnected from the economic geography of capital. Rather, workers’ abilities to produce and manipulate geographic space in particular ways are an active and potent form of social power (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0022185611432382">Herod, 1997</xref>). Hence, the ‘inherent spatiality of employment and production’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0022185611432382">Peck, 1996</xref>: 13) in labour geography provides a useful framing in this study of the social relations within and between the economic spheres of paid work and familial and community domains.</p>
<p>Consistent with the spatially-oriented approach, ‘community’ is understood as an ongoing, dynamic and normative construction as opposed to a stable, ahistorical and apolitical entity. It is recognized that place-based communities are heterogeneous and, as the literature widely attests, can house more than a single community (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0022185611432382">Massey, 1993</xref>). The primary shared characteristic of members of the case-study context, the ‘Ravensthorpe community’, is that they reside in the same geographic region. However, following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0022185611432382">Ellem (2006)</xref>, the ‘space’ of Ravensthorpe is treated not as a mere backdrop or unexamined metaphor, but as a geographically informed reading of the social relations of work.</p>
<p>The location of interest for the research is Ravensthorpe Shire in the south-west of Western Australia, which is located just over 500 kilometres south of the state capital, Perth. The shire had undergone rapid and considerable social upheaval resulting from the arrival of a BHP Billiton nickel mine that commenced construction in 2004. Though the shire has a long history of mining, this project was the first modern, large-scale mine in the area. Three towns in the shire were integral to the mine’s development and operation: Ravensthorpe, which is the regional centre, Jerdacuttup, which is the ‘fence-line’ neighbour of the mine itself, and Hopetoun, which is a small coastal settlement that was transformed into a residential community for mine workers (Mayes, 2008). While the establishment of residential communities by mining companies was and is atypical, the decision to provide funding for the community infrastructure necessary to attract and retain a residential workforce in Ravensthorpe was prompted by a very tight labour market at the time the mine was commissioned as well as the region’s ‘favourable south coast location’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0022185611432382">BHP Billiton, 2004</xref>). In May 2008, upwards of 300 employees and their families were residing in the region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0022185611432382">Ravensthorpe Nickel Operation, 2008</xref>). Consisting of an open-cut mine and hydrometallurgical process plant and requiring an operational workforce of 650 staff, the venture had an expected ore reserve lifespan of 25 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0022185611432382">Ravensthorpe Nickel Operation, 2008</xref>). Following nearly eight years of negotiations with local, state and federal governments and the local community, the mine was officially opened in June 2008. It subsequently closed unexpectedly in January 2009.<sup>1</sup></p>
<p>The reasons for the closure of the Ravensthorpe Nickel Operation were cited in exclusively economic terms. The media at the time widely reported that global commodity prices had collapsed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0022185611432382">Australian Bureau of Agriculture and Resource Economics (ABARE), 2009</xref>), while several residents noted that new acid leach technology used for extracting nickel was not as lucrative as expected. A later report by BHP Billiton to the United States Securities and Exchange Commission also stated that ‘consistent with the way we have always managed our business … the indefinite suspension of the Ravensthorpe operation [is] due primarily to the marked decrease in the LME nickel price and the additional capital that would be required to complete ramp-up to and sustain production at projected operating levels’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0022185611432382">BHP Billiton, 2009</xref>: 54). However, the announcement of the Ravensthorpe closure, in stark comparison to other closures, was abrupt and marked by secrecy. New mining employees from Australia and overseas were being relocated to the shire until the eve of the closure, which was announced at a supposed ‘Site Wide Safety Stop’ called in a company-issued memo distributed to employees. Production targets, which were repeatedly emphasized in the weeks prior to the closure, had reached 100%.
<fig id="fig1-0022185611432382" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>The Ravensthorpe Shire in south-west Western Australia</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0022185611432382-fig1.tif"/></fig></p></sec></sec>
<sec id="sec5-0022185611432382" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title>
<p>Data used to explore the interplay between the new scales and mobilities of labour and capital and work–family–community connections in mining were drawn from interviews and focus groups with individuals living in the shire as a result of the establishment of the mine. Interviews were conducted over a week-long period three weeks after the mine closure was announced; this was a final, unanticipated phase of data collection that followed a two-year ethnographic study of change in the region. The ethnography involved over 100 interviews, document analysis, photography and observation, with an emphasis on understanding the multiplicities of interrelated meanings of the region’s socio-spatial life. While the single case-study design often receives criticism on the basis that it lacks replicability and (traditional notions of) generalizability, its use here is highly relevant to questions of meaning for individuals and adds depth and dimension to theoretical understandings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0022185611432382">Donmoyer, 2000</xref>). Adopting such an approach captured the rich complexity of participants’ recollections of their prior relationships to the mine, with their responses to its closure, usefully highlighting how connections between the social and the spatial can occur differently in the same place at different times. Importantly, access to participants (long-term, pre-mine community residents; mine employees and their spouses, including visa-holders) was not negotiated via BHP Billiton. Rather, the rapport established during the ethnographic fieldwork facilitated a long-term relationship of trust with many participants. Other interviewees and the focus group participants were identified at community meetings.</p>
<p>The sample consisted of eight long-term, pre-mine residents, most of whom had had a long engagement with BHP Billiton community liaison managers and held leadership positions in the shire, six post-mine community members who had arrived in Ravensthorpe as a direct result of the mine operation and who would be leaving because of its closure, and a focus group with seven (six male, one female) mine employees and two female spouses newly arrived in Ravensthorpe on temporary, employer-sponsored, work visas (also known as ‘business long-stay [457] visas’; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0022185611432382">Toner and Woolley, 2008</xref>). The seven focus group employee participants were chemical engineers brought in as a result of an immigration policy in Australia that allows professionals with skills in short supply to enter the country, provided they settle outside of designated areas of high levels of immigrant settlement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0022185611432382">Hugo et al., 2006</xref>). Because of their temporary employment arrangements, these individuals faced imminent forced departure from Australia due to the mine closure.</p>
<p>Interviews were emotionally charged and began with participants recounting how they first heard about the closure and describing their memories of the events of that day. This typically progressed to discussions of what the announcement meant for them, their families and the community. Themes were identified inductively from transcriptions, guided by broad concepts outlined in the labour geography literature, including the spatial characteristics of labour and capital and relations between local and global spheres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0022185611432382">Massey, 1984</xref>).</p></sec>

<sec id="sec7-0022185611432382"><title>The mobility of labour in mining</title>
<p>Strongly emphasized in the interviews were the implications for the families of mine employees who had had former experiences of FIFO working arrangements. As the Ravensthorpe nickel mine was conceived of as a residential mining town, many workers and their families who relocated to the shire experienced more regular shift arrangements and stronger family relationships through daily contact and through ‘eating together and planning weekend activities’. As one new resident and mother explained:<disp-quote>
<p>With FIFO there’s a lot of sacrifices. We just thought if we were together, and my husband would be home every night, we could discuss issues that arise in the day. Whereas it’s very hard over the phone.</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>As a consequence of the closure, families faced intense and stressful financial and emotional uncertainty and a probable need to relocate to another mining community, or return to their home towns and for the worker to resume FIFO arrangements. One couple described it as needing to ‘throw a dart at a dartboard and work out where to go’. Longer-term, contracted employees anticipated difficulties in moving quickly to ‘pick the eyes out of what jobs were available’ in the downturned sector. The community and familial dimensions of the consolidation of global corporate resource and energy interests through mergers and acquisitions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0022185611432382">Russell, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0022185611432382">Waring, 2005</xref>) were clearly evident as interviewees spoke of the difficulty of finding alternative employment. Fears of gaining a reputation as a troublemaker, where opportunities for jobs were limited, illustrates the relatively recent but acute shift of the mining sector from collective to individualized employment contracts and the resulting uncertainty this created: ‘If they’re seen to be stirring the pot, they won’t get a job anywhere in the mining industry. … It’s not that big a circle of workers’ (new resident, mine employee).</p>
<p>Mine employees and their families spoke of a sense of loss, betrayal and anger as they recounted how partners/sons/daughters/siblings had worked long hours to meet and exceed the increasingly high production targets set by the company:<disp-quote>
<p>They set all these production targets for people. November they set us a target, December they set us a target. … These things were just almost unachievable considering the base that we were starting from, and every single target was met. (Female partner of mine employee)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>These sentiments are salient because while the impact of continuous production, extended working hours and compressed and extended shifts in mining have been critically examined from the perspective of employees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0022185611432382">Barry and Waring, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0022185611432382">Heiler and Pickersgill, 2001</xref>), it is clear that these changes also have significant familial dimensions. The anger and loss expressed by mine employees and their families also exemplify the different orientations capital and labour may have towards space; the former seeing particular locations as sites for profit generation, the latter as sites for social reproduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0022185611432382">Herod et al., 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>While uncertainty and distress are all too commonplace when mines, even with years of planning, cease operations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0022185611432382">Laurence, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0022185611432382">Pini et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0022185611432382">Warhurst et al., 1999</xref>), these impacts were amplified in Ravensthorpe. One factor augmenting distress was that mine workers, unaware of the impending closure, were continuing to be relocated to the area until the eve of the official announcement: ‘It was supposed to be my first day. … I was in the service station paying for the petrol and he said “They’ve closed the mine down”. And I thought he was joking’ (New mine employee).</p>
<p>An especially acute sense of shock and betrayal around relocation was experienced by the visa-holders interviewed. Most had arrived only recently in Australia with the promise of a two-year contract and many, like their citizen counterparts, still had their possessions in transit. A respondent also described the situation of a South African family whose ‘furniture had left Africa, but was still on the sea’. These workers and their families were subsequently faced with expulsion from Australia if they were unable to find alternative employment – a situation exacerbated by their recent arrival and consequently few opportunities to acquire local competencies and become familiar with work routines and occupational practices that may have been different from previous experiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0022185611432382">Toner and Woolley, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>The Filipino workers who participated in the focus group also had few prospects of regaining employment in their former company in the Philippines because, by resigning from the Japanese-owned company, they had apparently demonstrated that they were no longer ‘loyal employees’. The global dimension of this phenomenon challenges a well-documented belief that capital is mobile (capable of transcending space) while labour is relatively immobile (confined to place) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0022185611432382">Rainnie et al., 2007</xref>). However, the unique problems faced by visa-holders and, to a lesser extent, Australian citizens who were still in transit to Ravensthorpe when the closure was announced, throws into stark relief the way in which profound changes in the spatial constitution of labour relations in mining, driven by the globalization of capital, affect the precarious mobility of workers and also their families.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec8-0022185611432382"><title>The Rescaling of Work and Employment Practices</title>
<p>A typical strategy employed by mining corporations to manage their relationship with the communities in which they operate is to establish liaison groups consisting of mine representatives and selected community members. For participants of the groups established by BHP Billiton there was, as one explained, ‘a sense of being disheartened’, as they reflected on the considerable unpaid labour they had undertaken through their membership in order to lubricate BHP Billiton’s relationship with the community. A number of these participants gained no personal benefit from this work. However, they explained that they gave their time and effort on the basis of what they believed would be real, long-term benefits for their community. They demonstrated the complexity of the notion of ‘community’ as a fixed unit of analysis as they recalled wanting benefits to flow not only to the material community of the present, but also to the community they conjured and imagined as existing in the future. Their comments also revealed that while a rich social fabric and strong sense of shared community may heighten the demands on the company (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0022185611432382">Ellem, 2006</xref>: 376), in the end, it is the company that holds the balance of power in facilitating economic benefits. It also suggests that the narrow constructions of community embedded in what is colloquially known as the ‘social licence to operate’ – the unwritten, contingent and ongoing trust in an operation from support through to approval (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.sociallicense.com">www.socialicense.com</ext-link>) – fail to acknowledge community as both an emotional, intersubjective ‘place’ or experience, as well as a physical site in which community is made possible.</p>
<p>It is important to note that individuals and groups within the Ravensthorpe community had various relationships with the mine. While some engaged in what is described in the literature as ‘place marketing’ or ‘town entrepreneurialism’ in order to showcase the availability and acquiescence of their populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0022185611432382">Rainnie and Dean, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0022185611432382">Rainnie et al., 2007</xref>), for others, the arrival of the mine was unwelcome. Some long-term residents saw the infrastructure developed to support the mine as erasing the very characteristics that drew them to the town:<disp-quote>
<p>But the reason why everyone came here was because it was the town it was. We didn’t come for the hustle and bustle. … We didn’t want their schools and community big flash halls. We just love the old world of Hopetoun.</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Likewise, the increased population was not welcomed by some residents, who perceived some new groups as ‘keeping to themselves’ and hence ‘splitting the community’. Jerdacuttup, where the mine was actually located, was especially reshaped around the mine site, and local residents were concerned about the loss of the region’s identity as a farming community and its transformation to ‘That place next to the mine’. These various relationships to the mine highlight the heterogeneous nature of orientations, commitments, understandings and perceived attachments to ‘place’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0022185611432382">Beynon and Hudson, 1993</xref>) and the different ways in which social actors preferred to see the economic landscape produced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0022185611432382">Rainnie et al., 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Despite various relationships with the mine during its development phases, respondents universally reported that following the closure announcement, BHP Billiton’s relationship with the community became immediately cool and distanced. As one long-term resident observed: ‘The party’s over. Elvis has left the building.’ A salient aspect of this distancing was the immediate appointment of new public relations and general managers, neither of whom had an existing relationship with the community. High turnover of on-site mine managers was also documented by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0022185611432382">Ellem (2004)</xref> in an account of how mining operations in the Pilbara region of Australia were transformed in a period of intense social and political upheaval, and the resulting impacts on the quality of working and social life and uncertainty about family time. The appointment of new managers represents a rescaling of work and employment practices and illustrates a geographical hierarchy of place, effectively transferring decision-making from the local or regional level to a national one (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0022185611432382">Rainnie et al., 2007</xref>). With newly appointed managers, a narrower focus on contractual rather than community obligations and a distancing of BHP staff from public meetings and relationships built up over many years, residents of Ravensthorpe felt that the company had exploited their unpaid labour and manipulated the community. One long-term resident and community leader believed that the company had shouldered relatively little risk and financial burden compared to the state government and residents themselves. He described, for example, the sudden withdrawal of BHP from community engagement following the closure announcement:<disp-quote>
<p>They are absolutely resolute in their desire to only compensate and only support those people that they have a contractual agreement with. … We’ve had two meetings that have been convened by the Chamber of Commerce [local business community] in Hopetoun and I know for a fact that at none of these meetings was there any representation whatsoever from BHP. … At every turn we receive closed doors, unanswered phone calls, unreturned messages, non-reply to emails.</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Past scholarship on mining communities has highlighted the central role unions played as community actors (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0022185611432382">Mercier, 2001</xref>), particularly in their efforts to expand industrial disputes geographically by ‘upscaling’, or bringing in national and global entities to bring pressure to bear on companies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0022185611432382">Rainnie et al., 2007</xref>). At the same time, the literature has revealed how the rescaling of a relatively homogeneous collective bargaining landscape to one characterized by individualism and locally specific regulation has marginalized unions across the sector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0022185611432382">Ellem, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0022185611432382">Herod et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0022185611432382">Rainnie et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0022185611432382">Timo, 1997</xref>). Less well documented, however, is how the diminution of union activity and membership in the contemporary mining industry has affected communities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0022185611432382">Peetz, 2006</xref>). In Ravensthorpe, the absence of unions exacerbated the withdrawal of community liaison functions and was clearly evident in the lack of public protest at the closure of the mine. There was an obvious lack of reference to trade unions in interview responses, with only one respondent noting the role a union might have played in the closure: ‘They wouldn’t have done it if that was a union site. The union just wouldn’t let them do what they did. They’d probably have to be ramped down slowly but don’t just walk in and say “We close it”’ (New resident, mine employee).</p>
<p>The distinction between BHP Billiton employees and contractors, who had lesser entitlements than employees, was made repeatedly across interviews. Mining firms increasingly solve their internal labour problems through subcontracting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0022185611432382">Herod et al., 2007</xref>) and large numbers of contractors are characteristic of their workforce profiles. Effectively marking a boundary between ‘staff’ and ‘contractors’ and curbing any protest or militancy, the lesser status of contractors following the closure was conveyed to them by BHP management as they were corralled outside for the announcement. Residents also reported that the company had secretly arranged for buses, planes and additional security staff to be on-site to immediately facilitate the removal of contractors. These actions of BHP highlight how processes of decentralization and individualization of employment relations in mining reshape the geography of work and regulation, affecting the power of organizational actors to operate in and control particular spaces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0022185611432382">Ellem, 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0022185611432382">2005</xref>).</p></sec>
<sec id="sec9-0022185611432382"><title>Capital’s Spatial Relationships and Structures</title>
<p>Evidence of the interrelationship between physical and social geographies was the way in which ‘the mine’ seeped into all aspects of the material, economic, relational and emotional dimensions of the community. This was patently clear as research participants reflected upon the obvious changes to the visible landscape following the arrival of the operation. One resident, for example, described the irreparable clearing of large tracts of land as ‘an ugly great scar on the landscape that can be seen for kilometres in either direction’. Despite public consultation and, as one respondent stated, promises from the company ‘about not doing that’, the premature closing of the mine, the departure of senior mine managers and the short-term contract of the current environmental officer all contributed to cynicism that the planned clean-up would be delayed by red tape or would not eventuate at all. Concerns about environmental impacts on the community were not confined to visual degradation, but extended to the longer-term health and safety of workers and residents, including: the mine’s extensive use of sulphur, which required ‘specially modified loaders to load it because it is so volatile it can ignite’; exposure to asbestos (mineral) fibres, which required workers to ‘wear a dust mask at all parts of the pit all the time’; and run-off and seepage from highly salinated ‘evaporation ponds’.</p>
<p>The abrupt cessation of mine machinery and the departure of many town residents evident in ‘convoys of removal trucks’ were highly visible reminders of the exodus expected to follow. One prominent community resident described the closure as ‘out of a movie … like the old westerns when they have the tumbleweed rolling around’. Indeed, a central theme in the narratives was of the silence following the closure. This silence was disconcerting for long-term residents and mine employees and their families, who had become accustomed to the ongoing din and clatter of a mine site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0022185611432382">Pini et al., 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Pragmatic economic concerns were also repeatedly expressed, such as the impact of the closure on newly established, small business owners who had moved to the area to build infrastructure and service the town’s growing population, but who had no advance warning of the closure. Economic ripple effects extended to businesses and communities hundreds of kilometres beyond the shire as a result of reduced business-to-business trading and the cessation of outsourced and adjunct activities that serviced the mine. This highlights the way the interrelation of the forms of activity and social relationships imposed by mining work, upon which the community is based, extends beyond the community, in both space and time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0022185611432382">Dennis et al., 1956</xref>). Concerns around the economic landscape were also expressed in terms of the ongoing maintenance of infrastructure and services that had been built during the mine’s construction and operation, investments that are characteristic of contemporary, residential mining communities:<disp-quote>
<p>The child care centre. The amount of bituminised roads that have been put in. The sewerage. The extra power, we’ve got another wind turbine. … So the shire will have to maintain quite a bit of that infrastructure and it will be … a big cost for the few rate payers. (New resident, wife of mine employee)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Community residents, in quotations such as these, were tacitly aware of what Johnson et al. (2004, p.16) refer to as a ‘vicious downward spiral of economic conditions’ associated with population loss and the interwoven nature of residents’ migration intentions with the prospects for community sustainability and persistence.</p>
<p>The emotions triggered by the closure of the mine appeared as public expressions of overwhelming shock, grief and anxiety as the reality of economic insecurity set in alongside the loss of friends, community members and a sense of a ‘bright’ future that had ‘put the town in the 21st century’. These complex feelings were publicly displayed in a series of impromptu street gatherings on the night of the closure and an emotional, national-holiday Australia Day celebration at the local oval. These public connections forged between workers and their families and members of the community not connected to mining, were an example of the way in which geographic space, at particular historical junctures, can be produced and manipulated as a form of social power and self-reproduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0022185611432382">Herod, 1997</xref>).</p></sec></sec>
<sec id="sec10-0022185611432382" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title>
<p>This case study of the shock closure of the Ravensthorpe nickel mine demonstrates how complex interconnections between resource-dependent families and communities and the institutions within which they are imbricated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0022185611432382">Rainnie et al., 2007</xref>) are inherently spatial. It is likely that the findings from this study, which focuses on one contemporary, rural mining community at a time of intense emotional upheaval, represent a magnification of phenomena that occur in less concentrated ways in other sectors and geographic areas. However, in highlighting work–family–community connections at such a moment in time, the study demonstrates that any workplace and its associated labour market cannot be understood in isolation from communities, as well as the private sphere of the household and the associated labour of social reproduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0022185611432382">Wajcman, 2000</xref>: 196). In Ravensthorpe, for example, an exclusive focus on work and employment practices as enacted in the context of the mine’s closure would be incomplete without an understanding of the way that mining work, especially in light of recent and significant transformations in the sector, shaped the physical, emotional, economic and social dimensions of the region. The findings also begin to address the ‘hegemonic paralysis’ of the work–family conflict discourse that presents work and family as incommensurable spheres, and which obscures numerous, problematic narratives such as the privileging of men and masculinities in organizations and the characterization of familial responsibilities as ‘non-work’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0022185611432382">Runte and Mills, 2006</xref>: 713, 715).</p>
<p>The study further addressed the limited work to date on work–family–community connections in mining by revealing how complex notions of what constitutes ‘community’, and the fluid and fractured relationships that exist between individuals and mining (e.g. as having coexisting but conflictual experiences), are in stark contrast to the highly structuralist understandings of community imposed by the mining industry in ‘social impact assessments’. The research demonstrated the strength of understanding community not as a fixed and static unit of analysis largely (or solely) associated with a geographic space, but as a set of practices, discourses, beliefs and meanings, which are shifting, multiple and potentially contested (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0022185611432382">Liepins, 2000</xref>). However, mining research, which is predominantly sponsored by the resource sector and which therefore privileges the interests of mining corporations, frequently defines ‘community’ (and ‘the social’) largely in terms of infrastructure, focusing only on those the industry identifies as ‘stakeholders’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0022185611432382">Rolfe et al., 2007</xref>) and the way communities can best be ‘managed’. This emphasis overlooks the uneven distributions of the costs and benefits of mining and the impact on the social fabric of ‘community’, in all its multiple forms and meanings. The complexity of these relationships challenges existing, dualistic readings of mining workers and communities as either strong and resilient, or narrow and parochial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0022185611432382">Strangleman et al., 1999</xref>). They further demonstrate a fundamental distinction in labour geography between notions of ‘space’ – the location of capital’s profitable production where workers and their families live and are provided with economic opportunities – and ‘place’ – a location of considerable individual and collective cultural and emotional investment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0022185611432382">Beynon and Hudson, 1993</xref>).</p>
<p>The events and circumstances leading to the Ravensthorpe closure were, in many respects, atypical in terms of permanent mine closures. For example, the closure followed an intensive and lengthy engagement with government and the local community to develop the mine, and closed only eight months after its official opening and at a time when 100% of production targets were being met. In this sense, the single case explored here offers highly specific and unique local insights at a particular historical and geographical conjuncture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0022185611432382">Gibson-Graham, 1991</xref>). At the same time, localized spatial understandings of the social relations of work are highly relevant to global spheres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0022185611432382">Ellem, 2005</xref>), and questions of meaning for individuals can contribute to a broader theoretical engagement within and between fields (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0022185611432382">Donmoyer, 2000</xref>). A potentially limiting aspect of the community-study technique is that an emphasis on the interrelations between economic and social frameworks may obscure the significance of vastly bigger institutions and relationships that extend beyond, and influence, the community (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0022185611432382">Dennis et al., 1956</xref>). However, the approach here sought to explore how the mobilities and scales of labour and capital, and local work–family–community boundaries, are co-constituted. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0022185611432382">Weller (2007)</xref> emphasizes the importance of connections between phenomena at local and national levels, suggesting that the potential agency of contemporary actors in reconfiguring scaled structures is constrained and shaped by real differences in the structures of different nations. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0022185611432382">Massey (1994)</xref> similarly argues that the geographies of work need to be understood as contradictions within capital–labour relations and global–local intersections. While the work–family–community connections revealed in this research begin to hint at these complex associations, it is acknowledged that they remain limited, to some extent, by the ‘path-dependent’ trajectory in the context of Australian political, economic and legal structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0022185611432382">Weller, 2007</xref>), which may be distinct from connections that exist in mining towns and regions in other places and at other times.</p>
<p>As has been argued, the phenomena demonstrated in Ravensthorpe are likely to be complex and blurred in many industries and workplaces, but are amplified in mining work due to relatively recent and dramatic changes to employment conditions in the sector. Several employment practices characteristic of these changes were highlighted. These include: the widespread adoption of FIFO arrangements, despite significant concerns about its impact on the economic and social vitality of regional communities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0022185611432382">Storey, 2001</xref>), which facilitate the mobility of labour, including the employment of immigrants on temporary visas; an increasing use of contracted labour; and shifts to individualism and locally specific regulation, which marginalizes trade unions. Importantly, the reconfigured mobility of capital in the sector, especially the practice of ‘importing’ workers into a region but playing a limited role in supporting them when they are no longer required, suggests that the events in Ravensthorpe may, in the future, become less idiosyncratic and more commonplace. Finally, the spatially-oriented approach highlights the way in which capital’s productive ‘space’ and social ‘place’ collide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0022185611432382">Herod, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0022185611432382">Peck, 1996</xref>), underscoring the ways in which employment relations are enacted with and by not only workers, but also families and communities.</p></sec>
