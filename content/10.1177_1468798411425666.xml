<abstract>
<p>Research indicates that mothers scaffold the literacy skills of their children when jointly engaged in literacy-related activities in monolingual families (Tamis-LeMonda et al., 2001). Yet little is known about the linguistic environment of English language learners in the USA, a group at high risk for reading difficulties if they are only taught in English and the school is not mindful of their linguistic and cultural strengths (Snow et al., 1998). We studied mother–child language interactions in Spanish-speaking families in the USA during two literacy-related activities at home (book reading and a homework-like task). We employed language data analysis, discourse analysis, surveys and observations to study four cases of mother–child communication and its relation to the children’s literacy and language skills (letter-word identification, dictation, vocabulary). Mother–child proficiency in the same language (Spanish, English or bilingual similarities between mother and child) was necessary, but not sufficient, to facilitate their communication. Maternal language and literacy skills in this sample related to the quality of language input, but only in dyads with shared language did it relate to successful communication and the child’s skills. Continuity between home/school language and literacy showed compounded support for language that transferred to literacy skills across languages. This association was observed even in dyads with mothers who had scored low on receptive vocabulary or/and had only a few years of formal education. These findings suggest that maintaining a school language environment that preserves mother–child communication and its positive association with learning would yield the best educational outcomes for this particular population.</p>

<p>The amount and quality of home language interaction are strong predictors of children’s early literacy skills in low-income families (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1468798411425666">Chow and McBride-Chang, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1468798411425666">Kowaleski-Jones and Duncan, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1468798411425666">Weigel et al., 2006</xref>). Early literacy skills in turn predict later school success (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1468798411425666">National Assessment of Educational Progress, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1468798411425666">Stanovich, 1986</xref>). In monolingual families, skills in a common language as well as home and school language and literacy resources facilitate communication and maternal scaffolding of children’s learning. However, little is known about the home language resources available to children in language-minority (LM) families. At school entry, these young children often switch to using English very rapidly while caregivers use the home language. Given the strong connection between language and literacy skills, examining how language differences impact on communication within LM families becomes critical for understanding how these children can achieve the daunting task of learning to read in a second language (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1468798411425666">Tannenbaum and Howie, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>In this study, we investigated mother–child language interactions in Spanish-speaking families, or language-minority (LM) families in the USA, a largely monolingual English-speaking society with an educational approach emphasizing schooling in English. Schools in the USA use standardized tests, and often disregard a child’s skills and their knowledge in the home language. Children from Spanish-speaking homes are also considered an ethnic minority and often live in ethnic/language segregated communities and are more likely to attend high-poverty schools; this is unfortunately also the case for immigrant children in other countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1468798411425666">Barkhuizen, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1468798411425666">Bayley and King, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1468798411425666">Folmer, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1468798411425666">Tran, 2008</xref>). For example, the scarcity of resources allocated to bilingual education creates and maintains a home/school language discontinuity (Spanish at home and English at school) for a large majority of LM children. Growing up in an environment with segregated language communities increases home-language loss, limiting children’s access to language input and literacy resources at home (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1468798411425666">Barkhuizen, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1468798411425666">Bayley and King, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1468798411425666">Folmer, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1468798411425666">Tran, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>In English monolingual families, mothers with high educational levels and high incomes tend to use language similar to the language demanded by schools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1468798411425666">De Temple, 2001</xref>). However, low-income families show variation in the type of language they use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1468798411425666">Rowe et al., 2005</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1468798411425666">Rowe and colleagues (2005)</xref> found varied discourse patterns in mother–child interactions among families participating in Head Start programmes. Some of these patterns have been found, in middle-class families, to be associated with successful readers, i.e. explanations and the use of rare words. In an ethnically diverse Head Start sample, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1468798411425666">Dickinson and Tabors (2001)</xref> found aspects of mother–child communication to be strong predictors of school readiness, whereas socioeconomic status was not. Could these facilitating effects also benefit English language learners’ (ELLs) literacy skills in low-income families?</p>
<p>The following study examines the language environment of four Spanish-speaking families with preschool children to examine mother–child interaction and its role in communication and the children’s early literacy skills. We used triangulation of multiple data sources (observational and survey data, linguistic measures and discourse analysis) to analyze the interactions. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1468798411425666">Table 1</xref> shows the four families’ background characteristics.

<p>We developed three hypotheses to organize the case materials and enable predictions. Although hypothesis-testing is usually associated with large-scale studies, these four cases are a unique resource for developing hypotheses that can be tested on a larger scale in future studies. The triangulation of data provides some validity for the inferential hypotheses presented. Furthermore, the richness of the descriptive material provides a portrait of how abstract variables play out in actual mother–child interactions, enabling us to understand the complex combinations of linguistic and interactional variables forming the environment of ELLs. We predict that the best conditions to facilitate the ELLs’ language and literacy skills will come from the confluence of three factors: mother and child sharing a common language (shared language (SL)); maternal language and literacy support (maternal education and vocabulary, and reading books at home); and home/school language continuity (through bilingual education).</p>
<sec id="sec2-1468798411425666"><title>Hypotheses 1a and 1b</title>
<p><italic>Hypothesis 1a: SL is necessary to achieve mother–child communication, but other factors will interact with SL.</italic> Children’s Spanish language skills are necessary to achieve SL because all the mothers used Spanish during interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1468798411425666">Tannenbaum and Howie, 2002</xref>). <italic>Hypothesis 1b: Dyads with SL and home/school continuity will be able to communicate more with their family members, increasing one-on-one language interactions, resulting in larger vocabulary</italic> (Weizman and Snow, 2000). Also, children with greater home language vocabulary tend to learn English vocabulary faster than children who have limited home language vocabulary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1468798411425666">August and Hakuta, 1997</xref>). Thus, bilingual education, or the opportunity to receive instruction in the home language during the first years of schooling, is hypothesized to enhance these relationships and increase the possibility of a cross-linguistic effect. Attending a bilingual programme affords the child more opportunities to develop concepts in a language that is relevant to their experiences in both contexts. This extended exposure to concepts provides more opportunities to encounter words they could associate to their concrete experiences across contexts – the best way to learn new words (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1468798411425666">Pellegrini and Galda, 2007</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec3-1468798411425666"><title>Hypothesis 2</title>
<p>Maternal literacy skills (the mother’s Spanish vocabulary and educational level) will have a direct impact on the children’s literacy skills, but because maternal literacy is in Spanish it may not be associated with the children’s early bilingual skills. Maternal literacy skills, although important for fostering children’s early literacy skills, might be secondary to SL, because mother–child communication, or opportunities to access each other’s messages, is a prerequisite for the cross-generational transfer of language and literacy skills.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-1468798411425666"><title>Hypothesis 3</title>
<p>For ELLs in English school programmes, maternal talk will influence children’s achievement scores in English skills through the transfer of literacy skills across languages. Transfer of some early (i.e. letter recognition) literacy skills from Spanish to English may be facilitated by their similar structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1468798411425666">Genesee et al., 2006</xref>).</p>

<sec id="sec6-1468798411425666"><title>Case selection</title>
<p>Four children were selected from a larger study in which language data from 51 children and their mothers were collected at their homes in a metropolitan area of Massachusetts. The 51 children’s standardized scores in English and Spanish vocabulary from the beginning of their preschool year were mapped to create a quadrant distribution of the children’s bilingualism: low English–low Spanish, low English–high Spanish, high English–low Spanish, and high English–high Spanish (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1468798411425666">Table 1</xref>). One child was selected from each of these four categories, based on the completion of their data coding. The first child from each of the bilingualism categories whose language interaction from two mother–child activities was completely transcribed was chosen. Audio tapes were chosen by the transcribers in no particular order and listed in the order that they were finished.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec7-1468798411425666"><title>Data collection instruments</title>
<p><italic>Interviews.</italic> Two interviews, one conducted over the phone during the autumn of the children’s preschool year and one face to face conducted during the spring of the same year, were given to the main caregivers, in all cases the mothers. Demographic data that were time sensitive were drawn from the face-to-face interview and stable family characteristics were used from the phone interview. Both interviews gathered information about the family language and literacy environment. The face-to-face interview had more detailed and specific questions about language use at home and literacy resources, as well as parents’ beliefs and practices (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1468798411425666">Table 1</xref>).</p>
<p><italic>Mother–child interaction activities. </italic>Two activities were used to elicit mother–child language interactions: a book-sharing activity and the completion of a homework-like sheet. We used a wordless picture book, <italic>Frog Where Are You? </italic>by Mercer Mayer. We refer to these activities as BK for the book-sharing activity and HW for the homework from here on. A homework sheet with varying tasks was chosen for the HW. The tasks were writing letters of the alphabet on a line, word completion and initial sound identification. The letter-writing demands were very explicit: first, the homework sheet presented a model of the letter with arrows indicating the stroke direction. The letters ‘S’ and ‘T’ were chosen so Spanish-speaking parents would be able to recognize them, as their sounds are similar in Spanish. The word completion was self-explanatory, the location of the requested letter was shaded and a model of the word and a picture were presented above it. The initial sound identification was more demanding since it required reading the English instructions. However, parents who were familiar with this type of homework could deduce what was being requested of them by looking at the objects in the picture; the initial sound of their names was always /s/ or /t/ in English and Spanish. For example, there was a telephone (or<italic> teléfono</italic> in Spanish). This activity has high face validity because it resembles the type of HW parents encounter every day in the USA, although immigrant parents may often be unfamiliar with this type of task (e.g. if they attended school in a different country).</p>
<p><italic>Mothers’ vocabulary measures</italic>. The Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test – Revised (PPVT; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1468798411425666">Dunn and Dunn, 1981</xref>) and the Test de Vocabulario en Imágenes Peabody (TVIP; Dunn et al., 1986) were used to measure the mothers’ receptive vocabulary in English and Spanish. These tests are not comparable across languages because the Spanish version provides norms up to 18 years old, while the English offers norms up to 99 years old. The raw scores were used here, primarily to compare skills among the participants of this study within language and not to a normative sample (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1468798411425666">Table 1</xref>).</p>
<p><italic>Children’s language and literacy skills. </italic>The vocabulary, letter-word identification and dictation sub-tests of both the English Woodcock Johnson Language Battery – Revised (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1468798411425666">Woodcock, 1991</xref>) and the Spanish version (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1468798411425666">Woodcock and Muñoz-Sandoval, 1995</xref>) were used in the large study to assess the children’s English and Spanish language and literacy skills. One cognitive test (memory for sentences sub-test) was included to control for its possible confounding role. Standardized scores were obtained on each task in the spring of 2002, although they were only used to compare between the children and not to the norm population, as measuring their vocabulary in separate languages would underestimate their linguistic skills.</p>
<p><italic>School observations and teacher interviews. </italic>Data from school observations and interviews with the teacher and paraprofessional of each child were collected by researchers in the large study.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec8-1468798411425666"><title>Purpose and procedure for implementation</title>
<p><italic>Mother interviews. </italic>Family characteristics and demographics were gathered through the mother interviews. A Spanish-speaking researcher (the first author) gathered demographic information in spring 2001 via a 20-minute phone interviews conducted at the time and in the language preferred by each mother. During the spring of 2002, two Spanish/English bilingual and bicultural researchers (including the first author) visited the families at home. The visits lasted for between one and a quarter hours and two and a half hours, and a face-to-face interview was conducted first. This interview was used to learn about the family's language and literacy environment in greater detail than the phone interview had achieved. Interviews were conducted in the mother’s language of choice – Spanish for all four (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1468798411425666">Table 1</xref>). After each interview, the mother’s vocabulary assessment was made. Mother were invited to start with their stronger language as self-assessed (Spanish in all four cases). We believed this would build their confidence level.</p>
<p>After the mother’s vocabulary testing, two activities were given to the mother and child to elicit mother–child language interactions:</p>
<p><italic>Book sharing. </italic>Mothers were given the wordless picture book <italic>Frog Where Are You?</italic> by Mercer Mayer and asked to share it with their child in the same way they usually did. When mothers requested more prompting, they were instructed to share the book with their child in whatever way they felt comfortable. This activity required low communicative demands, because the pictures, which lend themselves to narrative construction, contextualized the communication between mother and child, and mothers were likely to be familiar with oral storytelling. Wordlessness allowed the mothers to use any language or style they chose to share the book. The book selected has been widely used to measure the narrative and other linguistic skills of both adults and children in previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1468798411425666">Berman and Slobin, 1994</xref>).</p>
<p><italic>Homework. </italic>Mothers were then given the HW assignment and asked to help their children with it as they usually did. If needed, mothers were instructed to do what they could to help their child finish the assignment. Although no other study known to us has looked at language interactions during homework, we considered this activity to involve high communicative demands. These Spanish-speaking mothers with limited English proficiency needed to help their children, with varied proficiency in Spanish, complete a HW assignment with English directions.</p>
<p>The children’s outcome data were collected at school in one-on-one sessions during the spring of their preschool year by researchers who were native speakers (pretending to be monolingual) of the language they were testing. Each language was assessed on a separate day, and the stronger language was assessed first to help the children feel confident (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1468798411425666">Table 2</xref>). Throughout the home visit, one researcher provided childcare when necessary. Interviews were audio-taped, and both researchers took field notes. The families received $50 or a gift certificate for a grocery or department store as a token of appreciation for their participation.

Audio tapes of the language interactions were transcribed using the convention of Codes for the Human Analysis of Transcripts (CHAT) and coded and analyzed using the Computerized Language Analysis program (CLAN) of the Child Language Data Exchange System (CHILDES) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1468798411425666">MacWhinney, 2000</xref>).</p>
<sec id="sec10-1468798411425666"><title>Claudia: Low English–low Spanish</title>
<p>Claudia and her mother had the lowest vocabulary scores in Spanish and English among these cases, except for the mother’s English score, which was second to lowest (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1468798411425666">Tables 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1468798411425666">2</xref>). They are in a dyad with SL, although both mother and child had limited bilingualism and language skills in Spanish. This home had limited language and literacy resources, with no books in the house, limited maternal skills and low frequency of reading in the family (by maternal report). This was Claudia’s first year of preschool in an English-only preschool programme and she was five years and two months old at the time of testing. The adults in her house as well as the observed neighborhood environment showed limited English use.</p>
<p><italic>Observation. </italic>During the home visit, Claudia was playing outside with a group of children of various ages who spoke Spanish among themselves. An older woman, who seemed to be supervising the children, was outside in a large yard in front of the apartment building; she spoke to several of the children in Spanish. Claudia played outside, occasionally re-entering and then exiting the house with two friends, while this first author interviewed her mother. Claudia’s mother called upon one of these friends to help during the HW activity. Her mother seemed to be familiar with Claudia’s friends as if they were family and spoke Spanish throughout. Claudia’s house was impeccably clean, carefully decorated and colour coordinated, with no books or toys in the house. Claudia’s mother did not seem to be aware of the sorts of activities or reading her older son or Claudia might be doing.</p>
<p>An excerpt from this dyad’s language interaction is presented below (see the referent for this interaction in Appendix 1).

<p>Claudia’s mother spoke the majority of the time during this activity, although Claudia interjected some questions but her mother did not generally acknowledge them. The excerpt presented above is a fair representation of their BK interaction. Most of their interactional turns, 37 out of 63 total turns produced by the mother, consisted of requesting or providing labels for the pictures in the book. Based on research in the area of mother–child book reading, this type of interaction, important for vocabulary acquisition, is often used in English monolingual mother–child reading with younger children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1468798411425666">Weizman and Snow, 2001</xref>). Claudia, who was exposed to book reading at school, tried to extend the interaction (line 5) by starting a story-like interpretation of the picture. Her mother did not follow her lead and continued to focus on picture labeling.</p>
<p>Although Claudia’s mother seemed to be unfamiliar with this activity, she demonstrated her learning competence as she modified her book-reading strategies even within this single BK activity. At the beginning of the book, Claudia’s mother was not using anaphoric references, i.e. the mother kept naming the characters from page to page, as ‘a boy’ or ‘a dog’ rather than ‘the boy’ or ‘the dog’, but by the end of the book, she used the anaphoric reference repeatedly.</p>
<p>During the HW this dyad’s missed communication was very salient. The following is an excerpt of the talk between Claudia and her mother during their attempt to complete this activity.

<p>Claudia and her mother were not able to complete all the tasks in the HW activity. The excerpt exemplifies the difficulties Claudia’s mother faced in trying to help her daughter complete the tasks in the HW. In this complex literacy task, the English language limitations of Claudia’s mother were compounded by her lack of familiarity with this literacy-specific task. Although the letters ‘S’ and ‘T’ are similar in Spanish and there were colour prompts and arrows to facilitate the completion of this task, Claudia’s mother struggled to understand what to do. These difficulties also diminished the quality of linguistic interaction they shared, and their discourse focused mainly on clarification talk (lines 2A–2C). Claudia’s mother did not refer to the letters by name or sound throughout the interaction. Instead, she pointed and substituted pronouns (i.e. that, this) for the names of the referents, which also limited the language input in this interaction. As observed on the longer turn (lines 8–8E) Claudia’s mother resorted to non-oral facilitation, holding Claudia’s hand, to bolster Claudia’s effort. Claudia’s mother also sought assistance from another child. That child, who was approximately four years of age, then attempted to help Claudia, but did not manifest task-specific skills significantly beyond Claudia’s mother. Rather, requesting academic intervention from a four-year-old seemed to undermine her parental role (line 6).</p>
<p><italic>Summary and conclusion. </italic>Despite SL, communication between Claudia and her mother seemed to be limited by the low vocabulary skills of both participants and the mother’s lack of familiarity with the tasks. Claudia’s mother was unable to support Claudia in these literacy-related activities because she was unfamiliar with them herself. The rich Spanish environment Claudia was exposed to in the community did not seem to be compensating for the limitations of Claudia’s one-on-one communication with her mother. Claudia’s case supports hypotheses 1a and 1b: (a) language shared between mother and child may be necessary, but it is not sufficient; and (b) mother’s language and literacy skills are also important to scaffold an instructional interaction.</p>

<sec id="sec11-1468798411425666"><title>Octavio: High Spanish–low English</title>
<p>Octavio and his mother were proficient in Spanish, as demonstrated by their vocabulary scores, and had limited bilingual proficiency with higher scores in Spanish, thus enjoying SL (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1468798411425666">Tables 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1468798411425666">2</xref>). Octavio was five years and four months old and in his second year at an English-only preschool programme. With no access to proficient English speakers, English resources at home or Spanish resources at school, Octavio experienced a discontinuous home/school linguistic environment. There were no books available to him. His mother reported not reading with him, and she reported having limited literacy skills herself. Although Octavio’s mother reported that she used the pictures in English books to convey stories to him in Spanish, she also reported she was teaching Octavio Spanish letter–sound correspondence and being very involved in the classroom. Octavio’s father, who did not live with them, preferred him to speak English at home, but there was nobody there who spoke English proficiently.</p>
<p><italic>Observation. </italic>Octavio’s family lived in a large building with many apartments. There was some common space outside the building, but no children were playing there that afternoon. Octavio was the only child at home and apparently was quite close to an older sister who lived nearby, as his mother reported during the interview. Octavio was firmly engaged in playing with toys and his mother had some difficulty in persuading him to participate in the activities. Octavio’s mother emphasized obedience. His mother evaluated Octavio with attributes of a ‘good’ child. Octavio seemed polite and cautious around the house. There were a few toys present, but no books. Octavio’s mother conversed easily and she discussed various topics with us, which was pleasant and welcoming.</p>

<p>Octavio’s mother produced the majority of the talk in the interaction, with some questions and comments from Octavio. She did not generally address Octavio’s questions or acknowledge his comments. Octavio’s mother primarily employed a narrative style in interpreting the pictures of this book. She focused on the cause-and-effect relationships in the story. She used dialogue and speech typically exhibited in oral storytelling. Her style was similar to a performance style as reported in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1468798411425666">De Temple (2001)</xref>. On several occasions, Octavio interrupted her and asked her to name the objects (e.g. line 2A), but the mother did not engage with her son in a dialogue or address his questions, but rather continued with the story. Octavio was presented with many opportunities to hear a wide variety of vocabulary, but the form in which these opportunities occurred may have differed from the story-reading style in school settings, typically more interactive. As was evident from several attempts he made to engage in the storytelling, he seemed familiar with the school’s style.</p>
<p>In studying Octavio and his mother’s discourse during the HW activity, we found that their communication was successful in that Octavio seemed to understand his mother’s instructions. The mother’s interpretation of the homework or what was expected of her was very different from the other mothers’.

<p>Despite the closely shared Spanish use in this dyad, Octavio was not able successfully to complete the HW task. His mother was able to assist him only in writing his name. Her difficulties in completing the task seemed to derive from its high literacy demands, but she was very successful in guiding Octavio through writing his name. She used literacy references that Octavio understood and vocabulary in a concrete context that they shared and he understood her Spanish (i.e. ‘like the first letter of your dad’s name’). However, she displayed little familiarity with the format of the HW assignment, although she reported she was very active at school.</p>
<p><italic>Summary and conclusion. </italic>Octavio’s mother seemed to be unfamiliar with the demands of literacy activities and this limitation seemed more pronounced during the HW. Octavio’s mother did not have the largest vocabulary in Spanish; however, she had excellent storytelling skills. Even though it was not very interactive, Octavio was engaged, as he remained attentively listening throughout the story. Octavio’s case is relevant to hypotheses 1a and 1b. Hypothesis 1a is partially confirmed: although language input was very complex in this dyad with SL, it was not sufficient for scaffolding the demands of the HW, and the limited maternal literacy skills precluded the dyad from successfully completing the activity, although not due to missed communication.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec12-1468798411425666"><title>Mauricio: High English–low Spanish</title>
<p>Mauricio’s mother had the highest vocabulary scores in both Spanish and English among these cases (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1468798411425666">Table 1</xref>). However, this dyad did not have SL: the mother spoke with Mauricio in Spanish, her dominant language, and Mauricio’s Spanish was very limited. Although the English vocabulary of this mother was larger than that of the other three mothers, it was still very limited. Mauricio’s father reported high proficiency in English and frequent reading to Mauricio in English; many books were available at home, mostly in English. Mauricio’s mother was very familiar with the USA school demands because she was a paraprofessional at a Head Start preschool programme. She had been trained as a teacher in the Dominican Republic and had the highest level of education among the four cases. She reported enjoying reading books and newspaper comics, and she and her husband read almost daily for themselves and to Mauricio in English and Spanish. Mauricio’s mother planned to teach Mauricio to read in Spanish, and reported he knew numbers, colours and shapes in both languages.</p>
<p><italic>Observation. </italic>Mauricio’s apartment contained some toys and books and was close to a park. No children were playing outside at the time of the visit. Mauricio consistently blended English and Spanish, and his mother decoded his speech, however complex the mixture was. He was five years and six months old at the time of testing and during our visit he seemed engaged and extroverted. He brought books spontaneously to read with us while his mother engaged in the interview. An excerpt from this dyad’s language interaction is presented below (see the referent for this interaction in Appendix 1).

<p>Mauricio was very enthusiastic about the activity. The book was shared as a narrative, mainly constructed by Mauricio’s mother. Mauricio took only seven turns out of a total of 67. Mauricio was engaged during the BK and it presented him with opportunities to hear language contextualized in a familiar activity. The type of questions this mother asked reflected those reported in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1468798411425666">De Temple and Snow (1996)</xref> in an English monolingual sample: the language presented to him went beyond the immediate context (i.e. explanations, elaborations) and his mother used specialized vocabulary. She often used synonyms with contextualized significance. For example, in the last line, she introduced two words to refer to the horns of the deer, but emphasized the specific form that was more appropriate for the context. Prompting diverse vocabulary, contextualized in narratives, has been observed among parents of children who are successful readers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1468798411425666">Beals, 1993</xref>).</p>
<p>Their HW interaction particularly illustrated the missed opportunities for learning language in a rich literacy environment caused by Mauricio’s home language limitations. An excerpt of this interaction follows.

<p>This section of the interaction depicts the mother’s difficulties in helping Mauricio with his English HW in Spanish and is representative of their overall HW interaction. Despite her familiarity with the school setting and high levels of literacy, communication difficulties impeded them from completing the HW. This mother’s familiarity with preschool settings was evident in the number of literacy strategies she used to try to help Mauricio, but this was insufficient because of Mauricio’s Spanish limitations. Mauricio’s mother took 20 turns to help Mauricio with writing the letters ‘i’ and ‘t’. Mauricio’s mother began by naming referents by the letter name. However, Mauricio struggled to follow her directions and she adjusted her approach by pointing and using pronouns to refer to the letter (lines 2F and 2P). This approach was similar to those used by Claudia’s mother. Not only were her literacy skills insufficient to scaffold the activity, but she had to adjust her directions both semantically (dropping the referent) and linguistically (code switching).</p>
<p><italic>Summary and conclusion. </italic>This example of language differences depicts missed opportunities due to Mauricio’s limited Spanish language skills. Mauricio’s mother used highly literate discourse, but Mauricio’s limited Spanish proficiency prevented him from benefiting from the high quality of language input, which was more evident during the HW activity. Just like Octavio and his mother, this dyad’s interactions differed drastically across the two activities. In the BK, Mauricio’s mother did most of the talking, while in the HW, he took many more turns and made requests for clarification. The advantage of his mother’s own education and familiarity with school settings was greatly limited by their linguistic differences. Mauricio’s case is relevant to hypothesis 1a: SL is required for communication; scaffolding difficulties were obvious, especially during the activity with more demanding literacy skills. During the highly contextualized BK activity, a shared history of book-reading routines helped them overcome some of their communication difficulties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1468798411425666">Snow and Ninio, 1986</xref>). Hypothesis 2 is also partially confirmed: the mother’s education and vocabulary appeared sufficient, in the absence of SL, for providing high-quality maternal input but not for successful communication – thus, not for supporting communicatively demanding activities.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec13-1468798411425666"><title>Tomás: High English–high Spanish</title>
<p>Tomás’s mother was Spanish dominant with limited bilingualism and literacy skills. This dyad had SL due to Tomás’s high Spanish language and literacy skills. Tomás experienced home/school linguistic continuity because he attended a Spanish/English bilingual preschool programme. He was receiving literacy support in both languages: Spanish at home and school and English at school. Most importantly, mother–child communication was facilitated by both SL and shared literacy-related contexts. This family used mostly Spanish at home, and reported owning many English and Spanish children’s books and reading to Tomás frequently in both languages. Tomás’s mother was teaching him to blend sounds and to create words in Spanish. Tomás was in his second year of a bilingual preschool programme and he was five years and four months old at the time of testing. His mother thought Tomás had made significant gains at school, whereas his father wished his son had already learned to read. His teacher strongly recommended speaking only Spanish at home.</p>
<p><italic>Observation. </italic>Tomás’s family environment seemed somewhat chaotic. It took several attempts to locate the family at home to carry out the home visit, despite arranging appointments at the family’s preferred times. The completed home visit occurred around dinnertime and the children seemed restless. The grandmother and the cousin spoke only Spanish. Tomás’s mother struggled to keep the other sibling at a distance. Tomás’s grandmother did not get involved, other than commenting that they needed the father to discipline them. According to the mother, there were clear goals and expectations for the children’s language use at home, as well as high academic expectations. Although the mother reported owning many books and reading to the children often, there were no books or printed materials in sight. The mother explained the children were expected to interact with the father often because they were boys. The neighborhood seemed to be organized in condominiums with no common spaces or playgrounds close by. However, they seemed to have built a social network with other Spanish-speaking friends, evident by the frequent social gatherings that prevented them from attending our appointments, as the mother reported.</p>

<p>The most salient aspect of this interaction was the role of the participants. This interaction was most like a dialogue with successful communication. The mother guided the interaction, but she often engaged Tomás by asking questions, elaborating or correcting Tomás’s contributions. Tomás asked many questions and often elaborated. In most cases, his mother addressed his input. She also focused closely on interpreting and elaborating from the book’s pictures and from Tomás’s contributions (lines 2–2F). She incorporated information not present in the illustrations by asking inferential questions (line 2C), providing opportunities to learn information, and making connections to the non-immediate world; these are strategies used in monolingual families with children who tend to have high literacy skills (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1468798411425666">DeTemple and Snow, 1996</xref>).</p>
<p>The following HW excerpt exemplifies this dyad’s linguistics resources in facilitating language interactions that have been shown to support early literacy skills.

<p>For this dyad, the HW activity was also different from the BK and overall more successful (they were able to complete the HW tasks as intended) than any of the other three dyads. During the HW, Tomás’s mother took most of the turns while Tomás attended to his mother’s instructions and completed the HW tasks with minimal oral participation. This dyad had both language continuity and familiarity with literacy through their SL (Spanish). Tomás’s mother used a type of prompting contextualized in the literacy format. Although she only named the letter in the beginning in Spanish and then switched to clues for writing directionality (line 7A), using a less concrete referent allowed her to use the same prompting for similar tasks. This ability to transport strategies across similar tasks is one of the stepping stones of literacy development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1468798411425666">Clay, 1979</xref>). She directed Tomás to use the numbering of the letter model in the tracing task for both tracings (lines 6A and 7A), and then for word completion. Linguistically, she was successful in scaffolding Tomás’s completion of the HW by modeling complex literacy strategies, naming letters, providing letter–sound correspondence and referring to concepts of print.</p>
<p><italic>Summary and conclusion. </italic>Among these four cases, Tomás and his mother had the most continuous form of language environment. Tomás’s mother and teacher were collaborating in maintaining Spanish use at home and English and Spanish at school. This dyad’s style in the BK interaction was quantitatively and qualitatively different from that of the other three dyads. Both used more language, they were more interactive, and they used more non-immediate talk (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1468798411425666">Table 3</xref>).

<p>This dyad also showed more adaptation to the particular demands of the HW, as their language became least interactive and more contextualized during the more demanding activity. The mother’s success (via SL) in supporting Tomás allowed them to complete the HW correctly, being the only dyad to do so. This case provides strong evidence for hypothesis 1a, the positive effect of SL on mother–child communication, and the complementary effect of home/school linguistic continuity was supported here even in the activity with high literacy demands. It partially disconfirms hypothesis 2: Tomás’s mother did not have the highest literacy skills, but there was home/school continuity of language and literacy support. The complementary language and literacy environment of home and school compensated for the limitations in maternal language and literacy skills; this situation facilitated communication around school-related activities even further than maternal literacy skills alone.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec14-1468798411425666"><title>Mother–child communication across cases and activities</title>
<p>The communication challenges encountered and the facilitating role of maternal language input differed among these four cases and between these two activities (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1468798411425666">Table 3</xref> for contrasting details). Active interaction between the participants, which is often used as a measure of the quality of interaction, did not always indicate communicative success among the participants. During the more demanding activity, it seemed to indicate the opposite, as evident in the HW discourse analysis and language use measures (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1468798411425666">Table 3</xref>). Maternal literacy related to the quality of maternal language input, but it only impacted on communication under SL conditions; further, the difficulty of the activities was also an important factor. Octavio, in the dyad with low literacy support, produced a low number of word types during the BK despite SL, and a large number of word types during the HW, where he produced more clarification requests. Although not every mother interpreted this task in the same way, a large mother-to-child ratio was a good indicator of successful scaffolding (see discourse excerpts). The large ratios during the BK seemed to indicate the least interactive styles, with the exception of Claudia’s where the child talked more than the mother (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1468798411425666">Table 3</xref>).</p>
<p>Additional support for hypothesis 2 was evident by the correspondence between the mother’s word types’ with the language categories of her child and the dyad’s rank among the cases. As predicted, SL – especially in dyads with home/school linguistic continuity – was associated with larger vocabulary scores (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1468798411425666">Tables 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1468798411425666">3</xref>). This was followed by maternal language and literacy skills (as in Mauricio’s case). These findings also support hypothesis 3: Mauricio, who had the highest literacy support at home, scored lower than Octavio and Tomás in both English and Spanish vocabulary. Although his English literacy scores were the highest, indicating a literacy-specific effect, they did not seem to impact on his vocabulary or transfer across languages. As predicted, Tomás’s dyad, with SL and in a home/school continuous language and literacy environment, used the largest number of word types, scored the highest on Spanish literacy skills and on English and Spanish vocabulary, and completed the HW correctly. This dyad’s communication was interactive during the BK where they successfully shared discourse around the same topic and informational references.</p>
<p>The MLU measure, as the indicator of language complexity, did not seem to capture cross-linguistic complexity across these cases consistently. During the BK, the largest MLUs were produced by the mothers in the dyads who did not use SL (Mauricio and his mother) and the mother with low literacy skills (Octavio’s mother). These cases had contrasting maternal literacy skills and SL. They produced the largest mother-to-child ratios (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1468798411425666">Table 2</xref>) during the BK. This contrast indicates that maternal literacy skills and oral storytelling seemed to afford the mothers the opportunity to use longer MLUs, although indicative of less interaction. However, as expected, the opportunity to expand the talk to explanations or elaborations was not accessible to the children. Mauricio’s Spanish limitations seemed to have elicited negotiation of meaning by resorting to code-switching. Octavio also had the opportunity to hear very sophisticated stories; however, he did not interact much with his mother, although his Spanish vocabulary was high.</p>
<p>Word type and MLU on their own do not seem to consistently indicate better communication; even when quality language use was present, interactive factors were important. The mother-to-child ratios across these contrasting activities, in conjunction with the discourse analysis, show the different role these linguistic measures play in the success of linguistic scaffolding in bilingual interactions. Communication, through interactive turns during the BK and successful scaffolding of the HW, was clearly contingent upon SL.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="sec15-1468798411425666" sec-type="discussion|conclusion"><title>Discussion and conclusion</title>
<p>As predicted in hypotheses 1a, 1b and 3, the child attending a bilingual preschool programme and in the SL condition, Tomás, had the best vocabulary outcome in both languages. He also had the highest literacy skills in Spanish and the second highest in English. This facilitation could not be attributed to alternative explanations. His scores in memory for sentences were lower than Mauricio’s, his mother did not have the highest education or vocabulary skills, and neither did his family have the highest income. By default, hypothesis 1b was also supported here because the worst literacy outcome was attained by Claudia, who was attending an English preschool programme and whose mother had the lowest levels of language and literacy skills. Hypotheses 2 and 3 were most clearly supported by Mauricio’s case. Literacy support at his home, even if in English, facilitated Mauricio’s English literacy skills and BK activity as observed in the discourse analysis and his English literacy scores. This association, however, was limited to his literacy scores, not his vocabulary, even in English. There was no cross-linguistic effect, as Mauricio’s vocabulary scores in both languages and his literacy scores in Spanish were lower than Tomás’s.</p>
<p>Support for the three hypotheses was found: SL and continuous language between home and school supports mother–child communication and relates to children’s language and literacy scores. Quality of mother–child communication, as observed in the discourse analysis, can facilitate learning as it relates to the mother’s role in helping her child with early literacy skills. Home/school continuity facilitates home-literacy support, but only in conditions that foster mother–child communication through mother–child SL. Home literacy support facilitates the children’s language and literacy skills, not only in the home language but in their second language as well.</p>
<p>Although results based on four cases have limited implications for the larger population, triangulation of data provides some validation to these patterns of association. Focusing on mother–child interaction illuminated the concrete role of otherwise abstract variables, identifying directions for future research. Studies that focus on absolute measures of individual bilingualism limit our view of the implications of living in such linguistically complex conditions. The child’s language skills need to be considered in relation to the home and the school language. We need to study further the role of mother–child language differences in the quality of mother–child communication and its impact on the child’s learning. A longitudinal study of mother–child communication will help determine the lasting effects of home language resources on the child’s language and literacy development, and whether its role changes as children get more exposure to school and face more challenging schoolwork. Studying different educational programmes (i.e. bilingual, dual language) will enrich our understanding of the role of home/school language continuity.</p>
<p>In planning for the education of ELLs, our results indicate that a shift is required. Instead of focusing at the individual level and pressuring for the early assimilation to English, we recommend a social approach emphasizing the importance of mother–child communication in learning. The linguistic demands in scaffolding literacy tasks indicate that assimilation may not only be ineffective in helping ELLs close the achievement gap, but may actually be contributing to widening that gap, by contributing to early literacy difficulties. Not only was it more difficult to overcome linguistic differences during the HW task, but the role of the parents was diminished by their trying to help their children with a task that was inachievable because of its literacy demands and cognitive difficulty. Considering that this type of experience occurs regularly for immigrant parents and across many situations, it is frightening to imagine the effect that these repeated humiliating experiences over long periods of time could have on their parental role.</p>
<p>Although the present political approach is to push parents to learn English sooner, this may not offer a solution to the language development needs of ELLs either. Having access to the societal language (English) and English literacy support at home, as in Mauricio’s case, seemed to compensate only on the English word-level literacy test and with the least demanding task, the BK. This was not sufficient for the development of his vocabulary skills, which is likely to have a greater impact on more complex literacy skills later (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1468798411425666">Snow, 1991</xref>). Another important finding for language planning is the indication that quality of language interactions in Spanish facilitates English language and literacy skills, as demonstrated by Tomás’s case. Maternal literacy skills, although important, seem to be second to the maternal support afforded by bilingual education and mother–child SL, as shown in the contrast between Tomás’s and Mauricio’s cases. Focusing on creating language conditions that foster maternal scaffolding of learning might be a better approach for the educational needs of this population that cannot afford to face any more challenges.</p>
