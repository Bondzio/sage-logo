<body>
<p>I am honored and delighted to accept this award from the Society for Research in Music Education (SRME) and NAfME, an organization of which I’ve been a member for about forty years. My earliest days of teaching were influenced by current topics in the <italic>Music Educators Journal</italic>—aesthetic education, multicultural music, technology, special learners—still familiar content in 2012. I recall my first national convention in Chicago, 1978, that opened my eyes to the possibility of research in music education. Then came the years of schlepping thirty- by forty-inch poster boards all over the country to share my own research findings and, ultimately, the opportunity to serve the organization in several leadership capacities. The National Association and the SRME have played a steadfast and multifaceted role throughout my professional life.</p>
<p>Today I extend my sincere appreciation to the national executive board, the executive committee of the SRME (otherwise known as “MERC”), and those who nominated me for the senior researcher award. I am eternally grateful to my role models and mentors, who guided my musicianship, pedagogy, and intellectual development with loving care. I am thankful for the time and confidence invested in me by Terry Kuhn, who took me under wing when I was a young master’s student at Kent State University, and Clifford Madsen, who challenged and supported me every step of the way through the doctoral program at Florida State University and beyond. How fortunate indeed to have the friendship of these good men. It takes a community to raise a researcher, and my extended community includes professional colleagues and a few critics; faculty, staff, and administration at The Ohio State University; and the many students I’ve had the privilege of teaching over the years. I am ever grateful for our mutual interest in learning.</p>
<p>When I first learned that I would receive this award and have the privilege of speaking to the SRME here in St. Louis, I began a journey of reflection about what I might say to a community of teachers, researchers, and scholars whom I so greatly admire. We come together today as a research community—a collection of senior stateswomen and men in our field who early on championed systematic inquiry as a means of increasing knowledge that could be useful in understanding how people learn, create, perform, and think about music; another generation, now at the height of their careers, who had the advantage of building on a foundation already in place when they arrived on the scene, ultimately redefining the questions, rearranging the furniture, and adding more seats at the table; and those who are starting out in an age when research is at the forefront of public discourse and media, nipping at our heels, eager to contribute, and looking for a way in. Communities grow and change, and ours has done both as attested to quantitatively by the sheer increase in volume of research, number of papers and posters, special research interest groups, symposia, journals, books, and online resources. We have also grown and changed qualitatively with increased methodological finesse, established lines of research that are examined from diverse points of view, a broader social purview, increased interdisciplinarity, and a body of research sufficiently well developed to inform practice at least some of the time. This research community is our common ground, but it is not really what brought us here. We are here because of the joy of music and the sense of discovery that have fueled us since childhood.</p>
<p>Everybody likes music, or to be more precise, nearly everybody likes some music. Children engage deeply with music through listening, dancing, singing, and exploring. They respond socially and aesthetically, with music as a core component of identity and a source of meaning in their lives. If anything, this intensifies through adolescence and adulthood. Moving into older adulthood, music provides meaning for many people through active listening, performing, or study. We needn’t choose whether music’s chief contribution to human well-being is aesthetic, cognitive, cultural, emotional, physical, social, or spiritual. It is all of that and probably more. Perhaps the power of music stems from the fact that it affects us in so many ways all at the same time, a truly significant interaction unrestrained by our constructed categories, useful as they might be in forming research questions. Even though we worry that attendance at some cultural events seems to be declining, music-related sales represent over a $100 billion annual business in America, with between $500 and $600 million in school instruments (about .55% of the big picture).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0022429412453570">1</xref></sup> School music represents a well-muscled arm of the educative enterprise, but it’s not the only show in town. The reach of music education extends throughout the entire life span, in and out of school, and it is contextualized by the mammoth entertainment and recording industry, global communication, and mind-boggling advances in technology. We also reside within the purview of education at large, with all its social, legal, fiscal, and political concerns. <italic>Where does a hearty band of music education researchers fit into these worlds?</italic></p>
<p>A number of years ago, I was invited to be the guest speaker at the Ohio Music Education Association Graduate Research Forum, which is attended by graduate students and faculty from around the state just prior to the annual convention. In planning the talk, I asked a group of doctoral students what they would most want to hear. After some deliberation, they came up with the title “Becoming a Researcher: Making Your Contribution to the Literature.” Of course they wanted to develop their interests, and they wanted advice on research and publication, but mostly, they wanted their efforts to be meaningful. They wanted to talk about what knowledge and skills researchers possess that would enable them to make a unique contribution. I’ll expand that question to include the following topics:</p>
<list id="list1-0022429412453570" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>The popularization and politicization of research</p></list-item>

<sec id="section1-0022429412453570">
<title>The Popularization and Politicization of Research</title>
<p>When young children want to underscore a point, they might use the compelling words <italic>really</italic> or <italic>need</italic>: I <italic>really</italic> want to play the drum. Or, I <italic>need</italic> that cookie. Adults also appeal to urgency in expressing their point of view but often shore it up with reasons why, including, through the ages, appeals to tradition, religion, law, or logic. And while these sources of authority remain firmly planted today, appeal to research has become the relatively new kid on the block. To strengthen an assertion, one might preface it with “Research shows that . . .” Suddenly, it is taken more seriously, pro or con, depending on whether the point is agreeable or not. Not everyone asks about the source of the research, whether it was carried out, thoughtfully and if it is consistent with existing theories and data. The phrase “Research shows that . . .” simply conveys a sense of authority.</p>
<p>There is a public appetite for research headlines and stories that have become abundant via newspapers, newsletters, television, radio, the Internet, blogs, Facebook, tweets, retweets, and memes. Universities, medical centers, and government agencies publicize their findings regularly. We can hardly keep up. “Does chocolate decrease body mass index?” (That’s the latest headline.) “Is it safe, after all, for young pitchers to throw curve balls without risk of injury?” (Still controversial, but there is evidence.) “Does playing Words With Friends delay the possible onset of dementia?” (I have no idea, but I hope so.) Building on popular interest, I structured assignments in my introductory research class around two television programs, <italic>Mythbusters</italic> and <italic>Antiques Roadshow</italic>. (This year we also had occasion to add <italic>If Walls Could Talk.</italic>) <italic>Mythbusters</italic> is a quantitative, qualitative, or mixed-methodology project that challenges assumptions we make in music education. <italic>Antiques Roadshow</italic> is the evolution of a historical artifact assignment that I borrowed from Cornelia Yarbrough years ago.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0022429412453570">2</xref></sup> These assignments capture the imagination of novice researchers and allow the question to lead the methodology, not the other way around. They satisfy the sense of wonder, discovery, curiosity, and “need to know” that have been extolled by every MENC/NAfME senior researcher since the inception of the award.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0022429412453570">3</xref></sup> These projects initiate the transition that moves from (a) interest to (b) discussions about knowing to (c) specific research techniques and eventually to (d) formal writing. Thus begins the process that separates a researcher from someone who holds general interest. It makes clear that a collection of headlines does not comprise systematic inquiry even though it may evoke some interesting questions. For many students, it is the crystallization of the “research attitude” described by Clifford Madsen in his classic text <italic>Experimental Research in Music</italic> and highlighted by Rudy Radocy and Judith Jellison in their Senior Researcher Award addresses.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0022429412453570">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>Bolstering argument with research increases its credibility, engaging in research appeals to our curiosity and sense of discovery, and defining questions reveals the variables and tools that must be understood to keep going. When I undertook my first formal research project with Terry Kuhn some thirty-five years ago, I never dreamed that research sound bites would have so much appeal to the general public, perhaps belying youthful naïveté.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0022429412453570">5</xref></sup> Today we view popular interest in research as a win, but with serious caveats about truthiness, the politicization of decontextualized facts, spurious conclusions based on journalistic headlines, or outright propaganda.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0022429412453570">6</xref></sup> The research enterprise depends on intellectual honesty, and the public we serve deserves no less.</p>

<sec id="section2-0022429412453570">
<title>Critical Thinking and Doing</title>
<p>A main point I want to make today is how the process of conducting research over many years does more than answer questions or build theories. There is value added for the person doing the research, especially hands-on research that is characterized by interaction, observation, problem solving, analytical decisions, and concerns about dissemination. Research outcomes have the best potential to make a contribution to knowledge, but the incidental learning gathered along the way may enrich and redirect the way a researcher extends her work over many years. Sometimes it is just the little things, like learning to use equipment. I mention this because it gives me the opportunity to tell one of my favorite stories about Eugenia Costa-Giomi, current chair of the SRME Executive Committee (MERC), who was a bright and ambitious doctoral student at Ohio State University a couple of decades ago. We were working on a research project with preschool children at the time, recording them individually as they responded to a listening task. Our technology included a Tascam four-track cassette tape recorder left over from a previous project. A few of you might remember that machine as a home recording system that used traditional cassette tapes but allowed overdubbing of four separate tracks. You could use only one side of the tape; recording on side 2 would erase everything. Eugenia worked diligently on this project, and after several days of individual data collection, we had a full cassette. Then, yes, she turned it over and continued to record, but that’s not the point of the story. When we discovered the tragedy of the erasure—days lost and preschoolers who could not be retested—Eugenia’s response convinced me that she had a real future in research. She squared her shoulders and said never mind, that we would find more participants and she would handle all the recording. She concluded by saying, “I love research so much I could do it <italic>again</italic> and <italic>again.</italic>”</p>
<p>Doing research again and again is the goal. Results accumulate and so does experience. Seasoned researchers know that no matter how challenging research methods classes might seem to graduate students, they’re nothing compared to conducting a study in the real world. There are few studies that look exactly like the model in a textbook, just like there are few musical compositions that follow precisely a model from a Form and Analysis text. Exercises maybe, but not the real thing. Myriad decisions need to be made, requiring advanced knowledge, critical thinking, creativity, and good judgment. Research concepts must be developed in addition to mechanics, concept formation being powerfully enhanced by the direct experience of doing research <italic>again</italic> and <italic>again</italic>. It’s a spiral curriculum that years later results in the reflection, “I wish I knew then what I know now,” but of course that would have been impossible. There are at least several very good outcomes from the skills and insights one picks up through the ongoing process of doing research: (a) there are the findings of the individual studies or, better yet, a line of related studies that have theoretical or practical value; (b) there is the experience that allows meaningful mentorship of a new generation of researchers; and (c) there is the eventual realization that you no longer view the world in the same way, having attempted to work through problems of how we know, what we know, integrity of data (whatever form it takes), application, transfer of knowledge, and more. I find it interesting that those who have engaged in doing research <italic>again</italic> and <italic>again</italic> are often humble in their knowledge and generous in mentoring others.</p>

<sec id="section3-0022429412453570">
<title>Speaking with Authority<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0022429412453570">7</xref></sup></title>
<p>I’m always impressed to see a master of some discipline find value in the earnest work of another person in their field. It takes expertise, insight, and compassion to use one’s critical capacities in someone else’s interest. I think of the world-famous dressage rider who witnessed a humiliating fall by a young girl in front of hundreds of people. His response after she got up was, “Come, sit by me.” He spent the afternoon directing her attention to acts of equestrian skill and beauty that would escape all but the most experienced eye. Thoughtful engagement in any endeavor over a long period of time yields depth of understanding and a unique view, the ability to criticize in the sense of analysis or evaluation, not to tear down through negative commentary. The process of doing research <italic>again</italic> and <italic>again</italic> ultimately yields a responsibility to synthesize a lot of information, attest to its quality, contextualize it, and use it to elevate the conversation toward public good. That’s a high expectation for a series of music education studies but perhaps not so much when you include the focused and incidental learning that accumulate over time.</p>
<p>Then again, there are the occasions when critical thinking born of research practice requires us to speak up when things could be better. The American system of free, universal, public education is sometimes called a noble experiment, and even with its weaknesses, our national commitment to this ideal has provided opportunity for many, but not all, citizens for some two hundred years.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0022429412453570">8</xref></sup> However, there are aspects of the educational experiment that are seriously flawed from a research perspective. For example, I suspect that the current emphasis on hard-line, high-stakes testing of students and the use of test outcomes for teacher evaluation wouldn’t cut muster with any institutional review board. Specifically, the testing instruments have questionable reliability and validity and are not being used for the purpose for which they were intended; they are being administered to students under adverse conditions; there is no assent, consent, or provision to leave the study without penalty; there are known risk factors for participation and questionable benefit to society; the data are not anonymous or confidential, and they are not destroyed after five years. There are problems in design with unequal groups, missing values, significantly correlated variables that are unaccounted for, and statistical corrections to make amends for known limitations of the study, not to mention the possible effects of “unknown unknowns.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0022429412453570">9</xref></sup> This is not research as we know it (nor as it is intended to be), but it highlights the difference between research and politics. We can find many more examples. For those who are so inclined, there are ways for a research community to take action: one is to set a research agenda that has direct implications for teaching music in the schools and <italic>keeping</italic> music in the schools for all students. Many researchers here today have expertise in music teacher evaluation, and some are already working within their states to design assessment systems that will satisfy mandates of “Race to the Top.” Not all research has practical or political implications, nor should it, but the critical faculties developed through engagement in high-quality research provide a good basis from which to speak. Finally, we have an opportunity and responsibility to teach our undergraduate and graduate students not just the rules for survival in public schools and academe but, more importantly, to read research beyond the bylines, to understand that well-formed opinions are based on knowledge, to withhold judgment until there is sufficient evidence, and to act in principled ways, reflecting well-considered knowledge and values. Is this research? Not exactly, but it is using those value-added skills that come from a research attitude.</p>
<p>One of my favorite movie scenes is from the film <italic>Gettysburg</italic> that was released in 1993.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0022429412453570">10</xref></sup> Colonel Chamberlain, a Bowdoin College professor of rhetoric turned soldier (and played magnificently by Jeff Daniels), is holding the left flank at Little Round Top. He comes to understand the gravity of the situation from Colonel Vincent, who ends his grim exhortation with the line, “Now we’ll see how professors fight.” I love that line. It’s not that I like fighting—like Colonel Chamberlain, I have more pacifistic tendencies—but I admire that moment of courage when these men led by a liberal college professor stood up and faced what had to be done, ultimately fixing bayonets, charging down the hill, and winning the battle. I sincerely hope our bayonets are metaphorical but that we have the courage to act when we see a need and an opportunity. Out of curiosity, I googled <italic>professors fight</italic> to see what it is we fight about. There were nearly 18 million hits in a fraction of a second. Here are some of the top contenders: copyright for sheet music, a piece of the pie, fracking impact, mild tuition hike, ousting of administrators, fair use, cheating, a bad book review, drug-resistant bacteria, to get fit, gerrymandering, prejudice, proposed Internet laws, HIV, and creationists. And, apparently, we have <italic>stopped</italic> fighting social media. While I like the ennobling image of professors standing up to fight, I have no illusion that music education is fighting a war. In fact, there is plenty of evidence that people <italic>like</italic> us. Even NAMM (the National Association of Music Merchants) concludes “that school music programs remain strongly popular with students and parents alike and, short of complete financial meltdown, are likely to continue.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0022429412453570">11</xref></sup> Research by Carlos Abril and Brent Gault, Marci Major, Jon Meeker, and others has shown that we do not necessarily exist in a hostile environment, although policy and budget issues can take a toll.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0022429412453570">12</xref></sup> Sometimes people just don’t know what to do with us, or understand what we can do for them. That sounds like a call to research, followed by communication with the right people at the right time. It is also a call to synthesize what we represent with what we know and to tell our own story.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0022429412453570">
<title>Using Knowledge</title>
<p>We are surrounded by data and overloaded with information, yet it is not always possible to find a clear answer to a particular question. It reminds me of the button that reads, “Data, data everywhere and not a thought to think.” There are probably hundreds of articles and blogs written about the so-called DIKW hierarchy (data, information, knowledge, wisdom), usually found in business and information science sources. In addition, if you google <italic>DIKW</italic>, it won’t be long before you find a relevant poem by T. S. Eliot and lyrics by Frank Zappa.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0022429412453570">13</xref></sup> I’m not convinced that the data-through-wisdom hierarchy works very well as a model for research in music education, or even that it is a hierarchy, but it opens the door to discussion about what we choose to study; how we choose look at it, that is, what comprises appropriate empirical data; and, ultimately, how we frame and apply the findings. Data alone are not enough. Neither are conclusions devoid of any evidence. In my opinion, the most interesting studies are those that create a new way of looking at something by the way data are gathered and then go on to describe or explain it in the context of related research, theory, or practice. I especially like reading research when I can make a transfer to my own professional or personal interests. The ability to transfer knowledge is a skill championed by Clifford Madsen as a key point in his inaugural Senior Researcher Award address, suggesting a shared responsibility between reader and writer in applying knowledge to particular questions.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0022429412453570">14</xref></sup> This is especially true in reading outside the discipline—it’s the connections, the transfers, that provide the most exciting “aha” moments.</p>
<p>The uses of research-based knowledge in music education range from large projects with strong potential for generalization to works of local or immediate value. The SRME recently has undertaken an ambitious project in bringing together a collection of topical research summaries synthesizing a lot of studies that have the potential to influence new directions for music curriculum and instruction. Another big-picture methodology, that of corpus studies and data mining, has gained popularity in music cognition by using large, preexisting data sets to ferret out trends, relationships, and effects. Large-scale research syntheses, meta-analyses, longitudinal studies, and perhaps corpus studies have great potential to turn data into information that can shape practice but only with the lively spark of a researcher who has a hunch about where to find the goods, that is, what questions to ask. Otherwise, facts—lovely as they are—lie dormant.</p>
<p>But we can’t always wait for a large-scale report or analysis, and there is plenty to learn from the research attitude that spurs action studies, pilot studies, and ongoing series of smaller-scale works that are folded into the big picture over time. In fact, without these foundations, there would be little to build on. Productive researchers are always working on something, often smaller parts that contribute to a larger agenda. The famous rocket scientist Werner von Braun is said to have remarked, “Research is what I’m doing when I don’t know what I’m doing.” I have no idea of the context in which he might have made that statement, but to me, it suggests the ongoing inquiry and problem solving that lead to the culmination of a life’s work, the incorporation of data into a broader knowledge.</p>
<p>I want to add some words of praise for the action research carried out by those music teachers whose daily observations and analyses function to include more students, to understand them better, to engage them more meaningfully, to improve instruction, and basically to challenge themselves and others to keep moving forward. Several years ago, I spent a sabbatical teaching music in an urban elementary school and had a firsthand opportunity to use my academically oriented research attitude while meeting the demands of being an elementary vocal–general music teacher.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0022429412453570">15</xref></sup> First, let me say that although there were challenges, this experience provided valuable insights that went beyond those that could have been gleaned from a short-term residency as a guest artist. The stakes for responsibility and accountability were higher, as was my commitment to the students I taught. I loved the opportunity to observe children’s responses to the myriad tasks I presented them, both the processes through which they engaged and the students’ musical products. It was a researcher’s playground even though it was not, in and of itself, research. However, a series of action research projects gave structure to my lesson planning, allowed me to corroborate more formal studies and personal hunches, and forced a little more teacher creativity than was required by following the district curriculum. Teaching undergraduate and graduate students to engage their inquiring minds through action research has benefits for the improvement of instruction and perhaps even longevity of teachers in the field. Formal or informal collaborations between university faculty and music teachers seem to fall somewhere between action research and outreach, but either way, there is the potential for discovery, improved instruction, and a magnificent source of research ideas for more rigorous investigation.</p>
<p>I was reminded of one more incident from my sabbatical experience that falls under the heading of “Using Knowledge.” One day, I was teaching a lesson about the voice to a class of fourth graders who demanded to know if I could sing high and low like Mariah Carey. The answer is no, but it was clearly a challenge in my first month at that school. So I improvised some highs and lows on scatlike syllables and was relieved when their eyes got big and a cool girl said, “Whoa.” Reinforced by their approval, I proceeded to talk about vocal range in infants (their baby sisters and brothers), how preschoolers can nearly always follow melodic contour with their voices (with playful examples), what it means to match a pitch and sing in a key . . . and then I realized that I’d slipped into professor mode and was repeating a lecture-demonstration I’d given many times to college students.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0022429412453570">16</xref></sup> Rather than revolt, I got respect. One student eyed me suspiciously and asked, “How do you know that?” I smiled back. “I do research.” I don’t remember exactly what happened next, but henceforth that particular class was willing to work with me. I think what hooked them was, first, that I wasn’t actually faking it—that I knew and could do interesting things—but also that the vocal development lesson went far beyond the music book and explained a lot about baby sounds, playground sounds, kids who sing in different registers, and why first graders sound different from fifth graders at their school. Perhaps this is reminiscent of what Bob Duke had to say in his senior researcher address two years ago: that research is interesting through its power of explanation.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0022429412453570">17</xref></sup> For a teacher who makes connections (transfers), no knowledge ever goes to waste. Just as it takes the spark of a researcher to perform the alchemy of transforming data into knowledge, a good teacher can ignite children’s sense of discovery by bringing inquiry to the classroom and showing its relevance to their interests.</p>
<p>Stories from the music class bring us back to the principal themes and questions posed earlier:</p>
<list id="list2-0022429412453570" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p><bold>We are here</bold> because of our love of music and joy of discovery that began in childhood.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><bold>We are here</bold> because somewhere along the way, perhaps during graduate school, we wanted to make a unique contribution to the literature, that is, a research contribution of value to music education at large.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><bold>We are here</bold> today as a research <italic>community</italic> with common goals and different perspectives; situated within social, political, and economic realities; seeking to research and serve according to our own interests and abilities; in a manner we believe will make a difference in present and future music education for all students.</p></list-item></list>
<p>Music education is a grounded, interdisciplinary field of study that by nature and necessity combines teaching, research, and service in a unique blend of scholarship. Compared to some academic disciplines, our sources of funding are limited, and we place a high priority on teaching in addition to research and outreach activities. We have a history of high-quality research and a professional organization, the SRME, that supports our enterprise through conferences, publications, and professional alliances. Most of us are intrinsically motivated to conduct research well beyond tenure and promotion requirements, expending precious personal time and resources as productive researchers and active members of the society.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0022429412453570">18</xref></sup> Even more than this wonderful award, which is indeed a great honor, I am grateful to have been a member of the SRME community over so many years and remain deeply appreciative of the opportunity to speak with you this morning. Thank you.</p>

<p>“Reports that say that something hasn’t happened are always interesting to me, because as we know, there are known knowns; there are things we know we know. We also know there are known unknowns; that is to say we know there are some things we do not know. But there are also unknown unknowns—the ones we don’t know we don’t know. And if one looks throughout the history of our country and other free countries, it is the latter category that tend to be the difficult ones.” Donald Rumsfeld, former U.S. Secretary of Defense, 1975–77 and 2001–06, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.defense.gov/Transcripts/Transcript.aspx?TranscriptID=2636">http://www.defense.gov/Transcripts/Transcript.aspx?TranscriptID=2636</ext-link>.</p>
