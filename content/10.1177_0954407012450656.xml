<p>In order to meet the ever-more stringent emission standards, significant efforts have been devoted to the research and development of cleaner internal combustion engines. Diesel combustion and the formation of pollutants are directly influenced by the spatial and temporal distribution of the fuel injected. This study investigated the effects of dwell angle of split injection on diesel combustion and emissions in a high-speed common rail direct injection optical diesel engine. The fuel injection system was characterized through the measurement of the fuel injection rate and quantity for the tested strategies on a fuel injection test rig. In particular, the interaction between the two injection events was identified. Effects of the split injection dwell angle and the interactions of the two consecutive injection events on diesel combustion and exhaust emissions were then investigated in the single cylinder optical engine using heat release analysis and optical diagnostic techniques. The fuel injection process was illuminated by a high repetition copper vapour laser and recorded synchronously by a high speed video camera. The combustion temperature and soot distribution during the combustion process were measured by a recently developed high speed two-colour system. The results indicated that this injection mode has the potential to improve fuel economy and engine performance while substantially reducing the combustion noise, provided that the injection timings are appropriately selected.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Although diesel engines are extremely robust and reliable, capable of producing outstanding torque at low speeds, inherently high levels of regulated and unregulated emissions and combustion noise associated with conventional diesel engines have been the foremost reasons for relatively low market share until the late 1990s. However, recent developments in diesel engine technology and higher fuel prices, as well as incentivizing tax regimes based on CO<sub>2</sub> emission levels, have led to a substantial shift in the automotive market, with diesel engines claiming approximately 50% of the European car market.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0954407012450656">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>Concern over emission of exhaust pollutants has led, since the 1960s, to the introduction of emissions legislation. In order to meet the ever-more stringent emission standards, significant efforts have been devoted to the research and development of cleaner internal combustion (IC) engines. Diesel combustion and the formation of pollutants are directly influenced by the spatial and temporal distribution of the fuel injected. Consequently, numerous research studies have been conducted aimed at more detailed investigation of fuel–air mixing and combustion processes, as well as chemical/physical reactions involved in the production of pollutants, in particular nitrogen oxides (NO<sub><italic>x</italic></sub>) and particulate matter (PM), the two most perilous emissions produced by diesel engines.</p>
<p>The introduction of the common rail (CR) fuel injection system in the 1990s allowed greater flexibility and control of the fuel injection rate, quantity and timing over the entire operating range of diesel engines. The rate of fuel injection and its effect on combustion noise, emissions and performance has been extensively investigated since the early days of diesel engines. Nehmer and Reitz<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0954407012450656">2</xref></sup> studied the effect of several injection rate profiles. Their results indicated that the combustion with injectors having slower rate profiles allowed the combustion to continue later in the expansion cycle. Although this resulted in the reduction of soot emissions through improved oxidation process, increase in fuel consumption was reported.</p>
<p>Zambare and Winterbone<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0954407012450656">3</xref></sup> used an optical engine to investigate the effect of injection rate profile of conventional and two-stage fuel injection equipments (FIE). The results showed that NO<sub><italic>x</italic></sub> emission was reduced with the latter injection system in comparison with a conventional injection system, though soot emission was higher, particularly at low loads. Koyanagi et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0954407012450656">4</xref></sup> also used an optical engine equipped with a common rail fuel injection system. They compared the effect of fuel injection rate using a conventional solenoid injector and a piezoelectric injector. The results indicated improvements in fuel and air mixing and soot emission due to higher fuel spray momentum caused by faster opening of piezoelectric injectors with a squarer injection rate profile. The fuel economy was also improved due to better fuel atomization and mixing, though penalties in terms of combustion noise and NO<sub><italic>x</italic></sub> emission were incurred.</p>
<p>Tanabe et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0954407012450656">5</xref></sup> developed a novel two-rail system comprising of both low and high pressure rails feeding a single injector. The experiments were conducted on a heavy duty diesel engine, and the fuel injection rate was controlled by switching between the rails during injection. Their results showed that fuel injection rate shaping resulted in simultaneous reduction of NO<sub><italic>x</italic></sub> and soot emissions, particularly at mid speed and high loads, where control over combustion led to a more constant-pressure combustion process, similar to an ideal diesel cycle. Although alternative combustion strategies are also capable of simultaneous reduction of NO<sub><italic>x</italic></sub> and soot emissions, fuel injection rate shaping allows simultaneous reduction of the aforementioned pollutants with no penalty in terms of fuel economy.</p>
<p>The fuel injection pressure in CR fuel injection system is independent of the engine speed; thus, it is capable of promoting improved fuel evaporation and mixture formation at low speeds and loads. The implementation of such a versatile and flexible fuel injection system led to the development of alternative combustion modes, including low temperature combustion (LTC),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0954407012450656">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0954407012450656"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0954407012450656"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0954407012450656"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0954407012450656"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0954407012450656"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0954407012450656">12</xref></sup> homogeneous charge compression ignition (HCCI)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0954407012450656">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0954407012450656">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0954407012450656"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0954407012450656"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0954407012450656">15</xref></sup> and premixed charged compression ignition (PCCI),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0954407012450656">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0954407012450656"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0954407012450656"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0954407012450656"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0954407012450656">20</xref></sup> through the application of sophisticated fuel injection strategies. The results revealed the potential for simultaneous reduction of NO<sub><italic>x</italic></sub> and PM emissions through the application of such combustion modes. The initial investigations on using alternative injection strategies were primarily focused on the application of pilot and main injections or split injections with equal fuel demand per injection (50%/50%).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0954407012450656">2</xref></sup> The results demonstrated that shorter ignition delay was achieved due to pilot injection, indicating less premixed combustion, lowering the peak heat release rate. Therefore, NO<sub><italic>x</italic></sub> emission as well as combustion noise was considerably reduced in comparison to conventional diesel combustion. In addition, the effect of post injection on further reduction of soot emission was examined by Han et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0954407012450656">21</xref></sup> and Farrell et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0954407012450656">22</xref></sup> Their results showed that soot emission was reduced due to improved soot oxidation, which was attributed to a higher combustion temperature during the mixing controlled combustion phase caused by the combustion of fuel injected during post injection. In order to better understand the mixing process, Zhang et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0954407012450656">23</xref></sup> carried out a series of investigations involving detailed analysis of the fuel and air mixing process in a constant volume vessel through the application of laser absorption scattering (LAS). They investigated the mixing process using conventional single injection and compared their results with those obtained through split injection strategies – 75%/25%, 50%/50% and 25%/75%. It was reported that the 75%/25% split injection strategy resulted in maximum soot reduction for the tested engine operating conditions. This was mainly attributed to improved mixing due to increased in-cylinder turbulence caused by the combustion of fuel injected during the second injection.</p>
<p>More recently, injection strategies have been investigated with up to eight injections due to the improved capability of modern fuel injection systems.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0954407012450656">7</xref></sup> Gill and Zhao<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0954407012450656">24</xref></sup> investigated the effect of multiple injection strategy on diesel combustion and emission characteristics using commercially available diesel fuel and biofuels. HCCI combustion was achieved through the use of multiple injection strategies which resulted in the reduction of exhaust emissions. These results were further confirmed through the application of optical diagnostic techniques, such as two-colour, chemiluminescence imaging and high speed video imaging. Nevertheless, diesel combustion and the associated mechanisms of pollutant formation are yet to be fully explored and require further investigation in order to meet future emissions legislations. Thus, conventional methods of engine measurement are no longer sufficient for further devel- opment of diesel engines. Instead, non-intrusive optical diagnostic techniques have been devised for in-depth analysis of fuel and air mixing process.</p>
<p>The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of dwell angle on the combustion performance and emissions through the application of 70%/30% split injection strategy in a single cylinder direct injection high-speed optical diesel engine by means of both conventional heat release analysis and advanced optical diagnostic techniques. During the course of the investigation, it was discovered that there were significant interactions between the two consecutive fuel injection events in the solenoid CR fuel injector. A fuel injection characterization rig and fuel bulk modulus measurement device were commissioned and applied to quantify the interaction of two closely coupled fuel injections. Therefore, in the first part of the paper, the principle and application of a fuel injection rate measurement technique are presented. Then the experimental set-up and in-cylinder measurement techniques are described. The effects of the split injection dwell angle and the interactions of the two consecutive injection events on the combustion process and pollutant formation are then presented and discussed.</p>

Consequently, the pressure inside the chamber increases, this augmentation being proportional to the quantity of fuel injected.

<p>In the case of a single injection, fuel quantity and injection duration as a function of injection pulse width could be measured through the application of this technique. In addition, interference between injections could also be identified for split or multiple injections, whereby substantial variations in the quantity and rate of fuel injection could be experienced.</p>
<p>However, the bulk modulus of a fluid changes with pressure, so accurate measurement of fuel injection rate requires evaluation of bulk modulus as a function of the CVC pressure. The bulk modulus of commercially available diesel fuel was experimentally evaluated using a test rig designed and manufactured at Brunel University, which allowed bulk modulus measurements up to 600 bar. The bulk modulus of commercially available diesel fuel as a function of pressure is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0954407012450656">Figure 1</xref>. The measurement at a given pressure reading was repeated twenty times ensuring the repeatability of the results.</p>

<title>Experimental set-up of the fuel injection rate measurement rig</title>
<p>A CVC, of approximately 50 cm<sup>3</sup>, equipped with three pressure sensors was employed in this study. The first sensor, Kistler 4043A50 piezo-resistive absolute pressure transducer, measured the pressure inside the chamber prior to fuel injection (i.e. back pressure) while the second and the third sensors, Kistler 701A piezoelectric pressure transducers with high and low sensitivities, were installed for the measurement of small and large fuel quantities (i.e. pilot and main injections), respectively. The piezoelectric pressure transducers were adopted in this set-up since their accuracy is often not affected by the size or the volume of the quartz, but the geometry and material used, enabling acquisition of accurate data even at absolute pressures ten times higher than their measuring dynamic full scale range.</p>
<p>A combination of a pressure relief valve and a solenoid actuator were located on top of the CVC. A schematic diagram of the experimental set-up employed in this study is depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0954407012450656">Figure 2</xref>. A high pressure direct acting coaxial solenoid valve was positioned directly on top of the CVC. A Swagelok R series proportional relief valve was utilized in order to regulate the back pressure. In addition, a high precision positive displacement fuel flow meter, ONO SOKKI FP-200 series, was mounted after the pressure relief valve, measuring the quantity of the fuel injected. The fuel quantities calculated based on the application of Zeuch’s method were further validated by the fuel quantities measured by the flow meter. The fuel injector was positioned horizontally opposite the pressure sensors such that the pressure rise inside the CVC could be accurately measured.</p>

<p>In this study, a Kistler 6125 piezoelectric pressure transducer was installed in place of the glow plug for in-cylinder pressure measurement and heat release analysis. Optical access was provided by the Bowditch piston design which allowed for the visualization of the combustion chamber through the axis of the cylinder via a glass window, made from fused silica, mounted in the crown of the piston. An extended piston and cylinder block were required in order to accommodate such an optical configuration which consisted of lower and upper parts with a 45° angled mirror, made of glass with aluminized front surface, between the sections. Therefore, the combustion chamber and cylinder walls can be fully visualized through such an optical arrangement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0954407012450656">Figure 3</xref>).</p>

<p>In order to visualize the fuel sprays, a high repetition copper vapour laser was utilized. The output of the laser was delivered to the engine via an optical fibre so that the whole combustion chamber could be illuminated by the divergent laser beam leaving the optical fibre. The short laser pulse of 30 ns effectively defined the exposure time of the spray image, which was critical to obtain sharp images of sprays travelling at very high speed. A NAC Memrecam FX6000 high speed colour video camera was used which was equipped with a high speed metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) sensor. The high speed camera was set to capture videos at 10 000 frames/s with an image resolution of 512 × 248 pixels. A Nikon 50 mm f.1.4 lens was used. A light-emitting diode installed in the field of view of the camera provided the reference signal at top dead centre (TDC) in the high speed video images.</p>

<p>The two-colour method is a technique capable of estimating the flame temperature and soot concentration within the combustion chamber of diesel engines.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0954407012450656">26</xref></sup> This technique is based on the principle of soot luminosity. Diesel combustion is rather luminous due to the radiation of soot particles at elevated temperatures. Therefore, the flame temperature and soot concentration in terms of KL factor (see below) can be estimated from the radiation emitted during the combustion process. The blackbody radiation is given by Plank’s law</p>

<p>The soot radiation was measured at two different wavelengths from which two apparent temperatures were calculated. Based on the measured apparent temperatures, flame temperature and soot concentration were estimated using the calibration data obtained with a tungsten lamp. Although this technique has been used in numerous studies due to the simple experimental and calibration set-up, there are several sources of uncertainty or errors such as soot deposition on windows, cylinder wall reflections and inadequate sensitivity of the detection system. Therefore, care must be taken when interpreting the results, either qualitatively or quantitatively. These factors may lead to experimental errors of 10%<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0954407012450656">26</xref></sup> or even higher depending on the selected wavelengths for measurement. However, the flame temperature values are less affected.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0954407012450656">26</xref></sup> Furthermore, most previous two-colour systems were only capable of single shot measurements from different engine cycles, thus suffering from cyclic variations. In order to overcome such a difficulty, a high speed two-colour system was developed. The high speed two-colour measurement system consisted of a NAC Memerecam FX6000 high speed camera and a high repetition image intensifier. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0954407012450656">Figure 5</xref> shows the experimental set-up of the high speed two-colour system. The combustion images were recorded using a standard Nikon 60 mm f2.8 lens, in front of which, a custom built optical holder was fabricated to house an image doubler and a set of neutral density and bandpass filters at 550 nm and 750 nm. The neutral density filters were selected such that the intensity of the combustion images was of similar level at the selected wavelengths.</p>

<p>The mechanical and thermal stresses the optical components are exposed to during firing cycles are substantial, thus the operating time of optical engines is extremely limited. As a result, both the coolant and the lubricating oil were heated prior to use to ensure reasonable engine temperature was achieved. Thus, problems associated with the cold start were eliminated. In this study injection pulse widths were set to produce 70%/30% split injection strategy with variable dwell angles under part-load operating conditions at the engine speed of 1500 r/min (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0954407012450656">Table 3</xref>).</p>

<p>In the case of 10, 15 and 20 crank angle degree (CAD) dwell angles, the quantity of fuel injected during the first injection remained almost constant, though the quantity of fuel during the second injection varied depending on the dwell angle used. The result for the F4 strategy indicated that a 5 CAD dwell angle was not sufficient for the injector to fully close prior to the onset of the second injection, thus almost replicating a single injection. This resulted in the total injected fuel quantity of approximately 27 mm<sup>3</sup>, which was substantially higher than the desired quantity of 20 mm<sup>3</sup>. These considerable variations in the total injected fuel quantity were mainly attributed to the design limitations of the injector utilized, as well as the adverse effect of pressure waves in the high pressure fuel line connecting the injector to the common rail, caused by the first injection. The effects of such inconsistency in fuel delivery on the combustion and emission characteristics were investigated.</p>

<p>The in-cylinder pressure and heat release rate data for the single injection strategies are depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0954407012450656">Figure 7</xref>. The peak in-cylinder pressure decreased as the injection timing was retarded. This was mainly attributed to the late initiation of combustion process during the expansion stroke, where the piston was descending after TDC due to retarded fuel injection timing.</p>

</fig>
<p>The heat release rate curves exhibited a drop due to charge cooling effect shortly after the onset of the fuel injection. Subsequently, the rate of heat release rapidly increased due to the premixed combustion. As given in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0954407012450656">Table 5</xref>, the ignition delay period decreased and the percentage of premixed combustion became less as the injection timing was moved towards TDC. The reduction in the amount of heat release from the fast premixed combustion with late injection is compensated for by the faster heat release of combustion in a smaller volume near TDC. As a result, the peak heat release rate remained almost constant for the A1, A2 and A3 strategies. However, this trend was not observed for the A4 strategy. In this case the ignition delay was much longer and more heat release took place due to premixed combustion, resulting in a greater heat release rate. This was mainly due to the initiation of combustion during the expansion stroke when the in-cylinder pressure and temperature were lower. Thus, the peak in-cylinder pressure was lowered as the combustion occurred in a larger cylinder volume.</p>
<p>The in-cylinder pressure and heat release rate data for the split injection strategies are depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0954407012450656">Figure 8</xref>. As shown in this figure, when split injection was employed, the in-cylinder pressure and heat release rate curves exhibited different trends. The peak in-cylinder pressure first increased as the first injection was retarded from 20 to 15 CAD BTDC and then dropped slightly as the dwell angle was reduced to 10 CAD. The corresponding heat release curves showed that the heat release rate increased as the first injection timing was retarded, instead of remaining constant, as with the single injections. The split injection with 5 CAD dwell angle resulted in the highest peak in-cylinder pressure and heat release rate due mainly to the larger amount of fuel injected, as the injector failed to close prior to the onset of the second injection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0954407012450656">Figure 6</xref>). Therefore, the F4 strategy will not be discussed further.</p>

<p>The heat release rate curves exhibited a drop due to charge cooling effect shortly after the onset of the first fuel injection. Subsequently, the rate of heat release rapidly increased due to the premixed combustion. As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0954407012450656">Table 5</xref>, the ignition delay period decreased, due to improved fuel evaporation and mixing effects closer to TDC, as the injection timing was retarded. However, unlike the single injection strategies, the percentage of combustion during the peak heat release period increased with the shorter ignition delay associated with the retarded injection. In order to ascertain the primary causes of such a trend, high speed fuel spray and combustion visualization technique was applied (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0954407012450656">Figure 9</xref>), in which the start of the first injection (SOFI), first visible combustion (FVC), start of the second injection (SOSI) and the maximum heat release rate (MHRR) for the F1, F2 and F3 strategies were studied and compared. The high speed images obtained revealed that the increase in the percentage of combustion near and shortly after TDC during the peak heat release rate period was due to the interaction between the first and the second injections, whereby the fuel sprays during the second injection at TDC were injected into burning regions generated by the combustion of premixed fuel and air during the first injection. As a result, the premixed combustion of fuel from the first injection was intensified by the participation of the second injection. The effect of such interaction became more pronounced as the first injection timing was moved closer to TDC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0954407012450656">Figure 9</xref>), where higher percentage of premixed combustion took place prior to the onset of the second fuel injection. From the results obtained it is evident that the design limitations of the FIE, as well as the possibility of interactions between the fuel injections during combustion, are amongst the complications that may be encountered in the application of split or multiple injection strategies. Therefore, thorough characterization of the FIE and careful selection of injection strategies are essential for satisfactory implementation of such advanced injection modes.</p>

<p>The high speed fuel spray, combustion, flame temperature and soot distribution results obtained for the F2 strategy were selected for detailed analysis, since the desired fuel quantity was injected for this strategy. The high speed image sequence for the F2 strategy is presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-0954407012450656">Figure 10</xref>. The first four frames show the fuel spray jets development from the start to the end of the first injection where, in the last frame, fuel sprays are almost fully evaporated. The fuel sprays in frames three and four are fully developed, due to long duration of the first injection; 70% of total fuel quantity was injected at this stage. The fuel spray impingement on the piston wall is evident from these images, where the tip of the fuel sprays spread along the piston wall upon impact, generating a mushroom type structure. The first combustion phase which was apparent from the heat release rate data at −6.8 CAD ATDC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0954407012450656">Figure 8</xref>) resulted in no visible combustion until −6.0 CAD ATDC, where the first visible combustion was observed. The presence of relatively intense premixed combustion shortly after the end of the first fuel injection is evident at −5.1 CAD ATDC. The frames presented at TDC, 0.9 CAD ATDC (MHRR), 1.8 CAD ATDC and 3.6 CAD ATDC show the image sequence from the start to the end of the second injection. As previously stated, the fuel sprays during the second injection were injected into burning regions, generated by the combustion of premixed fuel and air shortly after the end of the first fuel injection. Consequently, autoignition took place vigorously at the tip of the fuel sprays during the second injection, where fuel vapour was highly concentrated, and spread along the periphery of the fuel sprays, where the fuel evaporation rate and its mixing with air were considerably higher, as shown in frames seven and eight at TDC and 0.9 CAD ATDC, respectively. In the next frames, at 1.8 CAD ATDC and 3.6 CAD ATDC, the autoignition combustion spread to the outer regions of the sprays tips due to the fuel sprays impingement on the piston wall, following the mushroom like structure previously created due to fuel spray impingement. In the subsequent frame, at 8.1 CAD ATDC, the burning region was fully expanded, covering the entire combustion chamber. The intense burning in these images indicated that substantial premixed and diffusion combustion took place for this strategy, due to the interaction of the first and the second fuel injections; thus, high levels of NO<sub><italic>x</italic></sub> and soot emissions were expected. From the image sequence at 19.8 CAD ATDC, 27.9 CAD ATDC, 31.5 CAD ATDC, 43.2 ATDC and 52.2 CAD ATDC, it is evident that the flame intensity was diminishing during the expansion stroke, and moving clockwise due to the swirl motion. Several combustion sites are present in these frames, indicating the presence of diffusion combustion corresponding to the second phase of combustion.</p>

<p>The flame temperature and KL factor image sequence for the F2 strategy are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11-0954407012450656">Figure 11</xref>. Minor combustion at relatively low temperature was detected in the first frame, at 0.9 CAD ATDC. The subsequent frames, at 1.8 CAD ATDC and 3.6 CAD ATDC, showed combustion expansion around the tip and periphery of the sprays during the second fuel injection, where fuel sprays were injected into burning regions. As the combustion process evolved, the gas temperature increased, as is evident in the next frame, at 8.1 CAD ATDC, where high temperature combustion was detected around the periphery of the piston bowl; this is in good agreement with the high speed image taken at this crank angle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-0954407012450656">Figure 10</xref>). As previously stated, the interaction between the first and the second fuel injections resulted in the occurrence of such rapid expansion of combustion. The flame temperature steadily decreased during the expansion stroke, as shown in the image sequence at 19.8 CAD ATDC and 31.5 CAD ATDC, respectively. Although luminous combustion was detected through high speed fuel spray and combustion imaging technique at crank angles before TDC and later in the expansion stroke, no information could be detected at these crank angles due to inadequate sensitivity of the detection system at the preselected wavelengths in this investigation (i.e. 550 nm and 750 nm). The intensifier gain could not be further increased due to image saturation at crank angles where highly luminous flame was present. Therefore, the first few frames at the initial and final stages of combustion were neglected.</p>

<p>The soot concentration distribution shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11-0954407012450656">Figure 11</xref> followed the same pattern as those of the flame temperature image sequence, as expected. As shown by the KL factor images at 0.9 CAD ATDC and 1.8 CAD ATDC, during initial stages of the combustion process, soot concentration was relatively low. The soot produced at this stage was due to the presence of combustion during the second fuel injection, leading to the rapid combustion of fuel vapour around the tip and the periphery of the fuel sprays during the second fuel injection process. In the next two frames, at 3.6 CAD ATDC and 8.1 CAD ATDC, soot concentration increased, spreading to the periphery of the piston bowl as the combustion process progressed during the expansion stroke. Soot was mainly concentrated around the tip of the fuel sprays and the periphery of the piston bowl, where the gas temperature was considerably higher due to high concentration of fuel vapour. Soot concentration steadily decreased in the remaining image sequence, mainly due to oxidation. The same explanation regarding low signal-to-noise ratio of the results holds true for the soot measurements. Therefore, although the trend in soot formation and oxidation could be determined, care must be taken in quantitative analysis of such results.</p>
<p>The IMEP, soot, NO<sub><italic>x</italic></sub> and uHC emissions results are depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12-0954407012450656">Figure 12</xref>. The substantial variations in the engine output and exhaust emissions for the investigated split injection strategies were primarily due to the inconsistency in the total fuel quantity injected, as well as the interaction between the first and the second fuel injections. Nevertheless, the F2 and A3 strategies can be compared, since the total injected fuel quantities were identical and the IMEP values were comparable. In comparison, the F2 strategy resulted in a higher IMEP value, with considerably lower uHC emission, indicating improved fuel evaporation and mixing processes with significantly lower combustion noise. However, this injection strategy led to considerably higher soot and NO<sub><italic>x</italic></sub> emissions. The former was mainly attributed to the injection of fuel sprays into burning regions during the second injection, resulting in the propagation of highly luminous flame within the combustion chamber, while the latter was due to the occurrence of relatively intense premixed combustion caused by the interaction between the two injections.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>In this paper, the effects of dwell angle of split injection on the fuel injection system performance and in-cylinder mixture formation, combustion and soot distribution were investigated in a single cylinder CR fuel injection optical diesel engine. The fuel injection rate and interaction between two consecutive fuel injection events were quantified on a fuel injection characterization rig. The in-cylinder process was studied by means of detailed heat release analysis and high speed optical imaging techniques. The main findings can be summarized as follows: regarding the studied split injection strategies with variable dwell angle at 1200 bar injection pressure and the engine speed of 1500 r/min.</p>
<list id="list1-0954407012450656" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Significant interactions were found between two closely spaced split injections in a solenoid CR fuel injector. Care must be taken to ensure that such interactions are considered and accounted for in advanced diesel combustion modes which require multiple injections.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The in-cylinder high speed spray imaging and combustion visualization technique provided direct evidence of the interaction between combustion and fuel injection. The direct fuel injection into the premixed combustion from the first injection led to the more pronounced heat release rate seen amongst the four cases studied.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The results from the single and split injection strategies with similar total injected fuel quantities and IMEP values were compared, indicating the possibility of simultaneous improvement of engine performance and reduction of combustion noise. However, the tested split injection strategies resulted in higher soot emissions and almost similar NO<sub><italic>x</italic></sub> emissions.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Nevertheless, in order to identify the true effects of split injection with variable dwell angle on diesel combustion and emissions, further detailed characterization of the fuel injection system is required. In addition, an explicit conclusion on the advantages of split injection in comparison to that of conventional single injection can only be drawn provided that the effects of such phenomenon under various engine operating conditions are thoroughly assessed.</p>
