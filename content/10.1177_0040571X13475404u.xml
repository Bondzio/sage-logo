<p>In 2007, fifteen Jewish, Christian and Muslim scholars gathered at the Tantur Ecumenical Institute in Jerusalem; their task was to explore the consequences for inter-faith engagement of ‘learned ignorance’: the recognition that ‘all affirmations about God and God’s revelation are inescapably limited’ (p. 4). The book does not advocate withdrawal from serious commitment to the unique claims of one’s own faith. It insists, however, that the God who is truly known in and through these claims infinitely surpasses our knowing – and that these claims therefore cannot be converted into definitive pronouncements on how others, inhabiting different disciplines, stand before God. James Heft describes this as an affirmation of religious particularity that does not fall into exclusivism, and an affirmation of religious plurality that does not fall into relativism. It is distinct from the classic pluralist claim that the various traditions are all paths up the same mountain. It does, however, foster the expectation that others, precisely in their own religious faithfulness, might be surprises, gifts or revelations to me, recognizable in the light of my own tradition, but saying things that I could not have said to myself: they are genuinely different from me, and I cannot define in advance what their difference from me will mean, but must approach them in humble expectation.</p>
<p>A number of the essays explore the sources in the three traditions of such ‘learned ignorance’ and of the humility it fosters: in Nicholas of Cusa (Pim Valkenberg), in Torah (Michael Singer), in the Sufi tradition (Omid Safi) and in the Qur’an (Afra Jalabi, Mustafa Abu Sway, Asma Afsaruddin – though the last essay illustrates the diversity of the book: her rather different approach is to search for ethical common ground between the traditions).</p>
<p>Some of the essays provide careful re-interpretation of attempts in the history of the three traditions to define religious others or claim apparent certainty (Heft tackles papal infallibility, Reuven Firestone looks at claims about chosenness, Olivier-Thomas Venard at incarnational dogma, and Daniel Madigan the title <italic>Dominus Iesus</italic>). Some essays contain frank acknowledgement of the lack of humility in the history of our traditions, or of the ways in which religious others can therefore become ‘prophets’ to us, calling us to penitence (David Burrell, Elizabeth Groppe, Michael B. McGarry). Finally, there are essays examining the complexity of maintaining the stance of ‘learned ignorance’ – a stance that requires a balancing of, or even oscillation between, differing forms of certainty, ignorance and doubt (Stanislaw Krajewski).</p>
<p>The book is very readable, and each of the essays begins with an autobiographical sketch – displaying the very different histories of inter-faith engagement, and of theological stance, among the authors. As a whole, the collection is unavoidably uneven (and unevenly proofread) and the essays are too short to press the questions raised very far, but it is certainly a thought-provoking and interesting collection.</p>
