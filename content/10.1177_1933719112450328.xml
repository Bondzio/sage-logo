<abstract>
<p>To test the expression and localization of aquaporins 8 (AQP8) and 9 (AQP9) in human term fetal membranes and placenta in both oligohydramnios and normal amniotic fluid volume (AFV) groups and to explore the association between aquaporin expression and oligohydramnios. Real-time polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry were used to determine AQP8 and AQP9 expression levels and localization in amnion, chorion, and placenta, respectively. In addition, compared with the normal AFV group, the expression levels of both AQP8 and AQP9 in amnion in oligohydramnios group were significantly decreased, while their expressions in placenta were significantly increased. The expression level of AQP9 was also significantly decreased in chorion, while that of AQP8 was unchanged. Both AQP8 and AQP9 may play an important role in water flow both in intramembranous absorption and in placental water transfer. Our study offers the potential therapeutic approach for oligohydramnios.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>For the developing fetus, proper balance of amniotic fluid (AF) is critical for maintaining a full-term pregnancy.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1933719112450328">1</xref>
</sup> It helps to protect the fetus from trauma to the maternal abdomen, to cushion the umbilical cord from compression between the fetus and uterus, to serve as a reservoir of fluid and nutrients for the fetus, to provide the necessary fluid, space, and growth factors to permit normal development of the fetal lungs, musculoskeletal and gastrointestinal systems, and to render antibacterial properties. The balance between AF production and removal maintains the homeostasis of the amniotic fluid. Amniotic fluid, largely a product of fetal urine and lung fluid, is reabsorbed by the fetus. An additional route of AF absorption has been found via fetal membrane, across the amnion and chorion overlying the placenta, directly into the fetal circulation.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1933719112450328">2</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Excess or deficient amniotic fluid volume (AFV) is associated with high perinatal morbidity or mortality. Oligohydramnios occurs in 1% to 5% of all full-term pregnancies and is diagnosed as an amniotic fluid index (AFI) examined by ultrasound of 5 cm or lower according to the criterion of Phelan et al.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1933719112450328">3</xref>
</sup> Most oligohydramnios cases occur at term without associated risk factors, namely isolated oligohydramnios.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1933719112450328">4</xref>
</sup> Oligohydramnios has been considered a potential sign of fetal mortality and is associated with a higher frequency of adverse perinatal outcome.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1933719112450328">5</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Despite the critical importance of AFV, the mechanism that produces oligohydramnios is still not clearly understood. Verkman et al<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1933719112450328">6</xref>
</sup> found that transcellular water flux might be facilitated by aquaporins (AQPs), which were first discovered in red blood cells and renal tubules by Agre et al.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1933719112450328">7</xref>
</sup> Aquaporins are a family of membrane-bound, homotetrameric water channel proteins, whose size range is approximately 26 to 34 kDa. Each monomer is thought to contain a pore that facilitates osmotically driven water movement across a cell membrane. Up to now, 13 members (AQP0-12) have been found in a wide variety of mammalian tissues.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1933719112450328">8</xref>
</sup>
<sup>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1933719112450328">9</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>So far, the major AQPs found in placenta and fetal membranes at term are AQP1, AQP3, AQP8, and AQP9.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1933719112450328">10</xref>
</sup> Mann et al<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1933719112450328">11</xref>
</sup> found that AQP1 messenger RNA (mRNA) expression was increased in fetal membranes from patients with idiopathic polyhydramnios in comparison to that in fetal membranes from pregnancies with normal AFV, indicating that alterations in AQP1 expression may be a compensatory response to and not a cause of idiopathic polyhydramnios. We<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1933719112450328">12</xref>
</sup> demonstrated that AQP1 in amnion and AQP3 in amnion and chorion in the isolated oligohydramnios group was significantly decreased, while AQP3 expression in placenta was increased when compared with that in normal AFV group. These data suggested that alteration of AQP1 and AQP3 expression in fetal membranes and placenta may be a compensatory response to oligohydramnios. To date, there is no report published about the expression of either AQP8 or AQP9 in fetal membranes and placenta in human term pregnancies with oligohydramnios.</p>
<p>In human placenta, the expression of AQP8 and AQP9 were found in the epithelial cells of amnion, chorion cytotrophoblasts, and placental syncytiotrophoblasts and cytotrophoblasts.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1933719112450328">13</xref>
</sup>
<sup>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1933719112450328">14</xref>
</sup> Unlike AQP8, which is permeable to water and urea but not to glycerol, AQP9 is also highly permeable to glycerol. The presence of AQP8 and AQP9 in fetal membranes and placenta indicates that they may regulate AF either in intramembranous absorption or in placental water transfer. The objective of the present study was to determine the expression and localization of AQP8 and AQP9 in human term fetal membranes and placenta in both oligohydramnios and normal AFV groups and to explore the association between AQP expression and oligohydramnios.</p>

<title>Case Selection</title>
<p>The study protocol was approved by the Research Ethical Committee of the Second Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical College, and written consent was obtained from patients before the collection of samples. Through October 2006 to May 2009, 68 participants who had singleton pregnancies at term before a planned cesarean delivery were recruited in this study. Of these participants, 38 patients had isolated oligohydramnios and the rest had normal AFV controls. All patients, whose age ranged from 23 to 35 years, had pregnancies between 37 and 40 weeks of gestational age. Exclusion criteria included patients with fetal abnormalities, premature rupture of the membranes, small for gestational age, or growth restricted fetuses, and those who received medications for cervical ripening, labor induction, or augmentation. Participants with the following diseases, such as diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular disorders and autoimmune diseases, which may influence AFV, were excluded.</p>

<sec id="section4-1933719112450328">
<title>Diagnosis Criteria for Oligohydramnios</title>
<p>Amniotic fluid volume was assessed in all patients who were examined by HDI 5000 ultrasound machine with C5-2 abdominal probe (Philips, Japan) by dividing the uterus into 4 quadrants, with the linea nigra and umbilicus as landmarks. The AF index is the sum of the largest vertical pocket of amniotic fluid, free of umbilical cord, within each quadrant of the uterus in centimeters. Three AF index measurements was performed and averaged. Diagnosis of oligohydramnios was made by ultrasound measurement of the AFI index &lt;5 cm, with the index 8.0 to 18.0 cm referring to normal amniotic fluid.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1933719112450328">3</xref>,</sup>
<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1933719112450328">15</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>The AFV was reassessed at abdominal delivery with the technique described by Horsager et al.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1933719112450328">16</xref>
</sup> Briefly, plastic drapes with large plastic pockets were used on all patients to facilitate the collection of the AF at time of cesarean section. After the bladder had been reflected away from the lower uterine segment, a 1-cm incision was made in the uterus, and the AF was suctioned into a collection device, which was also used to collect blood or irrigating fluid from the operative field. The suctioning was continued until the AF no longer flowed freely. The fetus was then delivered, and any remaining AF in the uterus, operative field, and drape pockets was collected before delivery of the placenta. The AFV was measured, and a 3 mL specimen was collected in a tube containing ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid. The hemoglobin concentration was measured in the AF specimen with a Sysmex XE-2100 automated hematology analyzer (Toa Medical Electronics, Kobe, Japan). The blood volume in the AF was equal to the volume of the collected fluid multiplied by the hemoglobin concentration in the collected fluid and then divided by preoperative hemoglobin concentration. This value was then subtracted from the collected fluid to calculate the corrected true AFV. Oligohydramnios was defined as an AFV less than 300 mL, while an AFV range from 300 to 2000 mL was considered normal.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1933719112450328">16</xref>
</sup> Eight patients in the oligohydramnios group were excluded from the study because the AFV measured directly at cesarean delivery was discordant with the preoperative AFI determined by ultrasound.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1933719112450328">
<title>Tissue Specimens</title>
<p>Human placenta near the umbilical cord, approximately 1.2 × 1.2 × 1.5 cm, were obtained within 15 minutes after delivery, which the amnion, chorion, and placenta were gently separated from each other. Each tissue was rinsed thoroughly in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) solution to remove excess blood. Half of the tissues were fixed in 10% formaldehyde neutral buffer solution and embedded in paraffin for immunohistochemistry. The other half were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored in −80°C until further analysis.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1933719112450328">
<title>Real-Time Quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction</title>
<p>Frozen samples of fetal membranes and placenta, approximately 100 mg were homogenized in 1 mL Trizol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, California) and total RNA was isolated according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The RNA pellet was rinsed in 75% ethanol and briefly air-dried before being dissolved in DNase/RNase free water and stored at −20°C for further analysis. Reverse transcription was performed in a 12 μL reaction with 2 μg total RNA, using the M-MLV(200 U/μL, Fermentas, Hanover, Maryland), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) was performed and analyzed using a PRISM 7500 sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, California). Briefly, qPCR was performed in a total volume of 25 μL in each well containing 1.25 μL of 20× AQPs and β-actin TaqMan primers and probes, 12.5 μL of 2× TaqMan universal Master Mix (ABI, Foster City, California), 6.25 μL of DEPC H<sub>2</sub>O and 5 μL RT product. The reactions were carried out with an initial denaturation for 10 minutes at 95°C, followed by 40 cycles of 15 seconds at 95°C and 1 minutes at 60°C. All assays were performed in triplicates. The analysis was performed using the comparative threshold (Ct) cycle method. Following the formulas: expression = 2<sup>−ΔΔCt</sup>, where <sup>ΔΔ</sup>Ct = <sup>Δ</sup>Ct (oligohydramnios) − <sup>Δ</sup>Ct (normal) and <sup>Δ</sup>Ct = Ct (AQPs) – Ct (β-actin). Therefore, the amount of AQPs gene in the oligohydramnios group, normalized to β-actin and relative to that in the normal AFV group, was given by 2<sup>−ΔΔCt</sup>.</p>

<sec id="section7-1933719112450328">
<title>Immunohistochemistry</title>
<p>Paraffin tissue was sectioned at 4 μm and mounted on glass slides. Sections were air-dried for 15 minutes and fixed in 10% paraformaldehyde for 3 minutes, then rehydrated through a graded alcohol series after overnight incubation at 45°C to 50°C. The sections were heated in 10 mmol/L citrate buffer (pH 6.0) in a commercial microwave oven for 10 minutes at a 750 W power setting. The sections were then placed in distilled water after they had been cooled to room temperature. The sections were incubated in 0.3% hydrogen peroxide in methanol for 15 minutes to quench endogenous alkaline phosphatase. The sections were then incubated with 1.5% nonimmune goat serum for 15 minutes to avoid nonspecific binding. The sections were incubated overnight at 4°C with either anti-AQP8 (sc-28623) or anti-AQP9 polyclonal rabbit antibodies (sc-20824, Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc, Santa Cruz, California) at a dilution of 1:100, which was the best dilution established by optimization experiments. The sections were incubated 30 minutes at room temperature in biotinylated goat anti-rabbit antibody and then used diaminobenzidine as chromogen for 10 minutes. The sections were washed with PBS solution after each step of the procedure and counterstained with Mayer hematoxylin to enhance nuclear detection, dehydrated, and mounted in polystyrene xylene dibutylphthalate. Negative controls were performed in parallel, with the primary antibody omitted, while human renal tissue were used as a positive control for AQP8 and human liver tissue were used as a positive control for AQP9.</p>
<p>Protein expression signal was studied under the light microscope. A yellowish brown staining in membrane and cytoplasm indicated AQPs positive. All counting was done by 2 observers (S.S.J. and X.Q.Z.), without any knowledge of the diagnosis and results of the other observer's counts. The extent and location of immunohistochemical staining for AQPs was assessed according to the immunoreactive score (IRS) that determined the proportion of cells expressing AQPs and the intensity of staining as described.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1933719112450328">17</xref>
</sup> At least 10 high-power fields (×40 objective, ×10 eyepiece) were chosen at random to count all immunopositive cells. The number of AQP-positive cells was given as a percentage for each case. The percentage of positive cells detected was scored as 0 (0%-5%), 1 (6%-24%), 2 (25%-49%), 3 (50%-74%), and 4 (≥75%). Staining intensity was graded as 0 (<italic>negative</italic>), 1 (<italic>weak</italic>), 2 (<italic>moderate</italic>), and 3 (<italic>strong</italic>). Finally, the 2 scores were multiplied to obtain the IRS (values from 0-12).</p>

<title>Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>Statistical analysis was performed using the Scientific Package for Social Sciences (SPSS Chicago, Illinois) software version 13.0. Results were expressed as mean ± standard deviation. Data were first subjected to Kolmogorov-Smirnov test to confirm normal distribution. Student unpaired <italic>t</italic> test was used to compare the variables of maternal age, gestational age, weight, volume of maternal blood in AF and AQP mRNA expression between 2 groups. The Mann-Whitney <italic>U</italic> test was used to compare AQP protein expression in each tissue between 2 groups. <italic>P</italic> &lt; .05 was considered statistically significant.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In the present study, we demonstrated the expression of AQP8 and AQP9 mRNA and protein in human amnion, chorion, and placenta with either oligohydramnios or normal AFV. This is the first description of the expression of AQP8 and AQP9 in human fetal membranes and placenta in term pregnancies with oligohydramnios, which is consistent with previous studies of their expressions in human normal term pregnancy.<sup>

<sup>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1933719112450328">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1933719112450328">18</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Previous studies have explored the relationship between the expression of AQP8 and AQP9 in fetal membranes and placenta and decrease in AFV. Shioji et al<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1933719112450328">19</xref>
</sup> set up an oligohydramnios model using prostaglandin F2α receptor (FP)-deficient mice and demonstrated that AQP8 expression in the fetal membrane was decreased when oligohydramnios occurs. Through examining the correlation of AQPs with AFV and composition changes across gestation in the murine model, Beall et al<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1933719112450328">20</xref>
</sup> found that AFV was not correlated with fetal membrane AQP8 and AQP9 and placental AQP8 expression but negatively correlated with placental AQP1 and AQP9 expression and positively correlated with placental AQP3 expression. To the best of our knowledge, there is no report published to date about the association between the expression of either AQP8 or AQP9 in human fetal membranes and placenta and oligohydramnios.</p>
<p>Our results show that there was a significant decrease in expression of AQP8 in amnion and AQP9 in both amnion and chorion with oligohydramnios in comparison to pregnancies with normal AFV. Our finding suggests that downregulated AQP8 and AQP9 expression in fetal membranes may be an adaptive response to oligohydramnios, resulting in the decrease in the intramembranous absorption to maintain homeostasis of amniotic fluid. In addition to AQP8 and AQP9, 2 other AQPs (ie, AQP1 and AQP3) have been found to be expressed in human fetal membranes. In our previous study, a significant decrease in AQP1 expression in amnion and AQP3 expression in amnion and chorion has also been found in pregnancies complicated with oligohydramnios.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1933719112450328">12</xref>
</sup> However, our studies have not examined their functional significance in human fetal membranes with oligohydramnios. Water and solute uptake experiments are needed to investigate whether the molecular expression of AQPs in normal and oligohydramnios fetal membranes correlates with the transcellular transport mechanisms for water, mannitol, and urea.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the structure limiting placental water flow is presumed to be the trophoblast based on membrane permeability studies.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1933719112450328">21</xref>
</sup> The expression of AQP8 and AQP9 in placenta with oligohydramnios was noted to significantly increase when compared with that in normal AFV group, and AQP8 and AQP9 protein was localized in trophoblast cells. Therefore, AQP8 and AQP9 are likely to have a significant effect on regulating placental water flow when oligohydramnios occurs, to enhance the transport of water flow from maternal circulation through the placenta to fetus. Using placental explants in culture, Damiano et al<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1933719112450328">22</xref>
</sup> detected significant uptake of water, urea, and mannitol, sensitivity to mercury and phloretin, which indicated the expression of functional AQP9 in the normal term placenta. Moreover, AQP9 was found to be increased in human preeclamptic villous syncytiotrophoblast, but it could not be related to its functionality for the transport of water and mannitol.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1933719112450328">22</xref>
</sup>
<sup>,</sup>
<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1933719112450328">23</xref>
</sup> However, a significant urea flux was seen, which indicated AQP9 might not have a key role in water transport in human preeclamptic placenta, but a function in the energy metabolism or the urea uptake and elimination across the placenta. Whether the expressions of AQP8 and AQP9 in trophoblast cells play a key role in the regulation of maternofetal water exchange when oligohydramnios occurs is still speculative and needs further studies of functional significance.</p>
<p>In summary, this study shows that the water channel AQP8 and AQP9 may play a role in the regulation of AFV. Both AQP8 and AQP9 expression in fetal membranes and placenta is associated with AFV disorders, perhaps as an adaptive response to oligohydramnios. Further studies are needed to clarify the regulatory mechanisms of AOP8 and AQP9 expressions and examine their functional significance in human fetal membranes and placenta, hence, provide a potential therapeutic approach for isolated oligohydramnios.</p>
