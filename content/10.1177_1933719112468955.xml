<body>
<p>We read with great interest the article of Ozer et al entitled “The efficacy of bevacizumab, sorafenib, and retinoic acid on rat endometriosis model” published in your journal.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1933719112468955">1</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>The authors surgically induced endometriosis in 43 rats that were further randomized into 4 groups. One group was allocated to receive no medication while the other 3 groups received bevacizumab, sorafenib, or retinoic acid, respectively. After 14 days, the animals underwent a second laparotomy in order to examine the endometrial volume implants and then medical therapy was started. After 8 days from the end of the treatment, the animals were sacrificed and the authors showed an increase in delta volume of the nodules of 3.10 ± 6.35 in the control group (no drug) while a reduction of 11.5 ± 10.22, 9.64 ± 11.94, and 12.72 ± 7.58 were seen in the bevacizumab group, sorefenib group, and retinoic acid group, respectively. Microvessel density determined using the counting of CD31− and CD105+ microvessels and the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and soluble tyrosine-kinase receptor expressions were statistically modified by the use of bevacizumab and sorafenib but not by the retinoic acid administration.</p>
<p>The results of this study are in line with the previous investigations showing that the administration of antiangiogenic agents (TNP470, endostatin, anginex, and anti-human VEGF antibody) significantly decreases the angiogenic response of induced endometriosis, thus reducing the establishment, maintenance, and progression of these endometriosis-like lesions in animal models.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1933719112468955">2</xref>
</sup> However, the most common aim of treating endometriosis is not preventing the development of new endometriotic lesions. In the clinical setting, medical treatment is started after endometriosis has already been diagnosed, at which point the lesions have already been present for some years. Another clinical concern is that it appears unlikely that antiangiogenic drugs may cure the symptoms caused by large deeply endometriotic nodules that are mainly composed of fibromuscular tissue.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1933719112468955">3</xref>
</sup> Theoretically, antiangiogenic drugs may have a role in the postoperative treatment of endometriosis in order to increase the pain-free interval and decrease the recurrence of the disease; however, in this setting good clinical results (preventing recurrence, control pain symptoms) should be balanced with acceptable costs and toxicity, in fact long-term therapy is usually needed in patients with endometriosis.</p>
<p>Antioangiogenic drugs are one of the most promising drugs also in gynecological oncology; however, also in this setting some points need to be elucidated. The main problem in the use of antiangiogenic drugs is that, currently, there is no validated biomarker for patient selection and for monitoring response to antiangiogenic therapy. Furthermore, bevacizumab it is not approved by the Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of ovarian cancer, breast cancer, or endometrial cancer because, up to now, only improvement in progression-free survival and not in overall survival was observed.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1933719112468955">4</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>More importantly, antioangiogenic drugs, in particular bevacizumab, cause several adverse effects.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1933719112468955">5</xref>
</sup> In the oncological setting, high-grade hypertension is encountered in 7.9% of the patients and all grade proteinuria is observed in 13.3% of the patients. The incidences of all-grade and high-grade arterial thromboembolic events in patients receiving bevacizumab is 3.3%, while the incidences of high-grade anemia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia are 3.9%, 18.5%, and 3.4% of the patients, respectively. The rates of wound healing complications and gastrointestinal perforation are 3.7% and 0.9% of the patients, respectively. These rates of these adverse effects could be acceptable in an oncological setting, where the primary end point is overall survival, but it appears difficult to accept this treatment in young patients with endometriosis where the goal is improving the quality of life.</p>
