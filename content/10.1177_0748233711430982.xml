<abstract>
<p>The aim of this study was designed to evaluate the possible protective effects of quercetine (QE) on the neuronal injury in the frontal cortex after chronic toluene exposure in rats. The rats were randomly allotted into one of the three experimental groups, namely, groups A (control), B (toluene treated) and C (toluene-treated with QE), where each group contains 10 animals. Control group received 1 ml of normal saline solution, and toluene treatment was performed by the inhalation of 3000 ppm toluene in an 8-h/day and 6-day/week order for 12 weeks. The rats in QE-treated group was given QE (15 mg/kg body weight) once a day intraperitoneally for 12 weeks, starting just after toluene exposure. Tissue samples were obtained for histopathological investigation. To date, no histopathological changes of neurodegeneration in the frontal cortex after chronic toluene exposure in rats by QE treatment have been reported. In this study, the morphology of neurons in the QE treatment group was well protected. Chronic toluene exposure caused severe degenerative changes, shrunken cytoplasm and extensively dark picnotic nuclei in neurons of the frontal cortex. We conclude that QE therapy causes morphologic improvement in neurodegeneration of frontal cortex after chronic toluene exposure in rats. We believe that further preclinical research into the utility of QE may indicate its usefulness as a potential treatment on neurodegeneration after chronic toluene exposure in rats.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Toluene, one of the most widely used industrial aromatic solvents, is used as an ingredient in gasoline, paints, lacquers, resins, nail polish, inks, cosmetic products, paint thinners and adhesives. In addition to the industrial uses, toluene is abused via inhalation. This is done by ‘sniffing’ (i.e., inhaling vapors from an open container), ‘bagging’ (i.e., inhaling more concentrated vapors from a closed container) or ‘huffing’ (i.e., breathing through a solvent soaked cloth) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0748233711430982">Kurtzman et al., 2001</xref>). In human, acute intoxication with toluene produces euphoria and disinhibition followed by hallucinations, tinnitus, ataxia, confusion, nausea and vomiting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0748233711430982">Evans and Balster, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0748233711430982">Flanagan et al., 1990</xref>). In animal experiments, acute exposure to toluene at low-to-intermediate doses can increase locomotor activity, with an observable increase in the frequency of sniffing and rearing and at high doses cause ataxia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0748233711430982">Kurtzman et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0748233711430982">Riegel and French, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0748233711430982">Wiaderna and Tomas, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0748233711430982">Wood and Colotla 1990</xref>). Subchronic toluene exposure at low concentrations also leads to adverse changes in neurobehavioral and neurochemical functioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0748233711430982">Berenguer et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0748233711430982">Beyer et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0748233711430982">Von Euler et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0748233711430982">Wiaderna and Tomas, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>In humans and animals, the primary effect associated with inhalation exposure to toluene is central nervous system (CNS) depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0748233711430982">Greenberg, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0748233711430982">Pryor et al., 1987</xref>). Several studies, carried out with animals, reported an uptake of inhaled toluene in blood and brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0748233711430982">Benignus et al., 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0748233711430982">Crofton et al., 1994</xref>). Affinity of toluene for the lipid-rich structures of nervous tissue results in CNS toxic effects within minutes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0748233711430982">Benignus et al., 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0748233711430982">Campagna et al., 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>The chronic abuse of solvents results in structural and functional impairment of a variety of organs. Thinner fume inhalation is an important cause of encephalopathy and may lead to irreversible brain damage. Particularly, toluene abuse has been shown to cause permanent changes in brain structures, which correlate with neural dysfunction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0748233711430982">Baelum, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0748233711430982">Hass et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0748233711430982">Ladefoged et al., 1991</xref>). Furthermore, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0748233711430982">Mattia et al. (1993)</xref> demonstrated that intraperitoneal (IP) injection of toluene caused a significant elevation in the rate of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and a reduction in levels of reduced glutathione in the brain. ROS, in turn, damages lipids, proteins and nucleic acid. This leads to neurodegenerative disorders, which mediate behavioral changes. Acute and chronic effects of toluene on neurons have been well documented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0748233711430982">Burmistrov et al., 2001</xref>). Toluene can cause CNS depression, loss of memory and progressive brain and nerve damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0748233711430982">Benignus, 1981</xref>).</p>
<p>Apoptotic processes play an essential role during the development of the nervous system and hence for the final structure and function of the brain. The most critical time window for studying the influence of neurotoxicants on the level of apoptosis is probably when apoptosis is at its highest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0748233711430982">Lam et al., 2002</xref>). Recent studies have shown that prenatal exposure of rats to 1800 ppm toluene induced neurobehavioral changes in the offspring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0748233711430982">Hougaard et al., 1999</xref>) and increased apoptotic neurodegeneration at postnatal day (PND) 21 in the cerebellar granular cell layer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0748233711430982">Dalgaard et al., 2001</xref>). In the control animals of that study, a specific peak of apoptotic activity in the granular cell layer of cerebellum was observed at PND 21 when compared with days 11 and 90. Exposure to toluene has been proposed to postpone the migration of granule cells to their final destination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0748233711430982">Dalgaard et al., 2001</xref>), resulting in a delay in the apoptotic peak. Prenatal stress produces learning deficits associated with inhibition of hippocampal neurogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0748233711430982">Hayashi et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0748233711430982">Lemaire et al., 2000</xref>). Prenatal stress has also been associated with an increased number of apoptotic neurones in the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0748233711430982">Fujioka et al., 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>Flavonoids are a group of naturally occurring compounds widely distributed as secondary metabolites in the plant kingdom. They have been recognized for having interesting clinical properties, such as anti-inflammatory, antiallergic, antiviral, antibacterial and antitumoral activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0748233711430982">Middleton, 1998</xref>). One of these flavonoids, quercetine (QE; 3,5,7,3′,4′-pentahydroxyflavone), prevents oxidant injury and cell death by several mechanisms, such as scavenging oxygen radicals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0748233711430982">Bors et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0748233711430982">Inal et al., 2002</xref>), protecting against lipid peroxidation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0748233711430982">Laughton et al., 1991</xref>) and chelating metal ions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0748233711430982">Afanas’ev et al., 1989</xref>).</p>
<p>In spite of these studies, there is no available information on the effect of QE on neuronal injury. The present study aimed to investigate the possible protective effects of QE on the neuronal injury in frontal cortex after chronic toluene exposure.</p>

<title>Materials and methods</title>
<sec id="section3-0748233711430982">
<title>Experimental procedure</title>
<p>QE was obtained from Sigma Chemical (St. Louis, MO, USA) and dissolved in 0.5 ml of 60% ethanol just before IP injection (15 mg/kg). Control group was injected with the same volume of saline as the toluene-treated groups received.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0748233711430982">
<title>Animals</title>
<p>Thirty healthy male Wistar albino rats, weighing 200–250 g and averaging 16 weeks old, were utilized in this study. The animals were purchased from a local supplier and housed in individual cages (360 × 200 × 190 mm) 1 month before the start of the experiments. Food and tap water were available ad libitum. In the windowless animal quarter automatic temperature (22 ± 2°C) and lighting controls (light on at 7.00 a.m. and off at 9.00 p.m., i.e., 14 h light/10 h dark cycle) was maintained. Humidity ranged from 50% to 55%. All animals received human care according to the criteria outlined in the <italic>Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals</italic> prepared by the National Academy of Sciences and published by the National Institutes of Health.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0748233711430982">
<title>Experimental design</title>
<p>The rats were randomly allotted into one of the three experimental groups, namely, groups A (control), B (toluene treated) and C (toluene-treated with QE), where each group contains 10 animals.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0748233711430982">
<title>Solvent exposures, drug preparation and sample collection</title>
<p>Control group received 1 ml normal saline solution, and groups B and C were exposed to 3000 ppm toluene (Merck, Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany; 99.5%) in inhalation chambers equipped with a trap and is designed to sustain dynamic and adjustable airflow (11,250 mg/m<sup>3</sup>) for an 8-h/day (from 8.00 a.m. to 4.00 p.m.) and 6-day/week order for 12 weeks. The rats in QE-treated group was given QE (15 mg/kg body weight) once a day intraperitoneally for 12 weeks starting just after toluene exposure. The solvent concentration in the chambers was continuously monitored using a gas chromatography. Control group (A) animals were housed in identical chambers ventilated with fresh air. At the end of the solvent exposure, all animals were anesthetized with IP injection of sodium thiopenthal (100 mg/kg, Sigma Chemical). After 20 minutes, the anesthetized rats were killed and frontal cortex tissues were removed for histological investigation.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0748233711430982">
<title>Histopathological procedures</title>
<p>Biopsies from the frontal cortex tissues of the rats were harvested and tissue fragments were fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin solution, embedded in paraffin, sectioned at 5 µm thickness and then stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E). The preparations were evaluated by means of a bright field microscope and photographed (Optiphot 2; Nikon, Tokyo, Japan).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0748233711430982">
<title>Immunohistochemical procedures</title>
<p>Harvested frontal cortex tissues were fixed in 10% neutral-buffered formalin, embedded in paraffin, and sectioned at 5 μm thickness. Immunocytochemical reactions were performed according to the avidin–biotin–peroxidase complex (ABC) technique described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0748233711430982">Hsu et al. (1981)</xref>. The procedure involved the following steps: (1) endogenous peroxidase activity was inhibited by 3% H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in distilled water for 30 minutes; (2) the sections were washed in distilled water for 10 minutes; (3) nonspecific binding of antibodies was blocked by incubation with normal goat serum (DAKO X 0907, Carpinteria, CA, USA) with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) in 1:4 dilution; (4) the sections were incubated with a specific rabbit polyclonal anti-caspase-3 antibody (Cat. #RB-1197-P, Neomarkers, Fremont, CA, USA), diluted 1:50 for 1 h and then kept at room temperature; (5) the sections were washed with PBS for 3 × 3 minutes; (6) the sections were incubated with ABC complex (DAKO LSAB 2 Kit, Carpinteria, CA, USA) for 20 minutes; (7) the sections were washed with PBS for 3 × 3 minutes; (8) peroxidase was detected with an aminoethylcarbazole substrate kit (AEC kit; Zymed Laboratories, San Francisco, CA, USA); (9) the sections were washed with tap water for 10 minutes and then dehydrated; (10) the nuclei were stained with hematoxylin and (11) the sections were mounted in DAKO paramount. All dilutions and thorough washes between steps were performed using PBS unless otherwise specified. All steps were carried out at room temperature unless otherwise specified.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0748233711430982">
<title>Microscopic examination</title>
<p>Histological specimens of the frontal cortex were examined under light microscopy, with the examination carried out at a magnification of ×400 and the counts of neurons determined per square millimeter with the use of a standardized ocular grid. Apoptotic cells (terminal dUTP nick end-labeling [TUNEL] positive neurons) were counted. The distribution of neurons was examined in the sections from the specimens that were subjected using TUNEL. Tissue sections were examined under light microscopy (×400) and the number of the neurons counted within random high-power fields using a Nikon Optiphot 2 light microscope incorporating a square graticule in the eyepiece (eyepiece: ×10, objective: ×40 and a total side length: 0.25 µm<sup>2</sup>). Neuron density was assessed by counting the number of cells in ×400 high-power fields among the frontal cortex tissue preparations of each group. The neuron density in each site was calculated and recorded as the number of neurons per square micrometer. The tissue compartments were used to record neuron distribution in the frontal cortex tissues.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0748233711430982">
<title>Evaluation of apoptosis</title>
<p>Apoptosis was evaluated by the TUNEL assay. The TUNEL method, which detects fragmentation of DNA in the nucleus during apoptotic cell death in situ, was employed using an apoptosis detection kit (TdT-Fragel™ DNA Fragmentation Detection Kit, Cat. No. QIA33, Calbiochem, San Diego, CA, USA). All reagents listed below are from the kit and were prepared following the manufacturer’s instructions. Frontal cortex tissue sections of 5 µm thick were deparaffinized in xylene and rehydrated through a graded ethanol series as described previously. They were then incubated with 20 mg/ml proteinase K for 20 minutes and rinsed in tris-buffered solution (TBS). Endogenous peroxidase activity was inhibited by incubation with 3% hydrogen peroxide. Sections were then incubated with equilibration buffer for 10–30 minutes and then terminal deoksiniklotidil transferaz (TdT)-enzyme, in a humidified atmosphere at 37 C, for 90 minutes. They were subsequently put into prewarmed working strength stop/wash buffer at room temperature for 10 minutes and incubated with blocking buffer for 30 minutes. Each step was separated by thorough washes in TBS. Labeling was revealed using diaminobenzidine (DAB), counterstaining was performed using methyl green and sections were dehydrated, cleared and mounted.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0748233711430982">
<title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p>All statistical analyses were carried out using SPSS statistical software (SPSS for windows, version 11.0). All data were presented in mean ± SD. Differences in measured parameters among the three groups were analyzed with a nonparametric test (Kruskal-Wallis test). Dual comparisons between the groups exhibiting significant values were evaluated with Mann-Whitney <italic>U</italic> test. These differences were considered significant when <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0748233711430982">
<title>Results</title>
<p>The initial study consisted of 13 rats in the toluene-treated group. Three animals died in the toluene-treated group during the experiment and the rest of rats had loss of righting reflex and psychomotor impairment.</p>
<sec id="section13-0748233711430982">
<title>Histopathological and ultrastructural findings</title>
<p>In the control group, the morphology of neurons in the frontal cortex tissues was normal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0748233711430982">Figure 1(a)</xref>). In the toluene-treated group, the most consistent findings occurring in the histological tissue sections stained with H&amp;E were those indicating severe degenerative changes, shrunken cytoplasm and extensively dark picnotic nuclei in neurons of the frontal cortex tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0748233711430982">Figure 1(b)</xref>). The darkly stained nucleus and the nerve cells showing the pathologic changes were reduced in the QE-treated rats. In these groups, the severity of degenerative changes in the cytoplasm and especially in the nuclei of cells was less than that in the only toluene-treated group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0748233711430982">Figure 1(c)</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Despite the widespread abuse of toluene and other solvents, the molecular sites of action of these compounds are largely unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0748233711430982">Balster, 1998</xref>). More is known about the behavioral effects of these substances: toluene and other abused solvents produce effects similar to that of CNS depressants. These effects include psychomotor impairment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0748233711430982">Moser and Balster, 1986</xref>), excitation and then inhibition of locomotor activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0748233711430982">Warren et al., 2000</xref>) and loss of righting reflex and sedation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0748233711430982">Tegeris and Balster, 1994</xref>). In addition, peripheral nerve dysfunction has been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0748233711430982">Echeverria et al., 1991</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0748233711430982">Mattia et al. (1993)</xref> demonstrated that IP injection of toluene caused a significant elevation in the rate of ROS generation and a reduction in glutathione levels in the brain. Long-term toluene abuse has led to neuropsychiatric and neurobehavioral disorders, which in many cases, but not all, were reversible. Some chronic toluene abusers have developed structural CNS damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0748233711430982">Greenberg, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0748233711430982">Zabedah et al., 2001</xref>). Volatile substances containing toluene are frequently abused by young people, thus leading to neurological damage. In fact, glue-sniffing is frequent among secondary school children and young adults because it is more easily available and cheaper than other drugs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0748233711430982">Zabedah et al., 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>Acute and chronic effects of toluene on neurons have been well documented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0748233711430982">Burmistrov et al., 2001</xref>). In addition, toluene inhalation was found to enhance astrocyte activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0748233711430982">Gotohda et al., 2000</xref>). Astrocytes are known to play an important role in the survival of neurons in the brain and they have been implicated in the regulation of ionic environments, which are required for proper physiological function of neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0748233711430982">Moonen et al., 1990</xref>). Glial cells exhibit early cellular responses following a variety of insults to the CNS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0748233711430982">Papadopoulos et al., 1999</xref>). Reactive gliosis is a reaction of astrocytes to neuronal damage resulting from physical or chemical insults.</p>
<p>Pathological studies of the effects of toluene inhalation based on the biopsies of the sural nerve have shown swelling of the axons and an extremely thin lamella of the myelin sheath (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0748233711430982">Altenkirch et al., 1977</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0748233711430982">Coskun et al. (2006)</xref> suggested that increased lipid peroxidation, reduced antioxidant enzyme activities and ultrastructural changes found in their study indicate that chronic toluene inhalation might be involved in free radical processes. In the present study, chronic toluene exposure caused severe degenerative changes, shrunken cytoplasm and extensively dark picnotic nuclei in neurons of the frontal cortex. These findings are in agreement with the results of other investigators on toluene-induced neurotoxicity in different animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0748233711430982">Altenkirch et al., 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0748233711430982">Coskun et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0748233711430982">Kanter, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0748233711430982">Korbo et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0748233711430982">Saavedra et al., 1996</xref>).</p>
<p>To date, no histopathological changes neurodegeneration in the frontal cortex after chronic toluene exposure in rats by QE treatment have been reported. Recent studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0748233711430982">Kanter, 2008b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0748233711430982">2011</xref>) have attempted to identify that <italic>Nigella sativa</italic> and <italic>thymoquinone</italic> <italic>(</italic>TQ<italic>)</italic> have some neuroprotective and restorative effects on secondary pathochemical events after toluene induced frontal cortex injury in rats. These restorative effects are mainly observed on oxidative stress and neuronal numbers and neuronal morphology.</p>
<p>In our previous report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0748233711430982">Kanter, 2011</xref>), we concluded that TQ therapy causes morphologic improvement in neurodegeneration of frontal cortex after chronic toluene exposure in rats. In the present study, in the frontal cortex of QE-treated rats, the severity of degenerative changes in the cytoplasm and especially in the nuclei of cells was less than that in the only toluene-treated group. The darkly stained nucleus and the nerve cells showing the pathologic changes were reduced in the QE-treated rats.</p>
<p>Apoptosis involves interactions among several protein families that regulate activation of proteolytic caspases. Although multiple pathways can induce apoptosis, the mitochondrial pathway has most frequently been implicated in CNS apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0748233711430982">Yuan and Yankner, 2000</xref>). In our previous study, Kanter (2011) suggest that TQ therapy causes morphologic improvement in neurodegeneration of frontal cortex after chronic toluene exposure in rats. In our another study, there was a clear increase in the number of TUNEL-positive apoptotic cells in the bile duct ligation-treated rats in the liver parenchyma. Treatment of QE markedly reduced the reactivity and the number of TUNEL-positive apoptotic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0748233711430982">Kanter, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Studies have shown that in rats, toluene just like ethanol has toxic effects on the brain development as well as disturbances in the cognitive functions (Hass et al., 1999). Previously, it has been shown that toluene affects the apoptotic neurodegeneration of the cerebellar granular cell layer after prenatal exposure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0748233711430982">Dalgaard et al., 2001</xref>). For hippocampus on PND 6, the caspase-3 activity was higher in the toluene group compared with the control group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0748233711430982">Ladefoged et al. 2004</xref>). In this study, similar to our previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0748233711430982">Kanter, 2008a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0748233711430982">2008b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0748233711430982">2011</xref>), mild caspase-3 immunoreactivity was observed in the cytoplasm of neurons in control rats, whereas the caspase-3 immunopositivity was increased especially in neurons of the frontal cortex following toluene exposure. Treatment of QE markedly reduced the immunoreactivity of degenerating neurons after chronic toluene exposure.</p>
<p>A marked increase in the number of apoptotic cells was observed in cerebellar granule cells at PND 21 compared with the other age groups. Toluene induced a statistically significant increase in the number of apoptotic cells in the cerebellar granule layer at PND 21. The mean was increased from 37 in the control group to 71 in the toluene-exposed group. Thus, the granular cell layer in cerebellum is a highly relevant tissue which is used to study toluene-induced apoptosis because of the continuous migration of neurons and high frequency of neuronal apoptosis during the weaning period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0748233711430982">Dalgaard et al., 2001</xref>). In the present study, the number of the apoptotic (TUNEL-positive neurons) neurons was increased significantly in toluene-treated rats compared with control and toluene-treated rats with QE frontal cortex tissues.</p>
<p>We conclude that QE therapy causes morphologic improvement in neurodegeneration of the frontal cortex tissues after chronic toluene exposure in rats. We believe that further preclinical research into the utility of QE may indicate its usefulness as a potential treatment on neurodegeneration after chronic toluene exposure in rats.</p>
