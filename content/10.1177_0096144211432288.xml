<p>Outlining the characteristics and history of Chinese urbanism is proving illusive just as the Chinese city has entered one of its most rapid phases of transformation. China’s cities have been the seat of authority and status for thousands of years, even though the majority of the population has been rural until quite recently. China’s capital cities have long pursued yet rarely attained a specific ideal, while the urban fabric of different regions has shown great diversity. Throughout the nineteenth, twentieth, and twenty-first centuries, the process of making the Chinese city “modern” has also hosted a variety of expressions that, while showing influence of the West, are still distinctively Chinese. Views of the history of the city from within China may also be quite different from perceptions from abroad. Attempts at coming to terms with the topic, and to some extent at communicating across cultures, range from fine-grained case studies to geographically and temporally expansive studies that seek to uncover long historical trends. Three recent publications occupy diverse places in this continuum. The diversity of these works makes clear the value of approaches deriving from different disciplines, while two in particular confirm the usefulness of integrating visual evidence with text. Victor F. S. Sit’s <italic>Chinese City and Urbanism</italic> is a veritable handbook of Chinese urbanism from prehistory to the present day, while <italic>The Making of Hong Kong: From Vertical to Volumetric</italic> by Barrie Shelton, Justyna Karakiewicz, and Thomas Kvan is a careful study of the development of the former British colony’s three-dimensional urban form, and Michael Knight, Dany Chan, et al.’s museum catalogue, <italic>Shanghai: Art of the City</italic>, takes on that metropolis’s artistic and material culture.</p>
<p>Victor F. S. Sit, a senior Hong Kong scholar, author, coauthor, or coeditor of several books on the modern Chinese city, and the director and chair professor of geography at Hong Kong Baptist University, explains exactly his intent in the introduction of <italic>Chinese City and Urbanism</italic>, “to treat the progress of history, civilization, and urban development of China together in order to demonstrate the unique qualities of Chinese civilization” (p. vii). This allows the reader to immediately apprehend that this work does not feign objectivity like many Western texts but embraces its ideological origin fully. While much of the text is a straightforward recounting of the periods of Chinese history and the major urban centers associated with each, for Sit China is exceptional and is made so by Confucian values. Sit makes no secret of his active participation in politics, and parts of the work are indeed pervaded by nationalist and Confucian revivalist sentiments. Claiming China to be “the only surviving ancient civilization” (p. 1) and a probable rival to Sumer and Egypt as the most ancient, Sit reflects sentiments that while not uncommon in China would be a surprise to many Western readers. Likewise, the author alludes to Chinese disputation of the “out of Africa” theory of the origin of humankind in favor of the local origin of the Chinese people (a position considerably less tenable after the recent emergence of deep clade DNA studies). By the fourth chapter, on the early Bronze Age, it comes as no surprise that the author reflects Chinese thought about the Erlitou archaeological culture being a direct match for the proto-historical Xia state in the face of Western skepticism. The reader ought to accept that the positions outlined by Sit on these matters are shared by a great many Chinese scholars and are in part a reaction to what rightly or wrongly are perceived as imperialist theories from the West.</p>
<p>Luckily, these types of controversies do not keep much of the rest of Sit’s text from being a very accessible handbook of Chinese settlement and urban planning. A considerable amount of text is devoted to preimperial China (the Qin and Han dynasties appear about one hundred pages into the text). Perhaps this is to emphasize the historical depth of Chinese civilization. Sit’s clear and direct prose, however, allows a quick progress through the centuries. Each chapter addresses a historical era. Typically, the chapter starts with a section that discusses the larger historical trends of the era (i.e., political organization of dynasties, economic, and technological advances, etc.). Sit then turns to discuss larger trends in urbanism, including numbered lists of major changes during the time period. The author subsequently turns to a brief discussion of case study cities of the era, including both capitals and regional centers, generally accompanied by drawings of plans insofar as they are known. Sit’s marriages of different fields of history tend toward very broad connections, and his transition between the broad and the fine scale can sometimes be quite abrupt, but these sacrifices are made for the cause of immediate comprehension. Sit concludes with a couple of paragraphs that attempt to bring together the historical background and the organization and other characteristics of the era’s settlements and cities.</p>
<p>The clarity of Sit’s presentation of the epochs of Chinese history make this book potentially useful in an undergraduate setting, provided that there is open discussion about the author’s point of view in the classroom. In a mixed graduate and undergraduate setting, it could also be supplemented with Nancy Steinhardt’s rather more finely textured <italic>Chinese Imperial City Planning</italic>, which Sit strangely omits from his bibliography.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0096144211432288">1</xref></sup> If the book is used in the classroom, one interesting approach may be to have the students read the introduction and the final chapter (chap. 13, “Message from Chinese Urbanism”) first. In this conclusion, Sit reveals his theoretical underpinnings, including how he believes the Chinese city does and does not relate to Marx’s historical phases of cities and his reflection on the contemporary state of affairs. The contemporary government under Wen Jiabao and Hu Jintao in Sit’s view is a return to the Confucian core of Chinese civilization, and he is sure that this is the best way forward in contrast to Western capitalist models of the city. The refreshing thing about <italic>Chinese City and Urbanism</italic> is that Sit has taken a very clear position on his subject that regardless of personal opinion can easily be assessed and discussed. This makes it ideal as a focus for discussion and exchange, a valuable quality in a teaching setting.</p>
<p>Sit would no doubt regard the cities that are subjects of the other two texts here discussed as aberrations from the Confucian ideal, although they are among China’s most successful. Barrie Shelton and Justyna Karakiewicz (both now associate professors of urban design at the University of Melbourne) and their coauthor Thomas Kvan (dean in the Faculty of Architecture at the University of Melbourne and former dean of architecture at the University of Hong Kong) have written a much-needed succinct history of Hong Kong’s three-dimensional urban form. In <italic>The Making of Hong Kong: From Vertical to Volumetric</italic>, the authors chart the city’s development through an examination of building form, transportation networks, geographical delineations, population trends, and the spatial limitations and opportunities they created.</p>
<p>The book is divided into eight chapters. The first, “A State of IntenCity,” is largely an introduction to Hong Kong and a statement of the importance of its study to contemporary urban planning, partly based on the ecological benefits of urban density as opposed to sprawl. Chapter 2, “Precedents,” examines possible precedents for Hong Kong’s urban density in traditional Chinese architecture—in particular walled settlements and the shop-house typology. Two chronologically arranged chapters follow, outlining general trends as well as key events (i.e., the Shek Kip Mei fire, creation of tunnels across the harbor and through Lion Rock Ridge, etc.). “Long, Low and Intense” explains the formation of the city’s plan, transportation networks, and most common streetscapes from British occupation to World War II. “Massing and Rising” follows developments in urban form from the end of the war to approximately 1980, including the massive increase in population, the beginnings of the public housing estates, the shift toward an industrial economy, and the development of the New Territories.</p>
<p>The brief fifth chapter, “Vertical and Volumetric,” acts as an introduction to the remaining chapters’ discussion of contemporary issues. In these chapters the authors neatly intertwine local precedents and practices with references to global planning ideas (with mention of the German-born architect and planner Ludwig Hilbersheimer and the modernist icon Le Corbusier, etc.). Chapter 6, “Podium and Tower,” is a useful examination of the podium as an urban form. The nuanced discussion of how the podium and tower idea has been implemented in different contexts in the city with varying degrees and types of success provides some of the book’s most insightful passages. Chapter 7, “Emerging Volumetric,” discusses various spatial strategies that Hong Kong exhibits as a consequence of dealing with density. These range from various forms of spatial reclamation to elevated or multitiered pedestrian networks, flatted factories, double-decker trams and busses, and businesses run with a minimal real estate footprint. Chapter 8, the conclusion, offers an open-ended meditation on the characteristics of Hong Kong previously surveyed. An addendum then follows, outlining the ideas of two projects the authors undertook in 2003 for the Kowloon &amp; Canton Railway Company (which is owned by the Hong Kong government). The two projects were for station-related urban forms, one a multilevel community-use facility to link Mong Kok and Mong Kok East stations and one for a new town and new town station at Kwu Tung in the northern New Territories. If this book were a result of the background research produced in preparation for the design proposals, then one would wish all designers would pursue the contexts for their designs so thoroughly.</p>
<p>Some clarification of what <italic>The Making of Hong Kong</italic> does and what it refrains from doing is necessary. The authors are designers, not urban or architectural historians. Although they conducted their research thoroughly, they have priorities that are more formal and less explanatory. The goal of the book is not to be a comprehensive architectural history—if it were, its mere 182 pages would fall far short. Historical causality is discussed in a general way, but the authors have accepted some more specific notions without critical examination. In particular, the notion they put forth that the Chinese shop-house form (indigenous to Guangdong province) needed to experience regulation and reconfiguration in Singapore before the typology began to pervade Hong Kong’s fabric needs to be seriously questioned. Also, the city seems to emerge on its own in some discussions, and the operations of human agency (as well as the contestation of space) are generally treated only in passing. The pervasive use of passive voice in the work tends to reflect this: “public transport use took a significant rise,” “Kowloon Peninsula Ridge to Lion Rock Ridge was filled to capacity with official and squatter buildings,” “With this pressure for urban space, something had to give and that was the Lion Rock Ridge,” “With the approval of Tsuen Wan’s plan in 1963, the general plans for Hong Kong’s new towns were set,” “Between the building of the first road and second rail tunnels to Sha Tin, a third was added to Hong Kong’s wider movement network,” and so on (pp. 94-95, passim). There are places in the text where Hong Kong’s fabric seems to expand with great inevitability on its own. At these times some notion of who the state and private actors were in these contexts would be helpful. Some developments treated as relatively recent (see particularly “Veneered Functions” in chap. 7) actually have a long history in South China, the shops and stalls that lined the lanes between Guangzhou’s Thirteen Factories in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries being prime examples. <italic>The Making of Hong Kong</italic> also manages to stay well clear of controversy, a smart move for designers who may want commissions from the city government in the future. However, space and its allocation in Hong Kong is an intensely political issue. The authors omit government-guided trends that replace small spaces (of the forms of shop-house and “extruded shop-house” particularly) with shopping malls, ridding the city of the low-rent retail spaces traditionally available to start-up small businesses and replace them with spaces affordable only to chain stores. Nor do they address the controversial West Kowloon development, which relates little to the rest of the fabric of the city, robbing some attractive features (like the former waterfront) of adjacent traditional middle- and low-income neighborhoods to create luxury development. To demand this of the authors, though, would likely be too much.</p>
<p><italic>The Making of Hong Kong</italic> does succeed in being a close study of urban form. Ample illustrations support the text. Particularly engaging are the multiple photographs (albeit of variably quality) of key sites that reinforce arguments made in the text. Charts, maps, and diagrams also serve to enhance the reader’s understanding. The authors clearly have extensive familiarity with the city. This perhaps led to a bit of an omission—while those with more in-depth experience of the city can appreciate the extent of research that went into the book, those who have never come to Hong Kong or who have visited only briefly will no doubt need to independently find a map with neighborhood names on it to keep track of the discussion geographically. The great 1960s and 1970s private housing estate of Mei Foo and the extensive public and private developments of the Tsing Yi neighborhood would largely not be part of anyone’s itinerary apart from the “locals,” although this book might change that. The directness and clarity with which this book traces the formal aspects of Hong Kong’s development is admirable. For an advanced undergraduate course dealing with cities in Asia, it would be an ideal resource. For designers working on projects in Hong Kong, <italic>The Making of Hong Kong</italic> may well be the one essential text.</p>
<p>For scholars looking for some visual engagement with the material culture of a metropolis, <italic>Shanghai: Art of the City</italic> will prove greatly satisfying. The book is the catalogue of an exhibition held at San Francisco’s Asian Art Museum in 2010. The occasion for this exhibition in Shanghai’s U.S. sister city was of course significant as the year in which Shanghai hosted the World Expo. Edited by Michael Knight and Dany Chan of the Asian Art Museum, the book also includes essays by other American and Chinese curators and scholars. Three essays, Knight and Chan’s “Shanghai: Art of the City,” Wen-hsin Yeh’s “A Tale of Three Cities: Shanghai from 1850 to the Present,” and Peabody Essex Museum curator of Chinese art Nancy Berliner’s “Reaching to Heaven: Shanghai Architecture and Interiors,” set the stage for the catalogue entries. While these essays may not hold much in the way of breakthrough revelations for those already familiar with the history of Shanghai, they are certainly informative to a general audience and have passages of interest to even specialists. Nancy Berliner’s discussion of a series of illustrations in the exhibition for <italic>Haishang baiyantu</italic> (One Hundred Beauties of Shanghai), for example, is a particularly effective evocation and synthesis of these visual records of the vanished spaces of the culturally hybrid city of the 1890s.</p>
<p>The heart of the volume, however, is the catalogue of objects itself. In an era of diminished resources for illustrations in books, it is truly a joy to see the fine color plates that pervade the volume. The works in the catalogue are organized approximately by a combination of chronology and medium, starting with China trade paintings and export silver and leading through Shanghai School paintings and modern Chinese style paintings, late-nineteenth-century lithography, architecture and interior design, commercially oriented graphic arts of the early twentieth century (including a section specifically devoted to images of “modern women”), Western-influenced painting, woodblock prints associated with Lu Xun’s Public Art Movement, the Graphic Arts of the Mao era, and finally contemporary Shanghai art. Each section is introduced with a concise essay. All of these are informative and effectively introduce the subject matter that follows. Scholars may tend to notice some of the problems that museum exhibitions encounter, however—specifically the fact that the exhibition must on some level be shaped by the objects on hand. On occasion, it may occur to the reader that Shanghai exceptionalism (which is of course justifiable in an exhibit with a celebratory emphasis such as this) can go a bit far. While Shanghai may be a paragon of urban modernity in China, those new to the field should be aware that the cities of the Pearl River delta, Beijing, and other cities are equally important to the topic. Some of the artists presented (e.g., Lin Fengmian) may be considered really more as national figures with ties to multiple regions, although admittedly many figures of great significance in the twentieth century by necessity lived part of their lives in Shanghai.</p>
<p>The catalogue produces great satisfaction by allowing the reader to encounter objects that profoundly and often unexpectedly resonate with the history of the city. For instance, on turning to number 16 in the catalogue (pp. 80-81), the reader beholds what at first appears to be a not particularly remarkable double portrait of two men with faces rendered with an intense realism influenced by photography juxtaposed with a very traditional loosely painted landscape featuring pine and bamboo, conventional symbols of Confucian gentlemanly virtue. While incongruous to Western eyes, such paintings were not atypical in the early twentieth century. It is only on reading the catalogue entry that one realizes the seemingly scholarly figures are Huang Jinrong and Du Yuesheng, two of the most powerful organized crime bosses of the Shanghai underworld in the 1920s and 1930s! The catalogue rewards flipping back and forth to consider objects in juxtaposition. The ease with which the bund seemed to move from being a backdrop in a poster of an alluring young Chinese woman of the 1930s (p. 147) to being a backdrop for denunciations of American imperialism and capitalism in the 1960s (p. 201) is remarkable. Sometimes the scholar is best rewarded with additional application of his or her own knowledge. Li Hua’s woodcut <italic>A Corner of the City</italic> of 1947 (p. 188) becomes a more poignant image of protest when one realizes that the abandoned infant in the foreground is juxtaposed (not with the bund as the catalogue suggests but rather) with the Park Hotel in the background, then the tallest building in Asia and an unequivocal celebration of the city’s economic power. The objects mentioned are a very small segment of the many delights of the catalogue, which range from Art Deco rugs featuring tai chi emblems to dystopic urban visions of contemporary artists.</p>
<p><italic>Shanghai: Art of the City</italic>, like the other two works reviewed here, offers satisfaction as well as challenges (exploring a broader range of cities, integration of evidence from different media and disciplines, tackling unexplored areas of social history, etc.) to the scholar of China’s urban history. By addressing a series of objects that in some way are historically associated with the city, it asks the reader to take diverse information and assemble it into a narrative that helps explain the churning transformations of China’s urban environment. <italic>Shanghai: Art of the City</italic>, with its diversity of subject matter, would lend its breadth well to any university-level seminar on the history of modern art or material culture in China.</p>
<p><italic>Chinese City and Urbanism</italic>, <italic>The Making of Hong Kong</italic>, and <italic>Shanghai: Art of the City</italic>, in their engagement with the particularities and transformations of Chinese cities from the broadest possible scale to the rather more specific, should urge urban historians to emulate their example and push on to further exploration of this topic of remarkable complexity and richness. Professors will no doubt find the range of topics explored by these authors useful in engaging students according to their interests, whether they are ideological influences in the writing of urban history, urban history as a way to inform design, or the cosmopolitan background of artistic and commercial production. The latter two works discussed here also particularly make clear the value of integrating discussions of urban history with visual evidence to reinforce or clarify understanding of the topic. Interdisciplinary and visual approaches to engage the reader, indeed the next generation of readers, in the topic of urban history are valuable tools. If the high-density city (as Shelton, Karakiewicz, and Kvan suggest at both the beginning and end of their text) is our collective future, then an understanding of China’s urban history is vital.</p>
