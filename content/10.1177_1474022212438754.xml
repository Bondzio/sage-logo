<abstract>
<p>This article raises a number of questions that the author believes need to be addressed in order to defend and justify the teaching and practice of the humanities in an age when they continue to face swingeing cuts and unreasoned attacks from many quarters, both inside and outside the Academy. They are questions that have to do with the uniqueness of the humanities, its role in teaching values, the objectives of research, the connection between research and teaching, the value of an education in the humanities for society overall, and the ways in which humanists can play a useful public role. In sum, the author advocates for a coherent justification for what the humanities, plain and simple, <italic>are</italic> (or is).</p>

<sec id="sec1-1474022212438754"><title>I</title>
<p><sc>Something needs to be done</sc> – urgently. We are agreed – right? But what? From this starting point I mean to ask hard questions about the humanities, even at the risk of appearing subversive, because I seek answers, plain and simple, to questions I am struggling to answer myself. These questions have been troubling me for some time: it has only been the invitation to write this article that has stimulated me to perceive them as part of a unified whole. What is intrinsic to the humanities in contradistinction to other branches of academic inquiry? What goods or effects do we who teach the humanities claim to impart to our students? What should be the purpose of research undertaken in the humanities? Should a humanities curriculum implicitly or explicitly emphasize values? And finally, what is the role of the humanities in society?</p>
<p>To begin with, any discussion that has the word ‘humanities’ in its title is accompanied by a nagging concern on my part that the category of disciplines affiliated to it by no means constitutes a coherent entity. What does print design share in common with Russian literature, say? Or linguistics with the history of jazz harmony? Everything, you might reply, for all are expressions of human identity, the study of which teaches us what it means to be human. Indeed we who are humanists, by which I mean we who teach in the humanities, are privileged by our title to be identified as defenders of human identity. Is that identification justified? Not exclusively. Science is a no less quintessentially human enterprise, in both its social and natural aspects. We are the hapless heirs of the nineteenth-century German educational establishment, which holds ultimate responsibility for splitting <italic>Wissenschaft</italic>, the totality of human knowledge, into <italic>Naturwissenschaft</italic>, the sciences, and <italic>Geisteswissenschaft</italic>, the arts and humanities.</p>
<p>Within the disciplines classified as the humanities, moreover, there are areas of inquiry that require competence, if not expertise, in both the natural and social sciences. That is certainly true, for instance, of both Archeology and History. Hang on a second. Did I just lump History among the humanities? In Colgate University History is classified as a branch of the social sciences. So who came up with the bright idea that History was a branch of something called ‘science’? Someone, no doubt, who thought that <italic>Quellenforschung</italic>, source criticism, gave it scientific credentials. Yet few disciplines, historically (<italic>sic</italic>) speaking, have been more subject to the vagaries of both subjectivism and topicality than History, even though, I concede, it currently stands much closer to the social sciences than formerly, not least due to its connections to social and cultural anthropology. That does not mean it is any the less ‘humanistic’, however. And what about Women’s Studies and Jewish Studies, currently housed in the Division of University Studies rather than the humanities in my institution, owing to the vagaries of administrative convenience? Are they not at the heart of the humanistic enterprise? All I can say about my own intellectual leanings (to be self-referential for a moment) is that nothing defines me more as a humanistically oriented teacher of the humanities than the fact that I practice the discipline of history, albeit not in History.</p>
<p>It is also sometimes suggested that the humanities are characterized by an avoidance or even an eschewing of theory. This is not the case in all disciplines, however. Scholars of linguistics, for one, build their professional identities around theories, as, too, in a different way, do the heirs of that most venerable of philological traditions, textual critics. Or take the interpretation of Greek tragedy. The past half century has witnessed the introduction of a plethora of interpretive methodologies that offer the widest possible variety of approaches – anthropological, sociological, historicist, anti-historicist, psychological, structuralist, deconstructionist, Marxist, feminist, Marxist-feminist, linguistic, and performance-oriented. Some humanists would go so far as to assert that to claim to be working without a theory is itself a theory, and a pretty barren theory at that.</p>
<p>There is also an intractable problem with the word ‘science’, which is sometimes thought to signal a more positivistic and permanent form of knowledge than anything the humanities can deliver. On the contrary, science, quite aside from its practical effects upon human life, which are arguably ever more pervasive, is ‘a great theoretical achievement of knowing, a work of the mind, and a product of culture’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1474022212438754">Bird, 1976</xref>: 166). To fulfill its humanistic function, however, science must be studied and taught in a manner that is revelatory of human experience and understanding of the world we inhabit. Those who practice it at the highest level must, moreover, grapple with the intractable problems of subjectivism just as much as humanists do in their line of work, as well as consider the social impact of their discoveries. An anecdote recollected by Freeman <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1474022212438754">Dyson (1979: xi)</xref> makes the point well. ‘The physicist Leo Szilard once announced to his friend Hans Bethe that he was thinking of keeping a diary: “I don’t intend to publish it; I am merely going to record the facts for the information of God.” “Don’t you think God knows the facts?” Bethe asked. “Yes,” said Szilard. “He knows the facts, but He does not know <italic>this version of the facts</italic>.”’ The Italian physicist Enrico Fermi made much the same observation when he observed, ‘At the level of subatomic particles, everything is poetry.’</p>
<p>Science, too, arguably more than any other human activity or discipline, presents us with an historical record of the changes that have taken place over time in man’s conception of his identity and position on this earth and in this universe. All this said, I concede that it is primarily within the humanities that the concept of a self-directed, autonomous, and unique cultural entity that is man has received its fullest scope and expression, though my concerns with nomenclature, classification, and distinctiveness naggingly remain.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1474022212438754">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>A further concern has to do with ‘outcomes assessment’, a term with which we are all too familiar. I am not sure that an outcome in the humanities is measurable on any scale, unless we are talking in a limited sense about, say, proficiency in a foreign language or, to stick with a previous example, accomplishment in print design. I don’t believe that considerations about human values are either exclusive to the humanities or applicable to all the disciplines practiced throughout the humanities. Language departments, for instance, are hardly in the business of helping students make moral choices, though I suppose it could be argued for the sake of outcomes assessment that they provide them with a coping mechanism when they undertake foreign travel. In this regard I am sympathetic to, if not in agreement with, Stanley <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1474022212438754">Fish (2008)</xref>, who stated in a widely circulated op-ed in the <italic>New York Times</italic> a few years back:
<disp-quote>
<p>Teachers of literature and philosophy are competent in a subject, not in a ministry. It is not the business of the humanities to save us, no more than it is their duty to bring revenue to a state or university. What then do they do? They don’t do anything, if by ‘do’ is meant bring effects in the world. And if they don’t bring about effects in the world they cannot be justified except in relation to the pleasure they give to those who enjoy them.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1474022212438754">2</xref></sup></p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Fish was not the first to get the boot in. Callicles does it in Plato’s <italic>Gorgias</italic> (485d) – and with considerably less decorum: ‘When I see an older man still practising philosophy and showing no signs of laying it aside, it seems to me he’s asking to be whipped.’ Contrary to what Fish maintains, however, I will suggest that the humanities do bring about effects in the world and can be justified on grounds other than the production of pleasure. I see it as our job, not primarily to imbue our students with a specific set of values, but to make them more open-minded. I’d like to think that we teach them integrity, although, as I have already indicated, I don’t believe the humanities have any monopoly on that specific ‘effect’. I see it also as our business to alert them to the full range of human potential for both good and evil, as well as to the extremes of both human success and human failure, and to understand that these pairs of opposites, imposters as they both often are, may not always be mutually exclusive.</p>
<p>Classical literature for one is incomparably rich in providing us with the tools to ask hard questions. I hope that my students will learn the terrible lesson that Aeschylus teaches us, that at the heart of every moral dilemma right often fights with right just as much as it fights with wrong. I also think it is our task to teach about human diversity, by which I don’t mean simply racial or religious diversity, not least through the teaching of language, which should be obligated to incorporate the teaching of culture and cultural distinctiveness, though I acknowledge that language teachers may not be social anthropologists. Humanists, on a more regular basis than their colleagues in the natural or social sciences, confront the mystery of human creativity and discovery, and this mystery is fully worth emphasizing to our students. Finally, it is the duty of the humanities, and perhaps its foremost obligation, to teach students how to think and write critically, so that they can fulfill their role as democratic citizens in civil society.</p>
<p>But what students do with all that is their business, albeit society’s concern. And whatever it is they do with it, it won’t inevitably make them better human beings. The dissociation between artistic accomplishment and ethical behavior is so obvious as to need little illustration. Think of all those senior Nazis, like Joseph Goebbels, thrilling to the incomparably elevated and (one might have supposed) elevating chords of Mozart, Beethoven, and Wagner, conducted by the likes of Wilhelm Furtwängler and Herbert von Karajan, both card-carrying members of the Nazi Party. True, none of those Nazis may have taken any courses in moral philosophy. And it’s true as well that listening to music is not the same thing as studying or teaching in the humanities. Even so, we have merely to look at the career of Martin Heidegger, whose electoral address as Rector of Freiburg University in 1933 was notorious for its support of the principles of National Socialism, and who later demoted some of his colleagues for being insufficiently committed to Nazism, to be alerted to the limitations of critical thinking. These limitations become all the more disturbing in light of the fact that in 1935 Heidegger wrote:
<disp-quote>
<p>It is entirely correct and completely in order to say, ‘You can’t do anything with philosophy.’ The only mistake is to believe that with this, the judgement concerning philosophy is at an end. For a little epilogue arises in the form of a counterquestion: even if <italic>we</italic> can’t do anything with it, may not philosophy in the end do something <italic>with us</italic>, provided that we engage with it? (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1474022212438754">Fried and Polt, 2000</xref>: 13)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Admittedly Heidegger’s political sympathies present an extreme case, but it is one that should not lightly be brushed aside when arguing on behalf of the humanities.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-1474022212438754"><title>II</title>
<p>So, is there nothing that is exclusive to the humanities or to ourselves as humanities faculty or to our students as majors? There is, but perhaps rather less than sometimes meets the eye. I do not see how we can possibly claim to practice a shared mode of inquiry or have a shared approach to what we do. Rather what we do collectively is put a premium on certain ‘goods’ (or ‘effects’) that most people value rather slightly, if at all, and may even regard as a hindrance to the attainment of a successful and productive life. There are three such goods that I am able to identify. The first is an acute awareness of the provisional nature of all forms of human inquiry. I say ‘acute’ because, while all forms of human inquiry are provisional, those in the humanities are often more so. This makes humanistic inquiry a humbling exercise, whether it is undertaken in philosophy, ethics, religion, or literary criticism. Not that this means it is any the less valuable or gratifying. Of course, it is always gratifying to be able to have an outcome, as, for instance, to be able to settle once and for all whether Homer was one person or many, but probably that question like so many will never be solved. So what? Merely keeping the question alive is a goal itself, and one that has important implications for our reading and interpretation of Homer’s oeuvre.</p>
<p>The second good is that those who practice the humanities do occasionally ask central and pressing questions about the meaning of life, about its <italic>telos</italic> or <italic>summum bonum</italic>, about the best way to live, and the best way to foster human flourishing, and all this in turn requires us to ask what constitutes a well-ordered polity and what it means to be civic-minded. It may well be that humanists ask these questions more frequently and pressingly than their colleagues in the sciences, but we should not claim a monopoly. Political scientists also engage with questions about civic-mindedness and statehood, psychologists have much to say about human flourishing, and if physicists and biologists are not occasionally pondering the meaning of life when they look through a telescope or microscope, they must be very strange people indeed.</p>
<p>The third good centers around the concept of appreciation. I think there is a case for arguing that the humanities are foremost in encouraging appreciation of both human accomplishment and human frailty, and in so doing have the ability to sensitize us to human behavior. Yet again we should be wary of claiming this to be our exclusive preserve. Admittedly the full range of human capability – in music, literature, and art, to name but three – does primarily come under our tutelage, although this obviously doesn’t mean that we are likely to be better at such activities as music-making or music appreciation than non-humanists.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec3-1474022212438754"><title>III</title>
<p>I should like to build the rest of my article around a set of key questions that have preoccupied me for some while, both as a scholar of classical antiquity and as a professor in a liberal arts institution. Admittedly I should have become engrossed in them long ago, but I didn’t. It was hard enough, or so it seemed, to keep the Classics alive rather than bother with the humanities. The Classics, of course, occupies an unusual position within the spectrum of disciplines that belong under the heading of ‘humanities’. On the one hand, they are often the target of attack by those who question the value of learning ‘dead languages’, and on the other they are the flagship of those who regard the values of antiquity, modified to eliminate its most egregious abuses including slavery and sexism, as exemplary of the best that human society has to offer.</p>
<p>The first question concerns the value and purpose of research in the humanities, specifically research undertaken in a liberal arts institution like my own, which is all I have first-hand experience of. Though I see myself as a strong advocate for the undertaking of intellectual inquiry at a level beyond that which is transmissible within the classroom setting, it is not self-evident to me why the liberal arts tradition gives research a central status either in the job description of positions in the humanities or in the criteria for tenure and promotion. This is not to say that I don’t consider research to be vital; rather, to be totally honest, I have difficulty in mounting a completely cogent argument in support of it. Sander <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1474022212438754">Gilman (2000: 5)</xref> writes: ‘Attacks on research in the humanities as “useless” are an attack on the humanities itself.’ And he goes on to note: ‘No such attacks are made against the Social Sciences or Natural Sciences. Indeed, the funding of certain aspects of science as labeled as applied (such as the National Institutes of Health) is higher than ever, even if the science is abstract or basic science.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1474022212438754">3</xref></sup> Gilman was writing over a decade ago, but the ‘attacks on research in the humanities’ have hardly diminished. Indeed the sense of impending doom has, if anything, increased, as Martha <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1474022212438754">Nussbaum (2010)</xref> has demonstrated recently. The increasing emphasis upon ‘public scholarship’ has sharpened the debate as to its usefulness, as well as encouraged some scholars to ponder whether they are under a kind of moral obligation to ‘relate’ their research to the classroom.</p>
<p>This last point raises in turn the question whether teaching and research, particularly when undertaken at a private liberal arts college, have any necessary or implicit bearing upon one another. Are they in dialogue with or in essence independent of one another? And, even more bluntly, are we better teachers if we engage in cutting-edge research – or (a taboo question almost) are we better teachers if we do not? We are at a point in the history of humanistic inquiry and in the history of the liberal arts college when it is important to evaluate what most (but conspicuously not all) faculty take as a given and hold dear: the freedom to devote themselves to research on whatever arcane topic happens to take their fancy. What arguments can we mount for justifying the highly specialized nature of much of the research that is undertaken in the humanities?</p>
<p>Tough question, followed by a quick aside: I don’t have the privilege of supervising graduates, but if I did, I like to believe that I should consider it my duty to contest with them the purpose and purposefulness of their research topic. Graduate programs in the humanities have the responsibility of insuring that those who complete their doctoral degrees stand a fair chance of securing a position in the Academy, and, no less important in my view, of furthering the cause and visibility of the humanities in society as a whole.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1474022212438754">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>To this end, I believe that it would be highly beneficial to the humanities to initiate an open discussion about the nature and purpose of humanistic research. Apart from the hope of making a ‘contribution’ to knowledge, there are two arguments I use to justify – to myself at least – the time and energy that I expend on research. One is that it is an enabling device without whose support I would not be able to perform adequately in the classroom. Doing research helps me to remain alert. It relieves boredom. It engages my mind. It helps me re-think and change my assumptions. It keeps my thinking-part in training. I believe all this to be true. Indeed it would be true, even if I didn’t publish my research. I also believe that some seepage takes place from one’s research into one’s teaching, and that this can be both stimulating and on occasion inspirational for students. I am not suggesting that these arguments constitute an adequate justification for research, however, and I would very much relish a candid discussion on the subject with my colleagues, with a view to closing the gap between humanities scholarship as an ideal good and the public perception of it as an esoteric and self-referential activity.</p>
<p>The second question has to do with syllabi and course offerings. In a world as fast-paced as ours, the dictum ‘knowledge for knowledge’s sake’ has virtually lost all meaning. Students, faculty, and society at large are being confronted with more and more information (definitely not the same thing as knowledge), a phenomenon that requires all of us to be ever more selective about how we fill our memory banks. According to what criteria are we as teachers in the humanities to select what is most likely to be of ‘value’?</p>
<p>This in turn leads to consideration of what constitutes value. When I first entered the liberal arts educational system, I was taken aback by the discovery that knowledge within such a system is anything but treated as value-free. On the contrary, it is freighted heavily with values. The so-called Core Program at Colgate, that is to say that part of the curriculum which all students must take, is undisputedly value-laden, and has, under its current instauration (implemented in the fall of 2011), become more so. It does not merely purport to provide students with a necessary background to the panorama of human inquiry, but, additionally, to equip them with the interpretive tools to become civic-minded – civic-minded, that is, in the terms that a majority of the faculty have laid down or at least agreed to. I remain uneasy about the claim that any set of courses should serve any political agenda, however impeccable and enlightened that agenda might seem to be, for fear they do so at the cost of academic rigor. In fact, every instauration of every Core Program is a political statement of sorts, however much it is couched within the language of idealism.</p>
<p>A further question arises: does the existence of a Core Program, or of any required set of courses, release us in our disciplines to teach whatever we best see fit to teach? Or does it, on the contrary, place us under a comparable if unstated obligation to acknowledge a similarly high-minded ideal whatever we teach? If so, what about the knowledge-for-knowledge’s-sake thing, which in my mind is merely another way of supporting the similarly high-minded ideal of preserving the entirety of human experience? Has this ideal become merely one of many victims of our current budget deficit? And if so, is that something we should fight to reverse? Returning to the subject of values, the biologist and humanist (and presenter of the acclaimed BBC series <italic>The Ascent of Man</italic>) Jacob Bronowski claimed in the early 1970s that moral leadership had passed to the sciences. If we, rather than the scientists, have in our arsenal the language to evaluate values, why are we so consistently otherwise engaged?</p>
<p>My next question has to do with the issue of the role of the humanities in society – a particularly urgent one in an era when economic growth is seen by a majority of politicians as the ultimate goal and when subjects taught are assessed by their usefulness in the job market. How pertinent is it that the humanities should occupy a space within the arena of public debate and, more bluntly, what is it of genuine value that the humanities <italic>in primis</italic> have to offer? Focusing again on my own discipline, the debate between the Founding Fathers over what kind of constitution to establish was conducted by constant reference to classical exemplars that informed and embodied that debate. It was impossible in the age of the Enlightenment to conceive of holding a political debate without citing, evaluating, and seeking to learn from both the failures and successes of the past.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1474022212438754">5</xref></sup> Have the humanities a role of comparable importance to play today and, if so, how are their practitioners to muster the political skills and muscle to take on such a challenge?</p>
<p>Despite all my <italic>caveats</italic>, I remain convinced that the humanities do have such a role, not least via the influence of public intellectuals. Not everyone, of course, is cut out to be a Jean-Paul Sartre, leading protestors down the Champs-Elysées in Paris, or a Bertrand Russell, being arrested for participating in a Civil Nuclear Disarmament demonstration at the age of 89. Such actions are exemplary, though they always run the risk of being driven by narrowly political agendas or by self-promotion. Nor – another option – do I believe that we should try to cozy up to whatever Administration happens to hold office, just as Plato did by seeking to turn Dionysius, tyrant of Syracuse, into a philosopher king. Plato merely antagonized the tyrant and barely escaped with his life: a lesson of sorts. I recently spoke at a conference hosted by the Hauenstein Center for Presidential Studies in Grand Rapids entitled ‘Lessons from Antiquity for the Obama Administration’. It was a challenging, indeed a daunting assignment. Not surprisingly, the chief beneficiary was not the Obama Administration – I have not detected any appreciable shift in foreign affairs since I gave my 30-minute address – but us the participants, in that it made us take seriously the improbable proposition that the Classics, specifically knowledge of the classical world and of classical history, might actually have a useful political role to perform.</p>
<p>Another limiting factor is that only a minority of those who teach in the humanities pursue lines of inquiry that naturally translate into matters of urgent contemporary concern. I increasingly feel uncomfortable, however, in participating in conferences and colloquia if the issues under debate have absolutely no bearing on the quality of human life. This is partly because I myself have benefited so richly from being permitted to engage in my passion without ever being held accountable. For me, it’s payback time. I believe that all of us, as humanists, have a duty to be active in exporting our expertise beyond the gates of the academy. There are several ways in which we can do this, both to the benefit of society and to the health of the humanities. One is to contribute to a popular journal or magazine that reaches the educated reading public. Writing for such a readership can be as challenging as writing for experts. In addition, it may have unexpected benefit for one’s research, not least by making one think afresh about a well-trodden line of inquiry. If, moreover, a subject of research engages one’s attention for several years and yet has no interest for the educated public at large, then there must at least be a question as to whether those years spent were worthwhile. Alternatively one might offer a pro bono course on line for anyone who chooses to sign up for free under a growing number of initiatives, such as the Faculty Project recently posted by Udemy.com (see <italic>Inside Higher Ed</italic>, 12 March 2012).</p>
<p>Another avenue is to engage in outreach to one’s local community by offering introductory courses in one’s area of expertise, tailored to the specific needs and interest of the community – a particularly valuable exercise in rural areas like Upstate New York where I reside; or to explore ways in which a social or political dimension to one’s discipline and research interests might help inform public debate, rather along the lines of the conference on ‘Lessons from Antiquity for the Obama Administration’ that I mentioned earlier.</p>
<p>Yet another avenue is to participate in humanities-related ‘festivals’. One such is the annual Chicago Humanities Festival. This hosts over a hundred events connected to humanities-related disciplines, not only literature, philosophy, and arts and architecture, but also history and public affairs. Even science and technology are included, in cases where they are seen to have a particular connection to the humanities. Another Chicago initiative is called the Public Square, which in the words of its home page ‘fosters debate, dialogue, and exchange of ideas about cultural, social, and political issues with an emphasis on social justice’. Typically the debates take place in coffee shops and barber shops. I think it would be eminently worthwhile in any community of intellectually engaged citizens for humanities faculty to engender debates on similar topics. It might not be inappropriate to consider redefining ‘service’ as the application of knowledge in the service of the public good. In all these ways the humanities have a special part to play. If more of us could commit to having a public, extra-curricular role, we might even stare down the specter of humanistic decline.</p>
<p>In effect I am seeking to recommend a course of action that has its roots in the definition of the highest good or ‘end’ (<italic>telos</italic>) of human life advanced by Aristotle in the <italic>Nicomachean Ethics</italic>. Aristotle argues that for human beings to achieve <italic>eudaimonia</italic> or happiness – what we might call today human flourishing – they need to devote themselves to political science and gain knowledge of the science of laws and institutions. It is not enough to know the good, Aristotle posited. One must also perform good acts. Only that way do humans become morally virtuous. Much of what he says is applicable to the present argument. Those who ‘do’ humanities should actively engage in the common good. It is good for the humanities themselves, as well as good for the soul. Though Aristotle maintained that the ideal of philosophical inquiry is political leadership, since it alone offers the fullest scope for the virtues of character, he also acknowledged that one may devote those same virtues to the good of community or <italic>koinônia</italic> – be it a family or a village.</p>
<p>Humanistic discourse at its best is about building a humane society – a society that is heterogeneous in inclination, pluralistic in composition, and imaginative in essence. I know of no better symbol of this goal than Homer’s description of the encounter that takes place between Achilles and the elderly king Priam of Troy in Book <sc>xxiv</sc> of the <italic>Iliad</italic>. Priam has risked his life passing through the Greek lines so that he can beg for the return of the mutilated body of his son Hektor. In the encounter that follows, Achilles is reminded of his elderly father Peleus, whom he will never see again, and the two weep in each other’s arms, each reduced, or rather elevated, to their essence as father and son, all ethnic divisions swept aside. It is a desperately human encounter. It is about learning to see the world through someone else’s eyes – through the eyes of the person you hate most in the world.</p>
<p>Ciriaco Morón <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1474022212438754">Arroyo (2002: 251)</xref> writes: ‘We vow our highest respect and gratitude towards scientists and towards science and technology. Their theories and artifacts are human efforts, make our lives longer and more comfortable, and are beautiful objects. But the humanities are more important.’ In the end, plain and simple, I tend to agree.</p>

<p>Throughout my three years of service as Division Director of the Humanities, I never once had the opportunity – nor indeed sought it – to engage with my colleagues in a free-flowing discussion about the humanities in the way the Colgate–Emory connection has encouraged me to do. I have taken this opportunity therefore to analyze in very general terms certain key issues that I believe have current bearing on the health and vitality of our shared enterprise as teachers and practitioners of the humanities. I also wish to acknowledge my indebtedness to Jon Jacobs’ article in this issue. Though I disagree with it on a couple of major points, it provided the stimulus for the tentative <italic>entrée</italic> that this article represents.</p>

And thus their original purpose has been perverted or lost.’</p></fn>
<fn id="fn2-1474022212438754"><label>2</label><p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1474022212438754">Jacobs (2008)</xref> offers a forceful defense of the value of a liberal arts education, highly relevant to the present discussion, while also raising concerns about the low esteem in which it is held in some quarters.</p></fn>
<fn id="fn3-1474022212438754"><label>3</label><p>Gilman, not perhaps without a pinch of hyperbole, begins his discussion with the statement: ‘I weep for the future of the humanities for . . . it seems too trivial a thing to acknowledge, and yet its public debasement is a sign and a portent’ (2000: 2). Hype apart, Gilman goes on to a very down-to-earth and practical assessment of the ‘state’ of the humanities, particularly with reference to language teaching.</p></fn>
<fn id="fn4-1474022212438754"><label>4</label><p>Robert <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1474022212438754">Scholes in the Modern Language Association’s 2004</xref> publication of <italic>Profession</italic> predicted a time when there will be so many scholars competing for a decreasing number of publishers that the system will collapse (quoted in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1474022212438754">Aldama, 2008</xref>: 275). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1474022212438754">Scholes suggested that scholarship should be considered ‘in the service of teaching’ (2004: 124)</xref>, a view that deserves a serious hearing.</p></fn>
<fn id="fn5-1474022212438754"><label>5</label><p>Eleanor Maguire and other colleagues at University College London reported in <italic>Science </italic>(19 January 2007) that the neurobiological ability to envision and plan for the future is profoundly connected to our ability to recall and reconstruct the past accurately. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1474022212438754">Turner (2007: 21)</xref> has suggested, ‘If our cultural and educational system works as does our nervous system, the implication is that art’ – and I would add music and literature – ‘produced by artists without a familiar grasp of the human traditions preserved in the humanities will always be thin, transient and trivial’.</p></fn></fn-group></notes>
