<abstract>
<p>Due to the expanding role of pharmacy in health care, it is imperative that pharmacy professionals work together to advocate for the profession. An English-language only literature search was conducted of the PubMed and Medline databases using the key words <italic>advocacy, grassroots, political action committee, lobbying, politics, political action, legislation, letter writing, pharmacy, pharmacist, Capitol Hill</italic>. Up-to-date information regarding pharmacy-specific advocacy was limited and difficult to locate. Information from the literature search was supplemented with interviews of professionals actively engaged in advocacy, personal experience, and Web sites of national pharmacy organizations. This primer ignites the fire for political advocacy within pharmacy professionals by reinforcing the significant impact that advocacy has on the profession and by providing information on how to become involved. The primer provides a comprehensive “pocket guide” of resources combined into an easy-to-use reference for pharmacy professionals and outlines a structured approach on how to become a pharmacy advocate, ranging from a minimal level of involvement to master political activist, and to promote interest among pharmacy professionals to become more engaged with advocacy. Even a small act of advocacy or volunteerism can transform a spark into a raging fire.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>“It does not require a majority to prevail, but rather an irate, tireless minority keen to set brush fires in people’s minds.” As Samuel Adams, an American revolutionary and organizer of the Boston Tea Party, inspired the American people with this quotation, we hope to ignite a similar fire within the pharmacy profession to become politically active. As the world of health care rapidly evolves, so must we as pharmacy professionals and continue to make our voices heard. Although we learn how to advocate for our patients, many (if not most) pharmacy professionals are never formally taught how to advocate for our profession.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0897190013482333">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0897190013482333">2</xref>
</sup> We reviewed the primary literature only to find a dismal amount of current information regarding political advocacy in the pharmacy arena; one article referenced the use of telegrams.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0897190013482333">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0897190013482333">4</xref>
</sup> The available information was spread across various pharmacy organizations, Web sites, and disciplines. Often, the tips and advices given were specific to an area of pharmacy instead of the entire profession, making it difficult to locate and apply. In an attempt to remedy this disparity, this primer was created to provide a unique “pocket guide” of resources and tips (gathered from these various places) and combined into an easy-to-use and convenient reference for all pharmacy professionals. Content of the primer was supplemented with pearls gained during interviews of pharmacists and pharmacy lobbyists involved in political advocacy and legislation (or the experts in the area) and personal experience with advocacy. It is written from a new practitioner’s perspective; however, the talking points are applicable to anyone in the pharmacy profession, including student pharmacists, pharmacy technicians, and seasoned pharmacists. The goal of this primer is to provide a structured approach on how to become an advocate, ranging from the least time consuming and minimal level of involvement to master level advocate. Whether you are just kindling your interest in advocacy or tending to an existing fire, this resource will provide more fuel to set your political brushfire ablaze.</p>
<p>Advocacy at the very core is about speaking up for something that you believe in. Therefore, as a pharmacy professional, being an advocate for the profession means standing up for the idea that pharmacy has a great deal to offer the health care industry and patients alike. Advocacy is often thought of as persuasion, but at it's core, advocacy revolves around education. The simple fact is that legislators, and the general public, may be naive to all the services that pharmacists can provide, which would help to improve patient health and outcomes. The pharmacy profession risks not progressing with the times and falling by the wayside of health care changes. Consequently, we need to unify our voice and demonstrate our integral contribution to the health care system. As individuals we may not be heard, but as a unified group, we can make our presence known.</p>
<p>This unified approach has been effective for other disciplines including nurses who sparked change within their profession, reengineered their practice model, and obtained provider status as nurse practitioners.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0897190013482333">5</xref>
</sup> By following similar steps, the pharmacy profession can advance pharmacists as providers. Currently, there is a void that exists in pharmacy advocacy that needs to be addressed. By offering simple and time-sensitive suggestions to help become involved, the hope is that in the future the pharmacy profession will become one unified voice for change. Complacency does not create change, nor will it lead to pharmacist provider status.</p>

<title>How Does It Affect My Tuesday?</title>
<p>In the last session of Congress, of the 535 members (100 Senate, 435 House of Representatives), there was not a single pharmacist.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0897190013482333">3</xref>
</sup> This statistic further highlights the need for pharmacy to have a seat at the table as changes in pharmacy regulations will happen with or without our profession’s input.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0897190013482333">6</xref>
</sup> The congressional representatives may not be aware of the responsibilities of a pharmacy professional or how a particular law may affect our practice. For instance, if a senator with a background in business is voting on legislation that increases the Food and Drug Administration’s authority over the manufacturing of nutritional supplements, they may not have adequate knowledge to understand how it affects patient care and safety, even though they may understand the business behind it. Ultimately, elected officials want to be educated about our field and need expert knowledge in order to make well-informed decisions. Therefore, pharmacists need to be willing and able to share their expertise on decisions that will affect future practice. In a conversation with seasoned pharmacy political advocate, Mark Boesen, PharmD, JD (February 2012), a concise yet important question surfaced, “When legislation is proposed, ask yourself, how does this affect my Tuesday?” In other words, how will this change my practice on a daily basis if this legislation is passed?</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0897190013482333">
<title>Practice the Golden Rule</title>
<p>It is important to understand that legislation is influenced by many factors including state agencies, legislators, third-party interest groups, and constituents.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0897190013482333">7</xref>
</sup> Pharmacists have the unique opportunity in their daily patient interactions to have a direct impact on each of these 4 groups. The easiest way to promote the profession of pharmacy is to simply take good care of your patients. Most people do not realize that many laws have been initiated based simply on legislators’ personal experiences. Even one unpleasant interaction with a patient can lead to the creation of legislation that may directly impact (and restrict) our profession.</p>
<p>For example, a state representative asked a pharmacist whether he could fax advanced copies of prescriptions for his sick family member to save the pharmacist time. He promised that he would bring the original hard copy prescriptions in when he picked up the medications. He understood the rules and was simply trying to save time for himself and the pharmacist as the medications were urgent and the pharmacy was closing soon. However, the pharmacist denied the request stating that patients who faxed prescriptions from home were engaged in an illegal act. Consequently, the representative proposed and passed a bill that required pharmacies to accept faxed prescriptions from patients, although the patient is still required to bring in the hard copy prescription prior to delivery.</p>
<p>Even if your patients are not members of the state legislature or the US Congress, all patients are constituents that can bend the ear of their legislators. By the same token, leaving a good impression on a patient might inspire legislation that could expand pharmacists’ scope of practice. It is as simplistic as what we learned in elementary school: “Treat others as you wish to be treated.” The Golden Rule applies to pharmacy as well.</p>
<sec id="section4-0897190013482333">
<title>Step 1: Kindling the Fire</title>
<p>Whether you are new to the idea of political advocacy and just want to get your feet wet, or you are ready to go to Capitol Hill, there are many options to become more involved. Becoming a member of your state and at least one national pharmacy association are the first steps you can take to ignite your political connection. Coming together as a large group of pharmacists produces the greatest impact and the loudest voice to promote the interests of our profession. Furthermore, many pharmacy organizations utilize lobbyists and employees that dedicate their time to identifying new legislation that affects our profession. Membership in these organizations provides time-saving and convenient access to current political topics, specifically those relevant to the profession of pharmacy. Membership information can be found on your state pharmacy organization Web site. An electronic link to each state organization can be found at the National Alliance of State Pharmacy Associations (NASPA) Web site or the relevant State Board of Pharmacy Web site linked via the National Association of Boards of Pharmacy (NABP; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0897190013482333">Table 1</xref>).<sup>

</sup> On a national level, there are several different umbrella and specialty organizations to join including the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists (ASHP) and the American Pharmacists Association (APhA) among others (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0897190013482333">Table 1</xref>).<sup>

</sup> Much like state organizations, a portion of your annual membership dues in national organizations go toward supporting lobbyists to advocate for our profession. These organizations provide the kindling to ignite your political advocacy flames.</p>

<title>Step 2: Fueling the Fire</title>
<p>If you are already a member of your state and national pharmacy organization and want to intensify your involvement in political advocacy, you can fuel the fire by (1) identifying your elected representatives and (2) communicating with them via e-mail, letter, telephone, and in person. Several electronic and published resources can be used to determine your local, state, and national representatives (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0897190013482333">Table 1</xref>).<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0897190013482333">15</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0897190013482333"/>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0897190013482333"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0897190013482333">18</xref>
</sup> These resources provide extended contact information, links to each representative’s personal Web site, and a brief political profile summary.</p>
<p>Once you have identified your representatives, there are many different ways with which to communicate. Nothing gets legislators moving more than contact from their constituents; ultimately, your vote is important for their reelection. Contacting your legislators may be intimidating initially, but with experience your comfort level will increase.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0897190013482333">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0897190013482333">3</xref>
</sup> Sending a letter or an e-mail is a great way to start communicating with your representatives. As you become more comfortable, you may wish to speak with your representative via telephone or in person. Remember, you are the drug expert and legislators want to hear your opinion in order to make proper decisions. By contacting them with your concerns, you are helping them to become more informed about the topic, and, more importantly, more educated on the valuable role of the pharmacist in health care.</p>
<p>Being part of a LISTSERV for legislative matters serves as a great prompt to know when is the most beneficial time to contact your representative regarding pending issues. These lists are used by pharmacy organizations to notify members that participation is needed regarding important legislation.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0897190013482333">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0897190013482333">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0897190013482333">20</xref>
</sup> Many organizations will also provide template letters or e-mails that summarize the concern or support for a particular matter.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0897190013482333">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0897190013482333">20</xref>
</sup> Although these template letters can be useful in educating legislators (and yourself) about the organization’s opinion on an issue, be mindful that most legislators receive a myriad of letters and e-mails like these each day and may only give it a cursory glance. Personalized e-mails, however, carry a greater weight with legislators, causing them to pay closer attention to an issue if they receive several personal e-mails from constituents in their district. Sharing personal information in your e-mail concerning how the proposed bill would directly affect you and your experience in pharmacy proves to be substantially more efficacious than template letters. Anecdotes can make or break a new policy initiative advancing through the legislative process. Furthermore, emphasizing your ability to care for their constituents (your patients) weighs heavily on legislators’ support of the bill. When writing a letter or e-mail, ensure you briefly identify yourself including your name, address, and zip code; the proposed bill or legislative issue; your concern or support; and how it affects you.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0897190013482333">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0897190013482333">19</xref>

</sup> Phone conversations follow a similar protocol.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0897190013482333">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0897190013482333">21</xref>
</sup> Keep your phone conversations concise; 2 to 3 minutes is an appropriate duration. Boesen, PharmD, JD, recommends to program the telephone numbers and e-mail addresses of your state and national legislators into your contact lists (oral communication, February 2012). This way, when issues arise or if prompted by a LISTSERV, you will be prepared to contact your representative with ease. Whichever method of communication you chose, it is imperative in every interaction with a legislator to request a specific action, be it their support, cosigning, or opposition of a bill. <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-0897190013482333">Appendix A</xref>. provides a sample letter that can be used for correspondence with legislators.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0897190013482333">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0897190013482333">20</xref>
</sup> During an interview with pharmacy lobbyist Jeff Gray (February 2012) he reflected, “Emotions reign in politics; a personal story has a more powerful and memorable impact than data.”</p>
<p>Another important way to be involved politically at an intermediate level is to make a donation to a political action committee (PAC), which is a part of most state and national organizations.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0897190013482333">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0897190013482333">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0897190013482333">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0897190013482333">23</xref>
</sup> The PACs utilize donations from their members to sponsor political candidates who need support from the community. This is a great way for state and national political candidates to see pharmacists as a united group made up of many of their constituents. Perhaps, the best way to make a donation is during your annual dues renewal. This can be accomplished by simply marking your donation to the PAC as a separate line item. Many pharmacists may be hesitant to donate because they cannot make a “sizeable” donation; however, it is important to emphasize that no donation is too small.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0897190013482333">24</xref>
</sup> Consider contributing an hour of your base salary or even skipping your latte for the day and donating $5.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0897190013482333">25</xref>
</sup> Minimally, if every pharmacy professional gave just $1 to the PAC, this would raise contributions sizably and could help advance the pharmacy agenda in health care.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0897190013482333">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0897190013482333">26</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Attending a PAC breakfast, luncheon, or dinner at a state or national meeting is an alternate way of donating to a PAC. These events can range in cost from $25 per student pharmacist to $100 for pharmacists as a direct donation to the PAC and include a meal, keynote speakers, and networking opportunities in an intimate forum. Often, the speakers are current or former state or national legislators that offer a unique insight into their political world. These events allow you, as an individual, to communicate one on one with the speaker before or after the event, as most organizations budget time to accommodate personal interaction.</p>
<p>Ultimately, donations to your respective organizations have a significant impact. Pharmacy lobbyist Gray summarizes, “Making donations to a PAC isn’t nefarious or uncouth. It is simply a way for an organization or group of people who share a particular interest to get their name out there” (oral communication, February 2012). The PAC donations are a way to support candidates and show that pharmacy has a vested interest in promoting their practice.</p>

<title>Step 3: Fortify the Fire</title>
<p>For those who are more politically savvy, there are many other areas in which you can become involved. The most important part of advocating at a high level is to be informed on the issues. Familiarizing yourself with current legislation is the best way to do this. All proposed bills are listed in their entirety on the US Congress Web sites <italic>www.senate.gov</italic> and <italic>www.house.gov</italic> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0897190013482333">Table 1</xref>).<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0897190013482333">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0897190013482333">28</xref>
</sup> Reviewing legislation in raw form may appear daunting and time consuming, but there are several resources that can be used to make it more convenient. Web sites like <italic>www.govtrack.us</italic> and <italic>thomas.loc.gov</italic> are user friendly and provide summaries of the US Congress proposed bills in lay language (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0897190013482333">Table 1</xref>).<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0897190013482333">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0897190013482333">30</xref>
</sup> Individuals may also sign up to receive complementary electronic alerts on proposed federal regulations and comment on the proposed rule at the Federal Register (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0897190013482333">Table 1</xref>).<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0897190013482333">31</xref>
</sup> In addition to federal legislation, you should also be aware of legislation on a state level. All state bills may be found on your respective state legislature’s Web site. You can find your state’s Web site via the National Conference of State Legislatures <italic>www.ncsl.org</italic> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0897190013482333">Table 1</xref>).<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0897190013482333">32</xref>
</sup> Your state pharmacy association’s Web site may also provide more user-friendly information that affects your local community (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0897190013482333">Table 1</xref>).<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0897190013482333">8</xref>
</sup> Adding these universal resource locators (URLs; bookmarked” Web sites) to your list of favorites on your personal computers or smart phones enhances accessibility and allows you to remain current with legislation.</p>
<p>Volunteering your time on your state association’s Legislative Committee is another opportunity to actively engage in the political advocacy process. These committees generally meet once a month and discuss upcoming elections, proposed bills, and lobbying efforts. They also determine the state association’s position on proposed bills, including which bills to support, amend, or oppose. Legislative committees are in need of pharmacists with varied expertise who can provide insight on how the bill might impact their unique practice site. For example, a bill focused on compounding pharmacy would be best evaluated by a compounding pharmacist. By offering your expertise to the state association, you make a valuable contribution to your profession and to the legal system. These same concepts help shape national advocacy position statements and may be further strengthened by participation in national pharmacy organizations’ policy-making bodies.</p>
<p>An important step in becoming a seasoned political advocate is face-to-face interaction with your legislators. Participating in your state’s pharmacy legislative day or “lobby day” can promote confidence and ease in talking with your legislators.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0897190013482333">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0897190013482333">34</xref>
</sup> The state pharmacy association and sometimes colleges of pharmacy may organize these events. In Arizona, for example, the state pharmacy association and the Arizona schools of pharmacy host Pharmacy Day at the Capitol. During this event, several booths are set up to educate legislators on the daily responsibilities of a pharmacist, offer immunizations, and perform health screenings. This environment serves as a less intimidating and a more personal way to “get your feet wet” discussing topics with legislators and their staff. Although this event often centers on student pharmacists, new practitioners and pharmacists are encouraged to participate. If you are interested in participating in a similar event, contact your state association to find out when the next pharmacy legislative day is happening in your state. National pharmacy organizations also host similar events throughout the year at the US Capitol in Washington, DC.</p>
<p>Scheduling individual meetings provide another opportunity for personal interaction with your legislators. This can be an intimidating task for anyone, even a veteran of the political process; however, there are many steps you can take to alleviate any feelings of apprehension.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0897190013482333">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0897190013482333">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0897190013482333">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0897190013482333">36</xref>
</sup> Before embarking on an individual meeting with a legislator, contact a fellow pharmacist familiar with the process who can coach you through the etiquette associated with this type of meeting. Certain rules apply regarding how to sign in, what to wear, and how to address individuals that may not be commonplace.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0897190013482333">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0897190013482333">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0897190013482333">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0897190013482333">36</xref>
</sup> Another option is to use the buddy system for your first few meetings. Partnering with a colleague who has experience affords you the opportunity to witness the appropriate etiquette as the meeting unfolds and the types of questions being asked.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0897190013482333">2</xref>
</sup> If you are meeting on behalf of an organization or a program, there will often be a designated person with experience in this area to guide you.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0897190013482333">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0897190013482333">36</xref>
</sup> Kelly Ridgway, RPh, a state pharmacy organization executive familiar with the process, reflected on when she first began her political advocacy career (oral communication, February 2012). “When you are going to meet with a legislator, testify at a hearing, or attend a fundraiser for the first time it is important to understand that there is a proper process and etiquette for each situation. Having somebody who can prepare you ahead of time can take the stress away and give you more confidence so that an awkward moment does not interfere with the message you are trying to convey to the legislator.” Most importantly, remember that legislators are just ordinary people. You are the expert in your field and your legislators are hoping you will provide much needed insight on an issue with which they are unfamiliar.</p>
<p>These same concepts are applicable if participating in a town hall meeting or campaign fundraiser. Legislators use town hall meetings to hear from their constituents, and it provides you, as a pharmacy professional, with another venue to educate them about issues that affect pharmacy practice.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0897190013482333">19</xref>
</sup> If you receive an invitation on behalf of your state or national pharmacy organization’s PAC to attend a campaign fundraiser for a legislative candidate that the organization is supporting, you may be asked to drop off a contribution from the pooled resources of the PAC. Again, you can use this venue to further educate policy makers on the roles that pharmacists play in caring for patients.<sup>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>As this primer has demonstrated, political advocacy is a simple process that has a huge impact on our profession. Ultimately, the biggest barrier to getting involved is ourselves. As pharmacy professionals, we have a professional obligation to advocate not only for our patients but also for ourselves. By engaging in political advocacy and knowing what and how legislative decisions are being made, we can further promote our profession in the ever-changing world of health care. It is this unified advocacy that will ignite change in the profession and promote pharmacists as providers. The Pharmacy Advocacy Toolkit (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0897190013482333">Table 1</xref>) summarizes helpful Web sites and resources to spark your political advocacy desire.<sup>
