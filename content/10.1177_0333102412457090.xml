<p><italic>Background:</italic> Migraine is a prevalent neurological disorder with a complex genetic background characterized by recurrent episodes of headache. The disease is subclassified into migraine with aura (MA) and migraine without aura (MO). Many association studies have been performed to date to identify genetic risk variants for common migraine, most of them focusing on selected candidate genes, with variable and often inconsistent results. Recently, a clinic-based genome-wide association study for migraine reported a functionally relevant risk variant (SNP rs1835740), involved in glutamate homeostasis, which showed a significant association with MA. We aimed to replicate this finding in a clinic-based study of a Spanish cohort with MA and MO patients.</p>

<sec id="sec1-0333102412457090" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Migraine is an episodic neurological disorder that affects between 10% and 20% of the population, being around three times more prevalent in women than in men (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0333102412457090">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0333102412457090">2</xref>). Common forms of migraine present a complex genetic basis, with heritability values ranging from 33% to 57% and the likely participation of multiple genes that interact with environmental factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0333102412457090">1</xref>). The International Classification of Headache Disorders (ICHD) distinguishes two clinical forms of the disorder: migraine with aura (MA) and migraine without aura (MO). Both presentations share clinical features such as the presence of recurrent headaches, generally accompanied by photophobia, phonophobia, nausea and aggravation by physical activity. They are distinguished by the presence of aura, characterized by transient neurological symptoms that accompany the headache.</p>
<p>Genetic studies in migraine include genome-wide hypothesis-free approaches that aim to identify new susceptibility variants. To date, three genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have reported four variants associated with common migraine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0333102412457090">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0333102412457090"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0333102412457090">5</xref>).</p>
<p>The first risk variant, rs1835740G &gt; A (8q22), was identified in the European population in a clinic-based study carried out by the International Headache Genetics Consortium (IHGC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0333102412457090">3</xref>) in 2731 migraine cases and 10,747 controls from three countries, and replicated in four additional population cohorts, with a genome-wide significant overall meta-analysis <italic>p-</italic>value of 1.69 × 10<sup>−11</sup>. The ‘MA only’ group, including individuals that had suffered MA but not MO episodes, displayed the most significant association, as compared with the ‘Both MA and MO’ and ‘MO only’ groups. SNP rs1835740 is located near the <italic>MTDH</italic> gene (<italic>AEG-1, 3D3, LYRIC</italic>), encoding metadherin, and the <italic>CPQ</italic> gene (<italic>PGCP</italic>, <italic>LDP</italic>), encoding carboxypeptidase Q, both involved in the homeostasis of glutamate. eQTL analysis suggested that this genetic variation is a <italic>cis</italic>-regulator of <italic>MTDH</italic> expression in lymphoblastoid cell lines, with higher transcript levels associated with the risk allele (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0333102412457090">3</xref>). MTDH downregulates <italic>SLC1A2</italic> (<italic>EAAT2, GLT-1</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0333102412457090">6</xref>), encoding the solute carrier family 1 (glial high affinity glutamate transporter), member 2, thus leading to accumulation of glutamate in the synaptic cleft and potentially enhancing cortical spreading depression (CSD), the underlying mechanism of migraine aura (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0333102412457090">7</xref>).</p>
<p>Recently, three additional variants, rs2651899 (<italic>PRDM16</italic>, PR domain containing 16), rs10166942 (<italic>TRPM8</italic>, transient receptor potential cation channel, subfamily M, member 8) and rs11172113 (<italic>LRP1</italic>, low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1), were identified as nominally significant in a population-based GWAS from the Women’s Genome Health Study, consisting of around 5000 migraineur women and a control group of 18,000 non-migraineur women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0333102412457090">4</xref>). Interestingly, these single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) met genome-wide significance in a meta-analysis combining the discovery cohort and three replication sets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0333102412457090">4</xref>): the Dutch Genetic Epidemiology of Migraine study (GEM), the German Study of Health in Pomerania (SHIP) and the IHGC discovery stage cohort used in the first migraine GWAS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0333102412457090">3</xref>). None of the three associations was preferential for MA or MO. <italic>LRP1</italic> modulates neuronal glutamate signalling, whereas <italic>TRPM8</italic> has been related to neuropathic pain.</p>
<p>Finally, a meta-analysis of migraine GWAS was performed in a population-based study of six European cohorts, by the Dutch–Icelandic migraine genetics consortium (DICE), which included &gt;2000 cases and &gt;8000 controls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0333102412457090">5</xref>). No genome-wide significant association was found, although 32 SNPs reached a <italic>p-</italic>value below 1 × 10<sup>−5</sup>. A replication study with a selection of 19 of these SNPs in two Dutch and one Australian cohort did not show any association.</p>
<p>We aimed to replicate the results of the only reported migraine GWAS that focuses on clinic-based samples, which rendered the first variant associated with common forms of migraine. We applied a clinic-based case-control association study design to test the rs1835740 SNP in a Spanish cohort of 1521 patients and 1379 non-migraineur controls.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-0333102412457090" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title>
<p>The sample consists of 1521 Caucasian Spanish patients (78.2% women) and 1379 ethnically-matched migraine-free controls (79.2% women), recruited after a direct clinical interview and a physical exam at Hospital Universitari Vall d’Hebron (Barcelona, Spain), Hospital Sant Joan de Déu (Manresa, Barcelona, Spain) and at Fundación Pública Galega de Medicina Xenómica (Santiago de Compostela, Spain) between 2002 and 2010. According to the International Classification for Headache Disorders: 2nd edition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0333102412457090">8</xref>), patients were classified as MO (<italic>n</italic> = 951, 62.5%) or MA (<italic>n</italic> = 570, 37.5%). The average age at assessment was 41 years (standard deviation, SD = 14.12; range 5 to 86) for patients and 55 years (SD = 16.85; range 19 to 96) for controls. The study was approved by the local ethics committees and informed consent was obtained from all the participants or their legal representatives according to the Helsinki Declaration.</p>
<p>DNA was extracted from peripheral blood lymphocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0333102412457090">9</xref>). Genotyping of the rs1835740 SNP was performed with a Taqman® SNP Genotyping Assay (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). Three CEPH samples were included in every plate and a 100% concordance with HapMap data was observed.</p>
<p>Power calculation for analysis under a dominant model, α = 0.05, lifetime risk of 1.3, disease prevalence of 0.15 and minor allele frequency (MAF) found in controls (0.241), performed with Genetic Power Calculator (pngu.mgh.harvard.edu/∼purcell/gpc) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0333102412457090">10</xref>), displayed values of 95.5% in the MO group, 87.2% in the MA group and 98.5% in the ‘All migraine’ group. Statistical analysis for the association study was carried out using the SNPassoc R library (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0333102412457090">11</xref>). First, Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) was tested in our control sample, which was found to be in equilibrium (<italic>p</italic> = 0.12). Then, both allele and genotype frequencies were compared between cases and controls, considering codominant, dominant, recessive, overdominant and log-additive models and adjusting by sex. Three main phenotypic groups were considered in the analysis: MO, MA and ‘All migraine’. Additionally, in order to better match the comparisons performed in the original GWAS that we aimed to replicate, the MA group was divided into two subcategories: ‘MA only’, which includes MA patients that suffered mostly MA episodes, and ‘Both MA and MO’, including MA patients that suffered MA and MO episodes.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec3-0333102412457090" sec-type="results"><title>Results and discussion</title>
<p>The present study did not find association between the SNP rs1835740 and any of the clinical groups tested in our cohort, which included ‘All migraine’, MO, MA and the subdivisions of the MA group in ‘MA only’ and ‘Both MA and MO’. The clinical stratification of the analysis is relevant given the varying proportion of the different clinical subgroups in our study (37.5% MA, 62.5% MO) with respect to the cohorts of the original GWAS (only MA in the discovery sample; 0%–84.8% MA and 15.2%–100% MO in the replication samples). The analyses included allele comparisons and also genotype tests under codominant, recessive, dominant, log-additive and overdominant models (see the main results in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0333102412457090">Table 1</xref>). The lowest <italic>p-</italic>value, clearly not significant, was achieved between the MO group and the non-migraineur controls (<italic>p</italic> = 0.15), and the highest <italic>p-</italic>value (<italic>p</italic> = 0.96) corresponded to the MA group, in contrast with the results reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0333102412457090">3</xref>), where the best association was seen in MA rather than in other clinical groups.

</table-wrap></p>
<p>Several reasons may explain the discrepant results between our study and the original one by Anttila et al.: 1) Differences in the study design: first, in the original GWAS, the male:female ratio was different in cases (1:4) and controls (1:1), whereas in our study it was approximately 1:4 in the two groups; second, the controls in the present study were negative for migraine history, whereas they were population-based in the original work; third, the MAF values reported in the two studies are comparable for the cases, but they differ in controls; and fourth, sample size is larger in the GWAS (about 6000 cases and 50,000 controls) compared with the present study (1500 cases and 1300 controls), although the statistical power of our sample exceeds 87%. 2) It is also possible that, the original association being correct, the rs1835740 may not be the actual susceptibility variant, although the fact that it seems to be functionally relevant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0333102412457090">3</xref>) and its definition as a singleton SNP according to CEU HapMap data (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.hapmap.org">www.hapmap.org</ext-link>, release #28) work against this possibility. 3) Finally, the associated genetic variant may exert population-specific effects depending on genetic/epigenetic background or variable environmental exposures.</p>
<p>Although divergent from the original GWAS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0333102412457090">3</xref>), our results are in line with previous attempts to replicate the initial finding. Thus, a GWAS in a population-based cohort of migraineurs from the Women’s Genome Health Study failed to identify association of rs1835740 with overall migraine (<italic>p</italic> = 0.22) nor with MA or MO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0333102412457090">4</xref>). The inspection of SNPs covering the entire genomic region did not reach locus-wide significance either. In a second GWAS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0333102412457090">5</xref>), rs1835740 and two nearby SNPs (rs982502, rs2436046) did not show significant association with migraine in a meta-analysis of six cohorts (<italic>p</italic> = 0.64). An association study of SNPs within the <italic>CPQ</italic> and <italic>MTDH</italic> genes, located proximal and distal from rs1835740, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0333102412457090">Figure 1</xref>), identified a gene-based association with <italic>MTDH</italic> that overcame the Bonferroni correction for multiple testing (<italic>p</italic> = 0.002) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0333102412457090">5</xref>). Furthermore, the Dutch replication cohort inspected in the original GWAS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0333102412457090">3</xref>) also displayed negative results (<italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.25 with ‘All migraine’, ‘MA only’ and ‘Both MA and MO’), whereas there was association in the combined discovery sample from Germany, Finland and the Netherlands (<italic>p</italic> = 5.38e-09, ‘All migraine’), and nominal associations in three out of four replication samples (<italic>p</italic>-values between 0.010 and 0.038, with different migraine phenotypes). Finally, a recent study tested pre-existing genotype data from one of the replication cohorts of the original GWAS for association between rs1835740 and several clinical features of MA, displaying non-significant results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0333102412457090">12</xref>).

<p>It is possible that the discordant results of the studies by Chasman et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0333102412457090">4</xref>) and Ligthart et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0333102412457090">5</xref>) with respect to the first migraine GWAS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0333102412457090">3</xref>) may relate to differences in migraine ascertainment, as the original study used a clinic-based cohort, whereas the subsequent works focused on migraineurs from the general population. In this regard, our study is the only one that uses a clinic-based cohort to inspect the genome-wide association signal on rs1835740, with negative results. The patient samples, as described above, were recruited from three Spanish hospitals, and the controls, originating from the same geographical areas as the patients, were screened for migraine and lacked any family history of migraine in their first degree relatives.</p>
<p>In sum, although the association described between rs1835740 and MA in the original clinic-based GWAS remains a robust finding, sustained by a meta-analysis in seven cohorts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0333102412457090">3</xref>), our study displays a clear negative result in the Spanish population. The in-depth inspection of the <italic>MTDH</italic> genomic region in other clinic-based cohorts is warranted to gain more insight into the possible involvement of this gene in migraine.</p>
