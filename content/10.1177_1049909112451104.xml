<p>JH is a 93-year-old male who was admitted with a massive intracerebral bleed. He is currently on mechanical ventilation and is comatose off all sedatives. He has no corneal reflex but has a mild cough and decorticate posturing with noxious stimuli.</p>
<p>The patient’s son was at one time the patient’s power of attorney (POA). However, JH revoked this and granted POA to one of his hired caregivers after the son attempted to have him admitted to a nursing home over a year ago.</p>
<p>At present, the POA demands a feeding tube and continued aggressive treatment. The son states the patient would never have wanted to have his life artificially prolonged and wants life support terminated and “comfort measures” instituted. The POA claims that the son is acting out of expedience and for his inheritance; the son states the POA is acting out of self-interest as he is being paid by JH as long as JH lives.</p>
<p>Neurology feels no return to sapient existence is possible, although the electroencephalography (EEG) was relatively unremarkable. Neurosurgery has nothing to add, and a GI consult for a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube is pending. The hospitalist feels further aggressive treatment would be futile and that no significant quality of life can be salvaged.</p>
<p>An ethics consult is requested.</p>

<title>Legal Perspective</title>
<p>
<italic>Submitted by</italic> Russell W. Adkins, JD</p>
<p>Health care providers are said to observe the maxim of “first do no harm.” I suggest that the lawyer’s maxim should be to “first read the statute.” If state law and hospital policy are silent, general principles of patient autonomy and medical futility can provide guidance.</p>
<p>In its 1990 Cruzan decision (Cruzan v. Director, Missouri Dept. Of Health, 497 US 261 (1990)), the US Supreme Court recognized an individual’s constitutional right to refuse medical treatment. The court further assumed, without directly deciding, that a competent person has a constitutionally protected right to refuse hydration and nutrition. The majority opinion observed that this right to refuse treatment must be exercised on behalf of incompetent patients, if at all, by some surrogate.</p>
<p>Soon after the Cruzan decision, Congress passed the Patient’s Self-Determination Act (PSDA) in 1990. The PSDA requires all hospitals to maintain written policies and procedures concerning advance directives. Shortly after passage of the PSDA, most states enacted legislation authorizing living wills, health care POAs, and other advance directives. The priority of surrogate decision making is determined by the law of each individual state. Generally, absent judicial appointment of a conservator or guardian, a health care agent appointed by such an instrument has priority over any other decision makers.</p>
<p>JH has selected his caretaker as his surrogate. Assuming that the POA document is valid under state law, the agent’s authority is binding. JH’s providers need not consider the motives or qualifications of the various decision makers. The caretaker has legal authority to direct JH’s treatment, even to the exclusion of family members. JH’s health care providers are bound to honor those directions as if JH were competent and speaking for himself.</p>
<p>Under the facts presented, though, the inquiry does not end with identification of the patient representative. This case illustrates the sometimes conflicting interests of patient autonomy and biomedical ethics. When a patient or patient representative insists upon medically futile treatment, health care providers face a difficult ethical and legal dilemma. According to Principle 2.035 of the American Medical Association (AMA) Code of Ethics, a physician is not required to deliver care that has “no reasonable chance of benefitting the patient.”</p>
<p>There is no federal law or standard defining a provider’s obligations to provide medically futile treatment. Some states permit providers to withhold futile care, even when the patient or patient representative demands it. However, there is no uniform definition of medical futility.</p>
<p>Once again, providers should first look to state law and facility policy. Either may define a process for handling futility disputes. Absent legislative or policy direction, the process outlined by the AMA Council on Ethical and Judicial Affairs provides a good starting point. In 1999, the Council proposed a 6-step process for handling futility cases. The committee’s recommendation is designed to resolve disputes through a fair process, rather than relying upon external definitions and criteria. The committee proposes the following steps:</p>
<list list-type="order">
<list-item>
<p>Before the patient becomes critically ill, attempts should be made to reach an understanding between the patient, the proxy, and the physician about what constitutes futile care for the patient and what care falls within acceptable limits for those involved.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Decisions should be made jointly at the bedside between the patient or proxy and the physician.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>An individual consultant or patient representative may help facilitate discussion to mediate any controversy.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>If differences cannot be resolved, an institutional ethics committee may become involved.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>If the institutional process coincides with the patient’s desires, but the physician remains unpersuaded, arrangements may be made for transfer to another physician within the institution. If the outcome coincides with the physician’s position but the patient or proxy remains unpersuaded, arrangements for transfer to another facility may be sought.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>If no physician or institution can be found to follow the wishes of the patient or proxy due to medical and professional standards, the intervention need not be provided.</p>
</list-item>
</list>
<p>This process involves all parties, provides a fair opportunity for all viewpoints to be considered, and emphasizes the power of consensus. In the unfortunate event of resulting litigation, most courts would likely defer to the decisions of professionals who adhere to professional and ethical standards as articulated by their professional organizations</p>

<title>Ethics Perspective</title>
<p>
<italic>Submitted by</italic> Matt Stolick, PhD</p>
<p>This is a case of overriding a decision made by a surrogate when that decision conflicts with the best interests of the patient for whom she or he is making that decision. Really the son has nothing to do with this case in light of the central ethical issue: to honor or not to honor the request of the legal surrogate. Given the assumption that treatment would be futile without significant quality of life, the burden of proof is on the POA here to give his or her reason for requesting feeding tube and continued aggressive treatment. This request and strategy is inconsistent with a judgment that such treatment would be futile.</p>
<p>There is no professional duty to provide futile treatment and arguably a duty to never provide futile treatment (even in cases where no major harm is done in the process). It is unfortunate that JH did not put anything in writing a year ago in addition to naming a new POA.</p>
<p>A living will would be helpful in this case to strengthen the argument for or against the feeding tube and further aggressive treatment. Using practical reasoning, treating aggressively a 93-year-old man who has a poor prognosis seems foolish and an act of denial.</p>
<p>Were I on the ethics committee I would recommend that the POA be talked with, reasoned with in a nonconfrontational way with the key question being one requesting the reason or reasons for the request of further aggressive treatment. These reasons are to basically explain how further aggressive treatment serves the interests of this 93-year-old person. The prognosis can be once again made clear to the POA. If the POA persists then I would suggest taking legal action to override this POA decision, looking to name another surrogate to decide for JH.</p>
<p>Given that the son’s power to decide was revoked by a competent JH a year ago, I would suggest that out of respect for JH and his autonomy we should have a guardian named to represent his interests in this case. For the son in this case, I think this would be an acceptable alternative to the current POA dictating care.</p>

<title>Physician’s Perspective</title>
<p>
<italic>Submitted by</italic> Gregg VandeKieft, MD, MA</p>
<p>Many perspectives come into play in JH’s case. From a medical perspective, he is comatose and likely to remain so long term. Even if he emerges from his coma, it remains highly unlikely that he will ever meaningfully perceive or interact with his surrounding environment. Maintaining biological life is certainly possible, as there is literature supporting the effectiveness of feeding tubes in prolonging life in comatose patients, but it will just as certainly be fraught with caregiving challenges—for example, tracheostomy and feeding tube care and high risk of decubitus ulcers and aspiration pneumonia. From a legal perspective, his private caregiver has been designated as POA and thus is JH’s legal surrogate, so his treatment decisions trump the wishes of JH’s son. From a social perspective, one senses that there is a “backstory” that still needs to be teased out. JH’s decision to remove his son as POA and confer that status upon a hired caregiver instead seems unlikely to have been done casually. Relevant considerations include the relationship between JH and his son, the relationship between JH’s son and the caregiver, JH’s cognitive status at the time of the decision, and the proximity and level of engagement between JH’s son and the daily caregiving environment.</p>
<p>A facilitated care conference with JH’s son, his caregiver/POA, other involved family/caregivers, and key medical providers should be convened. Ground rules could be set to rein in any incivility between JH’s son and caregiver. The facilitator might open by explicitly stating that the conference will proceed with the assumption that both JH’s caregiver and his son want what is best for JH. Open-ended questions should be directed to each, starting by asking each to explain their understanding of JH’s clinical situation and prognosis. Clarifying questions and information can be provided to assure that they hold an accurate and shared understanding of JH’s clinical status. Follow-up questions at that point should solicit both their expectations and their hopes for JH’s future.</p>
<p>Given the absence of JH’s voice thus far, additional questions should inquire about specific statements JH might have made in the past regarding quality-of-life considerations. Did he make comments when family or friends went through similar experiences? Did he complete an advance directive? Did he give verbal instructions regarding his wishes for end-of-life care? The “empty chair question” may be useful: “If JH was sitting here with us right now, in clear state of mind, what would he tell us?”</p>
<p>The length of time since JH’s bleed is not specified, but certainly, the greater the amount of time that has elapsed since his bleed occurred, the lower his chances of regaining meaningful cognitive function. JH’s cognitive and overall functional status prior to this event should also be clarified. Despite his advanced age, the chances of any recovery will be better for a previously robust 93-year-old than for someone with multiple comorbid conditions. Either way, the severity of his bleed does not bode well. However, his relatively normal EEG likely makes the caregiver less accepting of definitive prognostic statements. Having the neurologist articulate JH’s prognosis as clearly as possible will be critical, and a second opinion would be useful.</p>
<p>If a facilitated care conference is unable to mediate the impasse between JH’s son and caregiver, the ethics committee (or ethics consultant) will have to determine whether they feel the caregiver’s treatment choice or financial conflict of interest is sufficiently counter to JH’s best interest to recommend further steps. Given that JH is likely to end up in a long-term acute care facility rather than returning home, it would be worth clarifying whether his caregiver indeed will continue to be paid, to determine whether the conflict of interest purported by JH’s son is a legitimate concern. As an advisory body, the ethics committee cannot make the final decisions, but they might recommend invoking a nonbeneficial medical treatment policy, if the hospital has one, or advise that a formal legal review of JH’s guardianship status be initiated. The easiest option would be to simply reinforce the caregiver's authority as POA and defer to his preferences, barring a credible legal challenge against his POA status. Given the allegations and conflict at hand, however, this seems to fall short of expectations. Regardless, an interdisciplinary support team, including social work and spiritual care, should be engaged throughout the proceedings, as should input from legal experts (including at least one who is not employed by the hospital, to avoid a potential conflict between obligations to the hospital and to JH).</p>

<title>Social Work Perspective</title>
<p>
<italic>Submitted by</italic> Leslie Stilin Schmidt, MSSW, MA</p>
<p>Offering a perspective on the case is complicated by the differing state laws which govern advance directives documents, their scope, and their validity. Reflecting on the laws of Wisconsin, where I practice, the validity of the second document could be called in to question. Wisconsin tends to discourage the naming of care providers as agents. Of course, that does not mean care providers are not named as agents. These types of documents tend to go unnoticed until there is a disagreement between caregivers and family members or caregivers and medical providers. In Wisconsin, it would be reasonable to pursue a guardianship hearing and legal involvement. The hope would be a legal opinion about the validity of the current document and/or to confirm or deny the authority of the caregiver. Without the respective state laws to reflect on, it is difficult to address the validity of the document.</p>
<p>That being said it seems the most reasonable approach is to assume the caregiver is the legal decision maker and should be addressed as such. I would suggest that both the son and caregiver are involved in conversation and joint decision making. It seems when family members are left out of conversations and decisions their feelings of frustration and isolation increase. My experience has been the more frustrated and isolate people feel, the less satisfied they feel with the care given.</p>
<p>The issue of financial interest was discussed in the case summary which of course raises red flags about the interests of both the caregiver and son. Unfortunately, once the question of ulterior financial motives has been raised, it is difficult to eliminate them from one’s mind. There is a tendency to be suspicious when there is money involved and because of this, decisions of either can seem suspicious. As much as possible, this issue needs to be set aside.</p>
<p>Setting the decision maker issue aside, the care team has an opportunity to be honest and forthcoming about the interventions available. His current condition is poor and the number of reasonable options is limited. In cases like this, there can be a tendency to use the word and concept of futility. It has been my experience that discussing futility has little place in the discussion with family and caregivers. People who care for the patient hear “futility” has a judgment that their loved one is not worth the effort. I suggest the alternative is to address the benefits and burdens of interventions in an honest and realistic manner. It seems people are more willing and able to make the difficult decision when they know “the good, the bad, and the ugly.” It is reasonable to discuss the surgery needed to place the tube, the complications possible with placement such as dislocation, infection, and regurgitation. It is reasonable to discuss the maintenance of the tube and caregiver burden as well. It is reasonable to discuss the relationship between nutrition and a return of cognitive function, if in fact there is one.</p>
<p>Finally, in my work, I encourage family members to partake in defining what a successful intervention would look like. In other words, what improvements can be defined that will indicate that the intervention has been successful. By doing so, the health care profession can get a better understanding of the family/caregivers understanding of the intervention and its purpose. This again offers the profession the opportunity to educate family and caregiver on the expected outcomes. Once success has been defined and the intervention started, the situation can be reassessed based on the caregiver/family definition of success. If success has not been achieved, the intervention can be continued or discontinued as needed.</p>
<p>I would suggest that the goal of any conversation between the son and caregvier is to bring them together. Find the common ground, may be that is the patient’s comfort, maybe it is his returning home rather than continued hospitalization. Both of these people care for this man and as much as possible we professionals need to believe in the best of intentions rather than the worse.</p>

<title>Nursing Perspective</title>
<sec id="section6-1049909112451104">
<title>Submitted by Paige Mingle, RN, MSN, CEN, CCNS, APN</title>
<p>JH has lived 93 years and up to this recent nonsalvageable injury, he appeared to be in his right mind and was active enough to live at home with a caregiver. As an emergency room and critical care nurse, I know and have seen that a massive intracerebral bleed is a terminal condition. I have seen both the family who chose to continue life support on a patient like JH and the family who chose to provide comfort measures only. Both are difficult for the family to go through. For the patient, especially one of JH age, the prolonged life support can be a long, painful, and unnecessary experience. With JH’s age and possible other comorbidities, prolonged artificial life support would lead to alteration in skin integrity, possible pneumonia, and expensive care.</p>
<p>In JH’s case, it is so sad that both his current POA and his son appear to be thinking about their own self-interest rather than JH. I feel in this case that both parties need to be in a room together with all of JH’s medical team (hospitalist, neuro, palliative care, case management, and nursing) to have an open discussion on his condition, what each option holds for JH’s quality of life, what had JH said in the past about life support, and what type of care would he need for prolonged life support and comfort measures only. The discussion needs to be focused on JH and not what others would or would not benefit from with JH surviving or dying from this injury. If after the discussion both parties continue to disagree on the treatment and care JH will receive, then the ethics committee needs to step in and give JH a voice in his care.</p>
<p>I personally support comfort measures only for JH because aggressive treatment would be futile and JH would not have a desirable quality of life if he would survive. I believe that JH has and deserves to die with dignity and not suffer.</p>
