<p>Abraham Lincoln’s Gettysburg address, which lasted circa three minutes, is regarded as a cornerstone of American history. It created a foundation of American idealism for the progeny. Sir Winston Churchill who served as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom twice is also known for his oratory skills. Swami Vivekananda is widely known for one of his inspiring and mesmerizing speeches which began with ‘Sisters and brothers of America...’. Perhaps speaking is a skill which can be learnt just like typing and riding and this is one of the reasons why the tome under review can be beneficial. Good speaking skills can definitely help in solving, if not avoiding, sundry problems in life. Speaking is a force which can help in attracting followers and implementing what’s been said and can act as a glue in holding people together.</p>
<p>After an introduction which runs into almost eight pages, the book under review has been effectively divided into four parts. The first part contains seven chapters which focus on thinking like a leader. The second part contains six enthralling chapters which explain how the reader can script himself/herself as a leader. The penultimate part containing eight chapters is devoted to using the language of leadership. The fourth part containing five chapters and a conclusion is devoted to presenting oneself as a leader.</p>
<p>The first chapter dwells on the significance of ‘vision’ and ‘mission’. The second chapter examines the reasons due to which people might turn into etiolated shadows of their brighter selves. The chapter is a treatise on leading. It provides an in-depth coverage of Leading from Above, Leading from the Side and also Leading from Below. The third chapter brings out the differences between informational mode and inspirational style. The fourth chapter contains five rules which help the reader in deciphering the fine difference between a not-so-positive outlook and a more-positive outlook. The fifth chapter examines the role of passion and honesty in effective leadership clearly differentiating between brutality and honesty—an explanation which is indeed warranted as there are chances that a person might be brutally honest when he/she is in fact being only brutal. The sixth chapter dwells on three levels of listening—listening physically, listening mentally and listening emotionally. The chapter is a must-read because from my personal experiences I feel that sometimes people listen only in order to make a reply, which is different from listening in order to understand. The seventh chapter cotains splendid examples from the lives of some of the greatest orators of the ilk of Demosthenes, Abraham Lincoln, Bill Clinton, Steve Jobs, Linda Stromme. The eighth chapter contains a template for a leader’s script which is a model for clear speaking, thinking and reasoing. The ninth chapter delves into the intricacies of how to start a presentation or a talk. The tenth, eleventh, twelfth and the thirteenth chapters are devoted to the important elements such as the subject, message, structure and closing aspects of a talk. The thirteenth chapter is devoted to the concept of ‘Call to Action’. It brings out the differences between audience-directed call to action, selfdirected call to action and a combined call to action,</p>
<p>The fourteenth, fifteenth, sixteenth and seventeenth chapter focus on clarity in speech, removing jargon, conversational prose and rapport-building with the audience. The eighteenth chapter is devoted to five figures of speech. A famous English Renaissance writer by the name of Henry Peacham in his work bearing the caption <italic>The Garden of Eloquence</italic> (1577) has enumerated 184 different figures of speech. There are many erudite scholars who have broadly classified the figures of speech into two broad categories: schemes and tropes. It is my personal conviction that this chapter could have included more details on usage of figures of speech, because it is one of the areas where a speaker might fumble, stumble or tumble. The nineteenth chapter sheds light on language usage which can weaken a person’s ideas. The twentieth chapter helps the reader in understanding when to use numbers after rounding them off and when to focus on hundred per cent precision while using numbers. The twenty-first chapter lays bare an important principle pertaining to use of humour while addressing a gathering. The twenty-second chapter explains how business scripts can be energized. The twenty-third chapter focuses on the best way a speaker can persuade his listeners. It explains when the usage of props can support the leader and his/her message and when props may detach a speaker from his/her leadership. The twenty-fourth chapter explains the up-down-up technique and the usage of a device known as Teleprompter (also known as Autocue). The twenty-fifth chapter explains how a speaker can project his/her leadership through his/her gestures, facial expression(s) and stance. The twenty-sixth chapter explains how a speaker can develop the voice of a leader.</p>
<p>The author has built on Charles Lutwidge Dodgson’s (who used to write under the pseudonym Lewis Carroll) <italic>Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland</italic>, Michael Dell’s autobiography <italic>Direct from Dell</italic>, Anton Chekhov’s story <italic>Fat and Thin</italic>, Aristotle’s <italic>Poetics</italic>, Michael Ellsberg’s <italic>The Power of Eye Contact.</italic></p>
<p>The work under review contains brilliant examples drawn from some of the highly acclaimed organizations like Google, Ontario Lottery and Gaming Corporation, Apple, General Electric. It clearly dissects the differences between a great speaker and a great leader, rules of rhetoric and rhetoric rules.</p>
<p>Many leadership champions have also been advocating ideologies of Leading from the Front and Servant Leadership. Perhaps the author of the tome under review can include these topics in the second edition of the book.</p>
