<abstract>
<p>Most societies view hope as a virtue. But those who do so ignore the writings of Hesiod and Seneca. In the Greek poet’s accounts of the quarrel between Zeus and Prometheus, hope and other evils swirl in the same cesspool. While in his epistles, the Roman stoic thinker shares with his friend Lucilius the insight of Hecato of Rhodes, “Cease to hope, and you will cease to fear.” In this article the author presents arguments supporting the thesis that hope is an evil and that wishing is better than hoping.</p>

<p>As a general rule, I avoid using the word <italic>hope</italic> in my conversations with parents and patients. Hope is a passive sentiment that lives in the dungeon of human emotions—<italic>all is exhausted, only hope remains</italic>. Hope is so hopeless that we pair it with wishes for world peace, ending poverty, and stamping out hunger. Hard as we may hope to achieve those laudable goals, realistically, they are unattainable. Thus, hope—a sense of open-endedness<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0883073812460584">1</xref></sup> or unattainable closure—is the only thing left to do. Hope blinds and shackles; hope is daunting and discouraging; hope is disempowering. Hope is alluring but vague; hope is revered but ineffable.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0883073812460584">2</xref></sup> Hope in health care is the alchemist’s gold, a force to be reckoned with, one that until the bitter end is accepted as invincible. Hope, explained Seneca to Lucilius, goes hand in hand with fear: “Just as the same chain fastens the prisoner and the soldier who guards him, so hope and fear, dissimilar as they are, keep step together; fear follows hope.”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0883073812460584">3</xref></sup> Fear and hope, continued Seneca, are ills that thwart our ability to adapt to the present, and instead send our thoughts into a future over which we have no control. Hope puts our mind in an indeterminate state, a mind that is in suspense, a mind that is fretted by looking forward to a potentially perilous future. Hope, as designed by Zeus, is an evil. For as recounted by Hesiod, the jar that Pandora carried included sorrow, mischief, ills, hard toil, heavy sickness, and hope. And if Zeus included hope in the vessel of devastation, who am I to second guess he “who thunders aloft and has his dwelling most high.”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0883073812460584">4</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>Hope may either be generalized or specific.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0883073812460584">5</xref></sup> Generalized hope defines an indeterminate and broad-in-spectrum development such as a world free from illness and in peace. Specific hope is the desire for a determined event or defined outcome called the “hope object”—cure for a grave illness, winning the lottery. To qualify as a hope object, the event or state of affairs is to be possible but not certain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0883073812460584">5</xref></sup>—or in Seneca’s words, coupled to fear of failure. And thus, the hopeful’s life could be defined as that which is done while leaping between hope objects: some attainable, some to be abandoned, but always in the shadow of fear.</p>
<p>Hope is not what I want from my health care provider, the airplane pilot, or the bridge’s engineer. From all of them I want, at the very least, a reasonable <italic>expectation</italic>. When discussing my choice of a medication, I tell the parents of my patients “I <italic>expect</italic> the medication will decrease the number of seizures.” When explaining why I consider a test to be necessary I indicate “my <italic>expectation</italic> is that the EEG will no longer reveal abnormal electrical activity.” Using the word <italic>expectation</italic> in any of its mutations is not a sign of arrogance or lack of empathy. Saying “I <italic>expect</italic> Ricky will experience fewer headaches with the new medication” leaves plenty of room for me to be wrong. Ricky may continue to experience frequent headaches. But instead of just <italic>hoping</italic> for him to get better, I used medical information and years of clinical experience to make an informed recommendation.</p>
<p>Wishing, write Quill et al, is a far better choice than hoping.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0883073812460584">6</xref></sup> Wishing is an active expression of empathy that acknowledges its boundaries—<italic>I wish we had better treatments for Ricky’s difficult to control epilepsy</italic>. By expressing wishes, Quill et al, explain “clinicians temporarily suspend their role as medical experts and respond as human beings faced with overwhelming circumstances that are not of their own choosing.”<sup>6</sup><sup>(</sup><sup>p552</sup><sup>)</sup> Wishing is better than hoping because the former is rooted in reality, while the latter is eager for a fluke. Wishes acknowledge the limited control clinicians have in certain situations and the regret that medicine is not more powerful and effective.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0883073812460584">6</xref></sup> Hope shows no remorse, even when it is false.</p>
<p>Do I consider hope is an evil? In certain circumstances it is. Hoping for a cure when one does not exist, or hoping for a good outcome when one is not possible clouds decision making. It gives the impression that options are still available. It forestalls resolutions. Am I the most uncaring and hateful individual you have encountered? I <italic>hope</italic> not. I have never shattered anyone’s hope. And in certain circumstances I use the word because of its conventional meaning; but I do so with awareness of the implications. I find no incongruence in being compassionate and using the word <italic>hope</italic> with measure. I hope for a patient’s recovery when conditions are so dire that expectations or wishes for a cure are no longer rooted in reality, when the best one can do is wait for a stroke of luck. But for those instances when expressing empathy is of a higher moral value than fearfully and passively waiting for good fortune, I will continue to stray from <italic>hope</italic>.</p>
