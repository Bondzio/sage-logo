<p>Bay Street, the main thoroughfare in Nassau, The Bahamas’ capital city, is a storehouse for much of that country’s social memory. It has been the stage for some of the most significant events in The Bahamas’ history and continues to be at the center of Bahamian cultural, economic, and political life. Understandably, Bay Street has also been a contested space. This article discusses the contested nature of Bay Street using the 1942 riot, a key event in Bahamian political history that occurred on Bay Street, and Junkanoo, an important cultural festival in The Bahamas.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Nestled between the North Atlantic Ocean and the Caribbean Sea, to the northwest of Cuba and the southeast of Florida, the archipelago of the Commonwealth of The Bahamas’ approximately 700 islands and 2,000 cays cover more than 150,000 square miles of ocean. Nassau, the capital city of The Bahamas, is located on the island of New Providence. Although New Providence is only the 11th largest island, it is home to approximately 70% of the Bahamian population; according to recent calculations more than 200,000 souls live there. Similarly, much of the country’s economic life is concentrated in Nassau. Most of the 5 million people who visit The Bahamas every year pass through Nassau. And, the financial institutions that buoy The Bahamas’ economy are all headquartered in The Bahamas’ capital city. Nassau is also the seat of the national government. As such, Nassau is also the demographic, economic, and political center of the country.</p>
<p>For much of The Bahamas’ history, Bay Street, Nassau’s chief thoroughfare, has been to Nassau what Nassau has been to the rest of The Bahamas: It is the center of activity in the city. It is the site of all major festivals in The Bahamas and a space at the center of everyday life in the country. Bay Street runs along the northern end of New Providence stretching from the current site of the British Colonial Hotel in the west to the Eastern Parade. It is the home of The Bahamas’ Houses of Parliament, the Cabinet Office, the main branches of several prominent banks, law firms and other professional services, as well as stores selling stationery, books, jewelry, perfume, linen, liquor, foodstuffs, clothing, and every other category of goods. Additionally, the Anglican Cathedral, the Central Bank of The Bahamas, and the Supreme Court, each a significant site in The Bahamas, are all situated just off Bay Street on the numerous side streets that flow out from the main thoroughfare, connecting it to the rest of the island. Also Prince George’s Wharf, just north of Bay Street, is the entry point of the millions of cruise-ship passengers who visit Nassau every year. Bay Street is, thus, at the axis of political, economic, and social life in the city and so the country.</p>
<p>Bay Street, then, is Nassau’s Main Street, with much to link it to the Main Streets found in small- and medium-sized towns and cities across the globe. Indeed, like Main Street, United States and High Street, United Kingdom, Nassau’s Bay Street is simultaneously commercial, political, and cultural space. It is the space for celebration and dissent, the space for work and leisure, the space for seeking power and from where state and economic power can and has been used to silence the subaltern and to disenfranchise the powerless.</p>
<p>Like other city centers, then, Nassau’s Bay Street is and has always been a contested space; a place where different groups vied for recognition, redress, and control.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1206331212466081">1</xref></sup> Racial groups in The Bahamas, for instance, “negotiated” this place since the earliest days of the colonies. Whites used the law and their socioeconomic power to limit where and when Blacks could be on the street. Similarly, Blacks worked within and around those laws and sometimes in direct resistance to the socioeconomic hegemony of White elites to carve out a place for themselves on the street. These practices produced a social space that is simultaneously but peacefully occupied by various groups who have come to perceive, experience, and conceive of Bay Street in very different ways and, at other times is hotly contested by various groups who see the same possibility for political and socioeconomic power by claiming Bay Street.</p>
<p>Understandably, Bay Street has been the focal point of numerous political protests and is the site of many of the important cultural festivals in The Bahamas. The June 1, 1942 labor action, for instance, began outside the city center but turned into a riot on Bay Street. An important event in The Bahamas’ history, this riot spoke to the growing dissatisfaction of The Bahamas’ Black majority with being hemmed in politically, economically, and socially (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1206331212466081">Martin &amp; Storr, 2007</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1206331212466081">2</xref></sup> It demonstrated the willingness of the hitherto silent Black majority to stand up to their colonial masters and the local White oligarchy. It was the first sign of a political awakening among Bahamian Blacks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1206331212466081">Martin &amp; Storr, 2007</xref>, p. 74). As such, this riot continues to occupy a unique place in the Bahamian imagination and, important for our purposes here, has helped to cement Bay Street as the most important center in the country.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1206331212466081">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>Bay Street, however, is not only a contested space. It is also a unifying space that is both a stage for and a product of Bahamian self-expression and collective action. Long before the riot, the semiannual Junkanoo parades had established Bay Street as the space where Bahamians go to express themselves. Although Junkanoo celebrations occur all over The Bahamas, since the 19th century Bay Street has been the key site for these parades. Junkanoo is a colorful spectacle that occurs twice a year on Bay Street. Although it began as an event for Blacks only, it is arguably become <italic>the quintessential Bahamian cultural experience</italic> and <italic>is the essence of what it means to be a Bahamian</italic> for many Bahamian Blacks and Whites. Indeed, Junkanoo has variously been described as the heartbeat, the pulse, the spirit, and the soul of the Bahamian people (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1206331212466081">Craton &amp; Saunders, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1206331212466081">Nash-Ferguson, 2000</xref>). Not surprisingly, then, through Junkanoo, Bay Street has become a site where Bahamians come to celebrate and lament with each other.</p>
<p>As such, Bay Street is both a unifying and disintegrating space; unifying in that it serves as a center or a point of orientation for Bahamians and visitors to The Bahamas; disintegrating in that it is also a space that is inhabited everyday by haves and have-nots, owners and workers, tourists and natives.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1206331212466081">4</xref></sup> It would be a mistake, however, to assume that in describing the space as unifying and disintegrating that we are intending to anthropomorphize social space. Social space for us is the site of social action and, since social space is socially constructed, the product of social practices. Bay Street, as we have stated, has been both the stage for and the product of some of the most significant events in The Bahamas’ history. Both social union and social disruption have taken place on Bay Street and so both have shaped the way that Bahamians have come to conceive of and experience Bay Street.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1206331212466081">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>Focusing primarily on the 1942 riot and the semiannual Junkanoo festivals, this article argues that Bay Street, a social space that is a stage for, player in, and a product of the major social dramas that happen in The Bahamas, is both a space where Bahamians come together and are split apart.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1206331212466081">6</xref></sup> Taken together, we argue, a careful reading of the riot and Junkanoo demonstrate that Bay Street is both unifying and disintegrating. As such, this article contributes to the analysis of contested spaces by emphasizing that they need not <italic>only</italic> be sites of conflict but can also be unifying spaces. It also contributes to the literature on the spatial significance of riots and festivals.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1206331212466081">7</xref></sup> Additionally, it adds to the literature on the spatial practices that occur within and so shape city centers.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-1206331212466081">8</xref></sup></p>

<title><italic>Going Down Burma Road</italic><sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-1206331212466081">9</xref></sup>: Bay Street as a Space of Power and Protest<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-1206331212466081">10</xref></sup></title>
<p>On June 1, 1942, disgruntled workers from an American project to build military bases in The Bahamas accompanied by women and children from the poorer neighborhoods in Nassau spilled onto Bay Street. The 2,000+ laborers on the “Project” had learned a few days earlier that the contractors were paying imported American workers 10 times as much as they were paying local workers. They were also discovering that the meager wages that they did receive were not high enough to meet their living expenses. By that Monday morning, the Bahamian workers were thoroughly frustrated with the inability or unwillingness of the government and the contractors to resolve the wage dispute. They went to Bay Street to seek redress, like so many Bahamians have in the years following the riots.</p>
<p>In 1942, 25 years before Black rule came to The Bahamas and 30 years before independence, Bay Street was largely a “white” space.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-1206331212466081">11</xref></sup> Although The Bahamas was a predominantly Black country at that time, and indeed had been since the 18th century, Whites, headquartered on Bay Street, ruled the colony and controlled its economy. The House of Assembly, which sits on Bay Street between Parliament Street and Bank Lane, for instance, was composed of mostly White members until the latter half of the 20th century. The few Blacks who did sit in the House before the 1960s had to overcome considerable odds to win and then maintain their seats, let alone to shape policy. Milo Butler, who would go on to be the first Governor-General of an independent Bahamas, is a perfect example. Butler, in the 1930s, was a shopkeeper, considerably poorer and less educated than the White elite who typically sat in the Assembly. Still, Butler challenged the millionaire Harry Oakes to the seat left vacant by A. F. Adderley, a Black lawyer, when Adderley ascended to the Legislative Council in 1938. The election between Butler and Oakes was hotly contested but it was not a fair campaign. The ruling elite pressured the Royal Bank of Canada to stop Butler’s credit and openly bribed voters as they came to the polls to cast their ballots (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1206331212466081">Craton &amp; Saunders, 2000</xref>). Butler won the race but he did not significantly change the makeup of the House (or likely the legislation it devised).</p>
<p>Similarly, in 1942, most of the stores on Bay Street were White owned. Indeed, Bay Street was so associated with the White ruling class in The Bahamas that they were simply referred to as “Bay Street” or the “Bay Street Boys.” As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1206331212466081">Klaw (1959)</xref> described, the “Bay Street Boys” are
<disp-quote>
<p>a dozen or so Nassau merchants, lawyers, and real-estate brokers who are . . . [named after] the street where they have their shops and offices . . . [and are] in firm control of The Bahamas government, running it with a free hand. (p. 92)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1206331212466081">Themistocleous (2000)</xref> has called the Bay Street Boys “the merchant princes of Nassau” with 100+ years of “hegemony . . . over non-white groups” (p. 6). Along the same lines, the Russell Commission (1942) convened to investigate the riot, has likewise described them as “elected representatives, who are collectively known as ‘Bay Street’ (in which street or its immediate neighbourhood all the twenty-nine members of the House of Assembly except two have their places of business)” (p. 40).</p>
<p>During the first half of the 20th century, Blacks, particularly those in service industries and street and market vendors, could find spaces on Bay Street to put up their shingles, as it were, but with a few exceptions Black merchants tended to locate their stores outside the city center. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1206331212466081">Craton and Saunders (2000</xref>, p. 211) said of Black Bahamian merchants of an earlier epoch, “white petty businessmen similarly had to look for interstices in the Bay Street edifice . . . as tailors, carpenters, undertakers, contractors, tortoiseshell craftsmen, or hirers of small boats or carriages.” Similarly, though Blacks who could afford to pay were certainly welcomed in even the White-owned Bay Street businesses, these stores marketed to and catered to local and visiting Whites.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-1206331212466081">12</xref></sup> “The Bay Street shops, with their poor-White clerks,” <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1206331212466081">Craton and Saunders (2000</xref>, p. 211) explained, “catered to whoever could pay–though the Black populace was expected to wait politely behind white customers.”</p>
<p>Although there were certainly cracks in the “Bay Street Boys’” control over Bay Street and thus in White control over social, political, and economic life in the majority Black Bahamas, the riots would firmly establish Bay Street as not only the space of White power but also of Black protest. When the crowd, composed of workers from the “Project,” as well as women and children, arrived on Bay Street, they gathered outside the government buildings at Public Square and demanded satisfaction. They were angry but by all accounts were prepared to listen. Attorney General Eric Hallinan addressed the workers from the steps of the Colonial Secretary’s office hoping to mollify them. Instead, he seems to have agitated them even further. He asked that they send a representative to the Colonial Secretary or to the Acting Governor. He promised that their concerns would receive immediate attention. He also told the workers that the company had originally planned to bring in Americans to work on the bases but had decided against it since the Bahamians had proven to be “good workers” (<italic>Russell Commission</italic>, 1942, p. 17). He warned them to be careful to “not spoil the good impression that they had made” (<italic>Russell Commission</italic>, 1942, p. 17). This last statement did not sit well with the workers. Not only were they not receiving what they thought they should be paid, he also seemed to be telling them that their jobs were now in danger of going to foreign workers. Although there were reports that some of the laborers threw their sticks in a heap and went home when they heard this news, for the most part the crowd became even more incensed. Mr. Christie, a labor leader, Captain Sears, a police officer, and a number of others tried to convince the mob to go home but to no avail. Eventually, a group of men broke off from the main assemblage, tired of listening to what they must have thought was cheap talk, and headed down Bay Street, “smashing as they went” (Green, <italic>Russell Commission</italic>, 1942, p. 184).</p>
<p>“The window of Moseley’s Book Store was smashed and what had begun as a labour demonstration now turned into an unqualified riot” (Select Committee, 1942, p. 11). There was a truck with full bottles of soft drinks (Coca-Cola) parked on the corner of Parliament Street and Bay Street that provided convenient ammunition to the rioters. They threw full bottles at nearby store windows and some, being more economical, drank the beverage first and then threw the empty bottles. The police remained in the square without moving to intervene for three quarters of an hour after the first window was broken. Once sufficiently provoked, however, the authorities used force to restore order. Though they were slow to use violence to protect the Bay Street Boys’ commercial interests they did ultimately act to assert the colonial administrators’ social control. By the time the police acted, however, Bay Street was in shambles.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-1206331212466081">13</xref></sup> <italic>The New York Times</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1206331212466081">1942</xref>, p. 7) noted that for days after the riot, “scenes in the Bay Street business section were reminiscent of a tropical hurricane, with storm shutters covering gaping holes in windows and doors.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-1206331212466081">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>In addition to being the first sign of political awakening in The Bahamas’ Black community, the 1942 riot in The Bahamas was also a rebellion against Bay Street’s hegemony. Or, at the least, the riot was a very real attempt to (re)capture, (re)appropriate and, once capture and appropriation proved impossible, to lash out at Bay Street. As we argued elsewhere, “the 1942 riot demonstrated to both Bahamian Blacks and the oligarchs—who were known collectively as the ‘Bay Street Boys’—that Bay Street was vulnerable.” Indeed, the riot showed quite clearly that “the hold the merchant princes had on The Bahamas was far from complete and unassailable. The majority black population in The Bahamas could literally dismantle the edifices of minority white rule, if sufficiently provoked” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1206331212466081">Martin &amp; Storr, 2007</xref>, p. 74).</p>
<p>Several salient features of this riot need to be emphasized if we are to understand the significance of Bay Street as a stage for and a product of this event. First, the riot targeted space and not people. There are reports of police officers being assaulted with stones and bottles (Pinder, <italic>Russell Commission</italic>, 1942, p. 99).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-1206331212466081">15</xref></sup> But this was the exception rather than the rule. For the most part, the rioters departed peacefully when pushed to leave Bay Street by the police. As the Commissioner of Police, Lt. Col. Reginald Alexander Erskine-Lindop (<italic>Russell Commission</italic>, 1942, p. 43) testified, extreme force was not necessary to control the crowd, when “we started to drive the people down Bay Street. They went sullenly, but they went.” The rioters were much more interested in property than violence. Indeed, there were no reports of civilians being attacked during the riot. Roland Symonette (<italic>Russell Commission</italic>, 1942, p. 490), one of the Bay Street Boys, for instance, walked down Bay Street during the height of the riot and was not harmed. Additionally, Bruce Johnstone (<italic>Russell Commission</italic>, 1942, p. 167) recalls a man succeeding in “stopping the people who were pillaging Mr. Yanowitz’ store.” Similarly, Roscoe W. Thompson (<italic>Russell Commission</italic>, 1942, p. 230) was able to convince the crowd not to further destroy his store. Not only was he not harmed but his store sustained no further damage after he made the request. Widespread looting, however, did occur. To Roland Symonette (<italic>Russell Commission</italic>, 1942, p. 490), it seemed that “the police just stood easy and let the looters take what they wanted.” Sir <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1206331212466081">Clifford Darling (2002)</xref> tells the story of a little girl who, following the example of her elders, wandered into a fabric store to choose a bolt of fabric. The bolt, of course, was too heavy for her to carry. Determined, she rested the bolt on the ground, grabbed the edges of the material and dragged it slowly but resolutely toward her house.</p>
<p>Second, that the rioters targeted specific spaces also suggests that the riot was an attack on Bay Street qua a space of White power and Black subordination. By all accounts, most of the liquor stores, clothing stores, and perfume stores lining Bay Street were completely sacked before the police restored order to the city center. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1206331212466081">Craton and Saunders (2000)</xref> report, however,
<disp-quote>
<p>the damage was not indiscriminate; such shops as those owned by the Speaker of the Assembly and the wife of one of the white Project supervisors were almost gutted, but the shoe store owned by Percy Christie, the white would-be labor organizer, was left untouched. (p. 288)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Moreover, as Christie reports, “when I arrived in front of my shop I found that a dozen people were holding arms and protecting the shop” (Christie, <italic>Russell Commission</italic>, 1942, p. 26). In contrast, the windows of Bay Street Boy Asa Pritchard’s store, the upscale John Bull, were shattered and the stores looted. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1206331212466081">Nash-Ferguson, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1206331212466081">Saunders, 1987</xref>).</p>
<p>Third, the 1942 riot shows Bay Street to be a contested space that is the site of racial and class conflict as well as a space that Bahamians regardless of race and class conceived of in similar ways. The Black laborers saw Bay Street as an obstacle preventing them from earning a living wage. The White merchants considered Bay Street as their own exclusive province.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-1206331212466081">16</xref></sup> Both groups, however, recognized Bay Street as a space for seeking power and from where power could be wielded. As a space is not just a physical place but also a social construction, the agreement of both Blacks and Whites on the significance and meaning of Bay Street is quite telling.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-1206331212466081">17</xref></sup></p>
<p>Interestingly, prior to 1942 and even for some time after 1942, many White and Black Bahamians saw the Bay Street Boys’ control over Bay Street as being impenetrable and so were surprised by the riot. It simply did not dawn on many of the White merchants that, a century after emancipation, the still poor, still quite dependent Bahamian Blacks might rise up and attack Bay Street. As J. P. Sands (<italic>Russell Commission</italic>, 1942, p. 293) testified, “I thought that everybody in the island was quite happy until about 8 o’clock on June 1st.” Even Etienne Dupuch, a journalist, politician, and activist who recognized the economic, political, and social inequalities in the colony, was not prepared for what occurred. “The riot came as a complete surprise to me,” Dupuch (<italic>Russell Commission</italic>, 1942, p. 301) testified shortly after the riot: “I never thought that our people could be agitated to the point of rioting because they have always enjoyed the enviable reputation of being patient, docile and law-abiding.” Similarly, Mrs. Morton Turtle (<italic>Russell Commission</italic>, 1942, p. 98), who owned a ladies apparel store on Bay Street called Suzy’s, could not understand “why [her] husband should have been apprehensive of the workmen. For years he had employed hundreds of workmen and he was of the opinion that they were very fond of him in fact.” And, as Mr. Turtle (<italic>Russell Commission</italic>, 1942, p. 127) confirmed, “I was amazed to find the crowd felt hostile towards me . . . I have always . . . given them good wages.” Commissioner of Police, Lt. Col. Erskine-Lindop (<italic>Russell Commission</italic>, 1942, p. 42) also admits to being surprised by the rioting. Although he and 40 of his men were on Bay Street before the rioting began, he took no steps to protect the stores from being damaged or looted.</p>
<p>Although the 1942 riot was undoubtedly a significant sociopolitical event, it was not until Black Tuesday in April 1965, however, that Bahamian Blacks began to believe that they could control Bay Street (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1206331212466081">Martin &amp; Storr, 2009b</xref>). If the riot was the first sign of a political awakening in The Bahamas, “Black Tuesday” was proof that Blacks were prepared and able to stand up to the White minority. Indeed, Bahamian Blacks had begun chipping away at Bay Street’s façade since the 1942 riot. Black Tuesday, however, played a critical role in demonstrating to Bahamian Blacks that Bay Street could be resisted and defied. Black Tuesday was evidence that Bahamian Blacks were no longer afraid of Bay Street.</p>
<p>Five years before majority rule in The Bahamas, the United Bahamian Party, led by the “Bay Street Boys,” had soundly defeated the Black-led Progressive Liberal Party in the 1962 election. A few years later on Tuesday, April 27, 1965, now known as Black Tuesday, a large crowd of Progressive Liberty Party (PLP) supporters gathered outside the House of Assembly on Bay Street. Inside the Assembly, the House, who could clearly hear the din of the crowd below, was debating and would subsequently defeat the PLP’s motion to have the boundaries of the electoral constituencies redrawn under the direction of the United Nations. In protest, Lynden Pindling, then Leader of the Opposition, denounced the Bay Street Boys who controlled the majority of the seats within the Assembly, took hold of the speaker’s ceremonial mace, and threw it out of the window to the waiting crowd below. Milo Butler, a leading figure in the PLP, grabbed and tossed out the quarter-hourglasses that the speaker of the house used to keep time during debates. The PLP members of the House then stormed out. As we argued elsewhere, this was “a defiant act by the PLP and ultimately a defining one for the Bahamian people” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1206331212466081">Martin &amp; Storr, 2009b</xref>, p. 38). Black Tuesday “was definitive proof that blacks in The Bahamas were prepared and able to stand up to the white ruling minority” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1206331212466081">Martin &amp; Storr, 2009b</xref>, p. 38). They had been warned by the government to stay away from Bay Street but large numbers had gathered there anyway.</p>
<p>Bay Street as the space of White sociopolitical power and wealth, and so Black lowliness, was a conception of Bay Street that was held by both Bahamian Blacks and Whites, at least until Black Tuesday. Indeed, as discussed above, it was a perception of Bay Street that would survive for years after the riot. The riot thus speaks to the fissures and unifying forces in Bahamian society that have been given expression on Bay Street and that Bay Street has come to represent for Bahamians of all races and classes. The rioters marched into the space of Bay Street frustrated with their economic circumstances, fed up with the merchant oligarchs and hoping for redress. When their concerns fell on deaf ears, they began venting their frustrations on parked cars and storefronts. Arguably, the rioters were somewhat naïve to think that (marching to) Bay Street would solve their problems. But if not to the space of Bay Street, then where else should they, could they, have gone? As we shall see when we look more closely at Junkanoo, the space of Bay Street had long since been established as the space where Bahamians went (and still go) to express themselves, to voice their hopes, fears, dreams, fantasies, and frustrations.</p>

<title><italic>Rushin’ Through da Town</italic>: Bay Street as a Space of Expression</title>
<p>Junkanoo is a semiannual cultural celebration in The Bahamas. Costumed revelers dance down Bay Street before sunrise on Boxing Day and New Year’s Day shaking cowbells and beating goatskin drums. The present-day parades feature new instruments, arranged music, choreographed dance routines, organized groups, and increasingly colorful and complex costumes consisting of headpieces, shoulder pieces, and skirts covered with crepe paper and made of cardboard, Styrofoam, wood, wire mesh, and plastic tubing. Revelers in earlier parades were similarly divided into gangs (usually representing different neighborhoods) but used much simpler instrumentation and wore much simpler costumes than they do now. Although by the 1920s masqueraders were covering their costumes with colorful tissue paper instead of newspaper and sponges as they had in earlier periods, the costumes during that era were still quite basic consisting of “fringed” clothing and headpieces (with no cardboard skirts or shoulder pieces). Junkanoo has changed in other ways since it developed as “slave entertainment” in the 1800s. In addition to the instrumentation and the costumes, the route has changed, the number of participants and spectators has grown, it has developed into a semiannual spectacle which attracts tourists from around the globe, and it has become a fierce competition that participants begin preparing for almost a year in advance.</p>
<p>In spite of these changes, or perhaps because of them, Junkanoo continues to be the definitive Bahamian cultural experience.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-1206331212466081">18</xref></sup> Indeed, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1206331212466081">N. Bethel (2003b)</xref> notes,
<disp-quote>
<p>Junkanoo, for Bahamians, is the ultimate national symbol. A street festival of West African origin held at Christmastime, it represents poverty and wealth, discipline and rebellion, competition and co-operation, creative genius and physical prowess. It is simultaneously viewed as the quintessential Bahamian self-conception and the best face turned to the visitor . . . Junkanoo may be regarded as the culmination of the tales of identification told to the self (Bahamians) and to the other (tourists and other foreigners) . . . Bahamian Junkanoo tells the following tales of the self: it is simultaneously the central symbol of black Bahamians’ development, a metaphor for national progress, an affirmation of Bahamian creativity, an arena for social commentary and a ready tool for the education of the young. (pp. 118-120)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Junkanoo rhythms speak directly to the Bahamian soul.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-1206331212466081">19</xref></sup> As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1206331212466081">Munnings (2003</xref>, p. 109) writes, “Junkanoo is a celebration of Bahamian life.” And, we should add, Junkanoo was also a lamenting of social decline and the inevitability of death. Junkanoo costumes often express the joys and pains of Bahamians as well as positive and negative events in The Bahamas’ history. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1206331212466081">N. Bethel (2003b)</xref> is quite right that “for the Bahamian . . . Junkanoo is . . . the embodiment of a history constructed by and for the African-Bahamian population” (p. 123).</p>
<p>The space of Bay Street has been Junkanoo space since the 19th century. There were reports of “grotesquely dressed” Junkanooers parading down Bay Street in 1879 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1206331212466081">Wisdom, 1985</xref>, p. 44). By 1942, the year of the riot, Bay Street was firmly ensconced as the focal point of these festivities. Today, Junkanoo parades at Christmastime are a fixture on Bay Street. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1206331212466081">N. Bethel (2003a</xref>, p. 53) writes, “Bay Street is central to the performance of Junkanoo, as it is the site of all the resistance, disorder and satire of past parades.” <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1206331212466081">Nash-Ferguson (2000)</xref> has written poetically about the link between Junkanoo and Bay Street: “For two mornings a year,” she states, “historic Bay Street becomes the stage whereon we demonstrate our sovereignty of spirit, and celebrate the triumph of a proud heritage” (p. 16).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1206331212466081">Nash-Ferguson (2000)</xref> also speaks for many Junkanoos when she writes that
<disp-quote>
<p>Junkanoo was the place to keep our souls. The real “me” would emerge in our costumes, the colours of our character, the design of our personalities, the patterns of our tastes, our pride, and our signature. On Bay [Street], in our costumes, we would feel complete. (p. 30)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>That the space of Bay Street is also commercial and political space imparts economic and political significance to these festivals. Because Junkanoo takes place on Bay Street, a space where Bahamian Blacks could shop and work but nonetheless a space that they were never meant to control, Junkanoo was and continues to be an opportunity for Bahamian Blacks to “reverse the trend of history” and to “joyously proclaim the triumph of the Bahamian spirit: parade it in the intricate steps of the dance, thunder it from the bounding of our drums, shout it in the sound of our cowbells” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1206331212466081">Nash-Fergurson, 2000</xref>, p. 30).</p>
<p>For much of The Bahamas’ history, certainly until the 1942 riot, Bahamian Blacks’ dissatisfaction with their socioeconomic circumstances and the enduring hegemony of Bay Street, were expressed symbolically, through songs, folktales, and festivals. That many of the Bay Street Boys were surprised by the riot, for instance, speaks to the ruling elites’ success in pushing protest into more symbolic forms such as Junkanoo.</p>
<p>Junkanoo on Bay Street is, thus, not simply a celebration of Bahamian originality and resourcefulness. It has often contained (sometimes quite overt) statements of protest. For the masqueraders, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1206331212466081">E. C. Bethel (1991)</xref> notes, “Junkanoo was . . . a celebration; but as times grew harder, and they had fewer things to celebrate, it also provided them with an annual forum for airing grievances” (p. 67). When Bahamians grow dissatisfied with the prevailing social and economic order, Junkanoo becomes an opportunity for them to express their discontent. “An example of this,” as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1206331212466081">Wisdom (1985)</xref> notes, “would be the sponge costumes, with painted protest signs attached, seen in the 1941 Junkanoo parades, which were worn in silent protest of the high interest rental rates White outfitters were charging Black sponge fishermen” (p. 91). The parades also gave Bahamians an opportunity to express their hopes and dreams. As Wisdom argued, “the Junkanoo parades of the 1950s, 1960s and early 1970s were not symbolic representations of the desire for socio-political transformations in The Bahamas leading up to independence, so much as iconic, direct embodiments of these same desires” (p. 91).</p>
<p>Bay Street, then, is not just a stage for these parades, equal to all other possible venues. Something significant takes place during Junkanoo on Bay Street. As noted above, many of the significant events in The Bahamas’ history have occurred on Bay Street and for centuries Bay Street has been an important space in the political, social, and economic lives of many Bahamians. As a result, Bay Street is also the focal point for these parades. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1206331212466081">E. C. Bethel (1991</xref>, p. 73) suggests, “the temporary occupation of Bay Street was a custom popularised by the Junkanoos.” As Junkanoo proved twice yearly, though the space of Bay Street was the province of the White merchant oligarchs and a symbol of political and economic oppression for many Bahamian Blacks, White hegemony was not so complete. Junkanoo demonstrated (albeit symbolically and temporarily) that Bahamian Blacks could possess and control the city center. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1206331212466081">N. Bethel (2003b</xref>, p. 122), writes “Junkanoo has the quality of an occupation, an invasion of the centres of authority; it occurs at the heart of the commercial power of the white Bahamian elite.”</p>
<p>For many Bahamians, the link between Bay Street and Junkanoo is an indelible one. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1206331212466081">Wood (1996)</xref> writes,
<disp-quote>
<p>Bay Street and Junkanoo are synonymous with each other. When Junkanooers talk about “goin [sic] to Bay Street” they are talking about rushing in the Junkanoo parade. There are subliminal and emotional ties to Bay Street that continue to exist. (p. 73)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Since the 1980s, however, some prominent Junkanooers and government officials have advocated moving Junkanoo off of Bay Street and developing a special Junkanoo space elsewhere on the island (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1206331212466081">Francis, 2003</xref>, p. 61). Their argument is that Junkanoo has outgrown Bay Street, that the size of the groups, costumes, and spectators are too large for the current venue. Summarizing their position, former government minister responsible for Junkanoo, Peter Bethel argued that “the route . . . [is] congested, too short, too narrow, blocked up, constipated, does not lend itself to crowd control nor does it provide comfort for the spectators” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1206331212466081">Wood, 1996</xref>, p. 67).</p>
<p>Attempts to move Junkanoo under Peter Bethel’s watch, however, were mightily resisted. There was “an uproar,” for instance, when officials informed the public that the 1989 Boxing Day would occur in the Queen Elizabeth Sports Center. “Junkanooers,” <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1206331212466081">Wood (1996)</xref> informs, “staged a spontaneous demonstration that included a <italic>rush</italic> from the over-the-hill to Bay Street and back” (p. 68). As she writes, their rejection of the planned relocation of Junkanoo in 1989 suggests that Junkanooers
<disp-quote>
<p>saw Bay Street as the only possible venue, since it continued to represent a power reversal (White merchants versus the Black masses), and indeed the atmosphere on Bay Street with its closely set buildings which provide excellent acoustics, the Christmas lights that add a sense of mystery to the setting, and the jostling of the spectators, are essential to having a true Junkanoo experience. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1206331212466081">Wood, 1996</xref>, p. 68)<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-1206331212466081">20</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Competition also seems to be an important part of the Junkanoo experience. Until quite recently, in fact, Junkanoo parades would (actually) transform Bay Street into a (very real) battleground. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1206331212466081">Wood (1996)</xref> informs,
<disp-quote>
<p>until [the 1960s] Junkanoo was a time when many individuals sought vengeance for wrongs they had suffered at the hands of others during the past year. Bay Street became the battlefield, and cowbells became the weapons . . . [they] also used as weapons whips to the ends of which they had attached dried testicles of bulls. (p. 111)<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-1206331212466081">21</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Today, Junkanoo is a different kind of battle. Groups now compete against one another for bragging rights and prize money.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-1206331212466081">22</xref></sup> “Like the scrap gangs before them,” <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1206331212466081">N. Bethel (2003a</xref>, p. 51) writes, “the primary intention of these young men was not to fight on Bay Street, but to compete for prizes.” The hostility between members and supporters of the different groups, however, is every bit as real (at least during the run up to the parades) as it was in years past. “Groups,” as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1206331212466081">Wood (1996)</xref> explains,
<disp-quote>
<p>boast of their skills and demean those of other groups, fuelling the tension between the groups. This “enmity” increases as Boxing Day draws closer. . . . In order to foster unity within the group and to establish a competitive frame of mind, members of one group develop a hostile attitude toward members of other groups. (pp. 113-114)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>But, like the temporary occupation of Bay Street that occurs during Junkanoo, the hostility between members of the different groups typically dissipates once the parades are done. “Once the parades are over,” <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1206331212466081">Wood (1996</xref>, p. 115) writes, “the enmity subsides and members of ‘warring’ groups participate in <italic>rush-outs</italic> and local and international performances. The sense of unity at these times is amazing.”</p>
<p>Junkanoo, perhaps even more than the riot, highlights (and engenders the view) that Bay Street is a site for and a product of both social union and social disruption. Junkanoo, this key Bahamian experience which brings together Bahamians of all stripes, also transforms Bay Street into a hotly contested space where Blacks attempt to challenge White economic hegemony; where spectators and Junkanoos remain separated by barricades; where groups struggle to confine their creativity and spontaneity within the rules governing the parades and the limits of its current venue; where Bahamians fight to retain Junkanoo’s authenticity while government officials, hoteliers, and others try to profit from the parades (commodifying and marketing it); and strikingly where groups (originally groups from different neighborhoods) battle one another.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Bay Street continues to be a space that is at the center of political, economic, and social life in The Bahamas. It continues to be both a field for many of the important events that occur in The Bahamas and the basis, the impetus, for many of those events. The semiannual Junkanoo festivals and the 1942 riot are just a few examples. “Black Tuesday,” which occurred 25 years after the riot, is another.</p>
<p>Bay Street has remained the space of power and protest in The Bahamas. Recently, for instance, the College of The Bahamas Union of Students marched to Bay Street from their campus in Oakes Field to insist that the government be given a voice in the selection of the college’s next president. Bay Street also continues to be Junkanoo space and so a space where Bahamian identity work occurs. A number of important Bahamian festivals and ceremonies occur on Bay Street besides Junkanoo (i.e., state funerals, religious parades, Christmas concerts).</p>
<p>Additionally, so much of the “everyday life” of the Bahamian people has taken place on Bay Street. Over the years, Bay Street has hosted a diverse and complex cast of characters: the Bay Street Boys; throngs of Bahamian consumers and salespeople; the politicians, judges, police officers, and other government officials who are all headquartered there; millions of cruise ship passengers on their too brief sojourns in paradise; straw market and street vendors hawking their wares; colorfully costumed Bahamians parading down the street during their semiannual celebration of Junkanoo; thousands of Bahamian workers rushing from their homes at the east end of the island to their offices in the west; campaigners, demonstrators, strikers, and rioters who typically descend on Bay Street to demand redress when they feel aggrieved; and the angry ghosts of too many Africans sold into slavery in the auction house, now a museum, that marks the beginning of downtown Bay Street.</p>
<p>Bay Street is surely a site for and a product of both social union and social disruption. The 1942 riot, Junkanoo, Black Tuesday, and the range of other political and social events that have occurred on Bay Street coupled with its role as an economic space and a tourist space (which we only hinted at in this piece) have turned Bay Street into a space of power, of protest, of expression, and have produced a space where Bahamians are both connected and separated. As such, it reminds us that contested space need not just be sites of conflict but can also be sites which bring people together.</p>

<p>Bahamians celebrate Labour Day on the first Monday of June every year, commemorating the riot.

Many have described the riot as the first in a series of increasingly vocal sociopolitical responses by the Black Bahamian masses to the system of apartheid which prevailed in The Bahamas at the time. And, so see it as the beginning of the political movement that eventually led to Black majority rule and independence.</p>

<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1206331212466081">Lefebvre (1991)</xref> has, similarly, conceived of social space as both the basis for all social activity and the result of spatial practice. He has also tried to express how spaces can simultaneously be the stage for and the result of spatial practices which connect and separate people. For instance, he described “capitalist space” as “whole and broken, global and fractured, at one and the same time” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1206331212466081">Lefebvre, 1991</xref>, pp. 355-356).

<p>It makes sense to focus on the riot and Junkanoo because of the sociohistorical significance of these events in the country. The 1942 riot on Bay Street, as stated before, was the first sign of political awakening among Bahamian Blacks. And, the first time that they openly attacked Bay Street. Similarly, Junkanoo, which occurs on Bay Street, is the most important cultural event in The Bahamas.</p>

<p>Roland Symonette (<italic>Russell Commission</italic>, 1942, p. 490), for instance, argued that the police and military should have used heavy artillery and opened fire on the crowd. For him, Bay Street should have been protected at all cost.</p>

<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1206331212466081">Wisdom (1985)</xref> has profitably used Goffman’s theories of to interpret Junkanoo. “Goffman’s theories on social encounters and ‘regions,’” <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1206331212466081">Wisdom (1985</xref>, p. 3) writes, “are particularly helpful in describing the function and use of the spaces, the performance settings, in which ‘acting out’ occurs in contemporary face-to-face social interactions.” Unfortunately, his focus is not on festivals but on the drama of everyday life where “teams” of individuals like actors in a play perform certain roles, follow scripts, wear costumes, and act on stages as they engage in a joint effort to convince each other and the audience of the truth of their performances. Lefebvre, however, took a particular interest in festivals like Junkanoo. He saw festivals as a way for people to combat their disaffection with everyday life. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1206331212466081">Merrifield (2006</xref>, p. 14) explains, Lefebvre saw (rural) festivals as “the veritable nemesis of insurgent form of modern alienation” and “paradigms of an authentic everyday life, a realm where the shackles of enslavement had been loosened.” Festivals strengthen social relationships, give voice to “pent up” desires, and allow individuals to step out of the drudgery of everyday life, to take off their masks, to become themselves. For Lefebvre, “festivals were like everyday life, only more intense, more graphic, more raw. During festivals, people dropped their veils and stopped performing, ignored authority and let rip” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1206331212466081">Merrifield, 2006</xref>, p. 14).</p>

<p>Of course this is not true for all Bahamians and is not even true for all Nassuvians. Some eschew the crowds preferring to watch it on television. Some are unhappy with recent developments in the style of costumes or music, the parade route, and the size of the event and so no longer attend Junkanoo festivals, seeing them as events that they attended when they were younger or that are now meant for tourists. Some never had that connection to Junkanoo in the first place. Still, no other event in The Bahamas could make the kinds of claims to centrality in Bahamian life as can Junkanoo.</p>

<p>The government scrapped their plans to move Junkanoo off of Bay Street in 1989 and every major Junkanoo parade since then has taken place on Bay Street. The smaller and now annual Junior Junkanoo parades, however, have occurred in the Queen Elizabeth Sports Center.</p>
</fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn21-1206331212466081">
<label>21.</label>
<p>Now, the parades follow a circular route, down Bay Street, then Elizabeth Avenue and Shirley Street, returning to Bay Street via Frederick Street. In the past, however, the parade went up one side of Bay Street and then down the other. As groups passed one another they not only tried to outperform opposing groups but would often tussle.</p>

<p>Lovelace’s <italic>The Dragon Can’t Dance</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1206331212466081">1998</xref>) offers a similar description of how poor and disadvantaged Trinidadians participate in and compete against one another in the annual Carnival celebrations as a way of gaining status and respect by creating magnificent costumes and dancing beautifully. The revelers in Lovelace’s novel, however, worry about the commercialization of Carnival that is occurring in Trinidad to make it an event more oriented toward tourists. Scholars have expressed a similar concern. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1206331212466081">Aching (2002)</xref>, for instance, describes how post-Independence states in the Caribbean have captured and transformed carnival into a commodity robbing it of its ability to combat the alienation of everyday life. Many Bahamians have, similarly, worried about the commercialization of Junkanoo. See also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1206331212466081">Martin and Storr (2009a)</xref>.</p>
