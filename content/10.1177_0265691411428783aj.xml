<p>The three-volume <italic>Cambridge History of the Cold War</italic> (CHCW) is an important investment in the field of Cold War studies which offers – after 20 years – a comprehensive overview of the era that influenced so many people’s life in so many different ways. Although the Cold War era is clearly past, the Cold War still has implications for the contemporary world; it influences our thinking, identities, communication and culture.</p>
<p>This three-volume history is a large, multinational research project, involving 73 contributors from 18 different countries, and providing almost 2000 pages of thoroughly weighed information about the Cold War from different perspectives. This is indeed a heavy package of Cold War history. With this in mind, the CHCW is reviewed here as a whole, concentrating on the main ideas and without focusing on individual chapters.</p>
<p>The CHCW claims to be the first comprehensive historical re-examination of the Cold War period from the beginning until the very end, and to provide ‘a transformation of the field from a national – primarily American – to a broader international approach’, aiming at the same time at illuminating ‘the causes, dynamics, and consequences of the Cold War’. The editors seek to relate the Cold War to its influence on the international system today, and all the contributions aim to go beyond the diplomatic affairs and delve deeper into social, economic and intellectual history in order to understand the evolution that took place during the Cold War era and why the Cold War ended.</p>
<p>The context for the research is the bipolar conflict. The research agenda is extremely wide, focusing on a variety of geographical angles, not only the United States and the Soviet Union but also Europe, Asia and other ‘critical regions’ of the Cold War era, from the national level to the global context. This is an important aspect of this work, given that ‘traditional’ or ‘mainstream’ Cold War research has mainly focused on the higher echelons of political decision-making in the international arena of the Cold War. Here, other actors and different levels have been taken into account; transnational organizations beyond the superpower politics, as well as different levels of investigation, are present in the chapters, and the perspective varies from the analysis of individual states to wider – even global – trends. This brings to the fore those actors that were not at the core of Cold War policy-making but were nonetheless extremely important for the overall development of the Cold War.</p>
<p>The research agenda of the volumes gives due weight to Eastern Europe. As the preface observes: ‘the Cold War has gradually become history’; in other words there is enough distance to look back and analyse what the Cold War era was all about from a critical and less biased point of view. The emergence of the Eastern view is a part of this process: a full picture of the Cold War era requires all the parties to the conflict to be present – East and West, at all the different levels. From this point of view, the CHCW is as serious as it is ambitious, with chapters focusing not only on the Eastern bloc but also on Asia, Africa, the Far East and South America. The themes and topics range from the history of diplomacy and the arms race, to culture, consumption and the biosphere.</p>
<p>All three volumes have a clearly-defined chronology and structure. Volume I, <italic>Origins</italic>, focuses on the early years of the Cold War, and aims at elucidating ‘how it evolved from the geopolitical, ideological, economic, and socio-political environment of the two World Wars and the interwar era’. It focuses on foreign policy, economy and the main actors of the early years of the Cold War, in order to find out how markets, ideas and cultural interaction affected political discourse, diplomacy, and strategy after the World War II. It considers ‘influential statesmen’ and the roles they played at the start of the Cold War, but also strives to take account of the lower levels of the societies involved. Although the volume does not fully achieve its ambition to ‘illuminate how people experienced the increasing bipolarization of the world’, it introduces new perspectives and ideas.</p>
<p>Volume II, <italic>Crises and Détente</italic>, ‘examines the developments that made the conflict between the United States and the Soviet Union a long-lasting international system during the 1960s and 1970s’. The chapters focus on the development of détente; how the Cuban crisis in 1962 stabilized into the period of detente during the early 1970s. The volume concentrates especially on foreign policy, that is, key crises during the 1960s and 1970s and includes chapters that go beyond this theme, drawing on cultural aspects of the Cold War and introducing topics such as counter culture and human rights. The focus broadens from Europe to the wider world with special emphasis on the third world, looking at the important role of economics during the détente period, both in relation to the socio-political aspects of the Cold War and to East–West competition.</p>
<p>Volume III, <italic>Endings</italic>, covers the period from the Helsinki conference in 1975 until the end in 1991. The focus is on the key leaders, their personalities and policies, during the last phase of the Cold War. Although political leaders were important actors at the end of the Cold War, other factors, political, economic, cultural and geopolitical, played their part. In this final phase, new and different issues began to influence the evolution of the Cold War, and the scale of events and dynamics had become global. The outcome of the Helsinki process, human rights, non-governmental organizations and environmental issues came to the fore and started to influence people’s attitudes. This volume has benefited greatly from the new archival materials which have been becoming accessible to researchers. But new archival evidence is not the main factor in shaping the new directions of research. New approaches, new topics and new questions are also needed. From this perspective, the references in this volume are extremely valuable, as they allow the reader to evaluate the information and arguments presented in the chapters. This, of course, is a double-edged sword from the point of view of the contributor: the reader will seize on innovative approaches and/or new materials, and be dissatisfied with old questions from old materials. The utility of the volumes is further enhanced by the bibliographical essays they each contain. These selective and critical essays – surveying the latest literature on the specific topic and providing full bibliographical information – are extremely useful.</p>
<p>The Cold War is perhaps even more fascinating today than it was during the Cold War era. The research field is widening outside the history of international relations and diplomacy as new and young researchers, topics and approaches emerge. An emphasis on cultural and social questions are bringing about change in Cold War research and filling out our picture of the complex structure of the Cold War era. A strongly bipolarized view during the Cold War era, and the unipolar approach of the years immediately after the collapse of the Soviet Union were important parts in the evolution of the field. We are now moving towards ‘multi-voiced’ research agendas and new questions, of which this three-volume set provides a good example.</p>
