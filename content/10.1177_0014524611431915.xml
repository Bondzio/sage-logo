<p>When I was in Paris last year I went with a friend to the Museé National du Moyen Age, a museum stuffed with all things medieval located in the former city residence of the monks of Cluny. Top of our must see list was the famous and beautiful tapestry of the Lady and the Unicorn, which, of course, did not disappoint. But there was much more. For me the most surprising, and intriguing, exhibit was a painted wooden sculpture of Jesus mounted on a donkey, on wheels. It was entitled <italic>Christ des Rameaux</italic>, Christ of the Branches, and was dated to 15<sup>th</sup> century Germany.</p>
<p>It was made for use in Palm Sunday processions. Such processions have an ancient pedigree. In 4<sup>th</sup> century Jerusalem the beginning of Holy Week was marked by a palm procession from the Mount of Olives to the city. The practice eventually spread throughout Europe but in 10<sup>th</sup> century Germany a new element was added – the figure of Jesus on a donkey mounted on a wheeled platform. The wheels enabled the whole ensemble to be pulled along at the front of the Palm Sunday procession. The extraordinarily intact example of this in Paris offers a window on medieval piety. (Indeed, the use of such statues or <italic>santos</italic> in processions is still common in Spanish Catholic contexts.)</p>
<p>But, I have to say, stuck in the corner of a museum this Christ and the donkey on wheels looks like an oversized children’s toy. The donkey’s large ears point to the sky in a characteristically startled stance, like two exclamation marks. Jesus himself seems rather precariously balanced – stiff (wooden I suppose) and upright, his legs directed straight toward the earth (there are no stirrups), his feet bare. He has one hand held up in blessing while the other is gripped around an absent rope. His pale face, more Germanic than Semitic, is marked by an expression of nervousness, I think. Three gold painted wooden rays are stuck behind his head to suggest a nimbus. A bit tacky. But it was the platform and wheels that really struck me, to the point of discomfort. It made the whole thing seem ridiculous. But now, reading Mark’s account of Jesus’ entry into Jerusalem again I have begun to think that my discomfort is not such a bad thing.</p>
<p>In recent years the emphasis on this sixth Sunday in Lent has shifted away from Palm to Passion. When I was growing up, Palm Sunday seemed as upbeat as Easter Day and Good Friday: a minor glitch in the whole Easter story. Now we read the Palm Gospel as we gather for our own processions, while at the centre of our liturgy on this Sunday is the solemn reading of the Passion narrative. Quite often there is (understandably) no sermon! But there is a loss here in not pausing over this extraordinary and rather strange story of Jesus riding into Jerusalem on a donkey.</p>
<p>For a start this is the only time in the Gospel that we hear of Jesus using this means of transport. He walks mostly, except for the times we find him travelling in fishing boats on the Sea of Galilee. This riding into town is an exceptional thing in Jesus’ life. Indeed, riding on the back of a donkey or camel or horse would have been an exceptional thing for the average inhabitant of 1<sup>st</sup> century Palestine. Certainly the majority of pilgrims that came to Jerusalem to celebrate the Feast of the Passover would have walked. It is clear that, whatever it might mean, Jesus made a deliberate choice to enter Jerusalem in this way.</p>
<p>The story of Jesus’ entry into Jerusalem is found in each of the four Gospels, with minor variations, marking the beginning of the events which lead to his trial and crucifixion. Traditionally the story is known as the “triumphal entry” – and we often think of it as the moment when the Jesus is definitively recognised as the messiah - by a crowd that turns on him within the week. (Though in the Gospel of Mark Jesus is hailed not as Son of David or King, but is simply greeted with the words “Blessed is the kingdom of our father David that is coming.” As Jesus rides into town the air is certainly filled with messianic expectations, but as the story unfolds we find the nature of this kingship radically redefined.)</p>
<p>What did Jesus think he was doing? We can never know for certain of course, but his action resonates with the sorts of symbolic actions that we find amongst the prophets before him. It is a performance, closest perhaps to a piece of street theatre. As it plays out, and as the early Christian community reflected on it later, this event overflows with meaning.</p>
<p>Jesus’ choice of a young donkey or colt is a clear messianic signal. The Gospel of Matthew makes this plain by quoting the prophecy of Zechariah:</p>
<p>
<disp-quote><p>Tell the daughter of Zion,</p>
<p>Behold your king is coming to you,</p>
<p>humble, and mounted on an ass,</p>
<p>and on a colt, the foal of an ass.</p></disp-quote>
</p>
<p>The branches cut from trees and spread out before Jesus recall, perhaps, the victorious entry of Simon Maccabeus into the citadel at Jerusalem (1 Maccabees 13.49-52) or the feast of the Tabernacles when the temple was rededicated after the victory of Judas Maccabeus (2 Maccabees 10.1-8) – events whose memory must have been close to the surface. The crowd greet Jesus with words from Psalm 118, one of psalms of praise and thanksgiving recited at Passover: “Hosanna - Save us …Blessed is the one who comes in the name of the Lord” (25-26). Liberation is at hand.</p>
<p>But if the scene is positively groaning with the resonances of Jewish religious and political events, this is not all. There are the Romans. Marcus Borg and Dominic Crossan have suggested that this was not the only procession in Jerusalem that day. On the other side of Jerusalem, they claim, Pontius Pilate was entering the city at the head of a military cohort – reinforcements for the week of the Passover, a festival that dangerously celebrated the story of liberation from another empire. While it is impossible to prove this it makes a great deal of sense. Passover was undoubtedly a time of tension in this occupied country.</p>
<p>Regardless, Jesus’ procession evokes a bigger history of “triumphal entries” in the ancient world. Hans Leander argues that Jesus’ entry is a mimicry or parody of the celebratory welcomes given to conquers, or liberators, as they symbolically take the city. Jesus is greeted and hailed by citizens and escorted to the city. But there is one difference. Typically a triumphal entry ended in a temple with a ritual of either cleansing or thanksgiving. In Mark’s Gospel Jesus’ entry ends with an anti-climax: he looks around the temple and returns to Bethany. In fact, the completion of this “triumphal entry” takes place in the days and events that follow. When Jesus breathes his last the curtain of the temple is torn in two and a Roman soldier declares, “Truly this man was God’s Son” (Mark 15.37-39).</p>
<p>If Jesus’ triumphal entry is a parody of sorts, the wheels on the statue in the Musée du Moyen Age no longer seem out of place. It is indeed an outsized children’s toy. A prop. Our own processions, often gauche and childlike, are an imitation, not of a slick imperial victory parade, but of a piece of improvised street theatre. And this is as it should be. “Let the little children come to me; do not stop them;” Jesus said, “for it is to such as these that the kingdom of God belongs.” (Mark 10.14) It is a strange but potent combination of courage and considered innocence that impels Jesus to mount that donkey. And he invites us to do the same.</p>
