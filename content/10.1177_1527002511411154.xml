<p><italic>Frontiers in Major League Baseball</italic> is a collection of articles centered on the use of data envelopment analysis (DEA) to analyze Major League Baseball (MLB). The book consists of an introduction, a presentation of DEA methodology, and eight chapters applying DEA to baseball using MLB data. The DEA identifies best-practice technology by fitting a nonparametric frontier to the outside or perimeter of a dataset. This is particularly appealing when measuring the efficiency characteristics of managerial and front office choices or when identifying players who excel at a position.</p>
<p>Technical efficiency in production implies that one cannot increase output without increasing inputs. Allocative efficiency implies that one cannot lower cost without reducing output. A simple application can highlight DEA. Suppose for illustration that runs are produced exclusively by team slugging average (SLG) and the manager’s decision where to place players in the lineup. Then, if manager A’s team has a SLG of, say, .750 and averages three runs per game while manager B with the same team SLG produces, on average, four runs per game, manager B is better (more efficient) at designing the lineup. Manager A is technically inefficient having failed to get the most out of his inputs. Similarly, if Team X manages to win 81 games per season with a payroll of $50 million while team Y spends $100 million and also wins 81 games, the general manager (front office) of team X is allocatively more efficient. If manager B (or general manager X) is better than every other manager (general manager) DEA identifies him as “best practice” manager (front office) and measures all others against his performance. Dominance has the same flavor as technical and allocative efficiency. One player dominates all others when his performance is superior in every category to that of the other players. If there is only one player output, dominance is easy to measure. In a homerun derby the only thing that matters is homeruns and the winner dominates. Of course, there is a lot more that goes into scoring runs than just SLG and lineup, more than just payroll that produces wins, and more aspects of a hitter than just homeruns that are important. Once the production function is specified, DEA can be used to identify the best practice manager and front office. And, once hitter (or pitcher) outputs are identified, DEA can be used to identify dominant players.</p>
<p>Having outlined DEA in greater detail in Chapter 2 of <italic>Frontiers</italic> than I have above, Ruggiero tackles team or managerial efficiency in Chapter 3—where he defines output as wins, offensive inputs as team on-base-percentage (OPB) and SLG, and team defensive inputs as one minus the opposing teams OBP and SLG—and analyzes the 2009 season. In the American League East, my beloved Rays tied for last with Toronto while the Yankees were among the best practice teams in MLB.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1527002511411154">1</xref></sup> You will need to read the book to see how your team fared. The author makes a necessary adaptation of the standard DEA model for sports applications where wins is the measure of output. This is necessitated by the fact that one team’s inefficiency results in another team’s apparent superiority since one team’s loss is another team’s victory. One point that is missing is a discussion of the limitations of team inefficiency in this kind of application. Suppose a team mistakenly starts a right-handed pitcher against a team that is very good at hitting right-handed pitchers and leaves its best left-handed pitcher on the bench. If, as a result, the ill-matched pitcher yields an OBP of .500 and SLG 1.000, DEA will measure this as a low-valued input rather than a poor team decision. That is, performance is assumed to be independent of managerial decisions.</p>
<p>In Chapter 4, the author analyzes cost efficiency. With wins as the output and payroll as the cost it would seem easy to measure efficiency as wins per dollar, but such a measure assumes constant returns to scale in producing wins from payroll while in fact there are decreasing returns to talent (or the marginal cost of talent increases with the talent of the player). This requires adjustment to the DEA model. In addition, the profound role that outliers play in determining the DEA frontier is explored. When it is all done, the Rays with a payroll of $63.3 million and 84 wins are seen to be as efficient as the Yankees with a payroll of $201.4 million and 103 wins. Those extra wins were expensive. Of course, injuries play an important role when trying to convert payroll to wins and this is not counted in the DEA analysis. In 2009, the Yankees lost 682 player-days to injury.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1527002511411154">2</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>Chapters 5 through 10 look at player dominance. Hitters in Chapter 5 are evaluated by their production of “singles plus” (singles + hit-by-pitch + base-on-balls), doubles, triples, and homeruns. By design, the leaders in each category are defined as dominant as are any players on the line segment connecting the four-dimensional performances of each category leader. There are nine dominant players including Derek Jeter and 2009’s National League MVP, Albert Pujols. The American League’s MVP, Joe Mauer, was not among the nine. The chapter ends with an interesting application comparing the measure of dominance to a player’s salary to identify “bargains.” With the highest payroll in MLB there were no bargains on the Yankees. Chapter 6 evaluates pitchers in the same way. Pitchers were considered to produce innings pitched, innings pitched per earned run, and innings pitched per hit. There were six dominant starting pitchers and Tim Lincecum was identified as the best bargain. Among relief pitchers three dominated and all three, with salaries in the low $400,000s, were considered bargains.</p>
<p>Chapter 7 uses DEA to analyze free agency and the arbitration contract zone. This application is new to me. It identifies a zone with upper and lower frontiers. With salary measured vertically and efficiency (dominance) horizontally, the lower frontier reflects the team’s desire to hire talent at the lowest price and the upper frontier reflect the player’s desire to be the highest paid player for any given level of talent. Players are analyzed according to their defensive position (starting pitchers, relief pitchers, catchers, etc.) and a measure of their relative contract position (how far up the scale is a player’s salary relative to the lower and upper frontier for his measure of dominance) is calculated for free agents. While some players must, by design, define the frontier, it is interesting to note that most players receive only a small fraction of the difference between the lower and upper frontier. Perhaps this reflects the relative bargaining strength of owners or the risk aversion of players who sign rather than fight for higher salaries.</p>
<p>Chapter 8 applies DEA to the Hall of Fame. It identifies the top Hall of Fame players of all time as well as the worst. Lou Gehrig is identified as the best hitter of all time. Babe Ruth is third. Ernie Lombardi has the ignoble honor of being the lowest rated hitter in the Hall of Fame, even after adjusting for the fact he was a catcher. Not surprisingly, Cy Young was the top rated pitcher. The chapter identifies candidates deserving of induction as those whose ratings are above the median for players in the Hall of Fame at their position. Pedro Martinez is the highest rated pitcher not yet in the Hall of Fame. Pete Rose is second among first basemen to Todd Helton and Joe Jackson is the top rated Leftfielder.</p>
<p>An interesting application of DEA to steroid use among hitters is the subject of Chapter 9. Ruggiero compares the age profile of performance efficiency for players before the steroid era (prior to the 1980s) with that of known steroid users in the modern era to attempt to draw some conclusions concerning steroids' effect on performance and to help identify suspected steroid use among other modern era hitters. In the presteroid era players reached their peak performance years at about age 30 (e.g., Ruth = 30.4; Aaron = 28.1; Mays = 29.9; Schmidt = 31.1; and Rose = 31.8). All had typical age profiles showing (in fitted regression lines) improvements until their peak age and declines thereafter. On the other hand, known steroid users achieved their peaks at younger years, presumably because steroids accelerate muscle development, and had significant positive outliers well past their primes (e.g., Dykstra = 27.2; McGwire = 27.8; Conseco = 26.6; and Giambi = 29.0). In addition, steroid users had less predictable performance profiles with multiple peaks and valleys. Did Barry Bonds use steroids? In his early career, his profile was consistent with those of history’s best hitters, improving steadily until Age 30. However, Bonds profile does not deteriorate. Rather he continues to dominate until Age 40. It’s not proof, but Bonds is at best an outlier.</p>
<p>Chapter 10 presents a similar analysis of steroid use among pitchers. Most star pitchers of the presteroid era reach their peak performance at about Age 31 (e.g., Young = 32.0; Johnson = 29.6; Spahn = 33.0; Ford = 30.3; and Seaver = 31.4). All had rather smooth profiles identified by regression analysis. Admitted or implicated steroid users reached their peak performance years at roughly the same age, but had significant numbers of performance well above the profile for presteroid era pitchers later in their careers. Paul Byrd’s MLB career did not really get off the ground until he was 29-years-old and he improved steadily until Age 35. Kevin Brown had his best years relative to the profile when he was approaching 40. Roger Clemens' and Chuck Finley’s profiles look like twin peaks; falling in their early 30s and then resurging until they approached Age 40. While the implications for steroid use presented in the last two chapters are intriguing, the author points out that it is not evidence.</p>
<p>All in all, this book is worth reading. It should appeal to the egg-headed DEA user, to the sports economist, and to baseball aficionados if they skip the technical parts. It has only one significant flaw. It confounds the author of this review with Darrell Porter, giving the latter credit in the Index for my 1982 article with Jerry Scully that is cited on page 3. I could overlook this if John Ruggiero had mistakenly given me credit for Darrel Porter’s performance.</p>
