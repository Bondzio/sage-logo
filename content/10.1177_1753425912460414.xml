<abstract>
<p>Retinoic acid inducible gene-I (RIG-I) is critical in the activation of the type I IFN-dependent antiviral innate immune response to hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. We examined whether hepatic stellate cells (HSC; LX-2) possess a functional RIG-I signaling pathway and produce antiviral factors that can inhibit HCV. We showed that LX-2 cells treated with the RIG-I ligand (5′ppp-dsRNA) expressed significantly higher levels of IFN-β and IFN-λ than the control cells. The RIG-I activation in LX-2 cells also induced the expression of Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) and IFN regulatory factor-7 (IRF-7), the key regulators of the IFN signaling pathway. When HCV Japanese fulminant hepatitis (JFH)-1-infected hepatocytes were co-cultured with LX-2 cells stimulated with 5′ppp-dsRNA or incubated in media conditioned with supernatant (SN) from 5′ppp-dsRNA-stimulated LX-2 cells, HCV replication in hepatocytes was suppressed significantly. This LX-2 cell action on HCV replication was mediated through both IFN-β and IFN-λ, as Abs to IFN-α/β or IFN-λ receptors could neutralize the LX-2 SN-mediated anti-HCV effect. The role of IFNs in LX-2 cell-mediated anti-HCV activity is further supported by the observation that LX-2 SN treatment induced the expression of IFN stimulated genes, 2′-5′-oligoadenylate synthase-1 (OAS-1) and myxovirus resistance A (MxA), in HCV-infected Huh7 cells. These observations highlight the importance of HSC in liver innate immunity against HCV infection via a RIG-I-mediated signaling pathway.</p>

<p>Hepatic stellate cells (HSC) are liver pericytes that reside in the space between parenchymal cells and sinusoidal endothelial cells of the human liver. HSC are rich in vitamin A and store nearly 80% of retinoids of the whole body in its lipid droplets in the cytoplasm.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1753425912460414">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1753425912460414">2</xref></sup> In normal liver, HSC are in a quiescent state and represent 5–8% of the total number of liver cells.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1753425912460414">2</xref></sup> HSC become activated following liver injury, and activated HSC enhanced migration and deposition of extracellular matrix components, resulting in liver fibrosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1753425912460414">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1753425912460414">4</xref></sup> Recent evidence indicated that HSC play a role in the innate immune system of the liver. It was reported that HSC could function as liver-resident antigen-presenting cell (APC) that present lipid antigens to Natural killer T (NKT) cells, inducing cell proliferation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1753425912460414">5</xref></sup> HSC can act as regulatory bystanders, enhancing differentiation and accumulation of regulatory T cells (Tregs), which may be the basis of the tolerogenic nature of the liver.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1753425912460414">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>The interaction between hepatitis C virus (HCV) and the innate immunity system in liver plays a key role in the immunopathogenesis of HCV disease. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and the retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I)-like receptors (RLRs) are major cellular receptors that recognize viral pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) during viral infection.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1753425912460414">7</xref></sup> Several TLR members play a critical role in the recognition of viral nucleic acids.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1753425912460414">8</xref></sup> Among these TLRs, TLR3 has a crucial role in virus-mediated innate immune responses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1753425912460414">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1753425912460414"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1753425912460414">11</xref></sup> as it recognizes dsRNA that either constitutes the genome of one class of viruses or is generated during the lifecycle of viruses.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1753425912460414">12</xref></sup> IFN-α/β have been recognized as the first line of the TLR3 activation-mediated antiviral response.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1753425912460414">13</xref></sup> In addition to TLR3, the RLR family has been reported as an important mediator of antiviral immunity. RIG-I can detect viral genomic RNA during negative-strand RNA virus infection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1753425912460414">14</xref></sup> and trigger a type I IFN-mediated immune response that protects the host against viral infection.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1753425912460414">15</xref></sup> RIG-I plays an important role in HCV genome recognition, resulting in activation of the type I IFN-dependent antiviral innate immune response to restrict HCV infection.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1753425912460414">16</xref></sup></p>
<p>Because the majority of HCV-infected subjects develop chronic infection, it is likely that HCV uses complex and unique mechanisms to evade or subvert host innate immunity to establish persistent infection. In order to counteract the host cell innate immunity viruses use mechanisms to block recognition and signaling of TLRs and RIG-I. Studies of HCV–host interactions have revealed that HCV protease NS3/4A ablates TLR3 signaling by cleaving the TLR3 adaptor protein, Toll-IL-1 receptor domain-containing adaptor inducing IFN-β (TRIF),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1753425912460414">17</xref></sup> and blocks RIG-I signaling by cleaving mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS) off the mitochondria.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1753425912460414">18</xref></sup> Thus, to activate TLRs and/or RIG-I by their ligands represents a promising approach for the treatment of HCV infection. Whilst most studies have focused on the interactions between liver immune cells and HCV, there is limited information about whether other residential cells in the liver participate in innate immune responses to HCV infection of hepatocytes. Specifically, we know little about whether HSC possess functional RIG-I signaling pathway and produce anti-HCV factors. Therefore, this study examined whether HSC have the ability to mount a RIG-I-mediated innate immunity that is effective in the control of HCV infection of human hepatocytes.</p>

<p>We first examined whether LX-2 cells or SN from LX-2 cell cultures (LX-2 SN) had a cytotoxicity effect on Huh7 cells. Little cytotoxic effect was observed in Huh7 cells either co-cultured with LX-2 cells stimulated with or without 5′ppp-dsRNA or treated with LX-2 SN (data not shown). We then determined whether LX-2 cells stimulated with 5′ppp-dsRNA release soluble antiviral factor(s) that suppresses HCV replication in Huh7 cells. We demonstrated that 5′ppp-dsRNA had little effect on HCV JFH-1 replication in Huh7 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1753425912460414">Figure 1A</xref>). In contrast, HCV replication was significantly inhibited in Huh7 cells co-cultured with LX-2 cells stimulated with 5′ppp-dsRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1753425912460414">Figure 1B</xref>). In addition, SN from 5′ppp-dsRNA-stimulated LX-2 cell cultures, when added to HCV JFH-1-infected Huh7 cells, inhibited viral RNA expression in a concentration-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1753425912460414">Figure 1C</xref>). We further examined the anti-HCV activity of LX-2 SN under three different conditions: Huh7 cells were incubated with LX-2 SN either 24 h before HCV infection, simultaneously with HCV infection or 8 h after infection. Cells that were pretreated for 24 h with 10% (v/v) of LX-2 SN and then infected had significantly lower levels of HCV RNA than untreated and infected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1753425912460414">Figure 1D</xref>). Similarly, cells treated with LX-2 SN and infected simultaneously or after 8 h HCV JFH-1 infection also had significantly lower levels of HCV RNA than the control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1753425912460414">Figure 1D</xref>). LX-2 SN-mediated inhibition of HCV replication was also confirmed by diminished percentage of HCV core antigen-positive cells in JFH-1-infected Huh7 cells treated with LX-2 SN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1753425912460414">Figure 1E</xref>).

<p>RIG-I is a key regulator in the IFN signaling pathway. Thus, we examined whether 5′ppp-dsRNA can trigger IFN production in HCV JFH-1-infected Huh7 cells.

<p>The interactions between HCV and the innate immunity system in liver play a key role in the consequences of HCV infection. HCV persistent infection is associated with its ability to evade the host immune response and counteract antiviral defenses. RIG-I as a pattern recognition receptor plays an important role in liver innate immunity against HCV infection. RIG-I recognizes viral dsRNA and induces downstream signals, leading to IFN-α/β production.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1753425912460414">15</xref></sup> Although RIG-I operates independently of the TLRs,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1753425912460414">25</xref></sup> RIG-I signaling culminates in the induction of the type I IFN response, one of the earliest alarm bells of the immune system, which inhibits viral replication without killing infected cells.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1753425912460414">26</xref></sup> It has been demonstrated that the HCV PAMP RNA-stimulated RIG-I-dependent signaling induced a hepatic innate immune response <italic>in vivo</italic>, leading to IFN and ISG expression that suppresses HCV infection.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1753425912460414">16</xref></sup> This RIG-I signaling, however, could be blocked by HCV protease NS3/4 A, which has the ability to cleave MAVS off the mitochondria.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1753425912460414">18</xref></sup></p>
<p>We demonstrated that HSC possess functional RIG-I that can be activated by the RIG-I ligand, resulting in the induction of IFNs and inhibition of HCV replication in hepatocytes. This RIG-I signaling-mediated anti-HCV activity is potent, as SN from RIG-I-activated HSC cell cultures showed anti-HCV activity under three different conditions (before, during and after infection) in HCV JFH-1-infected Huh7 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1753425912460414">Figure 1D</xref>). In contrast, 5′ppp-dsRNA direct stimulation of HCV-infected Huh7 cells failed to inhibit virus replication (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1753425912460414">Figure 1A</xref>), which supports the report that HCV has the ability to inhibit RIG-I signaling in infected hepaotcytes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1753425912460414">18</xref></sup> These data suggest that RIG-I activation-based therapeutic approaches may not be effective in the control of HCV in infected hepatocytes. Therefore, RIG-I signaling of liver bystander cells that can produce antiviral factors is now becoming the focus of research. We demonstrated that RIG-I-activated LX-2 cells produced IFN-β. The role of IFN-β in RIG-I-mediated HCV inhibition was evidenced by the observation that Abs to IFN-α/β receptor could compromise the LX-2-SN-mediated anti-HCV effect in Huh7 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1753425912460414">Figure 5A</xref>). The importance of the RIG-I-activated IFN signaling pathway in LX-2 cell-mediated anti-HCV activity was further demonstrated in the experiments, which showed that to knockdown RIG-I by specific siRNA could block the IFN induction of 5′ppp-dsRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1753425912460414">Figure 4</xref>).</p>
<p>In addition to the induction of IFN-β, the RIG-I signaling of LX-2 cells also induced the expression of IFN-λ. The induced IFN-λ is responsible, at least partially, for the RIG-I-mediated anti-HCV effect, as the Ab to IFN-λ receptor could block the LX-2 SN action on HCV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1753425912460414">Figure 5B</xref>).
