<abstract>
<p>This paper presents an argument for understanding the importance of emplacing knowledge production. It also argues for caution in doing so, hinting at two possible reactionary outcomes of such work: the (re)construction of competition among and between different assemblages of scholarly knowledge production and the potential for claiming innocence as a marginalized assemblage of scholarship.</p>

<body>
<p>I arrived at Auckland International Airport in early February 1992, ready to begin doctoral studies as a Commonwealth Scholar at the University of Waikato in Hamilton, Aotearoa/New Zealand. Little did I know at the time what an amazing education in geography I would receive there – in part because of the particular assemblage of heterogeneous objects, geographers, feminists, Maori academics, Maori students and institutional support for thinking geography differently – but also because of the important lessons I learned from being, quite literally, out of place. At about the same time that I was arriving in Aotearoa/New Zealand, Wendy Larner was arriving in Ottawa, Canada, to take up a Commonwealth Scholarship at Carleton University. Given subsequent discussions that we have had as well as the character of some of her own published work (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-2043820613493067">Larner, 2011</xref>), I’m pretty sure that Wendy would agree with me about the importance that being out of place has on developing a better understanding about just how emplaced and situated knowledge production is.</p>
<p>It was this very personal experience of the situatedness of knowledge that led Robin Kearns<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-2043820613493067">1</xref></sup> and I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-2043820613493067">Berg and Kearns, 1998</xref>) to argue that it was very ironic that even into the late 1990s, geographers had paid little attention to the geographies of knowledge production. Although we didn’t phrase it this way at the time, we should note that in doing so, their work often relied upon unearned Anglo-American privilege for its power in shaping wider understandings of geographic processes. Since that time, there have been more interventions focused on exposing the structural processes that underpin Anglo-American hegemony in geographic knowledge production. In this regard, authors have, for example, focused critical analysis on processes such as peer review (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-2043820613493067">Aalbers, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-2043820613493067">Berg, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-2043820613493067">Schuermans et al., 2010</xref>), academic capitalist publishing processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-2043820613493067">Berg, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-2043820613493067">Moss et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-2043820613493067">Paasi, 2005</xref>), neoliberal governmentality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-2043820613493067">Berg and Roche, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-2043820613493067">Castree et al., 2006</xref>) and especially the hegemonic political and cultural economies of knowledge circulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-2043820613493067">Aalbers, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-2043820613493067">Berg, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-2043820613493067">Garcia-Ramon, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-2043820613493067">Gregson et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-2043820613493067">Gutierrez and Lopez-Nieva, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-2043820613493067">Hones, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-2043820613493067">Rossi, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-2043820613493067">Simonsen, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-2043820613493067">Timar, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-2043820613493067">Vaiou, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Keeping the importance of these critiques of hegemonic knowledge production in mind, I think that ‘Neither here nor there or always here and there? Antipodean reflections on economic geography’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-2043820613493067">Wray et al., 2013</xref>) makes an important contribution to the understanding of geographical knowledge production, and I fully support the arguments made by the various contributors to the paper. Certainly, the importance of the emplaced character of knowledge production is revealed through a number of the compelling personal accounts of the development of particular assemblages of Antipodean economic geographies presented in that paper. Perhaps more importantly, the paper is itself an attempt to move beyond the simple binaries of here/there, metropole/periphery, dominant/subordinate, by illustrating the ways that all of these things are produced in complex assemblages that often involved the unacknowledged use of what Raewynn <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-2043820613493067">Connell (2007</xref>) terms ‘Southern Theory’ in the production of what she earlier (2006) called ‘Northern Theory’. In this regard, and as Kelly <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-2043820613493067">Dombroski (2013)</xref> argues, it is a performative piece (after <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-2043820613493067">Butler, 1990</xref>), partly bringing Southern Theory into being through the iterative descriptions of its existence.</p>
<p>Wray et al. have developed a novel way of approaching this project, but it is also important to mention that this is part of an older project to break down binary thinking about metropolitan theory and peripheral theory. Writers like Jane M. Jacobs <sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-2043820613493067">2</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-2043820613493067">1996</xref>) have already done a wonderful job in this regard by illustrating, through rich theoretical and empirical work, just how much Southern Theory has been taken up by the metropole in urban studies. I’m not sure that such binary thinking has been changed much, however. I mention this not to denigrate any of these attempts, but rather to point out the difficulty that such work might have in making a dent in hegemonic geographies and their production of scholarly ‘otherness’. This leads to a necessary discussion about how such attempts might be ‘read’ through a wider set of hegemonic practices in geography, regardless of the good intentions of the authors.</p>
<p>In recognizing the importance of this essay by Wray et al., I nonetheless want to register two concerns about the potential implications that might arise in the context of attempts to performatively (and explicitly) ‘produce’ an Antipodean economic geography. These concerns arise from my sense of how this project might be read in the wider discipline of geography, and especially within the context of hegemonic geographies and their production of scholarly otherness.</p>
<p>In discussing my concerns, I will draw on interlocking approaches (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-2043820613493067">Hill-Collins, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-2043820613493067">Jiwani, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-2043820613493067">Razack, 1998</xref>) to understanding the assemblage of both subject positions (of geographers but also of sub-disciplines) and socio-spatial relations of marginalization in knowledge production. Such interlocking approaches developed from activist and scholarly work by indigenous women and women of colour<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-2043820613493067">3</xref></sup> in the 1970s and 1980s (e.g. for the scholarly work, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-2043820613493067">Allen, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-2043820613493067">Carty, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-2043820613493067">Hill-Collins, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-2043820613493067">Lorde, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-2043820613493067">Maracle, 1988</xref>). This interlocking approach ‘…challenges singular and universal conceptualizations of identity and stresses the multiple and interlocking systems of oppression and domination operating in women’s lives’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-2043820613493067">Holmes, 2012</xref>: 21). Moreover, as Yasmeen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-2043820613493067">Jiwani (2006</xref>) and Sherene <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-2043820613493067">Razack (1998</xref>) have argued, interlocking structures not only oppress women in different ways but they also place them in hierarchical relations to one another (also see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-2043820613493067">Fellows and Razack, 1997–1998</xref>).</p>
<p>Here is my first concern: that the attempt to delineate and perform Antipodean economic geographies can be subsumed by wider hegemonic politics of knowledge production under academic capitalism, thus reinforcing the existing tendencies towards competition amongst scholars. Drawing on the interlocking thinking of the above-mentioned feminist women of colour, I want to draw attention to the fact that not only are women put into hierarchical relations with each other under interlocking forms of normative thought and practice but also that <italic>different assemblages of knowledge production</italic> – such as different national or international-but-regional scholarly traditions – are also placed in hierarchical relation to each other. Under the current forms of neoliberalizing academic governmentality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-2043820613493067">Berg, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-2043820613493067">Berg and Roche, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-2043820613493067">Castree et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-2043820613493067">Le Heron and Lewis, 2007</xref>) and academic capitalism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-2043820613493067">Paasi, 2005</xref>), these hierarchical relations are amplified in an attempt to develop a scholarly <italic>marketplace</italic>, whereby different national and supra-national scholarly assemblages are supposed to <italic>compete</italic> with one another. On the one hand, the explicit naming of a scholarly assemblage such as ‘Antipodean economic geographies’ allows for the valorization of a previously marginal set of knowledges (and knowledge producers). On the other hand, and given that this assemblage has now been produced through a new assemblage of performative procedures (such as this set of dialogues), it emerges into a set of hierarchical market relations, and helps to strengthen that market and the academic capitalism constituted by its performative production.</p>
<p>My second concern follows from my first, namely that the performative production of Antipodean economic geography, within the context of a global hierarchy of knowledge production assemblages, allows for the production of subject positions for individual scholars that can be reactionary at the very moment we think of them as being progressive. In this regard, I am concerned about the possibility that this kind of work might mistake resistance to hegemonic geography as automatically aligning with progressive politics, and in doing so could allow individual geographers the ability to claim innocence when they actually need to be cautious about their complicity with reactionary politics (and practices) in their own knowledge production. My thinking here is informed by the work of Mary Louise <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-2043820613493067">Fellows and Sherene Razack (1997–1998</xref>), who documented what they termed the ‘race to innocence’ among white feminists in North America, who used their position as women who were marginalized by hegemonic gender relations to claim innocence with respect to a host of other axes of oppression. Elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-2043820613493067">Berg, 2012</xref>: 508), I have noted a similar process among critical geographers, because we ‘understand ourselves as “more critical” than our (non-critical) colleagues, this sense of being critical produces in us a subject position that remains ignorant of the ways that we reproduce particular forms of … marginalization’. I want to suggest that the possibility for this kind of ‘race to innocence’ also exists powerfully in the context of the production of any critique of hegemonic geographies. This possibility exists in part because of the powerful way that critique produces a space of disaffiliation for its authors. That works through what Robyn <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-2043820613493067">Wiegman (1999</xref>) terms ‘white liberal disaffiliation’. First, and as I have argued elsewhere (in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-2043820613493067">Castree et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-2043820613493067">Berg, 2012</xref>), we need to recognize that as geographers, we have all been caught up in neoliberalizing projects, and our own subject positions are created in and through liberalism and neoliberalism. As good neoliberal subjects, but also as good Antipodean economic geographers wanting to contest hegemonic geographies, our<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-2043820613493067">4</xref></sup> very attempts at disaffiliating ourselves from the obvious forms of Anglo-American hegemony actually allow us to benefit from the continuing but not so obvious forms of structural social relations of that hegemony. These same processes also allow us to disaffiliate from the other forms of marginalization and oppression that occur through our own work.</p>
<p>So, what can we do about the paradoxical spaces that might be produced in our own work, ones that operate to support hegemonic geographies at the very moment we attempt to contest them? I think the key step is to operate within an interlocking analytical frame (for examples of this in practice, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-2043820613493067">Jiwani, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-2043820613493067">Razack, 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-2043820613493067">2005</xref>). The metaphors of both interlocking analyses and interlocking oppressions surely force us to question, <italic>always</italic>, the ways that our work articulates with, produces and is complicit in a wide range of hegemonies, marginalizations and oppressions, even when these are not readily apparent. In this way, we are forced to always question how might our ostensibly progressive work operate to (re)produce hegemonic geographies and their others under academic capitalism (and through white supremacy, ableism, heteronormativity, homonationalism and a whole host of axes of oppression). This is the challenge I put to Wray et al. as they continue to (re)produce an explicitly and unashamedly Antipodean economic geography.</p>

<p>It is important to acknowledge the very emplaced character of this terminology, for while ‘person of colour’ is the term used by these women themselves, the terminology doesn’t translate well to other places such as the United Kingdom, where it might be deemed reactionary, and even racist to use such phrases.</p>
