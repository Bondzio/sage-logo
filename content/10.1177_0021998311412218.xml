<abstract>
<p>This study reports the three-point bending fatigue behavior of three-dimensional angle-interlock glass/polyester woven composite (3DAWC). The <italic>S–N</italic> curve was obtained under the different bending stress levels. The bending stress vs. bending deflection curves were recorded to show the stiffness degradation and bending deformation of the 3DAWC during the fatigue test. The failure modes of the 3DAWC under the different fatigue loading conditions were photographed and compared with those in quasi-static bending tests. It was found that the integrated construction structure of the 3D angle-interlock woven fabric can resist the delamination of the 3DAWC under high-cycle fatigue loading. The cracks propagation and breakages of the warp yarns that run through the thickness direction of the 3DAWC dominate the fatigue failure. The resin cracks and resin-yarn interface debonding are the secondary factors for determining the fatigue behavior.</p>

<sec id="sec1-0021998311412218" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Three-dimensional textile structural composites (3DTSCs) have been widely applied to structure engineering in recent years due to their higher delamination resistance and fracture toughness than laminated composites.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0021998311412218">1</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0021998311412218">3</xref></sup> As one type of the 3DTSCs, the 3D angle-interlock woven composite (3DAWC) has attracted increasing interest in engineering owing to its easy and efficient processing in a traditional loom. Angle interlock weaving is a technique in which yarns are placed at an angle to the thickness direction to resist delamination. Three-dimensional angle-interlock wove fabric (3DAWF) can be classified into two types, referred as layer to layer angle interlock woven fabric and through-thickness angle interlock woven fabric.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0021998311412218">2</xref></sup> It is valuable to study the fatigue behavior of the 3DAWCs because of their wide potential applications in engineering, especially in the case of bending loading conditions.</p>
<p>The fatigue behavior of 2D textile composites has been fairly well investigated. For example, Gilchrist et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0021998311412218">4</xref></sup> determined the flexural fatigue properties of the woven laminates by means of three-point bending tests with a loading ratio <italic>R</italic> = 0.1 at stress levels of 50%–90% of the ultimate static strength. Van Paepegem and Degrieck<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0021998311412218">5</xref></sup> presented a phenomenological residual stiffness model that predicts both the stiffness degradation and the final failure of plain-weave glass/epoxy specimens. Huang and Ramakrishna<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0021998311412218">6</xref></sup> established a unified approach based on bridging micromechanics model to the simulation of the ultimate failure strengths of different textile composite laminates subjected to in-plane, fatigue, as well as out-of-plane bending loads. Hochard et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0021998311412218">7</xref></sup> developed a nonlinear cumulative damage model for woven ply laminates under static and fatigue loads based on a continuum damage approach and a nonlocal fiber rupture criteria. More recently, Tamuzs et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0021998311412218">8</xref></sup> reported the fatigue data of woven fiberglass laminate specimens cut at different angles to the principal axes. Hochard and Thollon<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0021998311412218">9</xref></sup> also developed a generalized nonlinear cumulative damage model for woven ply laminates subjected to static and fatigue loading. The damage, consisting of small cracks running parallel to the fibers, leads to a loss of stiffness in the warp, weft, and shear directions.</p>
<p>However, the fatigue behavior of 3D textile composites was not fully reported. Mouritz<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0021998311412218">10</xref></sup> compared the tensile fatigue properties of specific types of 3D woven, stitched, and z-pinned composites with through-thickness reinforcement. Rudov-Clark and Mouritz<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0021998311412218">11</xref></sup> investigated the tensile fatigue properties of 3D orthogonal woven composites (3DOWCs) made with different volume fractions of through-thickness reinforcing fibers (Z-binders). They found that the fatigue life and strength of the 3DOWC decreased with increase in Z-binders. Gude et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0021998311412218">12</xref></sup> developed a new physically based damage model to analyze the damage evolution of 3D textile-reinforced composites under tension/compression-torque fatigue loading conditions. Carvelli et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0021998311412218">13</xref></sup> compared the tension–tension fatigue behavior between a single-ply noncrimp 3D orthogonal weave E-glass composite and a laminated composite reinforced with four plies of a plain weave fabric. Their experimental results showed that the 3D woven composite has much longer fatigue life than the laminated composite. During the high-cycle fatigue, the most prominent feature of the 3D textile composite is that there is no delamination along the through-thickness direction.</p>
<p>As for the 3DAWC, Tsai et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0021998311412218">14</xref></sup> conducted a comparative study on the fatigue properties and damage processes between untouched three-layer and five-layer of 3DAWC plates under tensile cyclic loading. The fatigue damage mechanisms primarily involved transverse cracks in the warp yarns, debonding between the warp and weft yarns, debonding extension and deflection into the matrix, and weft fiber breakages.</p>
<p>Here, we will report the fatigue behavior of one of the 3DTSCs, the 3D angle-interlock woven composite (3DAWC) under the cyclic bending loading. The <italic>S–N</italic> curve, failure morphologies and the stress–displacement curves, stiffness degradation, and deflection variation during the bending fatigue loading are presented to characterize the progressive fatigue damage of the 3DAWC. In addition, the ultimate failure modes of the 3DAWC are illustrated to unveil the damage mechanisms under fatigue loading.</p></sec>

<p>The vacuum-assisted resin transfer molding technique (VARTM) was used to manufacture the 3DAWC. The resin was AROPOL™ INF 80501-50 polyester resin provided by Ashland Composite Polymers China. The viscosity of the resin was 0.18 Pas at 25°C. The curing agent was AKZO® M-50. The proportion of resin and curing agent was 100:1.5 by weight. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0021998311412218">Figure 3</xref>, the resin solution was first injected into the 3DAWF and then cured for 24 h at a room temperature of 25°C followed by a postcuring in an oven at 80°C for 4 h. The 3DAWC coupons used for testing were cut with high-pressure water jet along the longitudinal and transverse directions. The longitudinal direction of the composite coupons was aligned with the warp yarns. The size (length × width × thickness) of each 3DAWC coupon was 20 × 2 × 0.84 cm, and the same size was used for all kinds of tests. The fiber volume fraction of the 3DAWC was approximately 54%. The photographs of surface and cross-section of a composite coupon are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0021998311412218">Figure 4</xref>.

<p>The quasi-static tension and three-point bending tests of the 3DAWC coupons were conducted on an MTS 810.23 system at the speeds of 2 mm/min and 5 mm/min, respectively. For the coupons used in tensile tests, aluminum tabs with the length of 5 cm, width of 2 cm and thickness of 0.12 cm were glued at the end of the composite coupons. The aluminum tabs will prevent the failure in the grip zones. And for the three-point bending tests, one indenting roll and two supporting rolls were employed. All the rolls had the same size (2 cm in diameter and 7 cm in length). The span between two supporting rolls was 15 cm. At least two specimens for each kind of test were tested to obtain average results.

<p>The testing apparatus for the three-point bending fatigue tests were the same as those in quasi-static three-point bending tests. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0021998311412218">Figure 7</xref>, the tests were conducted under the sinusoidal wave-form cyclic loading with the frequency of 2 Hz and the stress ratio <italic>R</italic> (the ratio of the minimum stress to the maximum stress in one cycle) of 0.1. Five stress levels <italic>σ</italic><sub>max</sub>/<italic>σ</italic><sub>ult</sub> (the ratio of the applied maximum stress in one cycle to the ultimate static bending stress of the composite coupon), i.e., 80%, 75%, 70%, 65%, and 60%, were selected for the fatigue tests.

<p>The <italic>S–N</italic> curve (the magnitude of the cyclic stress level versus the number of cycles to failure) of the 3DAWC under five different stress levels (80%, 75%, 70%, 65%, and 60%) are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0021998311412218">Figure 8</xref>, in which each data point indicates one valid bending fatigue test. There are a total of 11 valid tests including the quasi-static bending test (the number of cycle <italic>N</italic> equals to 1). The arrow in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0021998311412218">Figure 8</xref> means that the coupon did not fail at over 5 × 10<sup>5</sup>cycles. In particular, the coupon did not fail at over 5 × 10<sup>5</sup> cycles under the stress level of 60%.

<p>Furthermore, in order to predict the fatigue life of the 3DAWC under other stress levels that are not included in the current fatigue tests, a linear fitting equation based on the tests data is used, as shown in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula1-0021998311412218">Equation (1)</xref>.

<p>In addition, a region (enveloped by two green curves in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0021998311412218">Figure 8</xref>) with a confidence level of 95% for the fitted linear curve is established.

<sec id="sec8-0021998311412218"><title>Stress–displacement curves</title>
<p>In order to reveal the damage evolution of the 3DAWC during the fatigue testing, the stress<bold>–</bold>displacement curves of the 3DAWC coupon for some selected numbers of cycles during the fatigue test under the stress level of 70% (number of cycles at the ultimate failure: 90,771) are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0021998311412218">Figure 9</xref>. It is found that two special regions, i.e., regions A and B exist between the cycles of 70,000 and 90,000, and cycles of 90,760 and 90,765, respectively. Both regions correspond to a large variation of deflection. In addition, the maximum stress and minimum stress in each cycle are almost constant before the cycle of 70,000. After cycle of 70,000, the maximum stress has a continuous tiny decrease while the minimum stress has a consecutive increase. In particular, the maximum stress has an obvious drop at region B. These results show that there is no significant degradation in the mechanical performance of the composite before the cycle of 70,000. After that, the progressive damage caused by fatigue loading becomes more apparent especially at region B. In order to understand the mechanical performance variation of the 3DAWC during testing, the initial stiffness of the 3DAWC vs. loading cycle curve is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-0021998311412218">Figure 10</xref>. It is found that the stiffness of the 3DAWC coupon decreases with increase in loading cycles. This means the mechanical performance of 3DAWC degrades gradually during fatigue loading. The stiffness drops abruptly when the testing cycle is very close to the ultimate fatigue damage. This phenomenon can also be clearly observed from the deflection–cycles curves shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11-0021998311412218">Figure 11</xref>, in which both the maximum and minimum deflections of the composite increase continuously with increase in the testing cycles. The rapid increase in the deflection at point 1 between cycles of 80,000 and 90,000, and point 2 at cycles of 90760 demonstrates that the damage of the 3DAWC becomes more significant due to the fatigue damage accumulation of the tested material. After point 2, the ultimate failure of the composite will occur in few testing cycles.

<sec id="sec9-0021998311412218"><title>Fatigue failure modes</title>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12-0021998311412218">Figure 12</xref> shows the front surface, back surface, and cross-section of the 3DAWC coupon damaged at cycle of 90,771 under the stress level of 70%. It is found that the resin cracking, yarns transverse cracking, and breakages as well as resin–yarn interface debonding are the main damage modes of the 3DAWC under bending fatigue loading. In particular, the resin cracks, fiber tows transverse cracks, can be easily found on the front surface of the damaged 3DAWC coupon, and the yarns breakages and resin–yarn interface debonding are obviously observed on the back surface and cross-section, respectively. The reason is the layers near to the front surface of the 3DAWC coupon are mainly subjected to the compression loading, whereas those near to the back surface are mainly undergoing the tensile loads under the bending test condition. Besides, the differences in the loading magnitudes among different layers along the thickness direction of the 3DAWC can result in the difference of interlayer stress, which may cause the debonding between the resin and yarns on their interface. However, the ultimate morphologies of tested coupons could be different when the testing stress level is changed. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13-0021998311412218">Figure 13</xref>, when the stress level is changed to 60%, only resin cracks and yarns transverse cracks can be observed on the front surface and back surface of the composite coupon. No significant change is found on the cross-section.

<p>To discuss the fatigue damage mechanisms of the 3DAWC, the photographs of the front surface, back surface, and cross-section of the untested and all tested coupons are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14-0021998311412218">Figure 14</xref>. By taking into consideration the fatigue damage pictures shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14-0021998311412218">Figure 14</xref> and the fabric reinforced architecture shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0021998311412218">Figure 1</xref>, we can summarize the general bending fatigue damage mechanisms of the 3DAWC. As the maximum compressive and tensile loads are applied on the front surface and back surface of the 3DAWC, respectively, the resin cracks are first generated on the outer surface layers after a certain number of testing cycles. And then, the cracks continue to develop into the inner layers of the composite along its thickness direction. At the same time, the cracks are developed from the resin to the warp yarns of the front and back surface layers due to the stress concentration. Due to the increase in testing cycles and the difference in interlayer stress, the cracks continue to propagate into the resin and the adjacent weft yarns. This leads to the generation of debonding on the resin–yarn interface and the cracks growth in the weft yarns. With further testing cycles, the breaking of the yarns gradually increases until the ultimate bending fatigue failure of the 3DAWC takes place.

<p>The three-point bending fatigue properties of the 3DAWC were tested on an MTS 810.23 materials tester under a 2-Hz sinusoidal wave-form cyclic loading with a stress ratio of 0.1 and 5 stress levels. The bending fatigue behavior of the 3DAWC was discussed based on the <italic>S–N</italic> curve, stress–displacement curves, bending stiffness–cycles curve, and deflection–cycles curves as well as failure modes. It was found that the fatigue life of the 3DAWC decreases with the increase in the stress level. In particular, the 3DAWC coupon did not fail at over 5 × 10<sup>5</sup> cycles under the stress level of 60%. The initial stiffness of the composite gradually decreased with increase in testing cycles, which characterized the progressive fatigue damage of the composite. The progressive resin cracking, yarns transverse cracking, resin–yarn interface debonding, and yarns breakages are the main fatigue damage mechanisms of the 3DAWC under three-point bending loading.</p></sec>
