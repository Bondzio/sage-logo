<abstract>
<p>In the present work, the dielectric nature of polypropylene and the softness of the cellular structure in the thickness direction of polypropylene cellular films were combined together to create a low cost and easily processable piezoelectric material. The effects of processing parameters, polymer crystallinity, filler type and concentration on the final structure of the cellular films were investigated. Three grades of calcium carbonate (CaCO<sub>3</sub>) filler having an average particle size of 0.7, 3 and 12 µm were used. An optimized cellular film was developed by biaxial stretching and inflating a film made from three hot-pressed polypropylene sheets filled with 20 wt% of calcium carbonate particles with an average size of 12 µm. The cells have an average length of 35 µm and height of 4 µm with a density ratio of 0.8. Its particle size distribution compares favorably with those available in open literature.</p>

<p>In recent years, cellular polypropylene (PP) thin films have attracted a lot of attention for their use as piezoelectric ferroelectrets. These 50–100 µm thick films are filled with gas cells of lengths reaching 100 µm and heights up to 10 µm. After proper electric charging, they present a good piezoelectric <italic>d</italic><sub>33</sub> coefficient up to 1200 pC/N at low frequency for single films,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0021955X12443687">1</xref></sup> and up to 2010 pC/N when they are developed in multi-layer systems.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0021955X12443687">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0021955X12443687">3</xref></sup> Their piezoelectricity can be compared favorably to lead zirconate titanate (PZT) <italic>d</italic><sub>33</sub> coefficient, which is around 170 pC/N.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0021955X12443687">4</xref></sup> They are also far more affordable and easier to produce.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0021955X12443687">5</xref></sup> They are promising multifunctional materials able to convert electric or magnetic field into mechanical movement and vice versa, and could be used to manufacture basic hardware like speakers, microphones, keyboards, as well as movement detection and security systems.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0021955X12443687">6</xref></sup> They could also be used in more technologically advanced systems such as medical imaging and ultrasonic transducers thanks to their water and air like acoustic impedance. Possibilities are wide, so interest for these soft and malleable piezoelectric films is still growing.</p>
<p>Piezoelectricity is not intrinsic to polypropylene cellular films like in conventional piezoelectric ceramics. Polymeric cellular films become piezoelectric after proper charging in an electrical field sufficient to create dielectric barrier discharge in the cells.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0021955X12443687">7</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0021955X12443687">9</xref></sup> Because of the dielectric nature of polypropylene, charges are retained at the walls of cells after the discharge. Opposite electrical charges on each side of the cells create macroscopic electrical dipoles, which render the cellular film piezoelectric.</p>
<p>A lot of work has been accomplished on post-fabrication treatments like pressure inflation and charging parameters.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0021955X12443687">10</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0021955X12443687">13</xref></sup> However, all this work has been done on industrial cellular PP films, such as those produced by Du Pont USA,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0021955X12443687">10</xref></sup> Nan Ya Plastics,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0021955X12443687">11</xref></sup> Treofan<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0021955X12443687">12</xref></sup> and VTT Processes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0021955X12443687">13</xref></sup> To the best of our knowledge, very little information is available in literature on the processing conditions and parameters of the films themselves and how these parameters could affect the final cellular morphology and properties, which are primordial for the piezoelectric efficiency. Generally, cellular films are produced by stretching polymer extruded sheets filled with solid particles.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0021955X12443687">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0021955X12443687">15</xref></sup> During bi-axial stretching, filler particles, which are solid, act as mechanical stress concentrators and high stress regions propagate cracks surrounding these particles. Since mechanical stresses are applied in two directions, these cracks transform into surfaces and create cells around filler particles.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0021955X12443687">16</xref></sup> To ease the process, fillers with bad compatibility with the polymer matrix must be chosen. The most used material for cellular ferroelectret research is PP filled with CaCO<sub>3</sub>. PP is a good charge retaining dielectric material and has a good resistance to fatigue, which is important for piezoelectric materials that will sustain several cyclic stresses. It is also inexpensive, easy to process and has well-known processing conditions. CaCO<sub>3</sub> is used as filler because of its availability, its low cost, and especially its prism shape, which is adequate for stress concentration. The quality of the film’s piezoelectric effect can be enhanced by various treatments. Nonetheless, the very own characteristics of the films, such as filler content and properties, crystallinity as well as stretching parameters cannot be neglected. The scope of this work is to study film processing parameters affecting the cellular morphology and film crystallinity in order to produce cellular PP films suitable for piezoelectric use. It provides a blueprint for researchers to produce cellular PP films with a wider range of characteristics than industrial films.</p>
<p>Aiming to develop a cellular film used in a wide range of piezoelectric applications that would be produced in large quantities, conditions and parameters were chosen to mimic industrial ones. The final film must be filled with large cells without any bulk polymer zone. Larger cells (height up to 10 µm) are known to lower Young’s modulus the most. They are softer than smaller cells because of their easily compressible central area. The desired final cell must have a large surface area with an eye-shaped cross-section.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0021955X12443687">17</xref></sup></p>

<p>PP homopolymer in pellets form (Pro-fax 6323), provided by Lyondell Basell Industries, was used in this study. The use of PP in pellets form was preferred over PP powder in order to be closer to industrial conditions where PP pellets are largely used over powders. Three industrial grades of CaCO<sub>3</sub>, provided by OMYA Canada, were used. Commercial names for these three grades are <italic>Omyacarb UF</italic>, <italic>Snowhite 3</italic> and <italic>Snowhite 12</italic> with average particle size diameters of 0.7, 3.2 and 12 µm, respectively. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0021955X12443687">Figure 1</xref> shows the particle-size distribution of each grade provided by the manufacturer.

<p>A twin-screw corotating 18 mm extruder (Leistriz ZSE18HP-40D), a slit die and a calendaring system were used to produce sheets having a thickness between 0.30 and 0.35 mm. Screw configuration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0021955X12443687">Figure 2</xref>) was optimized to ensure a maximum mixing of the polymer matrix and the solid CaCO<sub>3</sub> filler. Good dispersion and even distribution of CaCO<sub>3</sub> filler are both very important to produce a uniform cellular morphology. To achieve a good mixing, five sections of kneading blocks were added to the screws for a total of 12 kneading elements, nearly half of the total elements. A reverse kneading block was inserted at the end of the second kneading section in order to increase the pressure and to ensure complete melting and better initial mixing. Another reverse kneading block was inserted at the end of the fifth section in order to increase the residence time in the last intense mixing section. The first three kneading sections accomplish a more distributive mixing role while the last two, with disks having a 90° stagger angle, are more dispersive. The extruder has nine adjustable temperature zones, including the die. The temperature profile used for all film compositions was: 165–180–185–190–190–190–190–190–185°C (from the feeding zone section to the die). The screw speed was set constant at 250 rpm and PP was added at the main hopper of the extruder at a rate of 3.33 kg/h. CaCO<sub>3</sub> filler was also fed to the main hopper of the extruder using a homemade feeder previously calibrated to obtain filler loadings of 5 and 20 wt%. There was no mixing of PP and CaCO<sub>3</sub> prior to the extrusion since PP pellets and CaCO<sub>3</sub> powder cannot produce a stable homogenous mixture.

<p>Compression molding was used to develop multilayer films from the extruded sheets. Square samples (85 × 85 mm<sup>2</sup>) were cut from the center of the extruded sheets and stacks of three such squares were hot-pressed in a 85 × 85 × 0.9 mm<sup>3</sup> steel frame using a Carver 15 tons, 2 platens Auto Series press. Compression load was around 3175 kg (7000 lbs) for 2 min at 195°C, well over the melting point of PP (163°C). Also, Teflon sheets were inserted between each side of the frame and the platens to avoid sample sticking The purpose of stacking multiple films is to have multiple layers of cells in the final cellular film. Having multiple layers of cells maximizes the use of the available film volume and also the area of cell walls needed for the storing of electrical charges. To maximize the piezoelectric signal, the whole film volume must be cellular so there is no bulk polymer non-contributing zone. Multiple cell layers also provide a cellular film with stable and flexible structure that could not be achieved by a single layer of bigger cells that could collapse under stress. Three different cooling ways were used in order to verify the effect of cooling rate on multilayer film crystallinity: (i) using fresh water at around 5°C circulating near the surface of the platens (36°C/min), (ii) by quenching the pressed samples right out of the press during 5 min between 2 mm thick steel plates previously cooled down in liquid nitrogen and (1200°C/min), and (iii) by letting the film cooled down in the press left under ambient conditions (0.78°C/min). The pressed samples were then stretched bi-axially using a Brückner Karo IV Labstretcher. Depending on the initial thickness of the sample, the stretching ratios in the machine and transverse directions varied from 1 : 3.8 to 1 : 4.2. Despite all samples being pressed in the same mold under the same pressure, initial sample thickness varied from 880 to 950 µm. The ratios were adjusted aiming to obtain a final thickness between 50 and 60 µm. Samples were preheated for 50 s at 155°C,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0021955X12443687">18</xref></sup> then stretched at a speed of 3 m/min. After stretching, the samples were subjected to a pressure treatment to inflate the cells. Adequate pressure treatment can enhance the piezoelectricity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0021955X12443687">19</xref></sup> The chosen treatment was the same as that proposed by Zhang.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0021955X12443687">2</xref></sup> The samples were put into a gas tight chamber where the pressure and temperature are controlled. Vacuum was applied for the first 5 min to evacuate air and mostly humidity, a nuisance to piezoelectricity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0021955X12443687">20</xref></sup> Nitrogen pressure was then elevated to 15 bars at ambient temperature. After 3 h, the temperature was increased to 100°C for 1 h. Finally, the pressure was quickly released to atmospheric pressure and the sample was cooled down slowly in the press chamber left under ambient conditions.</p>

<sec id="sec5-0021955X12443687"><title>Film characterization</title>
<p>Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was done using a JEOL JSM-840A in order to study the quality of CaCO<sub>3</sub> filler dispersion and also to observe cells morphology of the produced films. SEM scans of the cellular film were analyzed with the <italic>ImageJ</italic> software. To avoid cell structure modification, the samples were first soaked in liquid nitrogen for 5 min before preparation for SEM observations. Polarized optical microscopy (POM), with a 40 × zoom and 25°C/min cooling rate, was also used to observe the crystalline zones in the polymer matrix. The crystallinity of PP/CaCO<sub>3</sub> samples was evaluated by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) using a Perkin Elmer DSC 7. Samples of 5–10 mg were heated at a rate of 10°C/min from 70°C to 195°C. The theoretical value of the melting enthalpy for 100% crystalline PP is 209 J/g.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0021955X12443687">21</xref></sup> It should be noted that the weight of CaCO<sub>3</sub> filler was excluded during the calculation of PP/CaCO<sub>3</sub> crystallinity.</p>
<p>Density characterization was done using a Quantachrome Ultrapyc 1200e gas pycnometer (with nitrogen). The reported values correspond to the average of a minimum of five measurements for each sample.</p>

<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0021955X12443687">Figure 3</xref>(a) and (b) respectively show SEM micrographs of a film filled with the same concentration (20 wt%) of smaller (0.7 µm) and bigger (12 µm) CaCO<sub>3</sub> filler. In each micrograph, dark regions correspond to the PP matrix and clear regions correspond to the CaCO<sub>3</sub> dispersed filler. As shown, for both filler types, good distribution was obtained over the entire film surface. Usually, smaller particles tend to agglomerate; however, both figures show no agglomeration of filler with the use of the smallest particles at the highest CaCO<sub>3</sub> concentration (20 wt%). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0021955X12443687">Figure 4</xref> shows the cross-section of a stack of three films, obtained by compression molding where each of these films was filled with 20 wt% of the 12 µm CaCO<sub>3</sub>. As it can be seen, filler dispersion and distribution are also good over the thickness of film stacks. It can be concluded that the screw configuration presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0021955X12443687">Figure 2</xref> is adequate to mix uniformly the filler in the polymer matrix.

<p>The crystallinity of the polymer matrix is an important parameter for piezoelectric cellular films. The interfaces between amorphous and crystalline zones are believed to be obstacles to electric charges drift.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0021955X12443687">22</xref></sup> Therefore, a film with more interface area should retain its charges and piezoelectric effect stronger and longer. Unfortunately, there is no way to measure exactly the total interface area between amorphous and crystalline zones in a polymer. Only the two-dimension shapes and sizes of crystals and the total crystallinity can be observed. Three manufacturing parameters could affect the crystallinity of the film: the particle size of CaCO<sub>3</sub>, the filler concentration and the cooling rate. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0021955X12443687">Table 1</xref> shows film crystallinity for the series of samples produced. For the same filler concentration (5 or 20 wt%), the size of CaCO<sub>3</sub> particles (between 0.7 and 12 µm) did not affect significantly the crystallinitiy of the films. Also, film crystallinity was not significantly affected by the variation of CaCO<sub>3</sub> concentration (from 5 to 20 wt%). We know that, for low CaCO<sub>3</sub> concentrations, the crystallinity of PP/CaCO3 increases with increasing CaCO<sub>3</sub> concentration, since CaCO<sub>3</sub> particles serve as nucleation agents to improve the nucleation rate. However, at higher concentrations, CaCO<sub>3</sub> particles and agglomerates hinder PP chain segments mobility and accordingly crystallites growth. This can be confirmed by <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0021955X12443687">Figure 5</xref>, which shows a POM micrograph of a film containing 20 wt% of 12 µm CaCO<sub>3</sub> filler where the white color corresponds to fully crystalline zones. It can be seen that these crystalline zones are surrounded by zones with high CaCO<sub>3</sub> agglomerations that obstruct crystal growth. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0021955X12443687">Table 2</xref> shows crystallinity results for films containing 5 wt% of the 0.7 µm CaCO<sub>3</sub> filler cooled under three different cooling rates in the press. In bulk polymer, slower cooling rates usually lead to higher crystallinity. Results show that crystallization can indeed be controlled by the cooling rate. Crystallinity up to 49.4% have been achieved by cooling the film at an extremely slow rate of 0.78°C/min, compared 43.5% at the fastest rate of 1200°C/min

<p>The cellular morphology is the main characteristic to look for a piezoelectric film. One of the first goals of this work was to see which filler was the best at creating an optimized cellular morphology. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0021955X12443687">Figure 6</xref>(a) to (c) show SEM micrographs of stretched films developed by using the three grades of CaCO<sub>3</sub>. It is clearly seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0021955X12443687">Figure 6</xref>(a) that the smallest particles with an average size of 0.7 µm are not large enough to create cells. During the stretching step, these small particles just move along with the surrounding polymer matrix without initiating and propagating cracks. However, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0021955X12443687">Figure 6</xref>(b), cracks begin to develop around the larger particles (3 µm average size), leading to partial cells around them. At the same time, smaller particles did not initiate any crack propagation. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0021955X12443687">Figure 6</xref>(c) shows that most CaCO<sub>3</sub> particles (having an average size of around 12 µm) were able to generate cells. It can be concluded that filler particles must be at least 3 µm in diameter to be able to effectively initiate and propagate cracks during stretching in order to generate a cellular film under the conditions studied. After stretching, cell walls are still relatively thick. This means it would be possible to add more CaCO<sub>3</sub> in order to produce more cells or stretch the film even further to reduce wall thickness. More cells with thinner walls will lead to lower Young’s modulus and a better piezoelectric effect. Wegener et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0021955X12443687">23</xref></sup> showed that higher transducer coefficient <italic>d<sub>33</sub></italic> corresponds to lower Young’s modulus. It is also noticeable in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0021955X12443687">Figure 6</xref>(c) that there are multiple layers of cells across film’s thickness. The pressing process reached its objective, as there is no large non-cellular zone in the stretched film.

<p>As mentioned, stretching the filled films only is not enough to obtain an adequate cellular film. A pressure treatment to inflate the developed cells, as explained in the experimental section, is necessary. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0021955X12443687">Figure 7</xref> shows the effect of such treatment on the cellular morphology of initially stretched films. It can be seen that, due to cell inflation, treated films are thicker, blowing up from 65 to 84 µm. It is also evident that cell inflation affects the density of the films, which decreased from 0.65 g/cm<sup>3</sup> before pressure treatment to 0.51 g/cm<sup>3</sup> (i.e. a density ratio of 0.8) in the case of 20 wt% film loaded with 12 µm filler (unstretched neat PP film has a density of 0.88 g/cm<sup>3</sup>). Depending on the initial thickness of the film, an optimal density ratio is between 0.4 and 0.6.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0021955X12443687">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0021955X12443687">24</xref></sup> So there is still room for more inflation in the produced films since the treatment was not sufficient to exploit the full potential of the films produced. The cells shape is still far from spherical so it can be inflated even more without risk of increasing the Young’s modulus, which happens when the cell shape approaches to spherical, due to the mechanical strength of that particular geometry. The internal structure of inflated films produced with a 20 wt% loading of 12 µm CaCO<sub>3</sub> was analyzed with the <italic>ImageJ</italic> software. An ellipsoidal shape was fitted to each individual cell on 10 SEM images of each film cross-section. This method permitted to approximate the major and minor axis of each cell reported here as the length and maximum height of each cell. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0021955X12443687">Figure 8</xref> shows the distribution of those two dimensions for the film containing 20% w/w of the 12 µm CaCO<sub>3</sub> filler. The cell height distribution compares favorably to height distribution found in literature for commercial cellular films submitted to a similar pressure treatment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0021955X12443687">25</xref></sup> The average cell is 35 µm long and 4 µm high. The fact that 25% of the cells are higher than 5 µm, despite the high density ratio, is promising as those large cells will contribute the most to the piezoelectric effect.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0021955X12443687">16</xref></sup> The films produced by the method described in this work already have an advantageous cellular morphology at a high density ratio. They compare favorably with industrial films inflated at the optimal density ratio and have great inflation potential left to exploit. It can be concluded that this work is a blueprint to manufacture polypropylene cellular films suitable for piezoelectric use. Nevertheless, the next step would be to go further in the optimization of cellular films. As previously mentioned, cell walls are still relatively thick in the produced films. Thinner walls inevitably lead to lower Young’s modulus, as long as they are not so thin that the cells collapse. This means it may be possible to create more cells in the same film by adding more filler particles. Actual thick walls and high density ratio would also permit the use of higher stretching ratio or inflation pressure to improve the final cellular morphology. This work is currently under way.

<p>Cellular polypropylene films were developed by stretching bi-axially a 3-layer stack of extruded polypropylene sheets filled with CaCO<sub>3</sub> particles. Good filler dispersion and distribution was achieved by using an adequate screw configuration. Results showed that film crystallinity was mainly influenced by the cooling rate. Decreasing the cooling rate from 1200°C/min to 0.78°C/min increased the crystallinity from 43.5% to 49.4%. It was also demonstrated that CaCO<sub>3</sub> particles need to be at least around 3 µm in diameter to efficiently initiate and propagate cracks during film stretching. For this purpose, CaCO<sub>3</sub> with an average particle size of 12 µm was found to be very efficient and led to cellular films of good cell height distribution at a density ratio of 0.8 compared to commercial films. The high crystallinity and optimized cellular structure render the produced films good candidates for piezoelectric use. Further improvement could be achieved by developing a new pressure treatment that would lower the density ratio between 0.4 and 0.6.</p>
