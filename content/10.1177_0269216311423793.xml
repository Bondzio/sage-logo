<title>Background:</title>
<p>Chronic cough is a disruptive and exhausting symptom, reported as very distressing in a quarter of those in their last year of life. Existing guidelines for management of chronic cough primarily deal with the commonest benign causes of cough: asthma; eosinophilic bronchitis; gastro-oesophageal reflux disease; rhinosinusitis.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0269216311423793">
<title>Aim/design:</title>
<p>to examine what literature evidence exists and formulate recommendations for managing chronic cough in patients with advanced, progressive, life-limiting illnesses.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0269216311423793">
<title>Data sources:</title>
<p>Electronic databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, Cochrane Library, Google Scholar); hand-search; grey literature.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0269216311423793">
<title>Results:</title>
<p>Of 11 initially eligible studies, 5 provided evidence at level 2 or better. The small size of these studies, heterogeneity of study population and diversity of interventions and outcome measures used meant that comparison across studies and compilation of guidelines based on high-quality evidence was not possible. Pragmatic recommendations based on available evidence were formulated, drawing on the included studies and, in addition, extrapolating from two other well-designed studies involving patients with chronic cough. They also took into consideration convenience, toxicity and minimizing burden and harm of intervention, as well as considering the potential for disease-directed treatment and the possibility of pharmacological and co-existing benign causes of chronic cough.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0269216311423793">
<title>Conclusions:</title>
<p>These recommendations (Grade D) include simple linctus, therapeutic trial of sodium cromoglycate and then prescription of an opioid or opioid derivative (dextromethorphan, morphine or codeine). Further research is clearly and urgently required in this area for more effective approaches to managing cough, tested in trials that have sufficient size, power and validity.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Chronic cough, defined as a cough lasting more than eight weeks,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0269216311423793">1</xref></sup> is a distressing and debilitating problem. It is a presenting symptom in over 65% of people with lung cancer.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0269216311423793">2</xref></sup> It often persists, and has been reported as ‘very distressing’ in 22% of people with lung cancer and 26% of those with chronic lung disease in their last year of life.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0269216311423793">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>Like pain, acute cough normally has a protective function, clearing mucus and foreign bodies from the larynx and lower respiratory tract. However, chronic cough is frequently socially disruptive and physically exhausting, and may exacerbate concurrent symptoms such as pain, breathlessness, insomnia and incontinence. Cachexia and generalized weakness, common in those near the end of life, may make the effort of coughing more exhausting and less effective.</p>
<p>The British Thoracic Society has produced comprehensive guidelines for the management of chronic cough,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0269216311423793">1</xref></sup> as have the European Respiratory Society<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0269216311423793">4</xref></sup> and American College of Chest Physicians.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0269216311423793">5</xref></sup> All these necessarily focus on the commonest causes of chronic cough: asthma, non- asthmatic eosinophilic bronchitis, gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) and upper airways cough syndrome arising from rhinosinusitis. None of these guidelines specifically deal with the intractable cough related to advanced progressive cancer as well as non-malignant life-limiting illness. This paper reports on the findings of a task group, set up by the Science Committee of the Association for Palliative Medicine of Great Britain and Ireland, to undertake a review of the evidence for pharmacological and non-pharmacological management of chronic cough in this group of patients and produce recommendations for clinical practice.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0269216311423793" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>The task group was drawn from doctors, nurses and pharmacists in specialist palliative medicine and respiratory medicine. The task group met on two occasions: the first to agree a protocol for the literature review drafted by BW and JB; the second to discuss the quality of the evidence identified and to formulate recommendations relevant to the clinical practice of palliative medicine.</p>
<p>The inclusion criteria for studies were defined as follows.</p>
<list id="list1-0269216311423793" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>English language papers that reported on studies involving adults or children with advanced, progressive, life-limiting illnesses who had a chronic cough lasting more than eight weeks. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease would be included, but not chronic cough related to asthma, eosinophilic bronchitis, GORD, chronic bronchorrhoea, trauma, congenital abnormalities, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and opportunistic infections in HIV.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Studies using any therapeutic intervention: pharmacological or non-pharmacological agents; antitussives; disease-specific therapies.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>The primary outcomes of interest were disappearance of the cough and/or objective or subjective change in the cough pattern (e.g. intensity or frequency). Secondary outcomes included change in quality of life resulting from change in symptoms associated with cough, number of different types of interventions needed to achieve a reduction in cough intensity and/or frequency and number of times an intervention had to be repeated to achieve or maintain a reduction in cough intensity and/or frequency.</p>
<p>Search terms used were ‘palliative’ (and a variety of terms relating to ‘palliative’) in combination with ‘antitussive’, ‘cough suppression’ and a range of therapies, for example, corticosteroids, codeine and opioids. Only papers published in English were included. A full list of the search terms is available in the <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-0269216311423793">appendix</xref>. Five electronic databases were searched: MEDLINE 1966–2010; EMBASE 1980–2010; CINAHL 1982–2010; Cochrane Library; Google Scholar. The reference lists of all relevant studies and reviews were hand-searched for additional studies. Investigators known to be conducting research in this area were asked for information relating to grey literature, including conference abstracts, theses and publications in non-indexed journals.</p>
<p>The literature search was conducted by JB, then the abstract of each potentially relevant paper independently screened by JB and one other member of the task group. Papers were excluded at this point if they clearly did not fit the inclusion criteria. The rest were read in full and recorded on a data extraction form, designed by BW and JB and based on the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme (CASP) tools.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0269216311423793">6</xref></sup> Information extracted from each paper included characteristics of trial participants (including age, diagnosis, stage and severity of disease), details of intervention (including dose, duration, frequency and whether or not there was placebo control), study design and type of outcome measure (including change or disappearance of cough frequency or severity, change in quality of life reported and number and times an intervention was required). If there was disagreement about eligibility between two reviewers and this could not be resolved following discussion, those papers would be brought to the final meeting of the task group for a wider discussion. The Cochrane Collaboration’s tool for assessing risk of bias would be used to evaluate bias within individual studies. A meta-analysis of the data would be carried out if the quality and size of studies identified allowed but it was acknowledged, from the start of this process, that this was unlikely, so the methodology for a meta-analysis was not explicitly set out at that point.</p>
<p>A qualitative summary of each of the included studies was prepared for consideration at the final meeting of the task group, where the risk of bias within and across studies would be discussed. The grading system developed by the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN) was used to allow recommendations to be graded according to the strength of the evidence<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0269216311423793">7</xref></sup> (see <xref ref-type="boxed-text" rid="boxed-text1-0269216311423793">Box 1</xref> for SIGN grading) and formulated for clinical practice.</p>

<p>Of these, only five provided levels of evidence of 2 or above; the remainder were case reports or case series. There were three randomized controlled trials: Moroni et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0269216311423793">8</xref></sup> compared inhaled sodium cromoglycate with placebo; Matthys et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0269216311423793">9</xref></sup> used a cross-over design to compare dextromethorphan hydrobromide, codeine phosphate and placebo; Sevelius et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0269216311423793">10</xref></sup> gave his subjects different doses of codeine (7.5, 15, 30 or 60 mg) or placebo as a single daily dose on four consecutive days. Moroni et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0269216311423793">8</xref></sup> found sodium cromoglycate to be significantly more effective than placebo in reducing cough intensity. In Matthys et al.’s study,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0269216311423793">9</xref></sup> dextromethorphan was found to be more effective at reducing cough intensity than codeine (non-significant), and both were significantly more effective than placebo. Dextromethorphan was significantly preferred by patients. Sevelius et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0269216311423793">10</xref></sup> found an average reduction in six-hour post-codeine treatment cough counts of between 29% and 67%, compared to placebo, with a significant dose–response relationship. However, there was no relationship between the dose of codeine and patients’ evaluations of its effectiveness. All three studies were small, ranging from 12 to 20 in each and there was no power calculation reported. Moroni et al.’s study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0269216311423793">8</xref></sup> had a relatively homogenous population: patients with locally advanced or unresectable metastatic non-small cell lung cancer. Patients with different respiratory and cardiac conditions were included in the other studies.</p>
<p>Two studies were considered to offer evidence at level 2. In an uncontrolled phase II study, Homsi et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0269216311423793">11</xref></sup> demonstrated a reduction in cough frequency with hydrocodone in patients with advanced cancer. In a much larger but uncontrolled study, Luporini et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0269216311423793">12</xref></sup> showed a significant reduction in cough severity in patients with primary or secondary lung cancer using either levodropropizine or dihydrocodeine. Reports of adverse effects were similar in both groups but the percentage of patients experiencing somnolence in those taking levodropropizine was significantly lower than those on dihydrocodeine.</p>
<p>In addition, two other studies were considered even though they did not meet the criteria for included studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0269216311423793">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0269216311423793">20</xref></sup> The first recruited from a regional cough clinic but excluded patients with significant lung disease; the second involved patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease who had stable disease. However, both merited consideration for two main reasons: (a) both were randomized double-blind placebo-controlled studies using morphine<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0269216311423793">19</xref></sup> or codeine,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0269216311423793">20</xref></sup> which are widely used in palliative medicine; and (b) these patients had chronic idiopathic cough and, arguably, it might be reasonable to extrapolate these responses to patients with advanced cancer where reversible causes had already been managed. In the first study, 27 patients were randomized to slow-release morphine sulphate 5 mg twice daily for four weeks or placebo and outcomes were measured using the Leicester Cough Questionnaire. Those on the active arm showed a highly significant reduction (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01) by 40% in daily cough scores compared to baseline, whereas those on placebo showed no discernible difference from their baseline. The reduction in mean daily cough scores began in less than a week. The second was a cross-over study involving 21 patients given codeine phosphate 60 mg or matched placebo in random order, at the start of each cough recording (0 and 12 hours), between 7 and 10 days apart. Outcomes were measured using ambulatory cough recording, cough symptom score and visual analogue scale. There was no significant difference between codeine and placebo using any of these outcome measures.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This review has yielded disappointingly little evidence, both in quantity and in quality, to support robust guidelines for the management of chronic cough in advanced, progressive disease. The three controlled randomized trials were small, involving a total of less than 50 patients between them. The patient population, interventions and outcome measures were so diverse that no attempt could be made at drawing valid conclusions across studies. It was clear that, at best, only Grade D recommendations could be formulated.</p>
<p>One limitation of this review was the restriction of the search to papers published in the English language only. In addition, the papers reviewed contained limited experimental and patient data, with incomplete and unclear reporting, making it difficult to evaluate the risk of bias within studies.</p>
<p>There was a clearly significant reduction in cough with sodium cromoglycate compared to placebo, but the sample size was small and the outcome measure used was an unvalidated tool. The evidence remains contradictory with respect to the efficacy of codeine phosphate. Sevelius et al.’s<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0269216311423793">10</xref></sup> study showed a dose-related response to the drug compared to placebo, but Smith et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0269216311423793">20</xref></sup> showed no significant difference between codeine and placebo, using three different outcome measures, even at a dose of 60 mg, which was the same as the highest dose used in Sevelius et al.’s study.</p>
<p>In the light of such limited evidence, the task group agreed that other considerations, such as convenience, toxicity and minimizing the burden and harm of any intervention, had to be included when formulating recommendations for clinical practice. Although this carries a risk of introducing bias, we felt that, in our discussions, this was moderated by the multidisciplinary composition of the task group, its collective clinical experience and our intention to make the evidence and our decisions sufficiently explicit that the readers could draw their own conclusions. We also felt that such recommendations, with all their caveats, should be more helpful to the clinician than simply pointing out the lack of evidence in this area of care. The recommendations are set out in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0269216311423793">Table 2</xref>.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Despite the prevalence and distressing impact of chronic cough in patients with advanced, life-limiting illnesses, there is virtually no substantial evidence to support its management in clinical practice. In this paper, we have set out the findings of our literature review and formulated recommendations as best we can, based on what little evidence there is and our clinical judgement and experience. These are broadly consistent with other recent publications on cough in people with cancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0269216311423793">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0269216311423793">22</xref></sup> and provide a useful current position for treating the symptom of chronic cough in patients with advanced cancer and non-malignant life-limiting conditions.</p>
<p>Further evidence is clearly required. It should be possible to develop robust studies using methodologies that have already been developed and tried in other patient populations. However, further research in this patient population is needed, in particular to test interventions for alleviating cough frequency, intensity and/or impact in the palliative care group.</p>
