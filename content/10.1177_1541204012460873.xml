<p>Staff turnover poses challenges for many correctional organizations. Though a growing body of research exists on turnover intention in adult corrections, few studies have examined the topic in juvenile corrections, and none have measured organizational commitment—a variable known to predict turnover intent in adult corrections. Using survey data, this study examines the utility of personal characteristics, work environment variables, and job attitudes in predicting intentions of staff in juvenile correctional facilities to quit their jobs within 12 months following survey administration. Job satisfaction and organizational commitment were the best predictors. In turn, considerable variability in these two job attitudes was explained by work environment variables. Implications are discussed for future research and for improving the work environment to better control turnover.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Staff turnover is a persistent problem in both adult and juvenile corrections. Annual turnover rates in adult facilities average around 20% and can climb to almost twice that (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1541204012460873">Lambert, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1541204012460873">Lambert &amp; Hogan, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1541204012460873">Patenaude, 2001</xref>). Likewise, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1541204012460873">Wright (1993)</xref> reported an annual turnover rate of 19.6% for a juvenile detention facility, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1541204012460873">Minor et al., (2011)</xref> found that 23.4% of new staff resigned from a state juvenile justice department within a year of hire. Rates like these have prompted efforts to identify predictors of turnover and turnover intention. Using a cross-sectional survey, the present study continues and extends these efforts by examining predictors of intent among juvenile correctional facility staff to leave their jobs within a year following survey administration.</p>
<p>Turnover is expensive to an organization due to costs surrounding separation of departing staff and recruitment, selection, hiring, and training of new staff; turnover can also render the organization unstable and less effective in accomplishing aims (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1541204012460873">Lambert, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1541204012460873">Lambert &amp; Hogan, 2009</xref>). Given that correctional organizations rely heavily on staff to meet objectives, problems associated with attrition (e.g., staffing shortages) can feed on themselves and ultimately exacerbate turnover (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1541204012460873">Minor, Wells, Angel, &amp; Matz, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1541204012460873">Mitchell, Mackenzie, Styve, &amp; Gover, 2000</xref>). In addition to negative organizational outcomes, turnover can adversely impact individuals who intend or choose to leave as well as those who stay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1541204012460873">Lambert, 2001</xref>). In some instances, the more qualified and higher performing individuals are most likely to leave due to better employment opportunities elsewhere. The need to retain skilled and qualified staff is paramount in today’s fiscal climate, and research on predictors of turnover can inform efforts to do so.</p>
<p>Recent research on predictors of turnover intent in adult corrections has examined the role of personal characteristics, work environment variables, and job attitudes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1541204012460873">Lambert &amp; Paoline, 2010</xref>). The present study investigated the relationship of these categories of variables to turnover intention among custody and noncustody staff working in facilities administered by the Kentucky Department of Juvenile Justice (DJJ). Personal variables included gender, race, age, education, tenure, geographic location of facility, and custodial versus noncustodial position. Work environment variables included staff perceptions of supervision, collective efficacy, communication, coworkers, safety and security on the job, as well as type of facility at which employed. The job attitudes included job satisfaction and organizational commitment. As demonstrated below, previous research justifies further examination of these variables among staff employed in juvenile corrections.</p>

<title>Prior Literature</title>
<p>Several studies have examined factors associated with turnover intention and behavior in adult correctional settings at various levels of government and the private sector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1541204012460873">Byrd, Cochran, Silverman, &amp; Blount, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1541204012460873">Camp, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1541204012460873">Jacobs &amp; Grear, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1541204012460873">Jurik &amp; Winn, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1541204012460873">Kiekbusch, Price, &amp; Thesis, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1541204012460873">Lambert, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1541204012460873">Lambert &amp; Paoline, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1541204012460873">Minor, Dawson-Edwards, Wells, Griffith, &amp; Angel, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1541204012460873">Slate &amp; Vogel, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1541204012460873">Stohr, Self, &amp; Lovrich, 1992</xref>). Less research has been conducted on predictors among juvenile correctional workers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1541204012460873">Liou, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1541204012460873">Matz, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1541204012460873">Minor et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1541204012460873">Mitchell et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1541204012460873">Tipton, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1541204012460873">Wright, 1993</xref>).</p>
<sec id="section3-1541204012460873">
<title>Juvenile Corrections</title>
<p>Juvenile justice is often not distinguished as an independent field, and thus many core statistics are lacking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1541204012460873">Howe, Clawson, &amp; Larivee, 2007</xref>). It is estimated that there are some 300,000 juvenile justice workers in the nation, many of whom enter and remain in the field because they enjoy working with youth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1541204012460873">Howe et al., 2007</xref>). The role of juvenile correctional workers differs from that of their adult counterparts with respect to greater emphasis on rehabilitation and serving the best interest of youth, as opposed to a predominant custodial orientation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1541204012460873">Minor et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1541204012460873">Wells, Minor, Angel, Matz, &amp; Amato, 2009</xref>). </p>
<p>Studies examining demographic or personal predictors of staff turnover in juvenile corrections have yielded inconclusive and sometimes contradictory findings. Some studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1541204012460873">Liou, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1541204012460873">Tipton, 2002</xref>), but not others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1541204012460873">Mitchell et al., 2000</xref>), have found women are more likely than men to possess turnover intentions; in a hierarchical model of turnover behavior, the gender effect disappeared when work-related variables were introduced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1541204012460873">Minor et al., 2011</xref>). There are also conflicting findings regarding age and tenure. Whereas Mitchell et al. found younger officers are more likely than older ones to have turnover intentions, Tipton reported the opposite finding. While Tipton found staff with longer tenure to be more likely to have thoughts of quitting, Wright reported that less tenure was related to a greater chance of actual turnover. Mitchell et al. also found minority race and higher education to be associated with intentions. Minor et al. used staff residence location (rural vs. urban) as a proxy for diminished employment opportunities and found that this variable did not predict turnover probability. Position of staff member (custody vs. noncustody) was examined only by Mitchell et al. and not found to be significant. Given the limited and inconclusive nature of past work, the present study incorporated each of these factors.</p>
<p>Compared to personal variables, prior research on juvenile staff has consistently found work environment variables to exert stronger impact on both turnover intent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1541204012460873">Liou, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1541204012460873">Mitchell et al., 2000</xref>) and behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1541204012460873">Minor et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1541204012460873">Wright, 1993</xref>). It is logical to believe that staff having more positive perceptions of the supervision they receive would be less likely to exhibit intent to leave, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1541204012460873">Tipton (2002)</xref> confirmed this relationship. In addition, Tipton found lower perceptions of safety to be related to turnover intentions, while Mitchell et al. found negative perceptions of coworker support and communication to be related to thoughts of quitting. Of the variables analyzed, Minor et al. reported that satisfaction with coworkers was the only significant predictor of actual turnover among newer staff.</p>
<p>In the present study, another important work environment consideration is that DJJ operates four distinct types of facilities: (1) detention centers focused on short-term custody; (2) youth development centers, which emphasize a blending of custody and treatment services for longer term residential placements; (3) group homes, which are community-based residential facilities analogous to adult halfway houses; and (4) day treatment facilities, which permit court adjudicated youth to remain at home during the evening but provide closely supervised educational and counseling services during the day as an alternative to traditional public or private schools. This type of variation across facilities has not been examined in previous studies of turnover among juvenile corrections staff. Both <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1541204012460873">Wright (1993)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1541204012460873">Liou (1998)</xref> studied samples consisting of short-term detention staff. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1541204012460873">Mitchell, Mackenzie, Styve, and Gover (2000)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1541204012460873">Tipton (2002)</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1541204012460873">Minor et al. (2011)</xref> all obtained data from multiple juvenile facilities; the former study did not include facility type in multivariate analyses, Tipton reported greater turnover intent in more secure facilities, and the last study reported that facility security level failed to predict actual turnover. Facility type was included as a variable in the present study because it describes variation in mission across DJJ facilities and is therefore a work environment component potentially relevant to staff turnover intent.</p>
<p>Collective efficacy refers to an employee’s perception of the effectiveness of the organizational unit of which he or she is part in advancing agency goals. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1541204012460873">Bandura (1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1541204012460873">2001</xref>) contends that people are unlikely to expect, or exert necessary effort toward, favorable outcomes if they believe that they and others with whom they regularly interact cannot produce desired outcomes and forestall undesired ones. Such persons may develop an increased likelihood of turnover intention, especially in correctional organizations that emphasize youth rehabilitation. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1541204012460873">Mitchell et al. (2000)</xref> found less favorable staff perceptions of a facility’s care toward youth to predict turnover intent, but collective efficacy has not received attention in previous turnover research on juvenile staff.</p>
<p>Job satisfaction and organizational commitment have been identified as salient job attitudes predictive of turnover intention. Job satisfaction, defined as the extent to which an employee likes his or her job (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1541204012460873">Lambert, Hogan, &amp; Barton, 2002</xref>), was related to thoughts of quitting in all three previously published studies of juvenile staff intent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1541204012460873">Liou, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1541204012460873">Mitchell et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1541204012460873">Tipton, 2002</xref>) and in one of the two behavior studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1541204012460873">Wright, 1993</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1541204012460873">Minor et al. (2011)</xref> did not find a significant relationship between actual turnover and either job satisfaction or organizational commitment. As used in the present study, organizational commitment is the affective bond between employee and agency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1541204012460873">Lambert, Barton, &amp; Hogan, 1999</xref>). Both job satisfaction and organizational commitment have consistently been related to turnover intent and behavior in the adult corrections literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1541204012460873">Byrd et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1541204012460873">Jurik &amp; Winn, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1541204012460873">Lambert, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1541204012460873">Lambert &amp; Hogan, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1541204012460873">Lambert &amp; Paoline, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1541204012460873">Robinson, Porporino, &amp; Simourd, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1541204012460873">Stohr et al., 1992</xref>). However, no previously published study of turnover intent among juvenile correctional staff has analyzed organizational commitment. The present study addresses this void.</p>

<title>Adult Corrections</title>
<p>Despite differences in philosophy between juvenile and adult corrections, predictors of turnover intent and behavior appear to be similar. Like the few studies of staff turnover intent in juvenile corrections, many studies of adult correctional staff also reported inconclusive findings for personal characteristics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1541204012460873">Camp, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1541204012460873">Jurik &amp; Winn, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1541204012460873">Lambert, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1541204012460873">2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1541204012460873">Lambert &amp; Hogan, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1541204012460873">Lambert &amp; Paoline, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1541204012460873">Robinson et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1541204012460873">Slate &amp; Vogel, 1997</xref>). Being younger, female, minority, and possessing higher educational attainment are most likely to be associated with turnover (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1541204012460873">Lambert &amp; Hogan, 2009</xref>). Adult corrections staff research has produced mixed findings about the relationships of tenure, alternative employment opportunities, and position to turnover (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1541204012460873">Kiekbusch et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1541204012460873">Lambert &amp; Hogan, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1541204012460873">Slate &amp; Vogel, 1997</xref>). </p>
<p>In contrast to some juvenile corrections research discussed above, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1541204012460873">Lambert and Paoline (2010)</xref> did not find perceptions of coworker relations, dangerousness, and communication to predict turnover intent; nor were perceptions of supervision found to be predictive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1541204012460873">Lambert, 2006</xref>). At the same time, however, job satisfaction and organizational commitment represent two of the strongest predictors of turnover in the adult corrections literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1541204012460873">Jurik &amp; Winn, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1541204012460873">Lambert, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1541204012460873">Lambert &amp; Hogan, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1541204012460873">Lambert &amp; Paoline, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1541204012460873">Robinson et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1541204012460873">Stohr et al., 1992</xref>). Camp’s (1994) study is one exception where job satisfaction was nonsignificant, though organizational commitment was significant. Camp also found that actual turnover was more probable among staff working in lower security facilities but did not find individual (vs. collective) efficacy to be significant. </p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1541204012460873">Lambert and Hogan’s (2009)</xref> theoretical model of turnover intent in adult corrections posited direct effects of personal characteristics and job attitude variables (job satisfaction and organizational commitment) on intent, along with indirect effects of work environment variables on intent as mediated by job attitudes; their findings generally supported this model (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1541204012460873">Lambert &amp; Paoline, 2010</xref>). The present study tests for direct effects of all three categories of variables on turnover intent. As mentioned above, collective efficacy and facility type have not been examined in previous staff turnover research in juvenile corrections. The additional work environment variables studied here (perceptions of supervision, communication, coworkers, and safety/security) have been reported to be directly related to turnover intent in previous juvenile corrections research.</p>

<title>Participants and Data Collection</title>
<p>The survey described below was mailed to all staff working at DJJ facilities. Initially, 113 surveys were mailed for purposes of pilot testing, and 97 of these (85.8%) were returned. After minor wording clarifications based on pilot results, the survey was administered to the remaining 931 DJJ facility employees (i.e., in all 1,044 employees were given an opportunity to complete the survey). Using standard survey methodology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1541204012460873">Leeuw, Hox, &amp; Dillman, 2008</xref>), a prenotice, initial mailing, postcard reminder, and two follow-up mailings resulted in an overall response rate of 70.8% (<italic>N</italic> = 739); this includes the 97 responses from the pilot administration and 642 (67.0% of 931) from the main administration. Eleven staff working at a combination youth development/detention center were excluded due to this particular facility’s blended mission of providing treatment and programming for youth requiring long-term placement, as well as short-term detention for newly arrested juveniles, respectively. With this omission of 11 cases and omission of 51 cases that did not supply turnover intent data, analyses were restricted to 677 staff working at youth development centers, detention centers, group homes, and day treatment centers.</p>
<p>As revealed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1541204012460873">Table 1</xref>, the majority of respondents were male, white, lacking a college degree, and custody staff. Respondents were close to evenly split between working in rural and urban facilities. On average, respondents had an age of 40.94 with a standard deviation of 10.73 years. Respondents averaged about 8 years of experience in corrections with a standard deviation of about 7 years. Of the 677 respondents, 359 worked at youth development centers, 193 at detentions centers, 95 at group homes, and 30 at day treatment centers. The facility type variable was dummy-coded for inclusion in subsequent models as distinct variables. However, due to low variability, group homes and day treatment centers were omitted from further analysis. Youth developments centers and detention centers were coded 0 if not applicable and 1 if applicable. Both variables were included in each of the subsequent models.</p>

<title>Instrument and Variables</title>
<p>Turnover can take two forms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1541204012460873">Lambert, 2001</xref>). Voluntary turnover occurs when an employee quits or retires, whereas involuntary turnover is employer-initiated separation, as with layoffs and dismissals. Turnover intention involves an employee desiring to voluntary leave his or her employer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1541204012460873">Lambert &amp; Paoline, 2010</xref>). Because turnover behavior is difficult to measure if documentation is incomplete (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1541204012460873">Lambert, 2006</xref>), and because actual turnover data can be misleading in terms of employees’ motivations to quit (e.g., staff may leave in lieu of being fired), many researchers have measured turnover intent as a proxy for actual turnover behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1541204012460873">Cotton &amp; Tuttle, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1541204012460873">Lambert, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1541204012460873">Mitchell et al., 2000</xref>). The logic is that intent directly predicts actual behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1541204012460873">Steele &amp; Ovalle, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1541204012460873">Udechukwu, Harrington, Manyak, Segal, &amp; Graham, 2007</xref>). Furthermore, turnover intent is undesirable even when it does not culminate in actual turnover because persons who desire to leave are often less likely to contribute meaningfully to the organization than those who want to stay (E. G. Lambert, personnel communication, November 2011).</p>
<p>The turnover intent measure used as the dependent variable in this study was adapted from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1541204012460873">Blau’s (1998)</xref> Revised Work Withdrawal scale. The item asked respondents to indicate when they were likely to leave DJJ. Because turnover is frequently conceptualized in annual terms, the coding was such that those likely to leave within 12 months were categorized as having turnover intent and were coded 1, while those not intending to leave in this time frame were coded 0. Respondents were excluded if they indicated retirement as the reason for intending to leave within a year or if they failed to answer the survey question dealing with retirement (<italic>n</italic> = 51). The staff in this study did not face mandatory retirement requirements, and there was no way to discern whether retirement intent was due solely to the respondent’s decision to wrap up his or her DJJ career based on health, age, and/or years worked, or alternatively, if retirement represented a de facto means of quitting a job seen as less than desirable.</p>
<p>Recall that the work environment measures included respondents’ perceptions of the quality of supervision provided from superiors, collective efficacy, communication, coworkers, and the safety/security of the institution. Quality of supervision items were adapted from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1541204012460873">Saylor and Wright’s (1992)</xref> Prison Social Climate Survey (PSCS) and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1541204012460873">Downs and Hazen’s (1977)</xref> Communication Satisfaction Questionnaire. Collective efficacy items were adapted from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1541204012460873">Riggs, Warka, Babaska, Betancourt, and Hooker’s (1994)</xref> Collective Efficacy scale. Communication items were adapted from Downs and Hazen’s Communication Climate scale. Perceptions of coworkers items came from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1541204012460873">Cook and Wall’s (1988)</xref> Interpersonal Trust at Work scale. Perceptions of safety items were derived from the PSCS.</p>
<p>The job attitude measures included job satisfaction and affective organizational commitment. Job satisfaction was measured using items from the PSCS. Organizational commitment items came from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1541204012460873">Mowday, Steers, and Porter’s (1979)</xref> Organizational Commitment Questionnaire.</p>
<p>Each of the work environment and job attitude variables was measured using a 7-point Likert-type response format with most ranging from <italic>strongly disagree</italic> to <italic>strongly agree</italic>. Safety and security item responses, also using a 7-point Likert-type response format, ranged from <italic>not at all likely</italic> to <italic>very likely</italic>. Factor analysis was conducted using principal axis analyses and oblique rotation; based on eigenvalues and scree plots, a single factor was extracted for each latent concept with all the items for a given concept possessing a factor loading of .46 or greater.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1541204012460873">1</xref></sup> Cronbach’s αs of the finalized scales ranged from .79 to .92.

<p>Descriptive findings for the work environment and job attitude variables appear in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1541204012460873">Table 2</xref>. With exception to collective efficacy, respondents on average had ratings around the somewhat agree or somewhat likely categories for quality of supervision, communication, perceptions of coworkers, safety and security, organizational commitment, and job satisfaction. Responses to the Collective Efficacy scale were more centered but also more varied with an average of 4.09 and a standard deviation of 2.05.

<p>Prior to conducting multivariate analyses, several preliminary and diagnostic analyses were conducted. The negatively worded safety and security items were reverse coded to make interpretations more intuitive (i.e., the higher the score, the more safe/secure the facility is perceived). Some variables were found to be positively (safety and security) or negatively (quality of supervision, communication, job satisfaction, perceptions of coworkers) skewed; these were subjected to square root and logarithmic transformations. In the remaining tables, variables that were reflexed (due to negative skewness) are denoted. For these variables, the interpretations must be reversed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1541204012460873">Tabachnick &amp; Fidell, 2000</xref>). In addition, six cases were removed from analysis because they were identified as univariate (<italic>n</italic> = 4) or multivariate (<italic>n</italic> = 2) outliers. Dichotomous variables were verified to possess no less than 10% of cases in a given category.</p>
<p>Zero-order correlations, tolerance coefficients, and variance inflation factors were examined as tests for multicollinearity. No variables were correlated enough to be removed from the analyses. It was also verified that there was a sufficient ratio of cases to variables.</p>
<p>Other preliminary analyses, including several types of scatterplots, were conducted to check for violations of assumptions appropriate for linear regression models. Histograms of standardized residuals and plots of observed versus expected residuals revealed no significant departures from normality. In addition, plots of standardized residuals against standardized predicted values displayed no violations of the equality of variance assumption. Likewise, residual plots checking for outliers showed no unusual values that could have any substantial impact on the results of the analyses. We also performed post hoc inspection of the standard errors of the regression coefficients to be sure none exceeded a value of one (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1541204012460873">Tabachnick &amp; Fidell, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>To examine bivariate relationships with turnover intent, Pearson correlation coefficients were computed and are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1541204012460873">Table 3</xref>. The personal characteristics of age, experience, and custody/noncustody staff were significantly related to turnover intent. Custody staff, younger respondents, and those with less experience were more likely to have intentions of leaving within 1 year.</p>

<p>All work environment variables except collective efficacy and facility type were found to be significantly associated with turnover intent in the bivariate analyses. Lower perceptions of quality of supervision, communication, perceptions of coworkers, and safety and security were associated with a greater likelihood to intend to leave in 1 year, respectively. Likewise, both job attitude variables displayed a significant relationship with turnover intent; lower organizational commitment and lower job satisfaction were significantly related to a higher likelihood of intending to leave within 1 year.</p>
<p>To test the effects of the predictor variables on turnover intent simultaneously, a three-stage logistic regression analysis was performed. Using the enter method, the first block introduced personal variables, the second block added work environment variables, and the final block added the job attitude variables.

<p>With listwise deletion for missing responses, the total sample was reduced by 137 cases to 534 cases for multivariate analyses. A check on data loss revealed that whether a respondent intended to leave within a year was independent of whether a case was included in logistic regression modeling (χ<sup>2</sup> = 2.456, <italic>df</italic> = 1, <italic>p</italic> = .117).</p>
<p>Block 1, containing only personal characteristics, resulted in a significant overall model composed of two significant predictors. Noncustody staff and older staff had higher likelihoods of intending to stay. The model did not correctly classify any of those who intended to leave but correctly classified all of those intending to stay. Further, the model only accounted for a small proportion of the variability in turnover intent.</p>
<p>Block 2 improved on Block 1 by adding work environment variables. The model was significant and contained four significant predictors. Age and position remained significant in that older and noncustodial staff had higher likelihoods of intending to stay. Communication and perceptions of coworkers were also significant in this model. Those who had lower perceptions of communication were over 50.5 times more likely to have intentions of quitting, and those with lower perceptions of coworkers were over 3.5 times more likely to intend to leave. Compared to Block 1, Block 2 accounted for a greater proportion of variability in turnover intentions, correctly classifying 99.6% of those intending to stay and 27.3% of those intending to leave.</p>
<p>Block 3 represented the strongest model and included personal characteristics, work environment variables, and job attitude variables. The model was significant with the two job attitude variables as the only significant predictors, although both personal characteristics from the previous blocks (age and position) approached significance. Both job satisfaction and affective organizational commitment were inversely related to turnover intent. This model accounted for the greatest proportion of variability in turnover intent, and it correctly classified 99.2% of those who intended to stay and 36.4% of those who intended to leave.</p>
<p>Because job satisfaction and organizational commitment were the only variables to have significant direct effects on turnover intent in the final block of entry just presented, both were regressed on the personal and work environment variables in order to examine direct effects on job attitudes. Treating these ordinal variables as interval results in several advantages, including: (1) the use of more powerful, sensitive, better developed, and interpretable statistics with known sampling error; (2) the retention of more knowledge about the characteristics of the data; and (3) greater versatility in statistical manipulation (e.g., partial and multiple correlation and regression, analysis of variance and covariance, and most pictorial presentation; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1541204012460873">Labovitz, 1970</xref>). Therefore, ordinary least squares regression was utilized, and results are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-1541204012460873">Table 5</xref>. It can be seen that in the first blocks of both the job satisfaction and organizational commitment models (containing only personal characteristics), just one variable was significant; noncustody staff displayed higher job satisfaction and higher organizational commitment. When work environment variables were added (Block 2 of each model), position remained a significant predictor of job satisfaction but was not predictive of organizational commitment. Likewise, gender and age were significant predictors of job satisfaction (with job satisfaction higher among female and older staff), but this did not hold for organizational commitment. Additionally, both job satisfaction and organizational commitment were significantly greater among staff with higher perceptions of supervision, communication, and coworkers. The combination of significant predictors in Block 2 of each model accounted for nearly half the variability in job satisfaction and over half in organizational commitment.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The data from this study revealed that just over 11% of the survey respondents intended to leave DJJ within a year other than to retire. This figure is less than the turnover intent figure of 21% reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1541204012460873">Mitchell et al. (2000)</xref> in their study of staff in juvenile corrections. It is also less than the actual annual turnover figure of nearly 20% reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1541204012460873">Wright (1993)</xref> and the actual figure of over 30% reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1541204012460873">Minor et al. (2011)</xref> in a study of relatively new staff. While 11% is at the lower end of the 12–25% range for annual turnover in adult corrections cited by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1541204012460873">Lambert (2001)</xref>, having this proportion of staff express intent to leave within the next year cannot be considered a good outcome, given the various costs of turnover to an organization. So clearly this study adds to the mounting body of research demonstrating that staff turnover is a significant issue in corrections, including at the juvenile level.</p>
<p>Multivariate analyses revealed that job attitude variables were the only significant predictors of turnover intent. In contrast to what past research with staff in juvenile corrections has shown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1541204012460873">Liou, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1541204012460873">Mitchell et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1541204012460873">Tipton, 2002</xref>), neither personal nor work environment variables significantly predicted intent to leave. Three work environment variables examined in this study (quality of supervision, collective efficacy, and facility type) have received minimal attention in prior literature on correctional staff turnover. However, none of these variables were predictive of turnover intent. The most tenable interpretation is that the effects of select personal and work environment variables on turnover intent are indirect and mediated by job attitudes. This interpretation is consistent with the results in the present study of the regression of job attitude variables on personal and work environment variables. The interpretation is also consistent with research on adult correctional staff that has included measures of both job satisfaction and organizational commitment. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1541204012460873">Lambert and Hogan (2009)</xref> reported that besides job satisfaction and organizational commitment, the only other direct predictor of turnover intent was age; the effects of other personal and work environment variables were indirect. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1541204012460873">Lambert and Paoline (2010)</xref> reached a similar conclusion except that education and supervisor status of the staff member also directly predicted intent.</p>
<p>Similar to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1541204012460873">Lambert and Paoline’s (2010)</xref> research, the results of the present study support drawing a conceptual distinction between work environment variables and job attitude variables. The perceptions staff form of the environment that surrounds them at work (e.g., supervisors, coworkers, safety) are distinguishable from the attitudes they hold toward themselves vis-à-vis their own job and relationship to the organization. This does not mean that work environment variables are unimportant, only that the effects of these variables on turnover intention are likely to be indirect and mediated by job attitudes, particularly job satisfaction and organizational commitment.</p>
<p>The utility of job satisfaction for predicting turnover intention in the present study is consistent with most previous studies of staff in both juvenile and adult corrections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1541204012460873">Byrd et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1541204012460873">Jurik &amp; Winn, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1541204012460873">Lambert &amp; Hogan, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1541204012460873">Lambert &amp; Paoline, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1541204012460873">Liou, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1541204012460873">Mitchell et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1541204012460873">Tipton, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1541204012460873">Wright, 1993</xref>). Job satisfaction speaks to the fit between an individual and his or her job (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1541204012460873">Stohr et al., 1992</xref>). It makes sense that when fit is strong and workers like their jobs, they will be less likely to intend to leave. This is especially the case when people who like their particular jobs also fit well with and are affectively committed to the larger organization for which they work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1541204012460873">Lambert et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1541204012460873">Stohr et al., 1992</xref>).</p>
<p>Research on adult correctional staff has consistently shown a negative relationship between organizational commitment and turnover intent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1541204012460873">Camp, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1541204012460873">Lambert, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1541204012460873">Lambert &amp; Hogan, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1541204012460873">Lambert &amp; Paoline, 2010</xref>). While <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1541204012460873">Liou (1995)</xref> researched predictors of organizational commitment among juvenile detention staff, the present study is the first investigation of turnover intent among staff in juvenile corrections to include a measure of organizational commitment and confirm the role of this variable in predicting intent. The evidence is strong that employees who are affectively bonded and committed to their organization are more likely to display intentions of staying with that organization. While <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1541204012460873">Minor et al. (2011)</xref> did not find organizational commitment to predict actual turnover among newer staff, the authors observed that it often takes time on the job for staff members to develop such commitment. </p>
<p>Like most studies, this one has limitations to be considered in interpreting results and thinking about their implications. The cross sectional research design does not allow analysis of causal processes, such as how dynamics underlying turnover intention might possibly shift over time or factors associated with these shifts. It seems important to consider how changes in the work environment, brought on for example by shifts in facility populations, staffing levels, administration, and resource allocations, may help alter levels of job satisfaction and organizational commitment. Additionally, the present study was delimited to juvenile facility staff in one jurisdiction having a relatively centralized state-level administrative structure. To the extent that the findings are contextual, they cannot necessarily be generalized to other jurisdictions, particularly ones with more regional or localized administrative structures.</p>
<p>In addition to issues of internal and external validity, there are issues involving construct validity. The facility location variable used in this study may not have been a good proxy for staff members’ perceptions of alternative employment opportunities; the variable could have tapped aspects of rural culture besides availability of employment options. Research on adult correctional staff using more direct measures of perceptions of alternative employment has yielded mixed findings about the relationship between this variable and turnover intent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1541204012460873">Kiekbusch et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1541204012460873">Lambert &amp; Hogan, 2009</xref>). While the measure of job satisfaction used displayed reasonably good internal consistency and factor loadings, alternative measures may better tap the more global dimensions of this construct (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1541204012460873">Lambert &amp; Paoline, 2010</xref>). Likewise, only affective organizational commitment was measured in this study. There are other types, such as continuance commitment and normative commitment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1541204012460873">Meyer &amp; Allen, 1991</xref>), and the type/types measured in a particular study can affect results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1541204012460873">Lambert, Hogan, Jiang, 2008</xref>). Finally, in the present study, the measure of turnover intent was a single item that asked respondents (excluding impending retirees) to indicate when they aimed to leave their job. Though single-item measures of intent are rather common (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1541204012460873">Camp, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1541204012460873">Kiekbusch et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1541204012460873">Lambert &amp; Paoline, 2010</xref>), use of a multi-item scale may have altered the findings by expanding the measurement of intent beyond simple likelihood to include thoughts of quitting, desire to quit, and job-seeking activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1541204012460873">Lambert &amp; Hogan, 2009</xref>). </p>
<p>Depending on the estimate used, the best prediction model in this study accounted for between 19.3% and 40% of the variability in turnover intention and correctly classified slightly over a third of those who intended to leave. This means that in the best case scenario, 60% of the variance in the predicted variable of interest remained unaccounted for by the variables studied here, suggesting that additional variables are required to account for turnover intention. For instance, one candidate is the additional job attitude measure of job involvement (i.e., a person’s identification with and prioritization of their job), which <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1541204012460873">Lambert and Paoline (2010)</xref> reported to be a significant negative predictor of turnover intent among jail staff. Another candidate, this one more behavioral in nature, is organizational citizenship, which refers to actions taken by staff which exceed what is expected of them at work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1541204012460873">Lambert, 2010</xref>). It may also prove worthwhile to include local or state economic indicators, such as unemployment or job growth figures, in future investigations of correctional staff turnover to help better gauge alternative employment prospects.</p>
<p>It seems clear that staff turnover will continue to be a drain on budgets and constrain the effectiveness of many adult and juvenile correctional organizations unless agencies are able to counter factors promoting these negative outcomes. Fortunately, the findings of this study and others suggest that there are feasible steps agencies can undertake in this respect.</p>
<p>The results of this research imply that correctional agencies seeking to curtail turnover intent among their staff need to proactively search for and implement ways to encourage staff to like their jobs and be committed to the organizations of which they are part. In conjunction with prior research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1541204012460873">Lambert, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1541204012460873">Lambert &amp; Hogan, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1541204012460873">Lambert &amp; Paoline, 2010</xref>), the present study suggests that one promising way to promote job satisfaction and organizational commitment is through improvement of the work environment. More specifically, the results of the present study imply targeting improvement efforts at staff perceptions of supervision, organizational communication, and coworkers. It makes sense that staff should exhibit greater job satisfaction and organizational commitment to the extent that they: (a) have more favorable perceptions of the supervision they receive; (b) believe that expectations and responsibilities are communicated in a way that stimulates staff motivation and promotes identification with the agency; and (c) see their coworkers as reliable, trustworthy, and worthy of confidence. Efforts to better manage the turnover issue in corrections should be informed and guided by evidence of this nature provided from ongoing research into the predictors of turnover intent and behavior. It is important to remember that left unabated a staff turnover problem can feed on and exacerbate itself by draining monetary resources and promoting organizational instability and ineffectiveness. A pattern of failing to maximize and all too frequently losing valuable staff resources is unsustainable in today’s economic climate.</p>
