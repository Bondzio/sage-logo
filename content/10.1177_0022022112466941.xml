<abstract>
<p>Overcoming identity crises during adolescence may help adolescents understand the world around them. Although adolescents may have developmental potential for wisdom, little is known about the direct relationship between wisdom and ego-identity or any cross-cultural effects. Wisdom dimensions (cognitive, affective, and reflective) and ego-identity statuses (achievement, moratorium, foreclosure, and diffusion) among 639 Korean and American late adolescents (aged 18 to 22) were investigated. The findings suggest that (a) age contributes to reflective wisdom, (b) identity achievement associates with wisdom among Korean but not among American adolescents, and (c) foreclosure and diffusion statuses are negatively associated with wisdom. This highlights school curriculum trends and emphasizes reflective wisdom for holistic adolescent development. However, the findings should be interpreted with caution.</p>

<p>Adolescence is a period of dramatic changes in terms of physical, intellectual, and socio-emotional development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0022022112466941">Piaget &amp; Inhelder, 1973</xref>). Some adolescents may adjust to the adolescence period well, whereas others may not. During this period, identity achievement is the main psychosocial developmental goal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0022022112466941">Erikson, 1968</xref>). While going through identity crises, adolescents have the opportunity to think deeply about who they are, what they want, and where they are going (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0022022112466941">Erikson, 1968</xref>). This opportunity may promote cognitive and metacognitive reasoning ability: the ability to see different perspectives, to judge and make decisions, to solve problems, and to eventually find who they are and what they want out of life. Furthermore, working through the identity stage may assist adolescents with socio-emotional development, such as dealing with emotions and connecting with others. Through this ego-identity formation process, adolescents may not only enhance their intellectual capability but also promote their social skills, life values, and wisdom.</p>
<p>Wisdom as the extension of ego development has been discussed by Erikson. Erikson’s psychosocial development focuses heavily on the outcomes of ego development, and wisdom is the basic strength during the ego integrity versus despair stage. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0022022112466941">Erikson (1968)</xref> has posited that ego-identity is one of the key developmental tasks and that wisdom is a virtue acquired after overcoming various developmental crises and accomplishing positive resolutions related to each developmental stage of life. If this is the case, then positive ego-identity development can be an important source for wisdom development, and the ego-identity development stage during adolescence could be related to at least a certain aspect of wisdom development.</p>
<p>Despite disagreements around the concept of <italic>wisdom</italic> (e.g., explicit theory vs. implicit theory), many wisdom researchers agree that wisdom is multidimensional and integrates knowledge, traits, emotion, and virtue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0022022112466941">Birren &amp; Fisher, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0022022112466941">Brugman, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0022022112466941">Chandler, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0022022112466941">Clayton &amp; Birren, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0022022112466941">Kunzmann, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0022022112466941">Randall &amp; Kenyon, 2001</xref>). Although wisdom is generally considered an asset of maturity that develops with age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0022022112466941">Ardelt, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0022022112466941">Richardson &amp; Pasupathi, 2005</xref>), we often encounter youth with wisdom beyond their years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0022022112466941">Piechowski, 2006</xref>). Age as a predictor of wisdom has been controversial; some scholars have argued that wisdom is more likely to develop during the adult years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0022022112466941">Baltes, Smith, &amp; Staudinger, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0022022112466941">Clayton &amp; Birren, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-0022022112466941">Sternberg, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-0022022112466941">Takahashi &amp; Overton, 2005</xref>), while others argue that wisdom only loosely relates to age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0022022112466941">Jordan, 2005</xref>) or that it is even lost over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0022022112466941">Meacham, 1990</xref>). In addition, because Western and Eastern perspectives of wisdom differ in important ways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0022022112466941">Birren &amp; Svensson, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-0022022112466941">Takahashi, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-0022022112466941">Takahashi, &amp; Overton, 2005</xref>), it is necessary to look at how cultures influence the development of wisdom in the West and East.</p>
<p>The purpose of the study is to explore how Korean and U.S. (hereafter referred to as American) late adolescents (age 18 to 22 according to the classification of the Society for Research on Adolescence; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0022022112466941">Goossens, 2006</xref>) demonstrate wisdom and form ego-identity and how their identity development is related to their wisdom with respect to their cultures and ages. Better knowledge about the relationship between wisdom and ego-identity development can be used to understand adolescent psychosocial development—to help adolescents overcome their identity crises, enhance their emotional well-being, and be motivated to seek meaning in life.</p>

<title>Ego-Identity During Adolescence</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0022022112466941">Erikson (1968)</xref> discusses wisdom as the result of positive ego development after resolving developmental tasks in each psychosocial stage. Ego-identity is the sense of self and feeling of control that changes through social interaction and is the major developmental task during adolescence. Ego-identity development influences the later stages of ego development, and this ultimately leads to the development of wisdom. As Erikson admitted, his own description of identity content has not been very specific; thus, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0022022112466941">Marcia (1966)</xref> has suggested a different operationalization. Marcia’s different forms of ego-identity (identity achievement, moratorium, foreclosure, and diffusion) helped support Erikson’s theory that adolescents who resolve identity crisis successfully are those who have the ability to resolve crises successfully in adulthood.</p>
<p>Among Marcia’s four statuses of ego-identity, identity achievement refers to individuals who have explored identity alternatives and have made their own decisions in terms of choosing their occupation, religion, or politics. Adolescents who are in the moratorium status are still in the process of exploring, are still confused, and are trying to find a compromise between social demands, parents’ wishes, and their own abilities. Those in the foreclosure status have never started exploring, and their parents’ wishes or goals become theirs. Finally, those in the identity diffusion status have not explored identity alternatives, and their independent choice of occupation, religion, or politics might be easily abandoned due to incidental changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0022022112466941">Marcia, 1966</xref>). Studies support that individuals in identity achievement status are more likely to recognize their strengths and weaknesses and have a well-articulated sense of self than those in diffusion, and individuals in moratorium status are more likely committed to explore their choices than those in foreclosure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0022022112466941">Klimstra, Hale, Raaijmakers, Branje, &amp; Meeus, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0022022112466941">Kroger, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0022022112466941">Meeus, Idedma, Hersen, &amp; Vollebergh, 1999</xref>).</p>

<title>Wisdom: Theories, Cultural Contexts, and Dimensions</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0022022112466941">Erikson’s (1982)</xref> definition of wisdom is related to the introspection of one’s life in regards to contentment and detachment when facing death. Because wisdom, for Erikson, is attained at the very last stage of life after the other stages are completed successfully, using Erikson’s definition may not be appropriate for measuring adolescents’ wisdom. Thus, an integrated definition of wisdom more appropriate to adolescents as well as better suited toward investigating cross-cultural effects is called for. Rather than using Erikson’s definition, this study utilizes as its theoretical framework implicit theories of wisdom (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0022022112466941">Clayton &amp; Birren, 1980</xref>) and Erikson’s psychosocial human development, especially the ego-identity achievement versus role confusion stage.</p>
<p>Historically, the concept of Western wisdom has emphasized cognitive dimensions such as reasoning, sense of justice, knowledge, and judgment. The concept of Eastern wisdom, on the other hand, has focused more on reflective aspects such as intuition, enlightenment, and mindfulness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0022022112466941">Cottingham, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0022022112466941">Magee, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-0022022112466941">Takahashi, 2000</xref>). Many contemporary wisdom studies have utilized either explicit or implicit theories of wisdom as theoretical and conceptual frameworks. Explicit theories, constructed by expert theorists, emphasize wisdom as an expert knowledge system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0022022112466941">Baltes, 1993</xref>). Implicit theories of wisdom, on the other hand, explore how lay people map core concepts of wisdom (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0022022112466941">Clayton &amp; Birren, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0022022112466941">Holliday &amp; Chandler, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-0022022112466941">Sternberg, 1986</xref>). Implicit wisdom theories, for example, include flexibility, honesty, sensitivity, compassion, understanding, altruism, gratitude, harmony of mind and body, and acceptance of reality as characteristics of wisdom (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0022022112466941">Clayton &amp; Birren, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-0022022112466941">Takahashi, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>Western scholars suggest that intelligence and knowledge are not sufficient to lead to wise decisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0022022112466941">Birren &amp; Svensson, 2005</xref>), even though traditionally wisdom has been characterized by intelligence and knowledge in the West. Eastern concepts of wisdom, on the other hand, not only include innate traits like intuition and compassion but also emphasize mental discipline to seek wisdom in order to benefit others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-0022022112466941">Takahashi, 2000</xref>). Because this study attempts to explore cultural differences among Koreans (one example of Eastern culture) and Americans (one example of Western culture) and also because the multifaceted nature of wisdom includes holistic human achievement, it adopts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0022022112466941">Ardelt’s (2003)</xref> adaptation of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0022022112466941">Clayton and Birren’s (1980)</xref> definition of wisdom—the combination of cognitive, reflective, and affective characteristics derived from both the Western and Eastern wisdom traditions.</p>
<p>Specifically, in this study, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0022022112466941">Ardelt’s (2003)</xref> Three Dimensional Wisdom Scale (3D-WS) is employed. According to Ardelt, the cognitive dimension of wisdom refers to an individual’s capability and willingness to understand life or phenomena thoroughly. The reflective dimension refers to meta-cognition and reflective thinking skills to develop self-awareness and insight, which makes it possible to perceive reality without deformation. Elements of the reflective dimension assess the degree to which subjectivity and projection are overcome by examining phenomena from different perspectives and the extent to which adolescents can avoid blaming other situations or people. The affective dimension of wisdom refers to the presence of positive emotions and behaviors toward others. Empathy and compassion are desirable, while indifference or negative emotions are not desirable behaviors toward others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0022022112466941">Ardelt, 2003</xref>). Although scholars agree on the multifaceted nature of wisdom, most definitions of wisdom consist of the cognitive and reflective dimensions, while ignoring the affective dimension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0022022112466941">Ardelt, 2003</xref>).</p>

<title>Wisdom and Ego-Identity Research in Adolescence</title>
<p>Although many studies have dealt with adolescent identity formation, little empirical research on adolescent wisdom has been carried out (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0022022112466941">Richardson &amp; Pasupathi, 2005</xref>). Moreover, cross-cultural comparison studies with regard to wisdom are even rarer. However, a recent study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0022022112466941">Benedikovicova and Ardelt (2008)</xref> used a cross-cultural comparison to measure wisdom between American and Slovak college students using Ardelt’s 3D-WS. The results of the study showed that American students scored significantly higher on cognitive and reflective dimensions of wisdom, while Slovak students scored significantly higher on the affective dimension of wisdom.</p>
<p>Few wisdom studies of the Berlin School have focused on adolescents. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0022022112466941">Pasupathi, Staudinger, and Baltes (2001)</xref>, for example, studied adolescents’ wisdom-related knowledge and judgment based on explicit theories of wisdom. Their study showed that although adolescents revealed strong growth potential in the realm of wisdom, they demonstrated lower levels of wisdom-related knowledge and judgment than adults. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-0022022112466941">Staudinger and Pasupathi (2003)</xref> suggested that intelligence and personality appear as the strongest predictors of wisdom-related performance among adolescents, whereas the interface is the strongest predictors of adults. The study implied positive development for wisdom among adolescents. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0022022112466941">Ardelt (2009)</xref>, on the other hand, used implicit theory to examine wisdom dimensions (cognitive, reflective, and affective) and compared wisdom between college students (18 to 22+) and adults (age 52+). She found that college-educated older adults scored higher on the reflective and affective dimensions of wisdom and concluded that wisdom might increase with age.</p>
<p>Little is known about cross-cultural comparison of ego-identity development between American and Korean adolescents. Although Erikson argued that ego-identity crisis occurs in early adolescence and is usually resolved by the age of 15 to 18, other scholars argue that identity formation occurs much later than what Erikson had originally assumed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0022022112466941">Berzonsky, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0022022112466941">Kroger, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-0022022112466941">Waterman, 1982</xref>). According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0022022112466941">Marcia (1999)</xref>, 22% of university students in North America are in diffusion status and 57% in identity achievement, whereas others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0022022112466941">Adams, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0022022112466941">Berzonsky, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0022022112466941">Berzonsky &amp; Adams, 1999</xref>) argued that the percentage of individuals who have achieved ego-identity is much lower (26% to 40%) and the percentage of university students in diffusion status is higher (16% to 26%). A Korean identity study revealed that Korean adolescent identity development is much slower compared to that of Western adolescents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0022022112466941">H. Kim, 1989</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0022022112466941">H. Kim (1989)</xref> argued that only 30% of South Korean undergraduate sophomores (19 or 20 years old) have achieved identity status, whereas 17% are in diffusion status, 19% in identity foreclosure, and 25% in moratorium status. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0022022112466941">Berzonsky, Macek, &amp; Nurmi (2003)</xref> studied identity formation process among late adolescents across three Western countries, the United States, Czech, and Finland, and found that identity processing styles are comparable in the Western industrialized countries. Few studies however, including H. Kim’s &amp; Berzonsky et al.’s, have provided direct insight into cross-cultural (Western vs. Eastern) differences with respect to identity development.</p>
<p>Although no study has shown a direct relationship between wisdom and ego-identity, some wisdom literature makes a connection to Erikson’s psychosocial development, since Erikson claimed that there is a connection between wisdom and the achievement of ego-identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0022022112466941">Blustein &amp; Philips, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0022022112466941">Jang, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0022022112466941">E. Song, 1999</xref>). Research has shown that the ego-identity status of adolescents is associated with their prosocial as well as antisocial behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0022022112466941">Donovan, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0022022112466941">Hogan, 1973</xref>), life values (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0022022112466941">Park, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0022022112466941">Ryff, 1989</xref>), and their eventual success. Adolescents who have achieved ego-identity are able to use adaptive defense mechanisms, achieve positive self-esteem, and use stable decision-making strategies, even under stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0022022112466941">Blustein &amp; Philips, 1990</xref>). Furthermore, other research indicates that logical thinking and wisdom-related knowledge drastically increase during adolescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0022022112466941">Richardson &amp; Pasupathi, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Although many studies have investigated Korean adolescents’ ego-identity, little research with this population has focused on wisdom (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0022022112466941">S. Kim, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0022022112466941">Park, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0022022112466941">I. Song, 1998</xref>). There are, however, studies showing the relationship between ego-identity and certain aspects of wisdom. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0022022112466941">S. Kim (2005)</xref>, for example, studied ego-identity status and social problem-solving ability among Korean adolescents and showed that ego-identity scores correlated positively with social problem-solving ability. Other Korean studies confirmed a positive correlation between efforts to find the meaning of life and ego-identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0022022112466941">Park, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0022022112466941">I. Song, 1998</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0022022112466941">Park (1983)</xref> found that individuals with higher scores on ego-identity achievement reveal high creativity and a felt meaning of life, whereas individuals with lower scores on ego-identity achievement often have a feeling of meaninglessness in life. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0022022112466941">I. Song (1998)</xref> reported that individuals with a positive self-concept made an effort to find the meaning of life even within hostile environments and life-threatening experiences. I. Song’s results detailing the positive relationship between ego-identity achievement and search for life meaning, social problem-solving skills, and positive self-concept can be thought of as the potential for wisdom development. In a North American study (Canada), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0022022112466941">McLean and Pratt (2006)</xref> also found a link between more sophisticated meaning making and a mature identity.</p>
<p>As respective representations of Eastern and Western cultures, Korea and the United States were chosen based on the theoretical and conceptual framework of the study, as well as the first author’s extensive relationship and experience with both cultures. Cultural differences are expected because most Korean adolescents depend heavily on their parents during their school years, including their college years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0022022112466941">I. Kim &amp; Jang, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0022022112466941">S. Song, 1993</xref>). As well, most Korean adolescents spend their days and weekends in traditional schools and/or cram schools to prepare for tests, school work, or university entrance exams (“examination hell”; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0022022112466941">H. Lee &amp; Cheon, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0022022112466941">M. Lee, 2003</xref>), whereas American adolescents work, drive, date, and are involved in clubs and sports. Thus, Korean adolescents are in more protective environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0022022112466941">Heo, 2004</xref>), which may influence not only their ego-identity but also wisdom development.</p>
<p>The formation of ego-identity appears to be related to the development of wisdom-related knowledge as well as wise behaviors and actions. Few studies, however, have analyzed the systematic interaction between wisdom and ego-identity status among adolescents. Besides, although wisdom has a long history of being studied philosophically, modern wisdom research has focused more on conceptualizing and measuring wisdom (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0022022112466941">Baltes &amp; Kunzmann, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0022022112466941">Sternberg, 1998</xref>). Furthermore, most of the wisdom-related studies concern Western populations, whereas comparatively fewer studies have concerned Eastern populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-0022022112466941">Takahashi, 2000</xref>), and almost no wisdom research has dealt with Korean individuals specifically. In response to this gap in the research, Korean and American late adolescents (age 18 to 22; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0022022112466941">Goossens, 2006</xref>) were chosen as cultural examples from East and West.</p>
<p>In a nutshell, this study specifically examined (a) the influence of culture and age on ego-identity and wisdom, including their interaction effects; (b) in-depth cultural differences with mean scores of ego-identity and wisdom development between Korean and American late adolescents; and (c) the relationship between ego-identity statuses and wisdom dimensions.</p>

<title>Participants</title>
<p>The study examined 267 South Koreans (all native) who attended a university in a southern city in Korea and 372 American students who attended a large state university located in a college town in the Midwest in the United States. The populations of this study are representative of college populations in the two country contexts and their respective cultural differences. In South Korea, the majority of universities are located in urban areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0022022112466941">Center for Education Statistics, 2009</xref>). In the United States, the “college town” concept is a uniquely American phenomenon, and a significant number of U.S. university students attend schools in these locales (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0022022112466941">Gumprecht, 2008</xref>). Korean and American undergraduate students (<italic>N</italic> = 639) ranging in age from 18 to 22 were recruited. Korean and American participants majored in education (32% and 20%, respectively), business (19% and 15%, respectively), engineering (29% and 8%, respectively), arts and science (14% and 21%, respectively), agricultural science (20% American only), and other areas (6% and 16%, respectively). The average age of the Korean adolescents was 19.60 (<italic>SD</italic> = 1.47 years), whereas among American adolescents, the average age was 19.87 (<italic>SD</italic> = 1.32 years). With respect to gender, Korean and American female adolescents who participated in this study were 50% and 56%, respectively. Among American students, Native Americans (<italic>n</italic> = 38, 10.2%), Caucasians (<italic>n</italic> = 251, 67.6%), African Americans (<italic>n</italic> = 58, 15.6%), Hispanics (<italic>n</italic> = 5, 1.3%), Asians/Pacific Islanders (<italic>n</italic> = 5, 1.3%), and others (<italic>n</italic> = 15, 4%) participated in the study.</p>

<title>Measures</title>
<p>Each participant was asked to complete a short demographic survey. The information requested included age, gender, and ethnicity, as well as the 3D-WS and the Revised Version of the Extended Objective Measure of Ego-Identity Status (RV-EOM-EIS).</p>
<sec id="section8-0022022112466941">
<title>3D-WS</title>
<p>Wisdom was assessed using the 3D-WS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0022022112466941">Ardelt, 2003</xref>), which has 39 items designed with a Likert-type scale (ranging from 1 to 5 with 1 = <italic>strongly disagree</italic>, 2 = <italic>disagree</italic>, 3 = <italic>neutral</italic>, 4 = <italic>agree</italic>, and 5 = <italic>strongly agree</italic>; 3 as cutoff point). The scale includes 14 cognitive (e.g., “Ignorance is bliss”), 12 reflective (e.g., “I would feel much better if my present circumstances changed”), and 13 affective (e.g., “I am annoyed by unhappy people who just feel sorry for themselves”) items (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0022022112466941">Ardelt, 2003</xref>). All cognitive, reflective, and affective dimensions showed moderate internal reliability, with Cronbach’s alpha scores ranging from .71 to .78.

<title>Ego-identity status measurement</title>
<p>Ego-identity statuses were determined by the RV-EOM-EIS. The original RV-EOM-EIS had 64 Likert-type scale items, including ideological (occupation, politics, religion, and philosophical lifestyle) and interpersonal domains (friendship, dating, sex roles, and recreation) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0022022112466941">Bennion &amp; Adams, 1986</xref>). However, only ideological domains were used with a Likert-type scale (ranging from 1 to 5, with 1 = <italic>strongly disagree</italic>, 2 = <italic>disagree</italic>, 3 = <italic>neutral</italic>, 4 = <italic>agree</italic>, and 5 = <italic>strongly agree</italic>) to assess four ego-identity statuses in this study because of cultural differences when examining interpersonal domains. Dating and recreation, for example, are not a big part of Korean adolescents’ life since they have to focus on preparing for the university entrance exam, not only at school but also after school (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0022022112466941">M. Lee, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0022022112466941">H. Lee &amp; Cheon, 2003</xref>). Among 32 ideological items, 16 total were selected. Those items (a total of 4 items in each status) were chosen based on the researchers’ judgment of goodness of fit with the theory.</p>
<p>Ideological domain includes philosophy (e.g., “After considerable thought I’ve developed my own individual viewpoint of what is for me an ideal ‘lifestyle’ and don’t believe anyone will be likely to change my perspective”—achievement), politics (e.g., “There are so many different political parties and ideals. I can’t decide which to follow until I figure it all out.”—moratorium), occupation (e.g., “My parents decided a long time ago what I should go into for employment and I’m following through their plans”—foreclosure), and religion (e.g., “I don’t give religion much thought and it doesn’t bother me one way or the other”—diffusion).</p>
<p>While measuring ego-identity, it is also possible that an individual may reveal more than one identity status depending on whether or not he or she has achieved identity. An individual may have achieved identity in the philosophy domain but may have not achieved identity in the religion domain. For these reasons, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0022022112466941">Bennion and Adams (1986)</xref> reported that the internal consistency of the RV-EOM-EIS is low, with a Cronbach’s alpha just over .60, except for interpersonal moratorium, which was .58. Likewise, this study yielded similar Cronbach’s alpha scores ranging from .61 to .67. At the same time, it is not easy to classify each individual into an identity status. Thus, we treat identity status as latent variables rather than analyzing membership. Nonetheless, even with this challenge, RV-EOM-EIS has been widely used because of the quantitative nature of the measure based on Marcia’s ego-identity status theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0022022112466941">Bishop, Weisgram, Holleque, Lund, &amp; Wheeler-Anderson, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0022022112466941">Ohnish, Ibrahim, &amp; Owen, 2001</xref>).</p>

<title>Procedure and Data Analysis Methods</title>
<p>This study was conducted online during a month-long data collection period in 2008. The participants were recruited through instructors willing to help with the data collection. The participants were then informed about the duration, confidentiality, voluntary nature, and procedure of the survey. The instruments took about 30 minutes to complete. All instruments were translated into Korean for the Korean participants and reverse-translated and compared for accuracy to the English forms.</p>
<p>Even with this small range of age differences (5 years), following preliminary analysis findings indicating age-related differences within the sample, the group was further divided into two age groups (18 to 19 and 20 to 22). The 18- to 19-year-olds had just transitioned from high school/secondary school and might have not yet shifted to emotional, financial, and residential independence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0022022112466941">Arnett, 2000</xref>), whereas the older ones, having been away from school for at least 2 years, were closer to adulthood (emerging adulthood) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0022022112466941">Arnett, 2000</xref>). In the preliminary analysis, gender effects were not significant across cultures and across age groups in neither wisdom nor ego-identity. Thus, analysis on gender effect is not included.</p>
<p>The following statistical procedures were conducted to respond to the research purpose:</p>
<list id="list1-0022022112466941" list-type="order"><list-item><p>In order to interpret mean differences between cross-cultural and across age groups it is crucial to make sure that the instruments are understood/conceptualized in similar ways by participants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0022022112466941">Kline, 2005</xref>). Thus, as a preliminary analysis to determine whether latent variables of wisdom dimensions and ego-identity statuses were measured in similar ways across cultures and across age groups, three types of measurement invariance (configural, metric, and scalar) were tested using Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) with maximum likelihood estimation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0022022112466941">Kline, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0022022112466941">Nye, Roberts, Saucier, &amp; Zhou, 2008</xref>) using AMOS 20 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0022022112466941">Arbuckle, 2011</xref>).</p></list-item>

<p>There are no missing data and no univariate or multivariate within-cell outliers. The results of the evaluation of assumptions of normality, homogeneity of variance-covariance matrices, linearity, and multicollinearity were satisfactory.</p>
<sec id="section12-0022022112466941">
<title>Preliminary Analysis: Measurement Invariance</title>
<p>All wisdom dimensions (cognitive, reflective, and affective) and ego-identity statuses have multilevel factor structures, and indicators are more than four items in each latent variable (e.g., 14 indicators/items in cognitive dimension of wisdom). Considering that the optimal number of indicators for a latent variable is three in Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA), all variables in the study are overidentified. Thus, in order to reduce model complexity, the item-to-construct balance parceling method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0022022112466941">Little, Cunningham, Shahar, &amp; Widaman, 2002</xref>) was used for cognitive and reflective dimensions of wisdom and moratorium identity-status. Twelve items of reflective dimension of wisdom were divided into three constructs (perspective-taking, problem-solving and ideas of reference, and resentment) based on the theoretical framework of the measurement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0022022112466941">Ardelt, 2003</xref>). Note that problem-solving and ideas of reference were merged due to the underidentified item numbers (two in each), however they are in different constructs.</p>
<p>First, configural invariance models were tested as baseline models (unconstrained models), and factor loadings were constrained to be equal across samples to test metric invariance. Then, both intercepts and factor loadings were constrained to be equal across samples to test scalar invariance. If the changes in <italic>χ<sup>2</sup></italic>/<italic>df</italic> are significant between the unconstrained and constrained model (that is, between configural and metric, and between metric and scalar), this suggests noninvariance across samples. Due to the fact that <italic>Δχ<sup>2</sup></italic> is sensitive to sample size, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01 is adapted to determine significant <italic>χ<sup>2</sup></italic>/<italic>df</italic> difference between models since the sample size is big in the study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0022022112466941">Kline, 2005</xref>). The overall fit of CFA models was determined based on parameters such as the chi-square goodness-of-fit statistic, Root Mean Square Error of Approximation (RMSEA), and Comparative Fit Index (CFI). A combination of CFI ≈ .95 and RMSEA ≈ .06 is considered to be a good model fit, although CFI ≈ .90 and RMSEA ≈ .08 may be considered acceptable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0022022112466941">Kline, 2005</xref>).</p>

<title>Configural invariance across cultures</title>
<p>In this model, the same factorial structures are specified for each Korean (<italic>n</italic> = 267) and American (<italic>n</italic> = 362) samples, and the intercepts and factor loadings were freely measured. All factor means are fixed to zero in both samples. The results show that configural invariance were established in all latent variables across groups (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0022022112466941">Table 1</xref>), which shows that the general factor structure is similar across culture groups (.933 ≤ CFI ≤ 1.000; .000 ≤ RMSEA ≤ .048).</p>

Thus, partial scalar invariance tests were conducted, as invariance limitations may possibly limit some indicators, but not all, across samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0022022112466941">Cheung &amp; Rensvold, 2002</xref>). After searching for noninvariant indicators in the Modification Indices (MI), tolerance of ambiguity parcel in cognitive wisdom, Items 4 and 5 in perspective taking, and acceptance parcel in affective wisdom seem to hold such difference. Once constraints were removed from these indicators, partial scalar invariances were accepted in cognitive and affective wisdom and perspective taking in reflective wisdom (<italic>p</italic> &gt; .01). Scalar invariances in problem solving and ideas of reference and the resentment construct in reflective wisdom were not accepted; thus, there must be some culture differences in some reflective wisdom indicators.</p>
<p>The scalar invariance models do not show good fit in all ego-identity statuses, and their <italic>Δχ<sup>2</sup></italic>/<italic>df</italic> were significant from metric invariance models (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0022022112466941">Table 1</xref>). After searching noninvariant items, achievement, foreclosure, and diffusion obtained partial scalar invariance. The failure of testing for a good fit in the metric and scalar invariance models among moratorium indicators shows an apparent culture bias in the factor loading and intercept levels. Thus, culture comparison using moratorium indicators seems impossible. Because the partial scalar invariance models were accepted in achievement, foreclosure, and diffusion, we can carefully interpret the results related to these statuses.</p>

<title>Configural, metric, and scalar invariance across age groups</title>
<p>Adolescents ranging in age from 18 to 22 years old were divided into two groups [younger group: 18 to 19 (<italic>n</italic> = 322; mean age = 18.56) and older group: 20 to 22 (<italic>n</italic> = 317; mean age = 20.98)], and the equivalence of wisdom and ego-identity measurements were tested across the age groups. The results show that all configural invariance was met (.968 ≤ CFI ≤ 1.000; .000 ≤ RMSEA ≤ .055). Metric and scalar invariance show good fit except with respect to the diffusion status of ego-identity (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0022022112466941">Table 2</xref>). When examining model differences between metric and scalar invariance, the results show measurement equivalence across the age groups, with the exception of problem solving and ideas of reference construct and the resentment construct in the reflective dimension of wisdom (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0022022112466941">Table 2</xref>). Thus, when interpreting age differences in reflective wisdom (except the perspective-taking construct), one should be cautious. Similarly, when interpreting indicators of diffusion status, participants in each group interpret differently in significant ways. Thus, we should limit the interpretation of the results relating to diffusion when comparing across age groups (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0022022112466941">Table 2</xref>).</p>

<p>The interaction effect of Age × Culture on ego-identity was statistically significant, whereas the interaction effect on wisdom was not (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0022022112466941">Table 3</xref>).

However, because metric invariance in diffusion was not supported, interpreting an age and culture interaction effect is not meaningful.</p>

<title>Discussion and Conclusion</title>
<p>This study investigated the relationship between ego-identity statuses and wisdom dimensions among Korean and American adolescents and how culture and age relate to their identity and wisdom development. The summary of the findings is as follows:</p>
<list id="list2-0022022112466941" list-type="order"><list-item><p>Based on the investigation in measurement invariance, both cross-cultural and cross-age comparison can be cautiously made.

<list-item><p>Reflective wisdom increases and foreclosure status decreases with age.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Cultural effects are significant for both wisdom and identity development. American adolescents in this study showed a more advanced ego-identity development than their Korean counterparts. Korean adolescents in turn are more likely to be in the moratorium status than their American counterparts. American adolescents scored significantly higher on the reflective dimension of wisdom.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Identity achievement predicts wisdom among Korean adolescents, while it is not associated with wisdom among American adolescents. Both foreclosure and diffusion statuses are not associated with all dimensions of wisdom for the Korean and American adolescents.</p></list-item></list>
<sec id="section30-0022022112466941">
<title>Measurement Invariance</title>
<p>Configural, metric, and scalar invariance models show a good fit in most wisdom and ego-identity latent variables, although there are some differences in intercepts. In particular, some indicators in the reflective dimensions of wisdom (problem solving and ideas of reference construct and resentful construct) show measurement nonequivalence across cultures and across age groups, which may result from cultural differences or different individual experiences. Ego-identity indicators also seem to have some culture bias. For instance, the intercept-level nonequivalence in achievement and diffusion and the factor-loading-level nonequivalence in foreclosure seem to show possible measurement bias.</p>
<p>Many studies have shown that when comparing a personality measure across cultures, the invariance restriction does not hold for some items, and thus nonequivalence is prevalent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0022022112466941">Klimstra, Crocetti, Hale, Fermani, &amp; Meeus, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0022022112466941">Nye et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-0022022112466941">Zhang, Fokkema, Cuijpers, Li, Smits, &amp; Beekman, 2011</xref>). Thus, although measurement invariance is not fully supported in wisdom variables and the interpretation of results must be made with some caution, comparing wisdom and ego-identity across these two cultures can still be meaningful for the following reasons: (a) the inevitable measurement discrepancy due to cultural difference when interpreting some items (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0022022112466941">Nye et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-0022022112466941">Zhang et al., 2011</xref>), (b) the small proportion of noninvariant items in the wisdom scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0022022112466941">Cheung &amp; Rensvold, 2002</xref>), and (c) a good fit indices support in configural and metric invariance in most variables (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0022022112466941">Klimstra et al., 2011</xref>).</p>

<title>Ego-identity among Korean and American adolescents</title>
<p>The American late adolescents (age 18 to 22) in this study were more likely to have achieved an ego-identity than their Korean counterparts (age 18 to 22). While Korean students achieved ego-identity status in some areas, they were more likely than their American counterparts to still be in a process of seeking their identity in other areas. Although Korean adolescents in this study were less likely to be in diffusion status, they scored higher on diffusion than their American counterparts, whereas American adolescents scored higher on foreclosure status than their Korean counterparts. This may be due to the different cultural practices regarding positive and negative social interactions with family and other members of society, which is the main source of ego strength and weakness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0022022112466941">Erikson, 1968</xref>).</p>
<p>These results support that Korean adolescent identity development is much slower compared to that of Western adolescents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0022022112466941">H. Kim, 1989</xref>). Several Korean studies (and the present study) suggest that Korean adolescents may have a “prolonged” ego-identity development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0022022112466941">H. Kim, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0022022112466941">J. Lee, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0022022112466941">S. Song, 1993</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0022022112466941">S. Song (1993)</xref> explains this “prolonged ego-identity development” phenomenon among South Korean adolescents in terms of parenting styles. She explains that if Korean parents encourage and accept their children’s autonomy and encourage their independence, as Western parents do, adolescents more successfully achieve identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0022022112466941">S. Song, 1993</xref>). Another study speculates that because Korean adolescents do not have appropriate opportunities for interacting with peers during the middle and high school years due to their excessive educational pursuits, they may not have real-life opportunities to explore and resolve identity crises and/or achieve ego-identities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0022022112466941">I. Kim &amp; Jang, 1992</xref>).</p>
<p>At any rate, these findings seem to contradict the assumption that Korean adolescents may score higher on foreclosure because Korean adolescents have been raised with authoritative parents, and respecting elders and listening to their parents are much valued (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0022022112466941">Kim, Cain, &amp; McCubbin, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0022022112466941">Shrake, 1998</xref>). Strengthening this case will necessitate further study. Nevertheless, a couple of Western studies provide a possible explanation. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0022022112466941">Lucas (1997)</xref>, for instance, showed that American male adolescents who were emotionally reliant on their parents were more likely to be in diffusion status, while another study showed that parents’ psychological control negatively linked with the levels of ego-identity commitment among Belgium college students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0022022112466941">Luyckx, Soenens, Vansteenkiste, Goossens, &amp; Berzonsky, 2007</xref>). Likewise, here Korean adolescents may feel much greater discrepancies in balancing their desires with their parents’ desires (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0022022112466941">E. Kim et al., 2006</xref>), which in return might lengthen the time needed to find their identity or may cause them confusion.</p>
<p>While Korean adolescents spend most of their time in school preparing for exams, average American adolescents are exposed to social and occupational experiences. American adolescents spend more time with peers and more likely work as well as drive compared to Korean adolescents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0022022112466941">J. C. Lee &amp; Staff, 2007</xref>). For example, approximately 80% of North American adolescents have at least one job during high school (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0022022112466941">J. C. Lee &amp; Staff, 2007</xref>). Regardless of some various negative effects, American adolescents have been reported to have obtained a sense of responsibility, social and occupational skills (including job maintaining skills), money and time management skills, and a sense of accomplishment and pride (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0022022112466941">Aronson, Mortimer, Zierman, &amp; Hacker; 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0022022112466941">Mortimer, 2004</xref>). These types of experiences might broaden American adolescents’ perspectives toward life and help them find who they are and what they want to do in the future.</p>
<p>Interestingly, American late adolescents scored higher on foreclosure status than their Korean counterparts, even though they are less likely in moratorium, foreclosure, and diffusion. Although further research is needed to ascertain the deeper reasons behind this higher foreclosure score among American populations, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0022022112466941">Mullis, Graf, and Mullis (2009)</xref> might give us an insight. In their study of American adolescents, they found that when adolescents perceive that their mother does not show caring behaviors they are more likely to show higher foreclosure scores. Likewise, when fathers show caring, adolescents are more likely to be submissive. The adolescents conform more when they feel they do not get enough caring from their mother and they conform when they perceive their father’s care. It seems like they are seeking love from their parents by conforming. However, their parents’ overprotection is not associated with a foreclosure score. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0022022112466941">Mullis et al. (2009)</xref> carefully concluded that the above phenomenon might be because the dominant participants were from single mother homes. An increasing number of single parents in the United States and the challenges they might get through may influence American adolescents’ insecure attachment to their parents, which may result in increasing foreclosure scores in order for children to obtain emotional supports from their parents. Although this finding might not be too generalizable and in need of further investigation, as mentioned earlier, Korean parents’ overprotection and controlling behaviors and (the/an) increasing number of single parents in the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0022022112466941">Mather, 2010</xref>) may result in this difference in the study (i.e., higher score in moratorium and diffusion among Korean students and higher score in foreclosure among American counterparts).</p>

<title>Wisdom development among Korean and American adolescents</title>
<p>Results indicated that adolescents in this study score high in the cognitive dimensions of wisdom. Although <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0022022112466941">Ardelt (2005)</xref> argues that respondents who score greater than a 4-point average on the 1-5 Likert-type scale are considered to have a high level of wisdom, the average scores of the participants of this study show relatively high mean scores (between 3.47 and 3.55), which are higher than mean scores of adults’ cognitive dimension (<italic>M</italic> = 3.44, <italic>SD</italic> = .56) in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0022022112466941">Ardelt’s (2009)</xref> study. This can be interpreted that late adolescents have reached the adults’ level of cognitive wisdom and that they comprehend the meaning of life events and have achieved qualities such as intelligence, morality, multiple viewpoints, and moral reasoning, which are expected to increase during adolescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0022022112466941">Piaget &amp; Inhelder, 1973</xref>). This result supports <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0022022112466941">Pasupathi et al.’s (2001)</xref> findings that adolescents have the potential for wisdom-related knowledge and that adolescence is a crucial period for wisdom development.</p>
<p>The results of this study also found that American adolescents scored significantly higher on the reflective dimension of wisdom, whereas there was no mean difference in the cognitive and affective dimensions of wisdom between Korean and American adolescents. This difference in the development of reflective wisdom may explain why Korean adolescents have a lower score on ego-identity achievement and a higher score on moratorium and diffusion, despite the fact that Korean and American adolescents show similar levels of cognitive and affective dimensions of wisdom. More explanations are discussed in the below section concerning the relationship between ego-identity and wisdom development, the positive link between achievement status and wisdom dimensions, and a lack of reflective and affective wisdom among Korean adolescents who are in moratorium and diffusion statuses. The reflective dimension of wisdom is the essential element among the three dimensions, because it supports the other two dimensions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0022022112466941">Ardelt, 2000</xref>). This could mean that American adolescents might have developed more meta-cognitive ability through their experiences. In the discussion of age effects, reflective wisdom shows age contribution. This may indicate that American adolescents may be more mature than Korean adolescents, which was also implied in the above discussion of identity development. This phenomenon could also be studied further using other research methods and analyses. This result should further be cautiously interpreted because of the lack of scalar invariance in some reflective wisdom indicators. In <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0022022112466941">Benedikovicova and Ardelt’s (2008)</xref> cross-cultural comparison study, American students scored significantly higher on the cognitive and reflective dimensions of wisdom, whereas this study shows that American students scored high only on reflective wisdom. Both studies showed that cultural, social, and educational factors might influence wisdom development.</p>
<p>Ironically, although traditionally Western wisdom emphasizes cognitive abilities whereas Eastern wisdom focuses more on reflective and affective wisdom, the results of this study displayed the opposite of the traditional wisdom concepts in both cultures—a fact that may be related to the identity development process. As discussed, it may be that American adolescents have more chances for social interaction, which in turn may help them to start their identity-seeking earlier. While American adolescents develop autonomy and independence early on in life, Korean adolescents may depend heavily on their parents during their school years, including their college years, and hence focus on a one-dimensional life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0022022112466941">I. Kim &amp; Jang, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0022022112466941">H. Lee &amp; Cheon, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0022022112466941">S. Song, 1993</xref>). Korean adolescents spend their days in schools or institutes to prepare for tests or university entrance exams—something that has been called “examination hell” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0022022112466941">M. Lee, 2003</xref>). Thus, Korean adolescents may not have enough chances to develop intrapersonal and interpersonal skills through real-life experiences, whereas American adolescents learn about life, problem-solving skills, responsibility, and independence through various experiences such as work, interaction with peers, dating, and engaging in community service, which are crucial elements of reflective wisdom.</p>

<title>Age Differences</title>
<p>Although this study examined a narrow range of the age variable, it does show age contribution to both wisdom and ego-identity development. The study shows that there is an age contribution to reflective wisdom, whereas there is no age contribution to the cognitive and affective wisdom dimensions. Rather than making a definitive statement that wisdom does not develop with age, the results of this study suggest that there is a need to distinguish specific dimensions of wisdom when explaining age effects. This result shows that late adolescents have developed cognitive abilities such as reasoning and logical thinking skills as well as factual and practical knowledge about how things work in life. This study also reveals that individuals in the younger age group (18 to 19) did not show a significantly different level of affective wisdom (e.g., exhibiting positive emotions) than individuals in the older age group (20 to 22). Thus, this study shows that the cognitive and affective dimensions of wisdom of younger individuals are not different from those of older individuals. This suggests that the reflective dimension of wisdom can be a sign of maturity among individuals in this age group, although we should interpret this implication with caution due to the approval of partial scalar invariance.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section35-0022022112466941">
<title>The Relationship Between Identity and Wisdom</title>
<p>One of the most intriguing findings of this study is that even though the average American adolescent showed an advanced ego-identity achievement, this was not associated with wisdom. This illustrates that the absence of moratorium, foreclosure, and diffusion informs wisdom better and more accurately than does the possession of ego-identity achievement status among American late adolescents. For Korean late adolescents, on the other hand, ego-identity achievement is an element in anticipating wisdom. Because this is a pioneering study in investigating the relationship between wisdom and ego-identity, it raises many questions. Cultural and individual characteristics of the participants, for example, must have made the differences presented above. Thus, investigating the characteristics and factors that influence identity-achieved individuals who show or do not show wisdom may indicate better understanding of identity and wisdom development among American and Korean late adolescents.</p>
<p>The negative correlations (from the second function of canonical correlations) between moratorium status and the two wisdom dimensions (reflective and affective) and between diffusion status and reflective and affective wisdom among Koreans uncovered that a possible reason that Korean adolescents in moratorium and diffusion statuses struggle in the search of ego-identity is due to the lack of reflective and affective abilities. Reflective wisdom includes the capability of looking at events from different perspectives by overcoming self-centeredness and subjectivity, whereas affective wisdom includes positive emotions like compassion, empathy, acceptance of the self and others, and openness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0022022112466941">Ardelt, 2003</xref>). As stated earlier, Korean studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0022022112466941">H. Lee &amp; Cheon, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0022022112466941">M. Lee, 2003</xref>) show that Korean students’ ego-identity is delayed during middle school and high school because they are suffering from <italic>examination hell</italic> and a competitive school atmosphere. Only once they enter universities do students start to search for their identity. This phenomenon limits Korean students’ life experiences, which impacts the development of reflective and affective wisdom.</p>
<p>On the contrary, both Korean and American adolescents in foreclosure status exhibited a negative relationship with cognitive wisdom (first function of canonical correlations). Adolescents in foreclosure might be inhibited from developing cognitive abilities when trying to make sense of the real world and human life in general. As students in foreclosure depend heavily on their parents’ desires, wishes, goals, and decisions, they may not develop sufficient autonomy and critical thinking skills as independent thinkers, which requires cognitive wisdom (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0022022112466941">Ardelt, 2003</xref>). Some Korean studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0022022112466941">Heo, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0022022112466941">J. Lee, 2007</xref>) show that positive and democratic (open) parent-adolescent (especially father-adolescent) communication is strongly related to the development of ego-identity, which indicates that individuals in foreclosure may struggle when forming identity due to their parents’ authoritarian and demanding childrearing style.</p>
<p>Foreclosure and diffusion statuses consistently showed negative relationships with all dimensions of wisdom among adolescents in both countries. Results revealed that the absence of foreclosure and diffusion is a better way of understanding the existence of wisdom among adolescents. Thus, it may be that encouraging identity achievement and intervening foreclosure and diffusion may encourage wisdom development and vice versa. Because this study did not investigate the causal effects, it is difficult to say whether the development of wisdom influences identity formation or identity formation influences wisdom development. However, wisdom development may help identity achievement, while at the same time also help to decrease the tendency toward foreclosure and diffusion. In other words, adolescents with wisdom may be able to get through identity crises more “wisely” and resolve identity crises and achieve identity more successfully. Conversely, adolescents with less wisdom may have a more difficult time (moratorium), simply give up on the search for an identity or accept the identity that their parents had formed for them (foreclosure), or even give up and form a destructive identity (diffusion). The literature consistently argues that there is an intricate relationship between ego-identity and well-being (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0022022112466941">Meeus, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0022022112466941">Meeus et al., 1999</xref>), academic success (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0022022112466941">Good &amp; Adams, 2008</xref>), career maturity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0022022112466941">Jang, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0022022112466941">Jeong, 2005</xref>), positive emotional development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0022022112466941">Hogan, 1973</xref>), and social development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0022022112466941">Blustein &amp; Philips, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0022022112466941">S. Kim, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0022022112466941">Kroger, 2004</xref>). Results of this study also contribute to the literature by providing insights into the negative relationship between wisdom and foreclosure, and wisdom and diffusion, and the positive relationship between ego-identity achievement and wisdom (at least for the Korean data).</p>

<sec id="section36-0022022112466941">
<title>Limitations</title>
<p>The major limitation in the study is related to the nonrandomized and convenient sampling method. The Korean college students’ data were collected in a city in South Korea, whereas the American data were taken from a land-grant state university in a medium-sized college town in the Midwest of the United States. Although the participants’ living environments in cities and college towns may have influenced their value systems, which could affect the results of the study, it is uncertain how greatly this differentiates their ways of thought. The subjects of this study are considered to be representative of two cultures because most South Korean universities are located in city areas, whereas most American universities are located in college towns. However, one should consider the sampling method when interpreting the results of the study. Another sampling issue is that because the samples of the study are university students, they might not be representative when studying other populations with diverse backgrounds, which would require further investigation.</p>
<p>The two measurements used may introduce some measurement biases across cultures and across age groups, as many of the items reflect inclusively American values and experiences. Korean adolescents, for example, may have fewer opportunities to think about political, religious, or ideological issues because of their limited experiences in real life. This in turn may affect the way they view indicators in the <italic>RE-EOM-EIS</italic>. Also, although 3D-WS constitutes a combined measure of Western and Eastern wisdom concepts and points toward a universalism, participants might report on the basis of their cultural exposure (e.g., individualism vs. collectivism). However, because of a good model fit in most configural, metric, and scalar models as well as factor-loading-level measurement invariance and partial acceptance of scalar invariance, it is still worthwhile to report this study.</p>
<p>Finally, social desirability can also affect the results, because this study used a self-reported assessment. However, to be able to measure wisdom and identity status, self-assessment is indispensable. In order to generalize the findings of the study to the general population, studies should tap into a more diverse population structure and use random sampling procedures.</p>

<title>Practical Implications</title>
<p>Several important findings about wisdom development and its dimensions arose in the study. Results, for example, showed that adolescents in both cultures score reasonably high on the cognitive dimension, yet Korean adolescents score lower on the reflective dimension. The study also revealed the age contributions of the reflective dimension of wisdom. This could mean that the reflective dimension of wisdom is a factor of maturity, which helps to distinguish the uniqueness of wisdom in each individual in this age group. Current curriculum trends at the primary through secondary levels in both countries are oriented toward boosting the cognitive abilities of students. As discussed earlier, the current Korean educational system forces students into examination hell and marginalizes them from the real world. Not only that, this notion of examination hell is the result of a social structure that encourages society members to pursue material success rather than encouraging the development of a humanistic self. Adolescents who learn in this kind of environment are concerned mostly with themselves, their own abilities, and the pursuit of success, rather than with developing concern toward others while reflecting upon their own status and behaviors. The No Child Left Behind policy in American schools may also force teachers to emphasize cognitive abilities and achievement scores over the satisfaction of humanitarian, emotional, and psychological needs of students and hence neglect a holistic educational approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0022022112466941">Dewey, 1916</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0022022112466941">H. Lee &amp; Cheon, 2003</xref>). The time is ripe for the development of more reflective classroom activities that broaden adolescents’ horizons.</p>

<title>Implications for Research</title>
<p>A number of studies can be developed from the research presented here. Perhaps the most interesting and important fact discovered in this study is that even though American adolescents revealed advanced identity achievement and scored higher on the reflective dimensions of wisdom—considered to be crucial components of wisdom—observing the identity achievement of American adolescents is not a helpful way of understanding their wisdom. Thus, it would be intriguing to investigate why identity achievement is a key component for wisdom development for Korean adolescents, while not for their American counterparts. What characteristics of American adolescents’ ego-identity make for these differences, and how does this relate to wisdom development? It seems that the qualities of ego-identity and wisdom development among adolescents in both countries differ. Thus, further research needs to be done to investigate the unique cultural impacts on identity achievement and wisdom development.</p>
<p>Additionally, this study looks at late adolescent groups and examines the age difference within this small age range. Thus, expanding the age group and comparing adolescents and adults may provide better insight into true age differences. In addition, in the preliminary analysis, gender effect was not observed across cultures and across age groups in both wisdom and ego-identity. Investigating a larger population in a different sample may produce a different result. Thus, adding gender effect might constitute a future task. Last but not least, the ultimate goal of this project is how our understanding of the relationship between wisdom and ego-identity can give us insight toward helping adolescents live more meaningful and self-sufficient lives and achieve greater resilience and well-being. Both quantitative and qualitative approaches may be fruitful in addressing the questions raised in this study.</p>
