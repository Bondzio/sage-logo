<abstract>
<p>The aim of the study was to determine if early steroid treatment of infantile spasms is associated with ocular complications years after its termination. Twenty-five patients with infantile spasms who underwent prolonged treatment with intramuscular synthetic adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and oral prednisone were evaluated for ocular complications 2 to 33 years after treatment cessation. Patients were followed by an ophthalmic examination that included anterior and posterior segments and measurement of intraocular pressure. Intraocular pressure was normal bilaterally in all patients. Findings on anterior segment examination were unremarkable. On posterior segment examination, 3 patients had an increased cup/disc ratio with normal intraocular pressure. In 2 patients, the increased ratio was considered an anatomical variant. Posterior segment findings in 2 patients were attributed to their background disease. In conclusion, early treatment with high-dose synthetic adrenocorticotropic hormone and oral prednisone for infantile spasm is apparently not associated with a risk of occular complications on long-term follow-up.</p>

<p>Infantile spasms are a seizure syndrome affecting 1 in 4000 to 6000 infants per year. Age of onset usually ranges from 4 to 8 months; however, seizure onset in younger and older patients has been reported as well. The syndrome is frequently associated with developmental arrest and even regression. The spasms are resistant to most standard antiepileptic drugs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0883073811420494">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0883073811420494">2</xref></sup> Adrenocorticotropic hormone, high-dose prednisone, and vigabatrin are reasonable treatment options.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0883073811420494">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0883073811420494">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0883073811420494"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0883073811420494">5</xref></sup>

The administration of corticosteroids for the treatment of infantile spasms has also been associated with early ocular complications.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0883073811420494">8</xref></sup> In a study of 9 babies with infantile spasm exposed to systemic corticosteroids, Friling et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0883073811420494">8</xref></sup> found that 5 (55%) had an increase in intraocular pressure and optic disc cupping during treatment. Tripathi et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0883073811420494">10</xref></sup> examined 58 pediatric patients treated with systemic prednisone for inflammatory bowel disease. Posterior subcapsular cataracts were detected in 12 patients (20.7%) and increased intraocular pressure in 21 (36.2%). However, the possible risk of very-long-term ocular complications after corticosteroid treatment termination has not been investigated.</p>
<p>The aim of the present study was to determine if early corticosteroid treatment of infantile spasms is associated with ocular complications long after treatment termination.</p>
<sec id="section1-0883073811420494">
<title>Materials and Methods</title>
<p>A noncomparative longitudinal study design was used. The files of all children diagnosed and treated for infantile spasm at Schneider Children’s Medical Center of Israel from 1974 to 2006 were reviewed. The diagnosis was based on a descriptive clinical history of massive spasms, in some cases with direct observation by the staff or documentation on videotape, and the presence of hypsarrhythmic activity on the sleep encephalogram. Treatment with synthetic adrenocorticotropic hormone and oral prednisone was administered according to the 2-stage protocol of Kivity et al,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0883073811420494">2</xref></sup> as follows.</p>
<p>(1) Stage I—depot tetracosactrin, a long-acting synthetic adrenocorticotropic hormone, given by intramuscular injection for 10 to 12 weeks: 1 mg on alternate days (3/week) for the first 2 weeks; 1 mg twice a week for the next 2 weeks; 1 mg/week for the next 4 to 5 weeks; and 0.5 mg/week for 2–3 weeks.</p>
<p>(2) Stage II—prednisone by mouth for at least 6 months: 10 mg daily for the first month; 10 mg on alternate days for the next 2 months; 5 mg on alternate days for the next 2 months; 2.5 mg on alternate days for 1 month.</p>
<p>Stage I was followed immediately by stage II. All patients completed both stages.</p>
<p>Patients in whom an increase in intraocular pressure was noted during treatment were given dorzolamide 2% with timolol malate 0.5%, or latanoprost 0.005%, or a combination of both drugs depending on the baseline value. All patients were followed until systemic corticosteroid treatment was stopped and intraocular pressure normalized. The follow-up examination included best corrected visual acuity, measurement of intraocular pressure with the Tono-Pen XL (Solan, Jacksonville, FL), anterior segment examination by slit-lamp biomicroscopy, and funduscopy by indirect ophthalmoscopy (with +20-diopter lens magnification). Cycloplegic retinoscopy was performed with cyclopentolate 1.0% and phenylephrine 2.5%, administered twice, 10 minutes apart.</p>
<p>Only patients who had stopped corticosteroid treatment at least 2 years before the present study were included in the analysis. The duration of systemic steroid usage as well as the time of withdrawal were derived from the patients’ medical files.</p>
<p>For purposes of the study, the patients were categorized into 2 groups: group A consisted of patients aged 10 years or younger at the time of analysis, who were followed regularly during treatment for ophthalmologic complications; group B consisted of patients aged 10 years or more at the time of analysis, some of whom had not been followed regularly by an ophthalmologist during treatment, according to the hospital’s policy at that time. All children of both groups were too young at the time of diagnosis of infantile spasms to undergo computerized visual field examination.</p>
<p>From July 2006 to January 2008, 2 to 31 years after termination of steroid treatment, the patients or their parents were invited to our ophthalmology clinic to complete a standard questionnaire covering age, educational status, occupation (if any), function at work or daily activities, family history of cataract and glaucoma, prolonged treatment with inhaled or topical steroids, and past medical treatment with steroids for reasons other than infantile spasm. The patients then underwent a thorough examination by a pediatric ophthalmologist, as follows: best corrected visual acuity and refraction, and anterior and posterior segments, using the same protocol as during the initial follow-up with an emphasis on intraocular pressure, and cup/disc ratio. Patients with an abnormal cup/disc ratio of the optic nerve head (≥0.5) underwent computerized visual field examination, if possible. The reliability was good, as we repeated these examination twice for each patient. At the time of the study, we did not have permission from the health maintenance organization to perform an optical coherence tomography examination.</p>
<p>Written informed consent was obtained before the study from all patients 18 years or older with normal development or the parents of children younger than 18 years old or dependent patients. The study was approved by the local Helsinki Ethics Committee, the head of the hospital, and the Israel Ministry of Health.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>Of the 39 candidates for the study, 25 (64%) were available to participate. The study group consisted of 13 male and 12 female patients aged 4 to 33 years (mean, 14.7 ± 9.06 years). Group A (14 patients, ≤10 years old) ranged in age from 4 to 8 years (mean, 6.03 ± 1.46 years), and group B (11 patients, ≥10 years), from 14.2 to 33 years (mean, 21.47 ± 6.07 years). Eighteen patients (72%) had cryptogenic spasms and 7 (28%) had symptomatic infantile spasms. Eight patients (32%) had mild to severe developmental delay. Twelve patients (48%) had a family history of cataract (grandmother/grandfather in 11, sister in 1), and 4 (16%) had a family history of glaucoma. Ten patients (40%) had mild to moderate myopia, 2 (8%) had hypermetropia, and 13 (52%) were emmetropic.</p>
<p>The mean time from cessation of systemic corticosteroid treatment for infantile spasm to the present study was 13.3 ± 9.09 years. Patients in group A had stopped treatment 2 to 6.5 years previously (mean, 4.6 ± 1.6 years), and patients in group B, from 13 to 31 years previously (mean, 20.2 ± 5.9 years).</p>
<p>According to the medical history, intraocular pressure increased during treatment in 6 patients in group A (54%), including 1 with a positive family history of glaucoma. All 6 were regularly followed at the Pediatric Ophthalmology Unit throughout treatment, and intraocular pressure was controlled with antiglaucoma medication; none of them underwent antiglaucoma surgery. In none of the patients in group B did intraocular pressure increase during corticosteroid treatment.</p>
<p>At the time of the present analysis, none of the patients of either group was receiving antiglaucoma medication, and intraocular pressure measurements were within normal range (10–18 mm Hg) in all patients. In group A, mean intraocular pressure was 14.3 ± 1.7 mm Hg in the left eye and 15.0 ± 1.9 mmHg in the right eye; corresponding values in group B were 14.2 ± 1.5 mm Hg and 14.1 ± 1.8 mm Hg. There was no statistically significant difference in intraocular pressure bilaterally between the 2 groups (left eye <italic>P</italic> = .86; right eye <italic>P</italic> = .26). Furthermore, within group A, there was no statistically significant difference in late intraocular pressure between the patients who had had an increased intraocular pressure during past systemic steroid treatment (right eye, 14 ± 1.68 mm Hg; left eye, 14 ± 1.55 mm Hg) and those who had not (right eye, 14.2 ± 2.4 mmHg; left eye, 13.2 ± 2.04 mm Hg; <italic>P</italic> = .91 for both eyes).</p>
<p>Findings on anterior segment examination were unremarkable in all patients. On posterior segment examination, the optic head cup/disc ratio was within normal range bilaterally in 22 patients (88%; mean left and right cup/disc ratio 0.4 ± 0.154), including all patients of group A, and it had remained stable since termination of treatment. Among the remaining patients, all from group B, the cup/disc ratio was higher than the pretreatment value (range, 0.6–0.8) in 3 (21% of group B); post-pole retinopathy was also found in 1 patient.</p>
<p>One of the 3 patients with a higher cup-disc ratio was a 15-year-old boy with developmental delay in whom a cup/disc ratio of 0.6 bilaterally with normal intraocular pressure (16 mm Hg) had been documented 4 years previously. Visual field examination at the time revealed a relative cecocentral scotoma in both eyes; ischemic frontal brain damage was observed on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Genetic analysis yielded a homozygous methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase mutation. At the time of the present study, the patient was able to cooperate in the computerized visual field examination. The cup/disc ratio was still 0.6 bilaterally, and intraocular pressure was within normal range (14 mm Hg). We assumed the increased cup/disc ratio was probably a consequence of the neurological abnormalities.</p>
<p>The second patient was a 33-year-old woman with normal development and intraocular pressure and a cup/disc ratio of 0.8. A cup/disc ratio of 0.8 had also been documented on 2 earlier ophthalmic examinations, 6 months apart, with no abnormalities on visual field examination.</p>
<p>The third patient, a 23-year-old woman with development delay, was unable to cooperate during the visual field examination, but her intraocular pressure was within normal limits (11 mm Hg in both eyes). No visual problems during activities of daily living were reported by her parents. Based on these findings, we attributed the increased cup/disc ratio to a normal anatomical variant of the optic nerve head.</p>
<p>The patient with post-pole retinopathy had old bilateral posterior pole depigmentation scars, typical for toxoplasmosis, which had probably caused the early epileptic disease.</p>
<p>Comparison of groups A and B for parameters other than intraocular pressure yielded no statistically significant differences in sex distribution, family history of cataract or glaucoma, cup/disc ratio, or presence of cataract on long-term follow-up.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Major side effects of high-dose corticosteroid treatment include increased intraocular pressure, cataracts, herpetic infection, and cup/disc changes. In our study, 24% of the patients acquired an unbalanced intraocular pressure during corticosteroid treatment, which was controlled by antiglaucoma medications. On late follow-up 2 to 33 years later, only 12% showed changes in the cup-disc ratio, and these were attributed to a neurological pathology or considered a normal variant, with no association to the corticosteroid treatment.</p>
<p>Corticosteroids are thought to induce secondary open-angle glaucoma by inhibiting phagocytosis at the level of the trabecular meshwork cells, which remove debris from the aqueous outflow system,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0883073811420494">16</xref></sup> leading to an increase in intraocular pressure. This process may have a particularly adverse effect on the immature drainage system of children. At present, there are no known predictors of which patients will respond pathologically to corticosteroid treatment and which will not.</p>
<p>Once steroid treatment is stopped, the intraocular pressure eventually normalizes. In a study of adult patients with steroid-induced glaucoma, Shihota et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0883073811420494">17</xref></sup> found that most did not need antiglaucoma medication at the 18-month follow-up after corticosteroid cessation. In preterm infants as well, high-dose dexamethasone administered for 3 weeks was associated with an increased intraocular pressure that disappeared 5 to 9 weeks after treatment cessation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0883073811420494">18</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>Friling et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0883073811420494">8</xref></sup> studied 9 infants treated specifically for infantile spasms according to the same protocol used here.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0883073811420494">2</xref></sup> Routine follow-up was conducted every 2 weeks until therapy was completed and its late effects resolved (mean duration, 13 ± 13.1 months). The authors reported an increase in intraocular pressure and cup/disc ratio during treatment, with no changes in refraction afterward. Five patients (55.5%) required antiglaucoma medication, and 1 patient underwent augmented trabeculotomy. The steroid-induced glaucoma remitted after treatment was withdrawn, with normalization of the cup/disc ratio and intraocular pressure. In our study, only 6 patients (54.5%) from group A (≤10 years old at analysis) had had an increase in intraocular pressure during their past treatment with synthetic adrenocorticotropic hormone and oral prednisone, which was controlled in all of them by antiglaucoma medication and disappeared after cessation of the corticosteroid therapy, without optic disc sequelae.</p>
<p>Cataract is another frequent ocular complication of prolonged systemic and topical corticosteroid treatment. Some studies suggested that cataract is formed as a consequence of glucocorticoid binding to lens proteins, leading to an alteration in protein structure.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0883073811420494">19</xref></sup> Others proposed that corticosteroids induce changes in the production of growth factors in the vitreous, altering their impact on lens epithelial cell differentiation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0883073811420494">20</xref></sup> It is also possible that glucocorticoids affect protective antioxidative systems in the lens, making the lens more susceptible to oxidative stress and apoptosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0883073811420494">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0883073811420494">21</xref></sup> However, Petersen et al,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0883073811420494">22</xref></sup> in a study of dexamethasone-induced apoptosis in human lens epithelial cells, failed to find evidence of the involvement of oxidative mechanisms, suggesting that the proapoptotic effect of dexamethasone apparently does not act through the glucocorticoid receptor. None of the patients in our study had a side effect of cataract during treatment with synthetic adrenocorticotropic hormone and oral prednisone or thereafter, perhaps owing to the relatively short time of the corticosteroid treatment.</p>
<p>Glucocorticoids may also be capable of inducing changes in gene transcription in lens epithelial cells that are related to many of these processes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0883073811420494">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0883073811420494"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0883073811420494">23</xref></sup> Ocular complications have been reported following different steroid regimens, such as inhaled corticosteroids, dexamethasone, prednisone, and topical steroid treatment. Additionally, because of the variability in the responses of individuals to various steroids, there may be no really “safe” dosage for any of the regimens.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0883073811420494">21</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>The appropriate treatment options for infantile spasms have been intensively investigated but are still problematic at this time. According to the American Academy of Neurology, adrenocorticotropic hormone is probably effective for short-term treatment, and there is insufficient evidence that oral corticosteroids are always effective. Other options, including pyridoxine, sulthiame, valproate, have only limited reported benefits. The antiepileptic drug vigabatrin recently received United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for the treatment of infantile spasms. An epidemiologic study of 335 vigabatrin recipients aged &gt;14 years reported visual field defects attributable to the drug in 31%; by contrast, none of the non–drug-exposed control subjects had visual field defects (upper 95% CI, 3%).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0883073811420494">24</xref></sup> The prevalence of vigabatrin-associated field defects was lower in children than in adults. However, this difference may have been at least partly due to methodological problems and the greater variability of visual field assessments in children. Clinicians should consider these findings together with ours when selecting the treatment of choice for infantile spasms: if the spasms are secondary to tuberous sclerosis, vigabatrin is the drug of choice. When the etiology is unknown and MRI has not yet been done, adrenocorticotropic hormone may sometimes serve as the first option. Clinicians should also consider the nonocular severe side effects of corticosteroid treatment, such as hypertension, sepsis, growth arrest, obesity, and diabetes.</p>
<p>In conclusion, treatment with high-dose synthetic adrenocorticotropic hormone and oral prednisone for infantile spasm is apparently not associated with ocular complications of increased intraocular pressure, cataracts, or changes in cup/disc ratio on long-term follow-up. Patients who do not have these complications early after corticosteroid treatment is completed need not be followed further.</p>
