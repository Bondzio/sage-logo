<p><italic>Shop ’Til You Drop</italic> examines the increasingly problematic role of consumption as a central component of late modern existence. Although the claim of long-term ecological and financial unsustainability is not a difficult one to make with our present consumer-based economy, the film does a reasonable job of doing so while including biological, psychological, and sociological perspectives in the process. Although not particularly original, the film is useful enough to consider for a number of undergraduate sociology courses, including those dealing with social problems, media, environmental, corporate, and general introductory themes.</p>
<p>The main strength of the film is found in its interviews with three scholars: Juliet Schor (sociology), Peter Whybrow (psychology), and James Twitchell (English/advertising). Schor easily takes the show, not just because she is the only sociologist of the bunch but because her expertise in this area is unmatched. The film highlights her research and knowledge in a way that easily translates the thoughtfulness of her work to students. Twitchell focuses mainly on consumer narratives, and Whybrow privileges standard, biopsychological explanations of consumerism. I see these alternative accounts as fodder for classroom discussions contrasting biological, psychological, and sociological explanations of the same phenomenon. It should also be noted that the film includes clips from interviews of Duane Elgin and Cecile Andrews, two of the most respected authors involved in the voluntary simplicity movement.</p>
<p>The weaknesses of the film are threefold. First, the filmmakers overuse sped-up imagery, blurred effects, and quick cuts, in concert with dramatic pieces of music. Unfortunately, this makes the otherwise serious documentary seem cheesy. Second, the latter half of the video devolves into a bit of fear mongering that is neither thoughtful nor compelling, even if it is typical of many second-tier environmental documentaries. Third, the final segment of the film is dedicated to words of hope and potential alternatives, but the viewer is still left with a significant feeling of disempowerment, given the lengthy “doom and gloom” segment that preceded it. Nonetheless, I think that these weaknesses can be easily overcome either by using a carefully chosen handful of clips or by noting the weaknesses for the students beforehand so that they can bracket them while watching the film.</p>
<p>The film begins with a memorable, three-minute opening sequence in which Juliet Schor lists some of the most common material objects found in an average U.S. household. It has a powerful and immediate effect on the viewer. Realization dawns that as unique as a person might feel, the items listed and shown are near perfect representations of what many of us have in our own homes! Great sociology shifts us out of our own, unique biographies into a derivation of something much larger. This segment is followed by a brief but useful explanation of Thorsten Veblen’s theory of the leisure class, along with the concept of conspicuous consumption. The filmmakers use these ideas to shed light on our contemporary problem of consumerism run amok.</p>
<p>Schor notes that our consumer society began to take shape in the 1950s as a social comparison model (aka “keeping up with the Joneses”). By the 1970s and 1980s, as women entered the workforce in larger numbers and were exposed to corporate culture, television began to expose the general public to the lifestyles of the economic elite through primetime soap operas (e.g., <italic>Dallas</italic>) and precursors to reality television (e.g., <italic>Lifestyles of the Rich &amp; Famous</italic>). Soon the Joneses (our neighbors) were replaced by the Ewings (our television fantasy counterparts).</p>
<p>This is followed by a segment on consumption and kids that brings Schor back to talk about her survey research results indicating that both “uninvolved” and “involved” parents are likely to have children with highly consumptive habits. This disrupts the poor parenting myth. John De Graaf of the organization Take Back Your Time does a reasonable job of offering additional evidence for Schor’s claim. Duane Elgin also rightly notes that advertisements are pitches not just for particular products but also for a set of values, or a way of life. James Twitchell discusses how narratives, once attached to objects, form powerfully attractive symbols for the average person to embody through the act of consumption.</p>
<p>In the next segment, Schor argues that contemporary consumption, while being financially and ecologically unsustainable, is ultimately about social communication and social connection (dysfunctional though their manifestation might be). She then connects these high levels of consumption with our need to justify an increasingly anxiety-ridden, fast-paced, work-focused culture. All of this is happening, of course, in a time when economic mobility is decreasing because of stagnating wages, two-income households, and increased levels of personal debt. The film moves into a critique of individualism and competition, while referencing the more common physical maladies that accompany high-stress lifestyles.</p>
<p>Just after the midpoint, the film transitions into questioning the socioeconomic system that has led us to this particular problem. Typical environmental topics, including resource depletion, species extinction, and general ecological degradation, are then addressed, albeit in somewhat shallow terms. By trying to motivate the viewer to action, this latter half of the documentary becomes caught up in apocalyptic scenes of destruction that lack the data required to make a compelling case. The end result is that this second half, although being mildly informative, becomes melodramatic and misses its mark as a motivational force for social change.</p>
<p>As a final note, I must admit that I was significantly impressed to read that this was Gene Brockhoff’s first film of any kind (he normally works as a flooring contractor). He put this documentary together on his Apple computer with the help of Final Cut Pro software. Perhaps sociology departments could offer classes on documentary filmmaking as a way to challenge undergraduate and even graduate students to engage with contemporary social problems in a technologically relevant but sociologically informed way. If a flooring contractor can create something of this quality, certainly we as sociologists can match or better this effort by more seriously addressing our own students’ needs along with the needs of the public in this arena.</p>
