<p>This article proposes that the term διάκονος περιτομη̑ς in Rom. 15.8 refers to Christ as an ‘agent of circumcision’, not a ‘servant to the circumcision’. As such, it is part and parcel of Paul’s view that faith in Christ effects in Gentile believers an intangible, genital circumcision, enabling them to enter the Abrahamic covenant which has circumcision as a requirement.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Paul believes in genital circumcision for Gentile converts to Christ—that is the contention of the present article. I do not mean that Paul advocates the physical removal of foreskins from believers, an absurd proposal in light of Paul’s vigorous objection to this practice expressed so vehemently in his epistle to the Galatians. Rather, I propose that in Paul’s view faith in Christ effects in believers a genital circumcision that is not wrought by human hands, but which nevertheless conveys upon believers the status of one who is genitally circumcised, thus enabling them to enter the Abrahamic covenant that has circumcision as a requirement. Indeed, Paul’s passionate objection to genital circumcision in the flesh is itself rooted in his conviction that believers already have been circumcised on account of their faith. To circumcise them again in order to secure their entry into the covenant would therefore be superfluous, and accordingly, nothing short of mutilation.</p>
<p>The primary text to be examined in developing this proposal will be Rom. 15.7-13, in which Paul calls Christ a διάκονος περιτομη̑ς, a ‘servant of circumcision’. A reevaluation of this phrase undergirds the entire study. Supplementary material will come from expected sources: Rom. 2.25-29, Phil. 3.2-3, Col. 2.11-13 and Eph. 2.11-13. One passage readers might find conspicuously absent is Rom. 4.1-16. The reason for its absence is that the present work is part of a broader study of Paul’s approach to circumcision in Romans, in which Rom. 4.1-16 and Rom. 15.7-13 are two featured passages. Each requires extended attention, however, and to treat both in a single article is not possible. The objective in the present study is to persuade readers with regard to Rom. 15.7-13, as well as the other texts mentioned above, in the hope that readers will then be receptive to the companion study of Rom. 4.1-16.</p>

<title>Background</title>
<p>Most commentators agree on the overall message of Rom. 15.7-13, notwithstanding disputes over the details.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0142064X12442848">1</xref></sup> It is the capstone in Paul’s plea for competing parties at Rome to put aside their differences and unite as one community. They ought to welcome one another just as Christ exemplified a spirit of reconciliation by welcoming both Jews and Gentiles into the glory of God. He welcomed Jews, i.e., ‘the circumcision’, by becoming their ‘servant’ in order to fulfill the patriarchal promises, and he welcomed Gentiles inasmuch as his acts of service to the Jews, followed by his death and resurrection, led to the incorporation of Gentiles into God’s people, which has enabled them to glorify God on account of mercy. For this reason, Jews and Gentiles are now rejoicing side by side.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0142064X12442848">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>This approach finds root in the nearly universal assumption that διάκονος περιτομη̑ς in v. 8a refers to Christ as a ‘servant of circumcision’, that is, a servant to <italic>the</italic> circumcision, the Jews. As a few commentators have observed, this interpretation is not without difficulties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0142064X12442848">Williams 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0142064X12442848">Gaston 1987</xref>: 133). In the first place, it is not clear how Christ’s ministry among the Jews fulfilled the promises to the patriarchs, which have to do with land and progeny rather than the bestowal of a future messianic servant. So, too, it is hard to see what Christ’s ministry among the Jews has to do with Gentiles glorifying God. Everywhere else Paul suggests that Christ’s death and resurrection are what make possible the Gentiles’ reconciliation with God. Were he linking it here to Christ’s service among the Jews, Paul would be leaving what Sam K. Williams (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0142064X12442848">1980</xref>: 285) has called ‘a very large gap’ in logic. Moreover, Paul’s allusion to Christ’s earthly ministry is curious in itself, as he rarely concerns himself with the life of Jesus prior to his death and resurrection. Why he would invoke it so idiosyncratically in this instance is difficult to explain. While these problems do not make the standard interpretation of διάκονος περιτομη̑ς intolerable, they do leave room for alternative proposals.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0142064X12442848">
<title>A New Proposal</title>
<p>In the only other place where Paul refers to Christ as a διάκονος, the formulation with a genitive different from the genitive as described above. In Gal. 2.17, Paul wrestles with the apparent paradox created when a Jew seeks justification through Christ rather than the Law. If this pursuit encourages him to act in a way that makes him a sinner before the Law, Paul asks incredulously whether Jesus becomes a διάκονος ἁμαρτίας, a ‘servant of sin’? As Hermann W. Beyer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0142064X12442848">1964–1976</xref>: II, 88-89) has suggested, ‘“Servant” here might be rendered “promoter”’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0142064X12442848">3</xref></sup> Paul wonders (rhetorically) whether Christ, as the exclusive source of justification, in some ironic twist actually promotes sinful behavior. The feigned concern is not that Christ ministers to the power of sin, but that through Paul’s gospel Christ ends up promoting sin among his followers.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0142064X12442848">4</xref></sup> The fear is not that Christ ministers to sin, but that he <italic>administers</italic> it to others. ‘Ministry’ language may possess a similarly agential force elsewhere in the New Testament. In 2 Cor. 3.6, for example, Paul and Timothy are not διακόνους καινμ̑ς διαθήκης because they ‘serve’ the new covenant, but because they ‘serve it up’, so to speak, by representing it, promoting it, and making it available to others.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0142064X12442848">5</xref></sup> Likewise, διάκονος εὐαγγελίου in Col. 1.23 and Eph. 3.6-7 does not suggest service to the gospel, but service to others in which the redemption offered by the gospel becomes available. Admittedly, some genitive constructions with διάκονος in the New Testament are genitive phrases along the lines of the standard interpretation of διάκονος περιτομη̑ς in Rom. 15.8,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0142064X12442848">6</xref></sup> but the usage suggested here is neither rare nor idiosyncratic, and as we have seen, διάκονος bears this sense in the only other case where Paul applies it specifically to Christ.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0142064X12442848">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>Were Rom. 15.8 to be viewed along these lines, Paul would say something dramatically different from what is usually thought when he describes Christ as a διάκονος περιτομη̑ς. He would not be calling Christ a ‘servant to the circumcised’, i.e., a minister to the Jews, but rather an ‘agent of circumcision’, i.e., one who <italic>serves up</italic> circumcision by removing foreskins.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0142064X12442848">8</xref></sup> Christ would be a facilitator of circumcision, like a <italic>mohel</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0142064X12442848">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>How could this make sense?</p>
<p>It makes sense when one considers to whom Paul was writing. As I understand his epistle to the Romans, Paul’s intended listeners are Gentiles. This claim is contentious, of course, and a full-scale justification of it cannot be laid out here.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0142064X12442848">10</xref></sup> Suffice it to say that in Rom. 15.14-18, when Paul apologizes to the narrative ‘you’ for the intermittent harshness of the epistle, he links this manner of writing to ‘you’ with his ministry ‘to the Gentiles’. This correlation suggests at the least that the intended audience in 15.14-18 is Gentiles, which makes it reasonable to conclude that the intended audience is the same in the immediately preceding 15.7-13.</p>
<p>In that case, Paul’s message about reconciliation in 15.7-13 is directed at Gentiles. He bids Gentile believers in Rome to put aside their differences and to welcome one another. Below I will discuss what these differences might be; for now, I draw attention to the justification Paul gives for the exhortation. Gentiles ought to welcome one another because Christ welcomed them into the glory of God. Here is the crucial matter: Christ did not do so by becoming a ‘minister to the Jews’ which, as we saw above, creates an <italic>aporia</italic>, but rather by becoming an ‘agent of circumcision’ who facilitates the incorporation of Gentiles into God’s covenant with the patriarchs, a covenant that has circumcision as its requirement. Of course, I am not suggesting that Christ circumcises these Roman believers in any tangible sense. What Paul describes is a real, but imperceptible, circumcision, by which Gentiles become reckoned as though they are circumcised and thus become qualified to participate in God’s covenantal community.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0142064X12442848">11</xref></sup> Their faith, rather than a knife, has circumcised them, and Christ, not a <italic>mohel</italic>, did the deed. In so doing, Paul contends, Christ fulfilled God’s age-old promise to the patriarchs that one day all nations would come to be included within God’s covenant. That day is today, as Paul sees it, and Christ made it possible. For that reason Gentiles are singing the praises of God just as the prophets foresaw long ago.</p>
<p>This reading enjoys significant advantages over the standard approach. First, it makes superior sense of the patriarchal promises to which Paul refers in the purpose clause of v. 8b. The prevailing reading struggles to explain how Christ becoming a servant to the Jews amounts to a confirmation or fulfillment of God’s promises to the patriarchs.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0142064X12442848">12</xref></sup> While ancient Jewish literature often speaks of promises between God and Israel, nowhere is there mention of a ‘servant to the circumcised’, especially in the patriarchal pacts of Genesis. Those promises deal with land inheritance, divine protection and future progeny, not with the bestowal of future servants. Thus, Christ’s becoming a servant to the Jews would hardly confirm any promises given to Abraham, Isaac or Jacob. Of course, one can find passages in the prophets in which God pledges to provide such a servant, but such promises are not made ‘to the fathers’, and invariably they feature the term δου̑λος, not διάκονος.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0142064X12442848">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>The reading proposed here accounts splendidly for ‘the promises to the fathers’ invoked by Paul, especially as he construes them elsewhere in Romans. Paul addresses such promises in Rom. 4.13-16, where he describes God’s vow to Abraham that he should inherit the world. God deliberately made faith the foundation of that promise so that its present recipients would include those Gentiles who share in Abraham’s faith by means of Christ.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0142064X12442848">14</xref></sup> The same understanding of the patriarchal promises arises in Rom. 9–11, when Paul confronts the lack of faith exhibited by some Jews, and the possible implications of this disbelief for the faithfulness of God to his covenanted people. Does Jewish unbelief mean God’s word is unreliable? Paul’s apology is revealing: he does not defend God’s honor by insisting, as he is thought to do in Rom. 15.8, that God held up his end of the bargain by sending Christ as a servant to the Jews; rather, he vindicates God by proposing that Israelites, as they are construed on the standard reckoning by physical descent, Law observance, and other such factors, are <italic>not</italic> the intended recipients of the patriarchal promises. The promises to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob are determined by faith, by grace, and as Paul says explicitly in Rom. 9.15-18, by God’s <italic>merciful</italic> election (cf. Rom. 15.9). In the wake of Christ, God mercifully has chosen some from among both Jews and Gentiles to become the promised heirs of the patriarchs, and consequently, continued unbelief among Jews does not impeach God’s reliability, for it is not Jews who necessarily inherit the patriarchal promises, but the faithful, which currently includes some Jews and some Gentiles. Simply put, God’s merciful inclusion of Gentiles through faith rests at the core of Paul’s conception of the patriarchal promises in Romans.</p>
<p>Galatians 3.1-29 corroborates this view. While the details of Paul’s argument there differ from the analogous material in Romans insofar as he identifies Christ as the single seed of Abraham, his concept of promise remains the same. Christ may be the promised seed of Abraham, but because this is so, incorporation into Christ makes such status available to anyone, even Gentiles. Paul adumbrates this conclusion in Gal. 3.14 and then says it explicitly in Gal. 3.27-29. He also insists, as he does in Romans, that the patriarchal promises are determined not by Law (Gal. 3.18-19), but by faith, and specifically by ‘the faith of Jesus Christ’ (Gal. 3.22). In Galatians, Paul explains <italic>how</italic> Christ has initiated the Gentile inclusion promised by God. It is not through his earthly ministry to the Jews, as if this service somehow enabled Gentiles to come aboard, but through his death on the cross (Gal. 3.10-13).</p>
<p>For Paul, then, ‘the promises to the fathers’ denote the covenant between God and Abraham, rooted in faith, which is fulfilled when access to that covenant is made available to all nations, on account of mercy, by means of the faith effectuated by the death of Christ.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0142064X12442848">15</xref></sup> This understanding of the patriarchal promises coheres felicitously with the understanding of Christ as an ‘agent of circumcision’ in Rom. 15.8a. Christ has indeed welcomed ‘you’ Gentiles into God’s covenant by becoming an agent of the circumcision required for admission, doing so in order to confirm God’s promises to the patriarchs that Gentiles eventually would enter the covenant through faith.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0142064X12442848">16</xref></sup></p>
<p>On this reading, Rom. 15.8 fits cleanly between vv. 7 and 9, both contextually and grammatically. On the one hand, v. 8 constitutes a justification for v. 7, thus accounting for the introductory γάρ, while at the same time v. 8 also provides a fitting apposition for the claim in v. 9, conjoined by a copulative δέ. That is to say: in order to defend his claim that Christ has welcomed Gentiles into the glory of God, Paul says on the one hand that Christ has become an ‘agent of circumcision’ on account of the truth of God in order to confirm the patriarchal promises; on the other hand, Gentiles are now glorifying God on account of mercy (cf. the merciful election of Gentiles described in Rom. 9).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0142064X12442848">17</xref></sup></p>
<p>The scriptural catena, too, makes it clear that Gentile inclusion lies at the heart of Paul’s message in 15.7-13. Following his announcement in v. 9a that Gentiles are glorifying God for the sake of mercy, Paul endorses the claim as a fulfillment of scriptural prophecy. It is happening ‘just as it has been written’. Paul begins by drawing from Ps. 17.50 (LXX).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0142064X12442848">18</xref></sup> He continues with an exact citation from Deut. 32.43 (LXX) followed by a slightly modified version of Ps. 116.1 (LXX).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-0142064X12442848">19</xref></sup> Lastly he offers an abbreviated version of Isa. 11.10 (LXX).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-0142064X12442848">20</xref></sup> The catchword uniting the four citations is ‘Gentiles’. Paul marshals evidence from each sector of the Hebrew Bible to show that the glorification of God by Gentiles has been a part of God’s plan all along. Because most commentators think Paul’s claim in Rom. 15.8-9a had to do with Christ’s service to both Jews and Gentiles, however, they have devised strategies for broadening the focus of the catena to include Jews and Gentiles praising God in unison—as Dunn (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0142064X12442848">1988</xref>: I, 853) puts it, ‘an expression of the ideal of a humanity (Gentile and Jew) united in worship of the same God and by hope in the same Christ’. But this interpretation has little to commend it, as only the quotation from Deut. 32.43 even remotely alludes to Jews. Despite the mention of ‘his people’, the principal call in that verse is for Gentiles to rejoice, just as it is <italic>exclusively</italic> in the other quotations. More importantly, if the catena were meant to describe Jews glorifying God alongside Gentiles, then it would fail as a corroboration of Paul’s supposed claim in vv. 8-9a. Even according to the consensus view, Paul says nothing there about Jews and Gentiles coming together or about Jews glorifying God. His only claim about Jews is that they received a messianic servant, a claim for which Paul would not have struggled to adduce prophetic support had he wished it. The catena describes Gentiles rejoicing, praising and hoping in Christ because Paul asserts as much in vv. 8-9a. As Lloyd Gaston (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0142064X12442848">1987</xref>: 134) puts it, ‘This section deals solely with the theme of Gentile inclusion’.</p>
<p>As a celebration of Gentile inclusion in God’s covenant, Rom. 15.7-13 also fits neatly into the context of Romans as a whole. At the outset of the epistle, Paul expressed his desire to visit Rome so that he might ‘also reap some fruit among you, just as [I have] among the rest of the Gentiles’ (Rom. 1.13). Having identified his audience as Gentiles, he proceeds to explain how the gospel of salvation through faith in Christ is available for Gentiles no less than for Jews. Time and again he emphasizes that faith levels the playing field, so to speak, by allowing Gentiles the access to God’s covenant previously enjoyed by Jews alone: through faith Gentiles gain Abraham as an ancestor and inherit his promises (Rom. 4.13-17); through faith they are adopted as ‘sons of God’ (Rom. 8.12-17); through faith they have been incorporated into the people of God (Rom. 9–11). In Rom. 15.7-13, Paul draws on this theme of the epistle and gives it an ethical, practical twist, exhorting his Gentile audience to deal with internal disputes by imitating the example set by Christ. They ought to accept one another just as Christ made possible their acceptance into the glory of God.</p>
<p>Let me turn, then, to an objection sure to have arisen by now. Most interpreters take Rom. 15.7-13 to be the culmination of Paul’s paraenetic discourse begun at Rom. 12.1 and, more immediately, the <italic>coup de grâce</italic> in his exhortation on the ‘weak’ and the ‘strong’ in Rom. 14.1–15.6.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-0142064X12442848">21</xref></sup> The concerns and behaviors associated with the weak, such as the avoidance of meat and the observance of special days, have led many to suppose that the ‘weak’ are mainly Jewish believers, the ‘strong’ mainly Gentiles.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-0142064X12442848">22</xref></sup> Paul knows that at least some believing Jews in Rome, unwilling or unable to abandon the Law in light of their newfound faith, have abided in their Jewish scruples, and this behavior has exacerbated tensions with Gentile believers. Paul beseeches the Gentile ‘strong’ to bear with the Jewish ‘weak’, to overlook their infirmity and to treat them amicably. In Rom. 15.7-13, Paul perorates by pointing to the example of Christ, who welcomed both Jews and Gentiles into the glory of God. Thus, even though the terms ‘Jew’ and ‘Gentile’, or ‘Circumcision’ and ‘Uncircumcision’, never appear in Rom. 14.1–15.6, their emergence in 15.7-13 demonstrates that Paul deals with a conflict between Jews and Gentiles in the previous section as well.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-0142064X12442848">23</xref></sup> Accordingly, 15.7-13 should be read as a call for Jewish and Gentile rapprochement.</p>
<p>There are problems with identifying the ‘weak’ and the ‘strong’ along Jewish and Gentile lines, however, beyond even the conspicuous lack of such terminology in 14.1–15.6. Most obviously, Paul situates himself among the ‘strong’ in 15.1, indicating that at least one Jewish believer was reckoned among that faction. Conversely, to the extent that Gentile believers in Rome were attracted to aspects of the Law, whether because they came from the ranks of Jewish sympathizers or because they had been persuaded of the importance of the Law by Paul’s rivals, then surely some of them would have constituted the ‘weak’. The explicit Gentile audience in Romans also militates against an association of the ‘weak’ and the ‘strong’ with Jews and Gentiles, respectively. Paul’s exhortation in Rom. 14–15 culminates in a call for the ‘weak’ and ‘strong’ parties to ‘welcome one another, just as Christ welcomed <italic>you</italic>’ (15.7), a second person plural which no doubt corresponds to the Gentiles indicated by the repeated second person plural pronouns in 15.14-18. If Paul exhorts ‘you,’ the ‘weak’ and the ‘strong’, to welcome one another, and the collective ‘you’ elsewhere in Romans refers to Gentiles,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-0142064X12442848">24</xref></sup> including in the passage immediately to follow, what reason is there to suppose that one of the groups addressed by the ‘you’ in this case is Jews, or a bloc of mostly Jews?</p>
<p>On my reading, there is no reference to a conflict between Jews and Gentiles in Rom. 14.1–15.6. Whatever the nature of the conflict, it is a dispute among Gentiles only.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-0142064X12442848">25</xref></sup> I am partial to viewing it as a disagreement over the measure of allegiance due from baptized Gentiles to Jewish scruples, ‘weak’ Gentiles wishing to observe the Sabbath and dietary regulations over and against ‘strong’ Gentiles desiring freedom from the Law.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-0142064X12442848">26</xref></sup> Such a conflict would dovetail with the struggle to curb Judaizing evident in Paul’s other epistles, most notably Galatians and Philippians. Gentiles ‘strong’ in faith would have known that the era of literal Law observance is over and that faith alone secures their place in God’s covenant—indeed, faith renders them as though they were circumcised. Gentiles ‘weak’ in faith, however, especially if they had practiced Jewish rituals prior to their conversion in the capacity of sympathizers, believed that observance of the Law, including circumcision in the flesh, is still required for reconciliation with God. Such ‘weak’ Gentiles would reckon Jewish holidays superior to other days and avoid meat in order to comply with Jewish dietary laws. In Rom. 14.1–15.3, Paul’s advice to both the ‘weak’ and the ‘strong’ among the Gentiles is clear: so long as they are motivated by faith and concern for the Lord, the nomistic inclinations of the ‘weak’ are of no consequence. In the spirit of self-sacrifice, the ‘strong’ ought to bear with the failings of the ‘weak’, just as Christ did when he fulfilled the expectations of Ps. 69.9: ‘The reproach of those reproaching you fell upon me’ (Rom. 15.3).</p>
<p>In 15.7-13, Paul clinches the case by drawing on the example of Christ yet again, encouraging his Gentile charges, whether ‘weak’ or ‘strong’, to welcome one another just as Christ welcomed them by making faith-based circumcision possible. In so doing, Paul not only inspires goodwill, but he does so in a way that reinforces the position of the ‘strong’ with which he identifies. After all, if the disparity in faith described in 14.1–15.6 has to do with the conviction that faith alone determines reconciliation with God and membership in the patriarchal covenant, Paul reinforces the view of the ‘strong’ in 15.8 when he proclaims Christ as an agent of circumcision. Faith in Christ effects circumcision in its adherents, and thus faith by itself brings Gentiles into the glory of God.</p>
<p>In sum, then, 15.7-13 makes best sense when one relinquishes the assumption that ‘circumcision’ in 15.8 refers to ‘the circumcised Jews’ rather than circumcision itself. Taking Christ as an ‘agent of circumcision’ fits better within the context of the passage as a whole. It explains how Christ welcomed ‘you’ Gentiles into the glory of God and why these Gentiles, as a consequence, glorify God; it accounts for the confirmation of patriarchal promises which, as we have seen, have to do with the extension of the Abrahamic covenant to Gentiles; and it anticipates the catena of prooftexts focused squarely on the participation of Gentiles in the praise of God.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, I suspect many readers at this point are still dubious that Paul, the apostle so famous for <italic>opposing</italic> circumcision, could in fact be suggesting that a genital circumcision effected by faith is not only crucial for inclusion in the covenant, but that Christ himself performs the deed. More texts will be required. Before we look at two other Pauline passages, however, I turn my attention briefly to the earliest interpreter of Pauline theology, the author of Colossians, who describes a similar sort of circumcision.</p>

<title>The ‘Circumcision of Christ’: Colossians 2.11-13</title>
<p>Of course, some maintain that Paul himself composed Colossians—roughly four out of ten according to one recent estimation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0142064X12442848">Brown 1997</xref>: 610). The arguments for and against Pauline authorship of Colossians will not be repeated here (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0142064X12442848">Collins 1988</xref>: 171-208). My assumption is that Colossians was composed by a disciple or group of disciples acquainted with at least the general contours of Paul’s teaching.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn27-0142064X12442848">27</xref></sup> Should it turn out that Paul in fact wrote the epistle, then my case will prove only stronger.</p>
<p>In Col. 2.8-23, the author cautions his audience against adversaries who ‘teach by philosophy and empty deceit, according to the traditions of human beings, according to the rudiments of the world and not according to Christ’ (Col. 2.8). Christ, he reminds them, is the source of all authority and the source of their fulfillment (Col. 2.9-10). The author then elaborates further on the effect of Christ:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p><sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0142064X12442848">11</xref></sup> In whom you were even circumcised with a circumcision not wrought by hands, by stripping off the body of the flesh, by means of the circumcision of Christ, <sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0142064X12442848">12</xref></sup> having been buried with him in the baptism in which you were also raised up with him, through the faith of the working of God, who raised him from the dead. <sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0142064X12442848">13</xref></sup> Even you, although you were dead in trespasses and in the uncircumcision of your flesh, he made you alive with him by forgiving us of all the trespasses.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The author tells his readers that in Christ they have been circumcised and overcome the state of death they once experienced due to uncircumcision in the flesh. The circumcision undergone by the Colossians is described in three ways. First, it is ‘not wrought by hands’, presumably human hands, suggesting that the circumcision was the product of divine effort, as the term ἀχειροποίητος indicates in Mk 14.58 and 2 Cor. 5.1. Second, it involves the ‘stripping off of the body of the flesh’, which refers to the flesh of the believers at Colossae.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn28-0142064X12442848">28</xref></sup> What this description means, exactly, will be clarified momentarily. Lastly, the circumcision occurs either ‘in the circumcision of Christ’, or more likely, ‘by means of the circumcision of Christ’. But what is the ‘circumcision of Christ’? It could be a subjective genitive referring to a circumcision possessed by, in the sense that it is performed by, Christ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0142064X12442848">Lohse 1971</xref>: 101-103; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0142064X12442848">Schweizer 1982</xref>: 143). More likely, it is an objective genitive pointing either toward the circumcision of Jesus as an infant or the death of Jesus—the shedding of his flesh—understood through the metaphor of circumcision (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0142064X12442848">Barth and Blanke 1994</xref>: 364-65; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0142064X12442848">Dunn 1996</xref>: 158; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0142064X12442848">O’Brien 1982</xref>: 117; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0142064X12442848">Wilson 2005</xref>: 204).</p>
<p>The participial clause in v. 12 holds the key to interpreting the circumcision described in v. 11. Grammar recommends the linkage of these verses, as the participle συνταϕέντες is subordinate to περιετμήθητε in v. 11, not to συνηγέρθητε in v.12, which comes in a relative clause that is itself subordinate within the participial construction.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn29-0142064X12442848">29</xref></sup> Whether the participle is temporal, causal or modal, all of which are possibilities, the ensuing description of baptism sheds light on the circumcision in v. 11. Believers at Colossae were circumcised either ‘when’ they were baptized, ‘because’ they were baptized or ‘by means of’ their baptism. The last alternative makes best sense, however, since the participle follows the two instrumental datives at the end of v. 11. The author’s description of the baptism in v. 12 thus corresponds to the string of datives associated with the circumcision. The burial and subsequent resurrection with Christ experienced by believers at baptism (v. 12) created in them a non-hand-wrought circumcision achieved through the stripping off of the flesh and through the ‘circumcision of Christ’. When they were buried with Christ, the believers shed their flesh just as Christ shed his when he died. Their flesh was circumcised through baptismal participation in the death of Christ, and in this way they have received a circumcision not wrought by human hands but through the agency of Christ. The ‘circumcision of Christ’, then, refers to Christ’s death, and believers, through communion with Christ at baptism, experience that death, that stripping off of the flesh, and in that sense become circumcised.</p>
<p>But what flesh do they shed? What is circumcised? Perhaps the author has a circumcision of the heart in view here, so that the flesh excised is either the figurative foreskin of the heart or the sinful ‘life in the flesh’ that such a circumcision overcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0142064X12442848">Dunn 1996</xref>: 147-58). That the circumcision is described as ἀχειροποιήτῳ may suggest the sort of ethical transformation characterized in Deuteronomy, Jeremiah and elsewhere as a figurative circumcision of the heart. But the term does not preclude a circumcision of the genital foreskin. The author’s point is simply that the circumcision has been achieved through divine, rather than human, agency.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn30-0142064X12442848">30</xref></sup> Such insistence may even suggest a kind of circumcision that can be hand-made, which would rule out a circumcision of the heart, as it cannot be circumcised manually. Human hands do circumcise penises, however, and thus the remarkableness of the genital circumcision undergone by the Colossians stems from its performance by the hand of Christ rather than by the hands of men. By participating in the death of Christ in baptism, the Colossians shed the body of their flesh, namely their genital foreskins.</p>
<p>This reading finds contextual support in the ensuing v. 13, where the author elaborates on the transformation experienced by the Colossians as a result of their baptismal circumcision. Previously they were dead because of their ‘trespasses’ and because of ‘the uncircumcision of [their] flesh’. Baptism, the author goes on to say, has made them alive alongside Christ, their trespasses forgiven. In this reversal, then, the uncircumcision of their flesh has likewise been removed. Admittedly, this ‘uncircumcision of the flesh’ may merely be a ‘symbol of spiritual alienation’, akin to the uncircumcision of the heart mentioned in Deut. 10.16, Jer. 4.4, Ezek. 44.7, <italic>Jub.</italic> 1.23, Philo (<italic>Spec.</italic> 1.305) and the Dead Sea scrolls (1QpHab 11.13).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn31-0142064X12442848">31</xref></sup> Indeed, these several verses reveal how well known this concept was in Jewish circles in antiquity. But in nearly every case in which authors intend a figurative understanding of uncircumcision, they specify so by referring to the ‘uncircumcision of the heart’, or the ‘hardness of the heart’. Alternatively, when ‘uncircumcision’ alone is mentioned, both in the Hebrew Bible and Second Temple literature, the uncircumcision invariably refers to the foreskin of the penis.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn32-0142064X12442848">32</xref></sup> If the author of Col. 2.13 had wished to portray the Colossians as uncircumcised in the heart prior to their transformation, then he, too, would likely have employed the usual terminology for doing so. As it is, he refers to the ‘uncircumcision of the flesh’ because he is calling attention to the Colossians’ prior state of <italic>genital</italic> uncircumcision.</p>
<p>Confirmation for this reading comes from the analogous passage in Eph. 2.11-13, which calls upon its readers to remember their own recent transformation:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p><sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0142064X12442848">11</xref></sup> Therefore, remember that in the past you were Gentiles in the flesh, those called the uncircumcision by those calling themselves the circumcision, which is wrought by hands in the flesh. <sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0142064X12442848">12</xref></sup> [Remember] that at that time you were without Christ, alienated from the polity of Israel and strangers to the covenants of the promise, without hope and godless in the world. <sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0142064X12442848">13</xref></sup> But now, in Christ Jesus, you who were once afar have become near by means of the blood of Christ.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This conversion experience mirrors the one described in Col. 2.11-13. The Ephesians had been ‘Gentiles in the flesh’, which in light of the explanatory clause in v. 11b must refer to their lack of genital circumcisions. When they were uncircumcised, they were alienated from the covenant of Israel, godless in the world and without hope. Now they have been brought near, so that they are no longer without God, no longer strangers to the polity of Israel and the covenants of the promise. Presumably they are also no longer ‘Gentiles in the flesh’, too, if we are to take seriously the contrast between ποτέ in v. 11a and νυνὶ δέ in v. 13. If we suppose that the Ephesians have not removed their foreskins with a knife, we are left with the conclusion that they are no longer ‘Gentiles in the flesh’ because the flesh of their foreskins has been removed ‘by means of the blood of Christ’. Of course, the Ephesians would not be separated from their foreskins in any tangible sense. Were one to peek at the Ephesians after baptism, the men would still have foreskins and the women would still lack penises. With respect to the covenant of Abraham, however, they are considered to have become circumcised members of the covenant.</p>
<p>The author of Colossians makes just this point, suggesting that the recipients of his epistle had been circumcised by means of Christ, a circumcision involving the shedding of genital foreskins made possible by the death experienced by believers in communion with Christ at baptism. Such a link between the baptismal rite of initiation and circumcision seems natural because circumcision was the initiatory rite in God’s covenant with Israel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0142064X12442848">Barth and Blanke 1994</xref>: 367). Because the Colossians had not been circumcised by a knife and had not entered the covenant by that means, then surely the baptism by which they did enter the covenant must have furnished the required circumcision.</p>
<p>It remains unclear, of course, whether the author of Colossians originated this notion of faith-based circumcision or derived it from another source, the best candidate being the apostle in whose name the author composed. As we have seen, there may be a precedent in Paul’s genuine epistles—namely, Paul’s contention, in Rom. 15.7-13, that Christ became an ‘agent of circumcision’ in order to facilitate Gentile inclusion and thereby to confirm the promises to the patriarchs. If a connection indeed exists between these passages, however, one is justified in wondering why this author has couched his understanding of circumcision within the context of baptism, when Paul’s genuine epistles never mention circumcision and baptism in the same place. One may account for the disparity in a couple of ways. First, it must be remembered that Paul never provides a detailed baptismal theology. His references to baptism are few and far between, and never elaborate. In Rom. 6.3-4, he invokes baptism briefly as part of an exhortation against sinful behavior; in 1 Cor. 1.13-17, baptism surfaces in his condemnation of Corinthian factionalism; in 1 Cor. 12.13 and Gal. 3.27, he speaks of baptism as a mode of intimate communion with Christ. These last instances are especially tantalizing and beg more detailed description. Nevertheless, what little we do learn about baptism from Paul is reflected in Col. 2.11-13: the believer participates in the death of Christ, just as Rom. 6.3-4 describes it, and the believer experiences a fundamental change in identity due to this communion, just like in 1 Cor. 12.13 and Gal. 3.27. Thus, one explanation for the disparity is that the author of Colossians drew upon Paul’s teaching for the link between baptism and circumcision, even if this link never surfaces in the sliver of Paul’s teaching that survives. Alternatively, the link may be the interpretive contribution of the latter author. That is, whereas Paul taught that the death of Christ granted access to the covenant and circumcision to Gentiles who believe, the author of Colossians elaborated on the ‘mechanics’ of this experience, so to speak, by correlating it to baptism.</p>
<p>In either case, Col. 2.11-13 bolsters the case for reading ‘circumcision’ in Rom. 15.8 as a reference to genital circumcision. The first generation of Paul’s interpreters, who knew Paul’s teachings intimately and wrote in his name, speak of a ‘circumcision not wrought by hands’ by which Gentiles shed the uncircumcision in their flesh, a circumcision made possible by participation in the ‘circumcision of Christ’. This circumcision certainly resembles Paul’s proclamation that Christ has become an ‘agent of circumcision’, who fulfills the patriarchal promises and welcomes Gentiles into the glory of God.</p>

<sec id="section6-0142064X12442848">
<title>‘We are the Circumcision’</title>
<p>Near the conclusion of his epistle to the Philippians, Paul’s tone changes abruptly as he confronts a pernicious element infecting his beloved community. Apparently, some forces in Philippi, as in Galatia and probably elsewhere, were encouraging Paul’s charges to undergo circumcisions wrought by human hands. Paul’s admonition is fierce, a threefold call to take heed before these rogues: ‘Beware of the dogs! Beware of the evil workers! Beware of the genital mutilation!’ (Phil. 3.2). Paul then explains why the circumcisers are to be avoided, turning his attention to the status of his followers: ‘For it is we who are the circumcision, we who serve God by means of the spirit and boast in Christ Jesus and have no confidence because of the flesh’ (Phil. 3.3). Paul goes on to show why he has every reason for confidence in the flesh, but nevertheless reckons that advantage to be for naught on account of Christ.</p>
<p>Interpreters agree that the ‘we’ in Paul’s bold declaration refers not to Paul and his fellow Jews but to Paul and his fellow converts at Philippi.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn33-0142064X12442848">33</xref></sup> Paul lumps himself in with these as yet uncircumcised Gentiles, with the result that most of the ‘we’ who constitute ‘the circumcision’ are in fact uncircumcised in the flesh. There is also consensus about the type of circumcision Paul has in mind. It is the figurative circumcision of the heart mentioned by Paul in Rom. 2.25-29. Paul thus turns the argument of the would-be <italic>mohalim</italic> in Philippi on its head. Those claiming to be ‘the circumcision’ and demanding circumcision for those in Christ are in fact not ‘the circumcision’. They are but mutilators of the flesh for whom epithets customarily thrown at Gentiles are appropriate. Those in Christ require no circumcision in the flesh because they already have been circumcised in the way that truly matters, figuratively in the heart by means of the spirit. It is they who really are ‘the circumcision’.</p>
<p>This approach to Phil. 3.2-3 is basically correct. One aspect requires tinkering, however. Let us look for a moment at Paul’s description of circumcision in Rom. 2.25-29. To see in this passage <italic>only</italic> a figurative circumcision of the heart is to miss a crucial point. True, Paul says in v. 29 that ‘it is the internally marked person who is a Jew, and circumcision of the heart, by means of the spirit and not the letter, is what matters’. But there is more to the story.</p>
<p>In the preceding verses, Paul has laid out the determinants of this figurative circumcision. If there is any logic to the progression of vv. 25-29, then the circumcision of the heart described in v. 29 must be a metaphor for the ethical achievement mentioned in vv. 25-27. That is to say, one shows that the foreskin of his heart is circumcised when he ‘observes the righteous decrees of the Law’ (Rom. 2.26). Here, then, is the point so often overlooked by commentators. According to Paul, such upright conduct reveals just as much about the state of one’s genitalia as it does about one’s heart! Paul makes this clear in vv. 25-26 when he describes the remarkable transformation experienced by the genitally circumcised man who fails to live up to the Law’s standard. His exposed glans becomes a foreskin! Surely Paul does not mean that his foreskin regenerates physically.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn34-0142064X12442848">34</xref></sup> Nonetheless, the intangible epispasm effects the man’s circumcision in the flesh, annulling it and rendering him as though he were physically uncircumcised. An equally astonishing thing happens when a putatively uncircumcised man fulfills the righteous decrees of the Law. As v. 26 puts it, ‘his foreskin will be reckoned as a circumcision!’ Though ostensibly uncircumcised, through his observance of the righteous decrees of the Law it becomes as though he were circumcised in the flesh. Paul’s point in Rom. 2.25-29, then, is not that circumcision of the heart matters while circumcision of the penis does not.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn35-0142064X12442848">35</xref></sup> In fact, circumcision of the penis remains crucial. What has changed is what counts for genital circumcision. As Paul explains it, the figurative circumcision of the heart determined by compliance with the righteous decrees of the Law at the same time renders adherents as though they were physically circumcised. Circumcision is indeed an internal and figurative matter, just as Paul proclaims in Rom. 2.29, but this internal, figurative transformation affects the state of the genital foreskin as much as the foreskin of the heart.</p>
<p>Thus, when Paul assures his Philippian charges that ‘we are the circumcision’, he says so not merely because they are circumcised figuratively in the heart. He considers them circumcised in the genitalia just the same because their foreskins are now reckoned as exposed glandes. Through their service to God by means of the spirit and their boasting in Christ Jesus, their foreskins already have been circumcised and their inclusion in the covenant secured. To submit to adversaries who do not acknowledge this sort of circumcision and who require the sort wrought by the knife would constitute willing submission to physical mutilation, the unnecessary cutting of an already exposed glans. No less would such capitulation undermine the effect wrought by Christ on the believers’ standing before God. Christ has produced in them the genital circumcision required for admission into God’s covenanted people. Paul makes no clear-cut distinction between a necessary circumcision of the heart, enabled by Christ, and an unnecessary circumcision of the penis. Both are essential, and the one produces the other.</p>
<p>That is why Paul calls Christ an ‘agent of circumcision’ in Rom. 15.8. Christ offers a genital circumcision not wrought by hands, a circumcision that enables Gentiles to enter into the glory of God and to sing his praises, thereby confirming the age-old promise that the nations of the world would come to receive the inheritance of Abraham.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn36-0142064X12442848">36</xref></sup></p>

<p>Meanings of περιτομή vary in the NT. It can indeed refer to the Jewish people identified according to one of their most peculiar characteristics (e.g., Rom. 3.30; 4.9; Gal. 2.7-9; Eph. 2.11). See <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0142064X12442848">Marcus 1989</xref> on the possible derivation of this usage.

<p>Paul would not be the only ancient Jew to reckon as circumcised those who are putatively uncircumcised. According to the Babylonian Talmud (<italic>b. ‘Abod.

<p>Admittedly, such agency on Christ’s part is not directly analogous to that described in Gal. 2.17 above. Christ’s (rhetorical) service as a ‘promoter’ of sin is of a more passive variety than the promotion—indeed, the performance—of circumcision proposed here. Paul’s affected concern in Galatians is not that the grace afforded by Christ causes believers to sin in as direct a way as Paul believes Christ’s resurrection causes believers to become circumcised. That said, in each case the effect of Christ’s agency requires the action of both Christ and the believer. In Gal. 2.17, Christ provides the grace while the believer chooses to sin; in Rom. 15.8, Christ provides access to the covenant while the believer opts to accept it.</p></fn>

<p>Syntactically, this rendering views v. 9a as a resumption of the indirect speech begun in the previous verse. The interpretation also works if v. 9a in fact forms a secondary purpose clause. Paul would then say that Christ became an ‘agent of circumcision’ in order to confirm the patriarchal promises, which happened in order that Gentiles might glorify God. In either case, the sentence becomes sensible when one acknowledges that Christ has become an ‘agent of circumcision’ for Gentiles, not a servant or minister to the Jewish people.</p></fn>

<p>Romans 15.7-13 no doubt culminates the paraenesis begun in 14.1, but whether it is a coda for the letter as a whole (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0142064X12442848">Dunn 1988</xref>: II, 484) is less clear. Because most interpreters consider the theme of 15.7-13 to be Jewish–Gentile rapprochement, they emphasize the hint of mutuality in the citation from Deut. 32.43 and link the passage to Paul’s refrain, ‘the Jew first and also the Greek’ (Rom. 1.16; 2.10) and/or to the alleged prediction of Jewish salvation alongside Gentiles in Rom. 11 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0142064X12442848">Schaller 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0142064X12442848">Müller 1997</xref>: 223-34; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0142064X12442848">Dunn 1988</xref>: II, 844-53).</p></fn>

<p>Among those who reject Pauline authorship for Colossians, most accept that it derives from a Pauline ‘school’. As Outi Leppä (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0142064X12442848">2003</xref>: 12) observes, opinions differ as to whether such a school developed after Paul’s death or while he was alive.

<p>One might wonder why Paul does not adduce this notion of figurative genital circumcision in his censure of the Galatians, where the issue of circumcision features so prominently. I hesitate to speculate on what Paul <italic>does not</italic> say, seeing as it is often so difficult to discern what he <italic>does</italic> say. Nevertheless, I see two possibilities. It might be that Paul developed the idea of faith-based genital circumcision precisely as a response to the conflict in Galatia. Perhaps Paul realized (or was made to realize) that when he based his rejection of the Law on the grounds that it post-dated the covenant by 400 years, he failed to acknowledge that circumcision, if not the rest of the Law, was indeed part and parcel of the original covenant. Perhaps this prompted him to find a way in which he could preserve the essentiality of genital circumcision without going so far as to reverse his opposition to its practice. Alternatively, it might be that Paul had developed the idea of figurative genital circumcision by the time he wrote Galatians, but deliberately withheld it from them so as not to educe confusion among the Galatians about what circumcision really is. Were Paul to make the case that genital circumcision is indeed an essential part of the covenant, which is now achieved through faith in Christ, perhaps he feared that the ‘foolish’ among the Galatians would mistake his advocacy of circumcision for a recommendation to pursue the fleshly circumcision hawked by the opponents. This would accord nicely with Gal 5.11, where Paul notes that some in Galatia believe he preaches circumcision, a curious admission. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0142064X12442848">Peder Borgen (1982)</xref> suggests that the admission makes best sense if the Galatians had learned of Paul’s positive estimation of figurative circumcision of the heart and mistook it as an endorsement of genital circumcision. Perhaps, then, Paul did not want to foster more confusion or to give his opponents an opportunity to further twist his words, so he held back his distinction between figurative circumcision of the heart and putative circumcision of the penis, instead choosing simply to repudiate physical circumcision and focus his argumentation on the obsolescence of the Law.</p></fn>
