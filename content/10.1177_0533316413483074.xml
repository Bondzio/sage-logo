<p>How nice it feels to be sitting together in a circle, does it not?</p>
<p>I hope you will soon feel at home here—comfortable, sitting in a circle, face to face, confident in sharing your thoughts and reflections, maybe a bit curious and uncertain at first, feeling some unease that can soon turn into the pleasure of listening, of thinking, of sharing thinking and thinking together, the pleasure of learning, of becoming aware: the pleasure of the mind.</p>
<p>That is why we have organized Median Groups for the rest of the day and the dinners, similar to Freud’s gatherings at Hotel Bemelmanns in Collalbo/Klobenstein, where he spent his vacations and wrote <italic>Totem and Taboo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0533316413483074">1912</xref>): we can remain professional and become personal in varying shades, and eventually become friends. De Maré’s idea is to do the same with the people we take care of: if it is good for us . . .</p>
<p>Welcome to the 1st International Median Group® Congress and I am privileged to welcome Turid de Maré, the patroness of this event and to Cathy de Maré. Turid was in Bolzano with Pat, and also invited to a seminar with Rocco Pisani in 2001, as shown by the DVD <italic>Pat’s Selected Images</italic> (2010) at the book desk.</p>
<p>I would like to thank Uni. Doc. Dr. Andreas Conca, recently head of Psychiatry in Bolzano who immediately joined the initiative and our Administration of the Comprensorio Sanitario Bolzano for hosting us, the Health Council of the Province of Bolzano-Bozen and the Fondazione Cassa di Risparmio Bolzano for helping our budget. Thanks to all my colleagues of the Psychiatric Service and of Nuovo Spazio for organizing the event. Thanks to the many colleagues and friends here and in London who have helped us to meet today. I would like to thank our guests, lecturers and friends for their disinterested participation and attention, for their belief in and passion for Patrick de Maré’s contribution to mental health—and his contribution to reclaiming the fused, confused and obsessed mind.</p>
<p>Having recently died, Pat was an English psychiatrist, a pioneer of group analysis, with S.H. Foulkes and colleagues who investigated the three types of groups: the small, the large and, finally, by working out the duality context/content and the introduction of dialogue, the free floating discussion instead of free floating association, and the one in between: the Median Group®. De Maré’s thinking was a definite improvement in the theory on the role of groups as a way of helping individuals to recover through socialization while making society more human.</p>
<p>Everyone has their personal style in working with groups, and over these two very tight days we will try to explore his thinking, which discovered the Median Group’s potential as a helpful setting for psychotherapy through dialogue. It is this socio-therapy that drove de Maré to develop a theory of the mind that will hopefully be the focus of a future congress.</p>
<p>He came to a theory of the mind introducing dialogue as the honest communication between peers who learn to intentionally meet and develop the confidence they need for a meeting of minds. It is a process among people that leads to Koinonia, an affective bond of communion (cum panis, the shared bread), sympathy, non-personal fellowship, solidarity.</p>
<p>Dialogue helps overcome the individual narcissistic barriers against the external world, the ‘we hood’ or Nos<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0533316413483074">1</xref></sup>, as suggested by Tom Ormay.</p>
<p>The human mind is best expressed in dialogue, because it is dialogic, just like consciousness, which is the result of its activity. It is proactively interested in the external world, it takes care of the world and loves everything universal, all functions that dialogue does practise: in the interest expressed for others, in taking care of others, in expanding one’s consciousness (from Latin con: ‘together’ + scire ‘to know’ it means knowing with, in other words having joint or common knowledge with another) from a simple increase in understanding through to learning and wisdom, not only knowledge.</p>
<p>De Maré’s Median Group is the development of Foulkes’ Small Group and begins where Foulkes stopped. Attention is increasingly focussed from the intra-psychic to the social, or better, to a stronger correlation between the intra-psychic and the social. It is a transitional area to get out of the narcissistic family bond (kinship) and enter into citizenship–society (kithship). The Median Group is a setting with 12–30 participants, in clinical practice 17 is the ideal number. It is small enough to promote the identification process and to get to know each other personally, and it is large enough to be a social dimension. It helps cultivate the mind in connection with other minds. It eases discrimination, disentangling the dualities of personal conscious/unconscious and social conscious/unconscious, the lateralization of thinking (the simultaneous activation of both hemispheres) and promotes creativity in signification: the same thing from different points of views.</p>
<p>It promotes not just the insight but also above all the outsight, transposition rather than transference, the reflection of the cultural phenomena that unconsciously affect the individual, and vice versa.</p>
<p>As it is a social setting, it eases emancipation from the family-centred, tribal, hierarchical culture towards a democratic social culture, self-training in action, mirroring and the individuation process. The clinical experience of the last few years found out that the Median Group may reach depths that can be even deeper than those of the small group.</p>
<p>To conclude, I would like to quote a letter sent by Patrick de Maré to David Parsons, which he will talk about tomorrow in his speech.</p>

<p>I would like to do something that may help; to make people speak, no matter about what, put into words the burdensome reality in the symbolic order of the words which may in turn be understood by the mind is the most important thing. This is the only goal of the exercise, to such an extent that a regime with more control and endless pain makes no difference now. So, symbols are not reality, but the reflection of a weakened reality, such that whatever a person does (except stopping to meet and talk regularly) becomes important. Luckily, the existing powers do not realise that. Despite any imposed structure, the real freedom is the freedom of the mind (not even clients need to realise that) and it will be like that, provided you give them a chance to talk to each other, something the powers seem to view as dangerous. Reality and trauma are one thing, reflection on reality is another thing which cannot but lead to ‘growth, development and humanization’, but they might be experienced by the ‘authorities’ as threats against their control and their tendency to infantilization. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0533316413483074">1994</xref>)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>We are reminded of Freud’s remark of helping people to change their individual misery in shared suffering. Listening to de Maré’s statement the most important thing is to put into words the burdensome reality in the symbolic order of the words. Thinking in a dualistic way has its advantages: helping us to ascertain the duality between reality and trauma on the one side, and reflection on reality and trauma as another thing. The synthesis is the work of the disentangling function of the mind: recovering activity that promotes growth, development and humanization.</p>
<p>This is what we are going to exercise in dialogue over the next two days.</p>
<p>I shall give the floor to Malcolm Pines<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0533316413483074">2</xref></sup> who will introduce the workshop.</p>
<p>Thank you, Malcolm.</p>
