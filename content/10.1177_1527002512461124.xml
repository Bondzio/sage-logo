<p>According to its editors, the goal of this hefty volume is to provide a “comprehensive collection of essays by leading scholars and practitioners in the burgeoning field of international sports law.” The book contains a preface and 19 chapters by 27 authors from North America, Europe, and Africa. Although “international sports law” refers to the law of international sporting competitions, the book also includes extensive discussions of national sports law and institutions.</p>
<p>The book has three sections. Part I, <italic>Foundations and Structures</italic>, describes the topics in international sports laws and many important governance institutions, including the Court of Arbitration of Sports (CAS), national governing bodies in Europe and North America, and major international governance organizations. Part II, <italic>Protection of Competition and Athletes</italic>, examines the law about protecting the integrity of sport through rules about doping, gambling, sports technology, the eligibility of athletes, discrimination, and exploitation of children. Part III, <italic>Commercial Issues</italic>, covers competition policy, labor markets, media rights, intellectual property rights, international event sponsorships, and player agents. Because the book is long, I focus my review on topics that seem most important from the perspective of sports economics.</p>
<p>The intended audience for this book is scholars in law and sports management, legal practitioners, player agents, and professional and amateur athletes. This list does not include economists, so an important question is whether this book is likely to be useful to a sports economist. The answer to this question is a qualified yes, with the qualification rooted in the type of legal scholarship that is reflected in most chapters. In brief, the book is not intended to be a contribution to law and economics. Most chapters describe legal rules and governance institutions, articulating the rationale for both without evaluating whether the rationale reflects a valid social purpose or could be accomplished in another way with greater efficiency and equity.</p>
<p>The first chapter by James A. R. Nafziger explains why “sports law” is a distinct area of law rather than simply applications of broader areas such as contract law, labor law, tort law, intellectual property law, and competition law. The distinguishing aspect of sports law arises from the special status that courts and, to a lesser extent, legislators have accorded to sports. The special status of sports is based on two assumptions: sport has social significance far beyond its economic importance and the primary goal of sports organizations is not commercial success.</p>
<p>The presumption that sport is not primarily commercial is more widely accepted in Europe than in North America. As discussed in another chapter by Professor Nafziger, the “European model” of sports organizations is built on community sports clubs that offer a variety of competitive opportunities, including youth sports. European sports governing bodies generally are not owned or controlled by the handful of clubs that operate at the highest level of competition. The inference that Europeans draw from these facts is that clubs, teams, event organizers, leagues, and national governing bodies pursue the health of sports at all levels, not just the commercial success of teams and events at the highest professional level.</p>
<p>The assumption that sport primarily serves noncommercial goals leads to the noninterference principle, which places most conflicts over playing rules and, to some degree, eligibility (see the chapter by Matthew J. Mitten and Timothy Davis) outside the jurisdiction of statutes and courts. For example, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in the United States expressed reluctance to apply American statutory law to participation in the Olympics by Americans, arguing that the Olympic Charter is an international agreement that applies to the entire world.</p>
<p>The noninterference principle has led to extensive privatization of many areas of the law. By far, the most important area in which sports law largely has been privatized is antidoping rules, which are discussed in the chapters by Richard H. McLaren on the CAS and by Richard W. Pound and Kerwin Clark on doping. CAS, a private arbitrator, hears appeals of decisions by governing bodies to punish athletes who violate their rules about performance-enhancing drugs. Because CAS is located in Switzerland, the Swiss Federal Tribunal (SFT) has exclusive authority to review CAS decisions but virtually always declines to do so. An excellent example of the noninterference principle at work arises when the SFT has exclusive jurisdiction over a decision by a CAS panel in the United States in a case in which an American athlete has been convicted of illegal doping by an American sports authority.</p>
<p>The International Olympic Committee (IOC), National Olympic Committees, International Sports Federations that govern sports that are part of the Olympics (which includes nearly all commercially important sports), and even some professional sports organizations, such as the governing bodies for professional cricket and rugby, use CAS in at least some circumstances to resolve disputes over the enforcement of antidoping rules. Punishments for violating doping rules can include fines, temporary or permanent bans from competition, and alteration of the results of past sporting competitions. Whether a violation occurred depends solely on whether an athlete tested positive for a banned substance and whether the test was correctly administered. Whether the substance conferred an athletic advantage, posed a risk to the athlete, and was taken knowingly can affect the punishment but not the decision whether illegal doping occurred.</p>
<p>Another area in which the noninterference principle has partially privatized the law is with respect to discrimination on the basis of gender, disability, and national origin, as discussed in the chapter by Klaus Vieweg and Saskia Lettmaier. In many nations, “separate but equal” is not a legally valid remedy for unequal treatment, but this principle does not apply to international sports and even in some cases to domestic sports. For example, U.S. colleges can satisfy the equality of opportunity provisions of Title IX by offering separate teams for each gender or by allowing women to participate on “male” teams, thereby using either integration or “separate but equal” to achieve equality of opportunity. But neither needs to be adopted at the international level. Although the IOC has steadily added more events for women, the Olympics still does not include women’s ski jumping or some specific events in women’s sports (e.g., 1,500 m free style swimming and 50 km walk), and women cannot participate in the men’s competitions in these events. Similarly, sports organizations can ban transgender athletes, disabled athletes, and athletes from so-called pariah nations, notwithstanding national discrimination laws that prohibit such practices.</p>
<p>One area in which the noninterference principle generally has not been applied is sports gambling. As discussed in the chapter by Paul M. Anderson, the role of sports governance bodies regarding gambling is subsidiary to statutory law, although bodies may punish athletes for engaging in gambling even if they are not charged with violating statutes that ban or regulate gambling. The rise of the Internet has created new tensions between national law and sports organizations. In cases in which sports organizations offer gambling in connection with their events, national prohibitions trump international sales of gambling services from locations where gambling is legal, although enforcement of these prohibitions is difficult.</p>
<p>Another area in which the noninterference principle does not apply is in child abuse cases. The chapter by Steve Cornelius and Paul Singh, written before the horrific events at Penn State were revealed, observes that while laws against child abuse apply to sports, the reality is that “youth sport also provides a fertile hunting ground for predators” and that child abuse “has not received sufficient attention in the sphere of sport, probably because most people associate sport with fair play, ethical values and high moral standards.” As a result, the noninterference principle to some extent applies de facto if not de jure. Professors Cornelius and Singh argue that sports organizations must be more actively engaged with law enforcement authorities to achieve maximal effective protection of children in sports. The problem is that the mechanics of how best to achieve such a change remains largely unexamined.</p>
<p>One area in which sports enjoys special status but is constrained by statutes and, where relevant, common law is competition policy. The chapter by Stephen F. Ross compares the application of competition law to labor markets in major league sports in Europe and North America. Restrictions on competition for major leagues players, such as the rookie draft, the old “reserve clause” and “option clause” provisions binding a player to one team after expiration of a contract, and the European “transfer fee” requirement imposed on teams that sign a player whose expired contract was with another team, would be clearly anticompetitive horizontal restraints if adopted in any other industry.</p>
<p>The status of sports in competition law has a historical legacy of noninterference, as represented in the United States by the antitrust exemption for baseball in the 1921 <italic>Federal League</italic> decision. In the last few decades, the noninterference principle has been displaced by the “rule of reason” in evaluating labor market restrictions as well as other commercial practices of sports leagues such as the sale of broadcast and licensing rights. The procompetitive justifications that major leagues have offered and courts have partially accepted as business justifications for restrictive practices are attaining competitive balance, preserving the integrity of competition, maintaining the fiscal solvency of teams, preserving the ability to stage national competitions, recouping investments in training players, and adhering to collective bargaining agreements that are exempt from competition law. As Professor Ross discusses in examining cases on both sides of the pond, major leagues generally have won the battles but lost the wars on these issues. The ability of sports organizations to restrict competition in labor and other markets on the basis of these arguments has been severely diminished except with respect to some restrictions that are part of a collective bargaining agreement.</p>
<p>The evolution of competition law in sports suggests an important issue that is, for the most part, ignored in most of the book, which is the rationale for the noninterference principle. In almost all sports (a major exception is motor racing), a single national organization controls domestic participation in a sport and a single international body, comprised of national organizations, controls international participation. Exclusive control of access to sporting competition confers monopoly power on sports governance organizations. Because these organizations control access to competition, athletes must adhere to their rules regardless of whether the restrictions efficiently serve a valid social purpose or are no more than a mechanism for transferring power and wealth from athletes to organizers. As illustrated by the evolution of competition law in sports, the accepted truths of today about institutional requirements for a healthy system of sporting competition can become the discredited myths of tomorrow.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding a focus on traditional legal analysis, the book can be a useful reference for economists who are interested in the organization and governance of international sport. The utility of this book is that it discusses the most important court decisions and statutes on sports and describes the structure and procedures of important governing bodies. Both are useful in setting the stage for analyzing the incentives and constraints facing athletes, teams, and sports governance bodies.</p>
