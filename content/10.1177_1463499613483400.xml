<abstract>
<p>Claims about social phenomena and experience of them, their scale and their quality – ‘great intimacy’ and ‘long distance’, affinity or alienation, Iron Curtains and Velvet Revolutions – are matters neither of unmediated sensation nor of symbolic construction alone. They merge qualic signs – bread’s saltiness, an eye’s luster – with histories and taxonomies, with bodily apprehensions of people and of geopolitics. Attention to examples linked to the Cold War help us theorize the social and semiotic processes by which people, especially those I call ‘phatic experts’, make social qualia. Insofar as their work involves competitive claims to modernity, we, as theorists, might in turn attend to the reverberations of such competitions within our own claims about social life.</p>

<sec id="sec1-1463499613483400" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>How do we sense the social? Anthropologists have skillfully explored ways people align sensations with social taxonomies: smells, tastes, and textures with class, nation, motherhood, and so on.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1463499613483400">1</xref></sup> But what of instances when people claim to detect, or behave as if they sense, basic principles of social affinity or alienation? How do they situate such claims? One lesson that Nancy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1463499613483400">Munn taught us in <italic>Fame of Gawa</italic> (1986)</xref> is that people formulate judgments about social values – e.g. ‘selfishness’ vs. ‘generosity’ – <italic>not only</italic> through structural oppositions (‘us’ vs. ‘them’), but <italic>also</italic> through affordances of sense data, which they project across multiple domains of social activity. ‘Shininess’, for example, could carry one far across the waves, to places and people that many Gawans never saw. Another lesson is that seemingly very specific qualia, along with any ‘feelings’ or ‘sensible capacities’ bundled with them, matter in the making of the ‘large scale’ relations as such, to that which we call ‘geopolitics’ or ‘world markets’ (<italic>From Russia with Love</italic> …).</p>
<p>To theorize processes whereby people claim to sense (and perhaps <italic>do</italic> come to feel) the social, the terms ‘qualia’ and ‘qualic signs’ will help us.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1463499613483400">2</xref></sup> Qualic signs can be words, gestures, images, demarcations of space, etc., by which people indicate what they perceive (or misrecognize) to be a material affordance or quality, here especially qualities considered to express the essence of relationship. By ‘the social’, I should specify that I mean those vectors of relation that people may or may not consider to extend to an endpoint: vectors that people characterize as ‘connection’ or ‘gap’.</p>
<p>I propose, <italic>pace</italic> Derrida, that absence is just as fantastically elaborated as presence, vacuum as touch. Habits of meta-social commentary may lead us to think of ‘contact’ as more readily expressed in terms of sensory qualia, but ‘gaps’, too, are never simple generic blanks. One problem is that we, as social theorists, can become accustomed to lump together quite varied gaps, real and metaphoric, and even confuse ourselves. In academic discussions, for instance, I sometimes hear people speak about a ‘gap’ between signifiers and signifieds (which misreads Saussure just a little) as if that image were identical to a ‘gap’ that we project between readers and texts, or ‘speakers’ and ‘hearers’. But they are not identical tropes (leaving aside realities). We only rarely give form and quality to that which constitutes what we name in terms of distance (but see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1463499613483400">Bauman and Briggs 1992</xref>).</p>
<p>To attend to qualia of social contacts <italic>and</italic> gaps means foregrounding what scholars have bracketed away as marginal: ‘para’ linguistic forms and phatic functions that attend to media (‘Hello? Is the line clear?’). Mediation itself, as it turns out, forms a key locus of attention in discourses about contact and its alleged failures. Where contact seems to fail, phatic attention is more frequent, frantic, or forcefully reflexive, even to grant material qualities to mediating semiosis as if this act would guarantee the qualities of human relationships themselves. But then, what are phatic communications for if not to perform relations (as Bateson reminded us)?</p>
<p>This is a practical possibility, I argue, because people meld the ‘sensible’ with the ‘emotional’, the ‘affective’, and the ‘sentimental’. People are prone to combine what analysts would divide: ‘sensation’ easily slips into ‘emotion’, then into the emotional capacity of persons, or even of some social entity or group. These slippery movements, as they concatenate over the seeming ground of sense data, lend their scalar productions, from diplomatic relations to intimate ones, a stubborn common sense (putting the obligatory ironic quotation marks around ‘From Russia with Love’, for instance).</p>
<p>Communications scholar John <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1463499613483400">Peters (1999)</xref> elegantly maintains that ‘modern’ European hopes and anxieties about social connection came to be what they are (intractably binary) through ways people projected experience with new, wireless media onto communication in other modalities. Thus, as people encountered new media, ‘lost letters, wrong numbers, dubious signals from the dead, downed wires, and missed deliveries have since come to describe the vexations of face-to-face converse as well. Communication as a person-to-person activity became thinkable only in the shadow of mediated communication. Mass communication came first’ (1999: 6). I find Peters’ provocation inspiring, rightly skeptical both of dreams for linguistic transparency and communitas as well as of nightmares of language as all disjuncture (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1463499613483400">Baudrillard 1988</xref>). His historical-institutional approach is amenable to anthropologists, who are situated to theorize, through ethnography, the means by which tropes for social connection and rupture become extended: within and across particular institutions, via particular techniques and media, under historical conditions that pose stakes for some people more than others, etc. I see, however, two knots to undo before proceeding. First, Peters, like many theorists, takes failure to connect as inherent, and the resulting lack as prime motivator in searches for connection (1999: 268). However, while infelicities are certainly ubiquitous, claims about communication gaps are no less subject to projection or distortion than those of ‘contact’. That people reflexively articulate failures is not enough to establish them as experiential ground.</p>
<p>Second, there is no single, universal experience of ‘downed wires’ or ‘tuning in’ to radio static. We need to do more to ground the specific social realities of media-induced ‘gaps’. Such experiences have been socially configured differently in different places: a person tuning a short-wave radio in mid-20th-century Perm went through a similar, but not identical, experience as did a person tuning in Omaha. Such experiences are embedded in relations that crisscross institutions that do things such as regulate wavelengths and content. This is why the ‘sensations’ of any gap can turn out to be very specific – and different from those of other ‘gaps’, whether they involve ‘new’ media or not. As numerous journalists, historians, humanist scholars and others have documented, Cold War containment, the global racial politics of cool jazz, the coolness of midcentury modern were not historically unrelated, but each indexed different modes of alienation. And each narrative genre painted its ‘chill’ with different materials. Moreover, ‘chill' and ‘warmth,' as we will see, along with other qualia that seem opposed, such as ‘luster’ and ‘dullness’, ‘laxity’ and ‘tautness’, can adhere alternately to both contacts as well as to gaps.</p>
<p>And so, rather than assuming we know what social contact or gaps are made of, this paper attends to people working in institutions who have concerned themselves with ‘feeling the social’, and contrasts their efforts across one of the ‘largest’ gaps of the 20th century: the Cold War. They work in places ranging across central to marginal institutions, and include people such as media engineers, police investigators, military intelligence, psychologists, science fiction writers, and theatrical practitioners, to name a few. In a Perm rehearsal hall or in a D.C. interrogation room, people engage overlapping but competing Cold War social ontologies to determine whether ‘gap’ has been breached or ‘contact’ made, across varying distances and scales (which they, in turn, create). In Moscow and Chicago, one can find acting teachers, business communication consultants, and surveillance experts developing ways to recognize (or create) qualia that indicate ‘contact’. I call these people here ‘phatic experts’.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-1463499613483400"><title>‘The gap’</title>
<p>I begin analysis with a text published by the daughter of American anthropologist Alfred Kroeber, science fiction novelist Ursula K. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1463499613483400">Le Guin. Her novel <italic>The Dispossessed</italic> (1975)</xref> opens on a desert moon at a wall built of stones that ring a spaceport. The spaceport channels a trickle of trade and mail between an anarcho-socialist colony and the capitalist mother planet. That distance poses a first gap. A lunar scientist, Shevek, is leaving, the first in centuries. He has been obsessing over mathematical solutions to gaps posed by space travel; this obsession is the reason he wants to communicate with capitalist strangers (who pose political and emotional gap). We flash back to his boyhood. At the ‘talking and listening learning group’ in his ‘children’s domicile’, he poses this puzzle: If one throws a stone at a tree, one can halve its trajectory at any point at ever smaller scales, to an infinity of micro distances … so, does the stone ever contact the tree? In his mind, he ‘sees’ that it does – he views the puzzle as a ‘joke’ to playfully undermine canonical principles in measurement and math. But his uncomprehending audience makes him regret trying to joke, and he earns reprobation for taking up too much time and attention (‘egoizing’) with an obscure point. Shevek learns to withdraw: this earns him a reputation for lacking collective spirit, for holding himself apart from the collective (still another gap).</p>
<p>Le Guin’s physicist is working through a variation of one of Zeno’s paradoxes, the ‘paradox of dichotomy’. Zeno (founder of Stoic philosophy in Athens c. 300 BC) posed such puzzles to expose what he saw to be conventions that set barriers to scientific enquiry. The paradox only arises in the conceit that we <italic>can</italic> divide space or time into points or segments, and then count them as real units. Zeno’s contention was <italic>not</italic> that stones never touch trees, but that the conventions of dividing space and time render an illusory understanding of movement and matter. (Ultimately, if he was right, such conventions indeed contributed to configurations of scientific method that deny sensation as evidence).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1463499613483400">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>Back to Le Guin’s science fiction: to the dismay of envious Lunar colleagues, scientists on the capitalist planet value the work of the rogue moon physicist. He has discovered something like a practical theory of singularity, which will innovate ways to communicate across inter-gallactic distances, without decades’ lag. He is famous there, but not at home; thus his decision to travel to the mother planet. Since the moon is run on anarchic principles, he does not need permission, but does face fierce collective disapproval: as he boards the vessel in the spaceport, a few aim real stones at him (which really do contact his skin across the stone wall, leaving it bruised: his first hard contact across a ‘gap’, as it were).</p>
<p>He lands on the mother planet, whose people are divided by markets and power politics. Once there, his skin learns the softness of silk, his eyes the greenness of leaves. He weeps in a shower under the heavy wetness of streaming, unrationed water. He hears the tinkle of coin and the crisp rustle of paper money. For back on the moon (the novel drawing imagery from mid-20th-century depictions of socialist states), his living quarters had always been spartan, the landscape monochrome: his one decorative possession an orange blanket that his best friend criticized as ‘excremental’.</p>
<p>Despite these new sensations of contact with new kinds of matter – and so many kinds – his sojourn on the home planet does not heal his incapacity to connect with others. Neither place is a utopia for him of full social contact, but here the proximity with so many new materials for sensation only compounds blocks to communication and increases his sense of distance and alienation from his hosts. Shevek, in his new social environment, stumbles against materials and words and faces that engage his senses in new concatenations. Through estranging encounters, he begins to pick out conflicting qualia – the stoniness of a gaze seems to cancel the softness of a dress. A surfeit of material sensation seems even to block and confound human ‘contact’. At a party, having for the first time drunk wine, and too much wine, something snaps when curious capitalists make small talk about his desert moon, and Shevek replies with uncharacteristic harshness:<disp-quote>
<p>No. It is not wonderful. It is an ugly world, not like this one … You Urrasti have enough. Enough air, enough rain, grass, oceans, food, music, buildings, factories, machines, books, clothes, history … Everything is beautiful here. Only not the faces. On Annarres nothing is beautiful, nothing but the faces. The other faces, the men and women. We have nothing but that, nothing but each other. Here you see the jewels, there you see the eyes … You are all in jail. Each alone, solitary, with a heap of what he owns. You live in prison, die in prison. It is all I can see in your eyes – the wall, the wall! (p. 274)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p><italic>The Dispossessed</italic> subverts other fictions created in the US that argued for the moral superiority of capitalism, echoing their structures but reversing their valence. At first, Shevek follows an arc similar to that traveled earlier by fictional characters, from Hollywood’s Ninotchkas to the Jazzman in <italic>Moscow on the Hudson</italic>, who leave the sensorium of one economic system for that of another. In two related films, <italic>Silk Stockings</italic> and <italic>Ninotchka</italic>, Soviet emissary Ninotchka is overwhelmed at first by the plenty and variety of material objects in the shops. For a while, she resists both decadent lures in shop windows and flirtations of the film’s hero. But unlike Shevek, when she finally opens her senses to the saturated blueness of velvet and the softness of silk stockings she also ‘opens’ her heart to the true colors of romantic love. By engaging the qualia of these materials, in their capitalist matrix of selection and exchange, she softens herself to allow real contact with others.</p>
<p>In both Le Guin’s fiction and in the Hollywood films, socialist worlds require sensory indifference. In both, the capitalist world overwhelms the travelers with sensory plenitude, dazzles them with the diverse qualities of things. In both, qualia associated with specific materials also signify something less tangible about intersubjective contact – thus blending ‘sense’ and ‘feeling’. In both, social-affective contacts that humans make with non-human matter<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1463499613483400">4</xref></sup> catalyze shifts in the nature of human–human contact. Where they differ is in <italic>how</italic> such contacts affect sociality: in one fiction, the sensory lack of socialism divides people from each other while capitalist plenitude lays the sensory ground for feelings of human connection. In the other, it is anarcho-socialist austerity that clears the air for true bonds, and capitalist qualitative excess that confuses and alienates. It is as if sensations of materials give body to social contacts in one and carve gaps in the other.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec3-1463499613483400"><title>Cold War projections</title>
<p>Soviet and socialist relations to luxury goods, or even to the sensual pleasures of ordinary objects, were much more complicated and interesting than any of these western fantasies depicts (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1463499613483400">Dunham 1976</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1463499613483400">Fehervary 2002</xref>). Be that as it may, in the United States, narratives about communist sentiment have always run closer to the <italic>Silk Stockings</italic> formula: material lack, and thus ostensive lack of vibrant sensation, neuters relations and emotions, creating only distance. Such tales were certainly most familiar. And we can identify them in texts that shaped political barriers during the Cold War, in the communications that led up to specific policies, such as ‘containment’, and that solidified pervasive metaphors, such as the ‘Iron Curtain’.</p>
<p>I turn now to a second text, George Kennan’s 1946 <italic>Long Telegram</italic>. In the <italic>Long Telegram</italic>, Kennan argued that it had become imperative to buttress ideological distances between Soviet/communist and American/capitalist worlds with firmer mental, political, and material barriers. This document, like others Kennan produced, layered qualia indexing seemingly small scales of sensation in ways that projected gaps at other, social and political scales.</p>
<p>In the ‘long telegram’, Kennan argued that Americans should not trust the Soviets. ‘The traditional and instinctive Russian sense of insecurity’ would never allow the US to penetrate their ‘oriental secrecy’. This had not always been his opinion. Kennan completed several diplomatic stints in Moscow, in the mid-1930s and again in the mid-1940s. Admirer of all things Russian, his earlier diaries and missives home poignantly emphasize the warmth of human contacts in Moscow, and the Russian capacity for sensation and emotion. What happened? Historian Frank <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1463499613483400">Costigliola (1997)</xref> explains by analyzing Kennan’s memoirs’ of 1930s parties at the US Embassy, replete with piles of salted caviar for all, towers of bubbly champagne for buoyant ballerinas. Exuberant post-party chatter with male colleagues pepper recollections; they gush about receiving enthusiastic, mustached kisses from Stalin. Costigliola tells us that Kennan ‘remembered 1933–34 as the high point of [his] life … in comradeship, in gaeity, in intensity of experience’ (1997: 1329):<disp-quote>
<p>Kennan’s involvement with Russia had the insistence of a physical need. He wrote of his ‘consuming curiosity to know it in the flesh,’ of his returning to Russia ‘like a thirsting man on a stream of clear water.’ He remembered, ‘I drink it all in, love it intensely, and feel myself for a time an inhabitant of that older Russia.’ (1997: 1329)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>But when Kennan returned after WWII, Moscow was a different world. The purges of the late 1930s and the cruelties of the war: it would be hard to imagine an embassy life that did feel more oppressive than it had before. Costigliola presses even further, to argue that ‘Stalin’s rule grated not just because it was so brutal, but because it excluded [Kennan] and separated him from the Soviet people’ (1997: 1329). Costigliola concludes that key US policy at the beginning of the Cold War (‘containment’) was motivated by diplomats such as Kennan who projected their own frustrations over barriers to intimate contact into imagery of a closed Soviet mentality.</p>
<p>Whether we agree with Costigliola about the cause – a diplomat feeling held back from and then jilted by his beloved Russia – the text of the <italic>Long Telegram</italic> and the correspondences leading up to it do transpose the qualia of everyday materiality and intimate sociality to other levels of the social, sounding out and even producing divisions at geopolitical scales. After the famines of the 1930s and the losses of the Second World War, Kennan simply could not return to the Moscow he had known: the war had annihilated tens of millions of people, foreign occupation had ravaged the cities, roads, and countryside. Shortages surely meant changes in embassy life: sheets might be scratchy, champagne and caviar pancakes replaced by vodka and bread. The giddy ballerinas had other work to do (or perhaps had never returned from refuge in Tashkent). If Muscovites were ever more anxious about foreigners, if sociality had lost its ease – how could this be surprising, given the conditions?</p>
<p>Perhaps, for Kennan, materials such as champagne, the qualia of bubbliness, were essential to his sensibility about how diplomatic commensality, social life in the upper echelons, is done.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1463499613483400">5</xref></sup> Whatever the particular sensibilities, material shifts had to alter the social sensorium; lack of qualia once associated with elite commensality might indeed threatened a shift in diplomatic habitus. Could it be that Kennan transposed the odors, colors, and textures of post-war devastation into qualic signs of social refusal? In a context of capitalist-socialist ideological competition, perhaps material contingencies (war depleting the supply of caviar) intersected the daily institutional workings of embassies (post-war rules against fraternizing) in ways that did more to create sensations of a ‘gap’ than did any actual Soviet person’s capacity or lack of capacity for human contact. If Kennan and his colleagues had once linked sensory qualia such as buoyancy, softness, saltiness with specific kinds of politicized social interactions (flirtations with ballerinas, power kisses with Stalin), it seems not such a leap to imagine that they could transform scratchiness into withheld affections, blandness into dourness or secrecy.</p>
<p>If so, note that as the diplomats blurred the qualia of material sensation with signs of emotional capacity, they created a ‘gap’ not from blank absence but from myriad presences, not of nothing but of many specific somethings. Based on this case, we might flesh out the axiom that any judgment that there ‘is no there there’ is just as pragmatically grounded in conditions and perspectives as anything else one might claim about social relations.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-1463499613483400"><title>Feeling ‘friend or foe?’</title>
<p>One of the most illuminating aspects of Nancy Munn’s ethnography of the qualia of fame is the way it situates social categories within networks and activities that extend beyond here-and-now on the island of Gawa: judgments and decisions at the most local scales of interaction interlock with speculation about future judgments of others, across the island and across the sea. Even imagined responses exert force on action. Taking this insight to heart, I introduce examples now from the other side of the former ‘Iron Curtain’. Awareness – and misrecognition – of how any other judges ‘us’ has its own consequences, even when those forms of awareness do not emerge at the scales defined by diplomatic meetings or military encounters.</p>
<p>The last sections showed how Cold War logics linked qualia to emotion and then to empathic capacity. Again, these are slippery logics. Nevertheless, they find traction not just in the United States but also on former Soviet territories. In Moscow, there is little escaping reminders of ‘foreign’ judgments, of international fascination with the Russian capacity ‘to feel’. These zigzag from one extreme to another, as claims of inscrutability give way to images of Russian love of suffering. On the one hand, Ninotchka. On the other, Orwell. Depictions of the Soviet state stifling Russian soul alternate with photos (possible faked: see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1463499613483400">Taubman 2003</xref>) of Krushchev at the UN in 1960 banging a shoe on the table.</p>
<p>Twenty-first-century Muscovites frequently register awareness both of Russian infamy as people who are ‘closed up’ and Russian fame for feeling more deeply, more collectively, more complexly than people elsewhere (Dostoevsky often comes up). These sliding logics poetically parallel those similarly oscillating images of Russia, one moment as mighty empire, and then the next as trod-upon subject of endless invasions. Russian Imperial and Soviet ideology both alternated between associating with the East and then with the West, with the powerful and then with the subaltern, caged within walls and then rolling over expanses, and so on. Other scholars may be better equipped to discover the causes; whatever they are, international discourses that evaluate Russian capacities for feeling echo such ideological alternations, and Russian people continue to engage with them as somehow resonant and ‘true’.</p>
<p>There is a refrain I have heard many, many times from visiting Americans. Upon first coming to Russia in 1988, as a student in a summer study tour, and decades later, as a professor guiding similar tours, I would hear: ‘Why don’t they smile?’ This question, ten times out of ten, would lead someone in the group to speculate: ‘Well, they lacked the freedom to smile’, or, ‘It’s because of Stalin’s cruelties’. My attempts to subvert such logic with comparative history – for instance, describing US corporate campaigns to create the service smile – generally failed to elicit uptake (except for once, in a student paper).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1463499613483400">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>Reports of such judgments weave through the press, and through ‘internal’ talk about Soviet feeling. For instance, during fieldwork in 2003 at the Russian State Theatrical Academy, I heard one of the acting teachers exhort his students to ‘go look at faces on the Metro, you will not see a smile – foreigners notice this all the time’. Indeed, student actors, learning to become phatic experts, spent many hours a day in exercises training them to ‘open up’ to other persons. One such exercise was called ‘Friend or foe?’ One student stands in the center of a circle, while the rest imagine themselves ‘as if’ they are a ‘friend’ or a ‘foe’. They are ‘not to display any sign’ to indicate friendship or enmity – as the instructor remarked, ‘in real life, such sentiments may be the very ones left unexpressed!’ The student in the center was to shake each hand and exchange only one word, ‘hello’. Based on that minimal phatic interaction (its qualia? that of its context?), she was to decide ‘friend or foe?’ and then to send ‘friends’ to one side of the room, ‘enemies’ to the other. The first student to try could not make up her mind and, flustered, sent all but two to the enemy line. And she guessed wrong: as she shot each one with an imaginary bullet, most declared, dropping to the floor, ‘How I had loved you!’ Watching her desperate indecision and misrecognition of foe over friend, one of the teachers, shaking with silent laughter, whispered to me: ‘Look at this – this paranoia is our Soviet, Stalinist mentality.’</p>
<p>In post-2000 Russia, such statements had long moved beyond the registers of dissident speech. Well before this moment, even before the 1990s, it had become common to say that Soviet-era modes of communicating chilled the space between souls, numbing abilities to open the self, preventing intersubjective connection and blocking compassion (on such claims see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1463499613483400">Lemon 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1463499613483400">2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1463499613483400">2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1463499613483400">Cohen 2010</xref>; see also Zigon 2011). Well before market changes had taken firm hold in the former Soviet Union, books addressing ways to detect lies, for instance, were already establishing themselves as a publication genre. Since early Soviet times, similar themes of detection through attention to material and behavioral details were common throughout representations of social interaction (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1463499613483400">Fitzpatrick 2005</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1463499613483400">7</xref></sup> Soviet-era press accounts of ‘Gypsies’, for instance, claimed that fortune-tellers really are just like psychologists or detectives: ‘good observers of facial expressions’. By the late 1990s, plenty of counter-claims pointed instead to the market, to postmodernism, or to Hollywood as forces draining the country of feeling, promoting deception, and blocking connection. While the attributed causes have varied over time, puzzles over how to open connection across veils and gaps persist, magnetically inviting participation: should we smile more? Tell the truth more? Learn better to read the signs?<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-1463499613483400">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>While watching that first game of ‘friend or foe’, I decided that I (and perhaps acting students anywhere) would probably fail just as badly. This is the reason why, when the teacher attributed the students’ failure to make contact to the paranoia of Stalinist times, his words struck me both as a very specific claim and also as a claim against which it would be difficult, not only in that situation, to argue. But how do such claims come to seem so self-evident? It might help to look more closely into how people isolate certain contact qualia over others as salient. The next section points to a few unexpected places where we might look.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-1463499613483400"><title>In the eyes?</title>
<p>There is no reason, aside from essentializing culturalism, to assume that people anchor ontologies about human motivation and feeling only to ‘deep’, ostensibly locally-made schema: phatic experts can and do come ‘from’ elsewhere, and can enter into conversations across all those gaps and borders that we define as national or linguistic. In Moscow, ‘foreign’ texts that propose ways to solve pressing practical and philosophical puzzles around discerning human connection from alienation exert a nervous attraction – nervous for reasons that will become clearer by the conclusion. But, regardless of whether Muscovites take a cosmopolitan or nativist position, they know Dale Carnegie from the Dalai Lama. Paul Ekman’s writing on lie-detection, an instance I will take up now, has been translated into Russian over several decades, in near entirety by the late 2000s, corresponding with the huge success there of the (dubbed) US television series based on his work, titled in English <italic>Lie to Me</italic>. I should caution the reader not to situate Ekman merely as a ‘new’ phenomenon in Russia (e.g. a reaction to neoliberalism, or to market changes, etc.): he first visited Russia in 1979, giving lectures at Leningrad State University.</p>
<p>For a 2009 interview in the nationally circulating newspaper <italic>Komsomol’skaja Pravda,</italic> a journalist asks Ekman: ‘To which basic signs do we need to pay attention, if we want to understand whether a person is lying or not?’ His answer (in fact <italic>passim</italic> throughout his works) quite sensibly advises us never to fix interpretation of emotion to one single ‘micro-expression’, and never to take a single emotion thus interpreted as revealing a lie: ‘The main thing is to find the contradictions. For instance … the word sounds right, but the facial expression or gesture does not correspond to the voice’ (Oksana Kal’nina, <italic>Komsomolskaya Pravda</italic>, 29 July 2009). As he elaborates elsewhere, the trick is to distinguish flashes of ‘real’ reactions from signs that ‘mask’ emotions.</p>
<p>First you have to learn to identify emotions, and then individual baselines. The first process is illustrated in these figures, reprinted and translated in <italic>Komsomol’skaja Pravda.</italic> Here you can see words and arrows imposed over a photograph of Tim Roth, the British actor who plays Ekman’s counterpart on the television show. Whether the photo – posed for by another phatic expert (a professional actor) who was asked to represent ‘fury’ – represents a ‘feeling’ or a learned technique of expression is a good question, but one we will have to leave aside for now. Dotted lines point to the material features or aspects (‘microexpressions’) that distinguish ‘fury’ or ‘rage’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1463499613483400">Figure 1</xref> <italic>gnev’</italic>) from ‘happiness’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1463499613483400">Figure 2</xref> <italic>schast’e</italic>):

</fig></p>
<p>Whenever I have discussed Ekman in Moscow with people who read his books, or watched the series there with friends and consultants, or searched Russophone internet threads that respond to his work, I have found little criticism of his methods, and found mostly approval and interest. This does not mean there is no criticism; however, I offer the following observations as my own, not theirs, and do so because I did observe people using Ekman’s qualia to make contrasting claims. I will turn to those claims soon to make a theoretical point.</p>
<p>In examining both the figures for <italic>gnev’</italic> (‘rage’) and <italic>schast’e</italic> (loosely, ‘happiness’), I have no problem matching texts with images. In <italic>gnev’</italic>, label #3 reads: <italic>rot zakryt, guby suzheny</italic> (‘mouth closed, lips pressed’). Label #2 reads <italic>blesk v glazax</italic> (‘[A] luster in the eyes’). Check, check: I do see lips touching in a way that could be named by a qualic word like <italic>suzheny</italic>. In the eyes, I do see a white spot and a sort of glaze (although which is the intended object is not clear to me) that I could agree to label <italic>blesk</italic>. But now the trouble begins: moving to the next picture, <italic>schast’e,</italic> I also notice a similar white spot and glaze. Yet <italic>blesk</italic> is not among the labels given here as relevant to discerning ‘happiness’. Why not? Why is it only salient to ‘rage’? Who decided that <italic>blesk</italic> binds with other qualia in the one emotion but not the other (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1463499613483400">Keane 2006</xref>)? So when would the appearance of <italic>blesk</italic> entail one of those ‘contradictions’ to which we are to become alert? Perhaps Ekman could provide an answer (maybe it would sound something like the ways linguists talk about free variation). Still, my strongest objection is yet to come.</p>
<p>I am able to pose it at all because of other, contrasting encounters in Moscow. For instance, between about 2002–2012 I have heard and seen phatic experts use the qualia ‘dullness’ <italic>rather</italic> than ‘luster’ to deduce and to index anger (and, moreover, to derive a refusal to connect, motivated by anger). I witnessed a teacher at the Theatrical Academy chastise a student this way: ‘You are angry, your eyes are dull, you don’t even want to hear what I am telling you.’ She complained to several of us present later about this interaction in bitter terms, though she confirmed that his ‘read’ was on the mark. Conversely, in a very different context, I have heard another sort of phatic expert (in that case, a psychic working for the police) use the very same qualic term as did the translators of Ekman – ‘<italic>blesk</italic> in the eyes’ – but not at all as a sign of angry, emotive reaction. In that case, <italic>blesk</italic> was a sign of phatic capacity (upon which I will soon elaborate). People in Moscow, at least, seem to rely on differing qualia to discern similar states, and similar qualia to label different ones.</p>
<p>Such differences in facial hermeneutics indicate that we may want to find out much more about how and why qualia such as ‘luster’ and ‘dullness’ shift meaning and value – not only across a single face, but also across contexts or over different media. Exploring the variety across claims (and, potentially, arguments about them) could help us to specify and to illuminate the political and social effects of the claims that, as we have seen, people make about contact qualia, about the emotional capacities of persons and of entire nations. Such work would speak to issues that Ekman’s schema – useful as they might be for certain goals – cannot address.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec6-1463499613483400"><title>The qualia of phatic capacity</title>
<p>I suggest ways to explore such issues by elaborating now on the moment when a psychic spoke about ‘luster in the eyes’. I had been invited, by the head of the agency where she worked, to speak to her about the job. As part of setting up another project, I had been meeting with celebrity psychics, with former and hopeful contestants for a television reality show titled <italic>Bitva Ekstrasensov</italic> (<italic>Battle of the Psychics</italic>). One of the main experts who appeared on the show, a man who claims to have been a key researcher on paranormal communication during Soviet times, insisted that I speak with this person, praising her as a strong psychic who had been helpful in recent years to police investigators.</p>
<p>When we met, she first attempted to tell me the age of my siblings, number of children, etc., but guessed at them incorrectly, which I acknowledged. She said that she sensed an obstruction, and I admitted to feeling guarded. She registered disappointment but qualified the failure in terms evoking those national, super-power barriers that I have been discussing above: ‘Maybe there is [a barrier] because this is the first time I’ve tried to read an American.’ She then began recounting her own biography (as she had been doing frequently for screen tests). After about an hour, as we were winding down, she paused, shifted to a quieter tone and switched footing, laminating a figure of herself, and of that figure’s semiotic emissions, into our talk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1463499613483400">Goffman 1979</xref>). She asked me: ‘Do I look like a psychic?’ I stuttered that I wasn’t sure what to look for. She replied quickly: ‘A penetrating gaze.’</p>
<p>‘Yes, you have that. What else?’</p>
<p>‘A luster to the eyes, like they’re shining.’</p>
<p>She used the same phrase printed in Ekman’s charts: ‘<italic>Blesk v glazax</italic>.’ Indeed, her dark eyes did seem to shine. So, too, her hair. She wore a luminous satin, red, sleeveless shirt with rhinestone epaulets, and long, dangling, very shiny silver earrings. Perhaps she, not unlike Gawa’s sailors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1463499613483400">Munn 1986</xref>), was maximizing material repetitions of value through qualic signs. In this, she was not unique among women in Moscow, where a glittery aesthetic has come to dominate an urban landscape that, until the 1990s, was dark after dusk. Moscow has become a landscape of neon lights and shining plate glass, burnished Mercedes and sequined platform shoes. Broader usages of qualia such as ‘luster’ in Russia <italic>may</italic> point to new power and wealth, to breaks with the past, but not always: Soviet entertainment, especially late Soviet films (and most especially those depicting the New Year) and variety shows featured tinselled and sequined decorations and costumes and dazzling light displays. I should also mention the ubiquitous references in Soviet era film and Russian literature to the dark, shining, piercing, mesmerizing gazes of people such as Gypsies (‘<italic>Ochi Chernye, ochi strastnye</italic> …’). Many are the references to the ‘Gypsy woman’ in Emil Lotianu’s 1979 film, <italic>The Camp Ascends to Heaven,</italic> who stops the Boyar’s charging horses by aiming her own bright gaze into their wild eyes.</p>
<p>Whether or not this psychic had all of this in mind when she uttered the phrase ‘luster in the eyes’, clearly she was pointing neither to rage nor to happiness. She wanted to evoke not a specific, temporally fleeting emotion, but an enduring capacity, a talent for feeling and knowing and influencing: something not unlike ‘emotional capacity’, something we might call ‘psychic capacity’. Psychic readers and healers in Russia have been expanding clientele since the 1990s; the government both credentials them and also attempts to legislate their advertising (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1463499613483400">Lindquist 2006)</xref>, the reality show mentioned above aligning with these efforts. To ask another to recognize a claim to ‘luster’ does not seem at all out of line with the kinds of advertising and publicity that people have been crafting to build livelihoods in ‘paranormal’ work, to garner respect as new kinds of professional phatic expert. Still, it seems interesting that, like Le Guin’s physicist Shevek, this Moscow psychic turned, for a moment, to a foreigner for recognition as a person who can solve puzzles about how contacts and gaps work.</p>
<sec id="sec7-1463499613483400"><title>Be the media: ‘Attention’ and qualia that oscillate</title>
<p>The psychic drew attention to contact qualia after ‘contact’ was threatened. Note that the threat arose as the interaction moved through a speech genre in which questions or statements could be rendered true or false, such that answers could contradict guesses. She and I characterized those contradictions not in terms of lies but of barriers, and she attributed the barrier in question to the difference between ‘Russian’ and ‘American’. Now for Ekman, and for others also thinking in forensic terms, mismatches of contact qualia and information align to index ‘lies’. Contradictions on the face can signal a ‘gap’ between real and pretended feelings, these in turn possibly revealing lies. To read a face is to learn to calibrate salient gaps: to learn to see relative ‘tightness’ and ‘luster’ as measures along poles. By measuring changes from polar extremes to baselines, we begin to separate ‘lies’ from ‘truth’. Now we have Zeno’s paradox again, as it were: we can now mistake the measure for the matter.</p>
<p>Plenty of us, people in Russia as in America, treat mismatches and contrasts, especially when multiple qualia seem to contrast, as triggers that something is wrong with contact. I will return to this common assumption, but right now I merely want to point out that to worry over qualic alignment is not the only way to go. Theater practitioners, for instance, <italic>aspire</italic> to <italic>highlight</italic> contrasts among qualia, for no other reason, they claim, than ‘because it is interesting’. We do not need to take their explanation at face value, and instead I merely remind the reader of the illustrious canon of artists and critics who have made this claim, from Meyerhold to Shklovsky to Brecht and beyond.</p>
<p>Training etudes at the Russian State Theatrical Academy fit right into this way of embracing contradiction in contact qualia. Consider this exercise, in which pairs of students each take a thread and stretch it between them. The main task: the thread must neither go limp – <italic>vjalo –</italic> nor become so strained and tight – <italic>zazhat –</italic> as to break as the students move together across the practice floor. Like ‘luster’ for psychics, these qualia seemed especially important to convey to students because of the ways they were distributed across fields of relevant practice. I heard ‘limpness’ and ‘tightness’ elaborated, for instance, across a number of performance-focused contexts to criticize bad work on stage. A director might query sharply: ‘Why so compressed? Get her to relax.’ Or ‘Why is she over-acting? A very limp beginning.’ (field notes, November 2002).</p>
<p>There is here a similarity to those qualities that Ekman isolates to qualify facial muscles around the eyes and mouth. For Ekman, however, each qualic extreme (limpness – tightness) is pinned to opposing emotions (happiness – rage), while for the students, each qualic extreme signals something else entirely. Ekman (like the psychic, we might note) focuses on the qualia of an organ that does its own sensing and reacting – the eyes. The acting students working with the thread do something similar, except that in the case of the thread, sensing and reacting has been extended from the body, proprioception (as Oliver Sacks has also taught us), extends through the medium, the thread, and back again. A related effect is that the qualia at either extreme (limpness – tightness), which seem to indicate a failure to maintain contact, also do more. Besides betraying a gap in communication, through contradiction, the extremes themselves are put into lively play, a play with the audiences’ attention and with the actors’ meta-attention to that of their audiences. This play with attention, ideally, produces a new level of relation.</p>
<p>‘Feel your partner, feel their every impulse … now try it with the string tied to a less sensitive part.’ Key in this lesson, what signifies, note, are not qualia exhuded at the points of contact or emission (sparkle in the eyes), but the <italic>qualia of a medium in oscillating contact/gap with its users</italic>. The qualia of the string, the new experts come to hope, are transposed into the qualia of the contact/gap that characterize actor-actor-audience relations, touching and not touching across prosceniums, breaking them and making them. The relative tautness and limpness of the string become indexical icons of ongoing rhythmic shifts in relations. The thread works as a medium, and it also demonstrates the shifting quality <italic>of</italic> contact/gap – those social vectors whose shifting is, in itself, ‘interesting’.</p>
<p>What is more, and this is key, the oscillation of qualia – for they can never reach perfect equilibrium – draws the attention not only of actors and observers to the actors’ relations but also <italic>to the attention</italic> of the actors to each other <italic>and</italic> to the material medium. The aim is less a perfect, final achievement of that ‘just right’ Goldilocks point, in between tautness and laxness, but rather the management of their oscillation that, like a good fight, will command concentration, perhaps even (at the extremes of avant garde work) shift frames of interaction. At the Theatrical Academy, ideal deployments of qualic signs engage multiple, overlapping ‘circles of attention’ (Stanislavski’s terminology).</p>
<p>Theatrical phatic experts, unlike their forensically or diplomatically focused counterparts, do not aim to reduce communication to information that can be contradicted, to questions that have answers. Staging and rehearsal never pair one reader against one opposing speaker, or one interrogator against one face. To be sure, the thread etude may join pairs, but each pair is positioned as but one vector of attention intersecting several others – including those who watch them watch. The students maintain ‘threads’ of contact across gaps between actors’ bodies as audiences of instructors and other observers watch them <italic>and</italic> the thread. The threads iconically index participant alignments while also focusing attention (of all the participants, but each differently) to the ongoing making and breaking of gap and contact. These circles of attention spin simultaneously, a moving mobile, each differently aware of others’ awareness, like a model of sub-atomic electrons and particles. To produce theatrically vivid work, acting students are supposed to learn to juggle scales and vectors of gaps <italic>and</italic> contacts.</p>
<p>The etude with the thread is an attempt to represent, or rather, to make available to reflexive practice, less the qualia of objects, emotions, or sense organs, but those attributed to social ‘contact’ and ‘gap’ themselves. The students have been told to pay attention to the qualia that result when one or the other of them (and it is not easy to say which) pays differential attention to this medium by which one might simply measure distance: in this case, a length of thread. But, as it turns out, it is mediating semiosis as a collective process of embodied attention that both delivers and is then granted qualia. That mediation is framed as the central circle of attention among others (a framing that can be slippery).</p>
<p>These theatrical pedagogues work sometimes, as with the thread, not to make mediating qualia more and more tangible but the opposite, to render increasingly intangible connections as imperceptible as possible, as if they did not exist (becoming more like ‘gaps’): ‘try with a less sensitive part.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-1463499613483400">9</xref></sup> Student actors learn, then, not just how to ‘express’ or ‘read’ feelings through qualia (as in Ekman’s charts), but to respond like ‘thinking’ material for mediation, to condition a <italic>reflexive</italic> habitus of contact/gap making. The whole point is less whether or not actors successfully touch across subjectivities or frames; to be sure, they may want to ‘make contact’ with other actors and the audience, but the shifts in intersubjective timespace that they really need to attend to require them to ‘do’ qualia differently. In a way, they too expose Zeno’s paradox. They are learning that ideal social vectors need not be unmediated or ‘direct’. To the contrary: one trains and trains and trains not just to feel a partner through – or despite – media, nor merely to feel the media, but to become the medium, whichever medium is at hand (in this case, a thread).</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="sec8-1463499613483400"><title>A few more threads</title>
<p>I can think of similar iconic-indexical manipulations of qualia outside the Theatrical Academies in Russia. Never hegemonic in Soviet times, these complex tropes emerged as alternatives whose authority and provenance waxed and waned, depending on when and how they intersected other authoritative registers. One example comes from Soviet-era stagings both of telepathy science and as well as of spectacular procedures to debunk it (both of which have become ever more popular, as in the reality show I mentioned above). Since the 1960s these drew from (and perhaps influenced) scientific, military, political, psychological and theatrical registers and genres. One documentary, shot by a team of Soviet filmmakers and researchers working through the 1970s with psychics and people claiming psychic powers (released in the 1980s as <italic>9 лет с экстрасенсами</italic>, ‘Nine Years with Extra-senses’), did just that. One section features Albert Ignatenko, who began demonstrating telepathy on Soviet stages in the 1960s, appearing alongside the great Wolf Messing (a foreign-born psychic who worked the provincial stages across the USSR, famous for using his earnings to donate a plane to the Soviet military during the Second World War). The section begins with shots of electronic equipment that measure and monitor sounds, electrical impulses, and heart rates. Multiple screens display peaking and falling threads of light. Observers line up behind a table with notebooks. All of this deploys across a wooden stage, the curtains pushed out of the way, but some of the documentary cameras still visible: this is science <italic>and</italic> this is theater.</p>
<p>Once the camera has established that the equipment and observers take positions at some distance from the research subjects, it closes in on the latter: a black-bearded man and his partner, a blond woman in a black robe. Eyes closed, she sways back and forth as the psychic passes his palms a few inches in front of her forehead, without touching. The narrator’s voice explains that the psychic is ‘tuning in to his partner’. Once done, he retreats behind a barrier, from which position he is to send numbers to his partner. A few minutes later, sitting backstage, the psychic, framed by a three-way make-up mirror, recounts the proceedings in terms of energy movements through the tendrils of the nervous system, thus scientifically accounting for the ‘need to tune in’.</p>
<p>Throughout the 8 minute clip, the visuals of electronic, oscillating threads on screens, the dialog about threads that need tuning, are echoed by mono-tonal background music – the sound of one, long, high-pitched drone, like a single violin string – or perhaps a Theremin.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-1463499613483400">10</xref></sup> Another drone note discordantly replaces the previous one, then again, higher and then lower, at erratic intervals. Here, too, the filmmakers align qualia that evoke relative tautness and looseness of thread-like materials (as if they manipulate the pitch of instrument strings), all the while foregrounding their oscillation – and while alternating a narrative of the ‘success’ and ‘failure’ of mental contact (‘he has said the correct number’, ‘incorrect’). Regardless of the outcome of the demonstration, alignments of attention sync gaps together via specific combinations of qualia. For these filmmakers, it is again as if something akin to Le Guin’s version of Zeno’s paradox troubles them, as they puzzle over how and whether ‘thought waves’ cross distance and time.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec9-1463499613483400"><title>Concluding thoughts</title>
<p>All of these examples, from perspectives marked out during the Cold War, partake in conversations that crossed geopolitical borders even as they reified them. As such, they engage formal tropes of rupture and suture that structure so many claims to modernity, claims that alternate between blaming the modern for the death of real human contact and looking to the modern to birth its new forms of transcendent unity. On the one hand is fear of the competitive, mechanical divisive forces of industry, or of alienated exchange, anxiety about the separating and individualizing technologies of bureaucracy and surveillance. On the other is optimism that new media will bridge old enmities, forge democratic bonds, even nurture the evolution of new human energies and affections.</p>
<p>Modernist novelists and playwrights, we know, devoted painstaking attention to moments when characters speak past each other, or fail to hear; such attention to ‘gaps’ serves generically to mark them as modernist (see, for instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1463499613483400">Williams 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1463499613483400">Levinas 1989</xref> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1463499613483400">1947</xref>]: 164; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1463499613483400">Peters 1999</xref>). It could well be that others repeated such configurations across fields of activity, building interdiscursive resonance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1463499613483400">Silverstein 2005</xref>), until ‘bridging the gap’ became a dominant way to configure and understand communication. In my view, it remains a matter of speculation, from which fields or in what registers the problem of ‘alienated communication’ began to be defined and elaborated. Historians of science might want to argue that, as scientists paid increasing attention to vectors of relation between molecules, atoms, sub-atomic particles – depicting gaps and bonds among them at ever smaller scales as they expand, quaver, and dissolve – observers of humans began also to depict each other in ways that created ‘gaps’ that replicated at ever smaller or ever larger scales. Shakespeare’s people used to misinterpret each other too, but Ibsen’s and Chekhov’s are no longer set apart by angels or fates, or even by market forces that tangle them into comedies of error (nor even just by accidental puns or double-meanings). Rather, they discovered themselves to be ever reducible, comprised of particles that never really touch across the gaps.</p>
<p>No matter how it started, the trouble remains for us, as social theorists, that we also take a version of Zeno’s paradox – one in which people can never really reach ‘contact’ with other people, or know that they have done so – as a cynical hedge, as safe ground, rather than as itself a formulation that presupposes methods and measures. But what if the social does feel like something, like many somethings? All the pain and angst associated with declarations of social alienation offer too many compensating pleasures for us not to investigate who produces them, when, for whom, and how. To be involved in projects that invent ‘gaps’ in order simultaneously to ‘make contact’, to force a rupture and then to try to suture it, may be a way to claim to <italic>make modernity</italic>. All the more so if oscillations among social qualia intensify surety that we have ascended to a higher, meta-level activity. Thus, even when demonstrations of phatic expertise index <italic>failure</italic> to connect, they afford a way to encompass Others’ claims to modernity.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-1463499613483400">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>From the perspective of Moscow, perhaps even more so than from the perspective of Washington or Detroit, the very <italic>topics</italic> of contact and gap, I suggest, afford ways to engage vexed suspicions over alleged Soviet incapacities for feeling and connection. Meanwhile, they simultaneously mitigate the danger that to engage the senses might entail descent into primitive passions. Working through social qualia offers ways to assert empathic capacity and reflexive modernity at the same time. Inhabitants of Moscow encounter, every day, material reminders <italic>both</italic> of failed modernity and victorious claims to it. In a region no stranger to infrastructural breakdown and material shortage, to cultivate knowledge about human ‘contact’ and ‘gap’ consistently offers a bulwark – if not against Western brands, things, and technologies, than at least against the arrogant spirit of <italic>‘Amerikan nou khau</italic>’ (know-how). From Bekhterev to Stanislavski, from pragmatics to cybernetics, this is the fame of Moskva.</p>
<p>Insofar as anxiety about and fascination with gaps in human communication involve projects that characterize competing claims to modernity, and insofar as attempts to nurture phatic experts (across prestigious scientific, diplomatic, and artistic institutions have historically served) to champion ‘local’ methods – as theorists, we might want to attend to the reverberations of such competitions within our own claims about social life.</p>

<fn id="fn2-1463499613483400"><label>2</label><p>This usage is inspired by Peirce’s distinction of qualisigns from sinsigns and legisigns, recognizing also his assertion that real signs usually combine modes. We might say that a qualic sign is a sinsign that points to someone’s idea of a qualisign. Note also that Peircean qualisigns need not be limited to abstractions from sensation (e.g. ‘redness’); in practice, as this paper argues, apparently general qualisigns such as ‘gap-ness’ (‘sanctified’, ‘democratic’) come to life with us through specific, sense-grounded qualic sinsigns. Should we distinguish ‘qualia’ from ‘qualic signs’? I suppose one could argue to use separate terms to signify relatively more or less formally elaborated or intentional semiotic processes, or more or less imminent affordances, but I also see reasons one might argue not to do so.</p></fn>

<fn id="fn5-1463499613483400"><label>5</label><p>It does not follow that deprivations alienated Soviets from each other – this is a question to be examined. Other sources suggest otherwise for later Soviet times (for instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1463499613483400">Pesmen 2000</xref>). Studies of commensality have demonstrated that people can judge it achieved with very little in the way of ritual victuals – in this writer’s experience in Russia, dividing one egg in an overnight train compartment can do the job. Lily Chumley notes (personal communication) that many people in China claim that poverty in the past created opportunities for commensality which later creature comforts and their pursuit eliminated.

<p><bold>Alaina Lemon</bold> is an Associate Professor in the Department of Anthropology at the University of Michigan.
