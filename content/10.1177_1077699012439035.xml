<p>Given the rising popularity of online video platforms in recent years, this study addresses the plausible cannibalization effect of online video platforms on television. It does so by examining the perceived substitutability between online video platforms and television. A national survey revealed differences between online video platforms and television in terms of consumer motivations for video content consumption. Non-users of online video platforms are also more likely than users of online video platforms to perceive online video platforms as a substitute for television.</p>

<body>
<p>As the Internet revolutionized and became part of the mainstream media, scholars have questioned whether this online medium has the power to cannibalize traditional offline media. Porter stated, “the Internet is widely assumed to be cannibalistic.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1077699012439035">1</xref></sup> Industry observers have suggested the battle traditional news is losing to online news is the result of such an effect.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1077699012439035">2</xref></sup> As broadband communications infrastructure matured and the Internet evolved into a viable video platform, many industry practitioners and researchers also began to wonder about the potential cannibalistic effect the Internet might have on television—and the possibility that the Internet, as a video outlet, would eventually replace television altogether.</p>
<p>In the United States, the migration of video content to the Internet by television networks and web proprietors actually took longer than industry experts had anticipated. As numerous industry reports have indicated, online video platforms—systems that utilize Internet streaming via computers that enable users to watch and distribute video content—seem to have finally entered a rapid stage of growth in the United States. A recent comScore report stated that in 2009, 81.4% of the total US Internet audience had watched online videos.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1077699012439035">3</xref></sup> During December 2008 alone, US Internet users watched approximately 14 billion online videos.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1077699012439035">4</xref></sup> As technical barriers such as bandwidth and speed are lowered and more people adopt online video platforms, the focus of the Internet’s cannibalistic effect is now turning to the relationship between television and the Internet as a video platform. This study addresses the plausible cannibalization effect of online video platforms on television by examining consumers’ perceived substitutability between online video platforms and television.</p>
<sec id="section1-1077699012439035">
<title>Perceived Substitutability and Uses and Gratifications</title>
<p>Whenever a new medium is introduced to the market, a debate over whether the new medium complements or substitutes for an older one is common. Some research on the issue assumes that audiences have finite time for media and non-media activities. This is based on a zero-sum relationship for the amount of time invested for each of the media.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1077699012439035">5</xref></sup> Thus, research based on that assumption expects that the addition of a new medium will encourage the audiences to spend less time on existing media or to disregard the new medium. Another body of research argues that a new medium displaces traditional media as long as the new medium is functionally similar to the traditional media. This group suggests that the key point in studies that investigate the relationship between a new medium and old medium is whether the new medium is functionally similar, functionally more desirable, or complementary to the old medium.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1077699012439035">6</xref></sup> In the same vein, to find out how a new medium changes the use of the existing one, Ferguson and Perse asserted that the first step in the process should be whether consumers perceive the new medium as substitutable for—or a functional alternative to—the existing one.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1077699012439035">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>In microeconomics, substitution is defined as consumers’ tendency to switch from one product to another that fulfills the same purpose.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-1077699012439035">8</xref></sup> In mass communication, uses and gratifications is a widely used theoretical framework for explaining adoption and use of a new medium.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-1077699012439035">9</xref></sup> Accordingly, this framework is often used to describe changes in a consumer’s traditional media consumption behavior in response to the emergence of new media.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-1077699012439035">10</xref></sup> The core assumption of uses and gratifications is that consumers are active rather than passive.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-1077699012439035">11</xref></sup> Uses and gratifications posits that people select and use a medium over others to gratify specific needs and purposes.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-1077699012439035">12</xref></sup> In general, new media are functionally better than traditional media in fulfilling a specific goal.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-1077699012439035">13</xref></sup> Hence, if new media fulfill goals similar to those of an older medium, the new media are more likely to become a substitute for the older medium. Applying a uses and gratifications perspective, Perse and Courtright found that cable television and VCRs can be viewed as substitutes for broadcast television in that cable television and VCRs gratify the relaxing entertainment need people seek from broadcast television.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-1077699012439035">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>Utilizing the uses and gratifications theory, previous studies identified pass(ing) time, relaxation, companionship, social interaction, habit, entertainment, information, arousal, and escape as motives behind television consumption.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-1077699012439035">15</xref></sup> Researchers consistently found that relaxation and entertainment are the primary motives for watching television. Pass time and information seeking are also motivations for watching television, but not as dominant as the relaxing entertainment motive.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-1077699012439035">16</xref></sup> Since the emergence of the Internet, there has been an array of research that examined the motives for using the Internet. Some of the motives for Internet use are similar to those for television use. They include information, entertainment, escape, and social interaction needs,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-1077699012439035">17</xref></sup> which are also the motivations for watching television.</p>
<p>These studies investigated motives for using television or the Internet, respectively, without a direct comparison between the two media. On the other hand, Ferguson and Perse did compare the Internet and television. They examined whether the web can be a functional alternative to television by investigating how television-related motives predict the use of the web. They concluded that the web may serve as a functional alternative to television because entertainment is a salient motive for visiting the web. Recreational activities on the web are predicted by entertainment, pass-time, and relaxation motives, which are also the primary motives of television use.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-1077699012439035">18</xref></sup> However, it is worth noting that the study did not find those motives effective in predicting other types of web activities, and that the salient motives for television use did not contribute to the amount of time spent on the web.</p>
<p>The Internet provides some of the same needs satisfaction that people seek from television. Nevertheless, it is difficult to say that the Internet is a complete substitute for television, because the extent to which the Internet gratifies these needs might be different from the extent to which television can satisfy them. Also, the inherent nature of the Internet might fulfill other unique consumer goals that television cannot fulfill. As a matter of fact, researchers argue that the Internet is not identical to television, although it might have some commonalities with television with respect to gratifications.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-1077699012439035">19</xref></sup> As a result, some studies specifically focused on substitutability between different modalities that deliver the same or similar type of content (e.g., print newspaper and online newspaper). Emphasizing the effects of different modality types, Vincent and Basil found that the surveillance motivation is the most common and reliable predictor when explaining the consumption of news across different modalities, namely, newspapers, news magazines, and television news. It dominated entertainment, escape, and boredom-relief motivations. Interestingly, their study also suggested that the motives behind news consumption differ according to modalities of news. The findings revealed that the entertainment motive is an important determinant, particularly for television news viewing.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-1077699012439035">20</xref></sup></p>
<p>By the same token, Flavian and Gurrea attempted to identify specific motives that affect the degree of perceived substitutability between online newspapers and traditional newspapers. They found that motivations commonly satisfied by both offline and online channels increase the level of perceived substitutability between digital and traditional newspapers. However, the discrepancy between online newspapers and traditional newspapers with respect to motives decreases the perceived substitutability. The findings indicated that the motivations of seeking current news and of habit positively affect the perceived substitutability between traditional newspapers and online newspapers. On the other hand, search for specific information, search for updated news, and entertainment motivation decrease the perceived substitutability between online newspapers and traditional print newspapers.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-1077699012439035">21</xref></sup></p>
<p>Witnessing the surging popularity of online video platforms, many television executives are pondering the best way to respond to the phenomenon. Little is known about the underlying and dynamic relationship between television and online video platforms from the consumer perspective. Although television and online video platforms are essentially similar in that both enable people to watch video content, the two platforms may differ in fulfilling specific needs of consumers. Therefore, this study is not designed simply to examine whether or not online video platforms can become a substitute for television. Rather, this study attempts to identify the specific underlying motivations for watching video content that increase or decrease the degree to which consumers perceive substitutability between online video platforms and television. Doing so will provide insights into the motivational differences between the two modalities, and into how online video platforms and television can establish points of differentiation or parity based on the discrepancy of the gratifications consumers seek from each platform. Accordingly, the following research questions are posited:</p>
<list id="list1-1077699012439035" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><bold>RQ1:</bold> What motivations do consumers have for watching video content?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><bold>RQ2:</bold> What specific motivations for watching video content affect consumers’ perceived substitutability between online video platforms and television?</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Although the number of online video platform users has increased rapidly over the past few years, some people are still reluctant to use online video platforms to watch video content. This hesitation to adopt and use Internet-based systems has been witnessed in various settings.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-1077699012439035">22</xref></sup> To better understand why certain people do not adopt or are reluctant to use online video platforms, this study also examines whether there are differences between users and non-users of online video platforms in two respects: user motivations for watching video content, and perceived substitutability between online video platforms and television. Thus:</p>

<title>Data Collection</title>
<p>Data were obtained through surveys after two pretests were conducted in order to ensure the validity and reliability of constructs measured with multiple items. Another objective was to check the flow and wording of questions in order to eliminate confusion or misunderstanding in the final mail survey. A total of 1,500 US adult Internet users were included in the main survey sample purchased from a mailing list brokerage firm randomly selected from 150 million adults nationwide who use the Internet regularly. The data were collected in 2009. A $1 bill was enclosed in the first mailing of the questionnaire as a token of appreciation. A follow-up mailing was conducted two weeks after the initial mailing, along with a questionnaire and a business reply envelope. A total of 504 responses were obtained out of 1,500 mailed surveys, and 388 responses were used for the analysis, after undeliverable addresses and nonresponses were removed. The response rates of the survey ranged from 25.9% to 29.6%. The contact rates ranged from 31.3% to 32.0%.</p>

<p>The term <italic>video content</italic> was defined as any type of content that is based on the combination of audio and video. Examples include television programs, music videos, movies, and YouTube clips. To measure motives for watching video content, twenty-five items were employed. Some items came from literature that focuses on television use and movie attendance. In addition, motives for Internet use were integrated with the set of measures to identify possible differences between television and online video platforms.

<title>Use of online video platforms</title>
<p>This study focuses on online video streaming via a computer. The definition of streaming was based on the widely accepted definition of streaming seen in most reference books. For the purpose of this study, watching video content through the Internet was specifically defined as “viewing video content on the computer through the Internet in real time.” Thus, watching video content through the Internet did not include: (1) viewing video content after the video content has been downloaded to computers, television, or portable devices capable of accessing the Internet and (2) watching video content on a mobile phone. The two conditions were excluded from the study because of other associated consumption factors that might complicate the aim of this study, such as mobility, computer hard drive capacity, and technical knowledge for downloading videos. The exact definition of online video streaming was provided to the respondents, who were then asked to indicate whether they use the Internet to watch video content in this context. There were two answer categories: yes and no. Respondents who chose yes were categorized as users of online video platforms.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1077699012439035">
<title>Perceived substitutability</title>
<p>Perceived substitutability between online video platforms and television was measured with five items adapted from Flavian and Gurrea.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn32-1077699012439035">32</xref></sup> The items include “the Internet and television offer content in the same way for watching video content,” “the Internet and television satisfy different needs for watching video content,” “the Internet and television offer different services for watching video content,” and so on. Respondents were asked to indicate their level of agreement with each of the statements on a 7-point scale (1 = <italic>strongly disagree</italic>, 7 = <italic>strongly agree</italic>). The measure was reliable (Cronbach’s α = .817, M = 2.898, SD = 1.093). The Cronbach’s alpha values surpassed the .70 criterion recommended for applied research.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn33-1077699012439035">33</xref></sup> The five items were averaged to create a summated scale.</p>

Of 388 respondents, 47.4% completed college. Another 27.1% and 23.2% hold graduate degrees and high school diplomas, respectively. Median income ranged from $60,000 to $79,999. Approximately 87.1% of respondents were non-Hispanic Caucasians. Another 4.5% and 2.8% were African Americans and Asians, respectively. In terms of media use, 57% of respondents said that they use the Internet to watch video content, whereas 43% said that they do not use the Internet for watching video content.</p>

<title>Statistical Analysis</title>
<p><bold>RQ1</bold> gauged consumers’ motivations for watching video content. An exploratory factor analysis was performed using all of the twenty-five question items that asked about motives behind video content consumption. Before the results of the factor analysis were interpreted, the adequacy of the data for the factor analysis was examined; namely, the Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin (KMO) measure of sampling adequacy and Bartlett’s test of sphericity were consulted. Then, we examined whether individual items have high loadings on motivations that the items are supposed to reflect and items were averaged to create composite motivation variables. To further identify the most salient and least salient motives for watching video content, a one-way repeated measures ANOVA was performed. Specifically, Bonferroni’s simultaneous 95% confidence intervals were consulted to jointly compare the mean scores of the motives for watching video content.</p>
<p><bold>RQ2</bold> asked what specific motivations behind video content consumption affect perceived substitutability between online video platforms and television. To answer the research question, multiple regression was used. The independent variables are different motives for video content consumption that resulted from the exploratory factor analysis. The dependent variable is perceived substitutability between online video platforms and television. Prior to reporting the results of the multiple regression, muliticollinearity among independent variables was evaluated. Variance Influence Factor (VIF) was checked for multicollinearity among the independent variables.</p>
<p><bold>RQ3</bold> and <bold>RQ4</bold> involve the differences between users’ and non-users’ motivations for watching video content and the perceived substitutability between online video platforms and television.

<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1077699012439035">Table 2</xref> shows that the exploratory factor analysis yielded six motives for watching video content: timely learning, relaxing entertainment, boredom relief, companionship, escape, and social interaction. The six factors explained 70.68% of the variance. The first factor contains seven items that generally describe the desire for learning new things/accessing information and its timing/immediacy (27.29% of the variance). This factor is referred to as a <italic>timely learning</italic> motivation for watching video content. The second factor contains six items that describe entertainment and relaxation as the reasons why people watch video content (16.76% of the variance).

<p>To find the most and least salient motives for watching video content, a one-way repeated measures ANOVA was performed. Bonferroni’s simultaneous 95% confidence intervals were used to jointly compare the mean scores of the different motives for watching video content. As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1077699012439035">Table 3</xref>, the results of the repeated measures ANOVA indicate that there are statistically significant mean differences between the motives for watching video content (<italic>F</italic> = 371.157, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001). Based on the ANOVA results, timely learning (M = 5.338, SD = 1.156) and relaxing entertainment (M = 5.298, SD = 1.058) are the most salient motives for why people watch video content. Boredom relief (M = 3.710, SD = 1.475) and social interaction (M = 3.855, SD = 1.645) are less salient. People are least likely to watch video content for companionship (M = 2.558, SD = 1.568) and escape (M = 2.692, SD = 1.650).</p>

<title>Perceived Substitutability</title>
<p><bold>RQ2</bold> addressed what specific motivations behind video content consumption affect consumers’ perception of substitutability between online video platforms and television. Ordinary least squares (OLS) regression was performed. There was no multicollinearity, as VIF ranged from 1.132 to 1.509. The suggested model was statistically significant in predicting perceived substitutability between online video platforms and television, <italic>F</italic> (6, 376) = 5.361, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01. The final model explained 6.4% of the variance in perceived substitutability.</p>
<p>The results of the regression indicated that both the timely learning motive and the relaxing entertainment motive are statistically significant in predicting the perceived substitutability. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1077699012439035">Table 4</xref> shows the results of the regression. Timely learning and relaxing entertainment motivations are negatively related to the level of perceived substitutability between online video platforms and television. The more consumers watch video content for timely learning, the less likely they are to think that online video platforms and television are substitutable (β = −.181, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01). The more consumers watch video content for relaxing entertainment, the less likely they are to think that online video platforms and television are substitutable (β = −140, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05). The results indicated discrepancies between online video platforms and television when it comes to satisfying the timely learning and relaxing entertainment gratifications. The other motives (i.e., boredom relief, companionship, escape, and social interaction) for watching video content did not have statistically significant effects on the perceived substitutability.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Most previous studies have attempted to assess the degree to which an emerging medium substitutes for traditional media by examining the time displacement effect<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn34-1077699012439035">34</xref></sup> or investigating the relationship between “perceived substitutability” and “intention” to use the new medium.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn35-1077699012439035">35</xref></sup> Little research has tested the cannibalistic effect of online video platforms on television. Thus, the current study focused on the consumer needs that each type of video platforms gratifies. It was designed to identify the specific motivations that affect the perceived substitutability between online video platforms and television.</p>
<p>The findings suggest that the timely learning motive differentiates television and online video platforms in terms of consumer gratifications. Users of online video platforms are more likely than non-users to watch video content for timely learning purposes. This is consistent with the results of previous studies, such as that of Papacharissi and Rubin, who found that the most salient motive for Internet use is seeking information.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn36-1077699012439035">36</xref></sup> Focusing on the perceived substitutability between traditional newspapers and online newspapers, Flavian and Gurrea also found that the “learning updated event information” motive negatively affects perceived substitutability between offline newspapers and online newspapers.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn37-1077699012439035">37</xref></sup> Considering the findings from both this study and prior studies, it seems that online video platforms are better than television at satisfying consumers’ learning motives in a timely manner.</p>
<p>The present study also emphasizes the fact that the two modalities’ respective abilities to satisfy the relaxing entertainment motive affects the level of perceived substitutability between online video platforms and television. Specifically, television might better fulfill consumers’ relaxation and entertainment needs than do online video platforms. The predominant motives for watching television have been relaxation and entertainment over the past decades.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn38-1077699012439035">38</xref></sup> Even though passing time and learning have been important motivations for watching television, they have not been as dominant as the relaxation and entertainment motives.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn39-1077699012439035">39</xref></sup> Prior studies found that the Internet does, like television, satisfy entertainment needs, along with escape and social interaction needs.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn40-1077699012439035">40</xref></sup> However, most studies have concluded that using the web is not as relaxing as watching television.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn41-1077699012439035">41</xref></sup> In recent years, online media have become a staple in most Americans’ lives. In fact, according to a survey report released by Aribtron and Edison Research,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn42-1077699012439035">42</xref></sup> the Internet has surpassed television to finally become the most essential medium for US consumers. That said, it appears that the two distribution channels are not equivalent in terms of their perceived ability to gratify video consumption needs. Specifically, consumers still tend to view television as a better medium than online video platforms for gratifying their relaxation and entertainment needs.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the comparison between users and non-users of online video platforms suggests that non-users are <italic>more</italic> likely than users to perceive online video platforms as a substitute for television. Television has been the dominant video platform for the past several decades, while online video platforms began to take off only in recent years, and have yet to be as widely utilized as television. Given that, it might be intuitive to expect that non-users of online video platforms are less likely to think that online video platforms are substitutes for television, but our results defy this expectation. It is possible that the lack of online video usage experience might have led to non-users’ “incomplete” perceived notion of the online video consumption experience. In other words, without ever actually watching video online, non-users are unable to identify the unique aspects of this consumption process. Consistent with this notion, users of online video platforms are more likely than non-users to have different expectations of television and online video platforms in terms of needs gratification.</p>
<p>The finding can be explained by two concepts—<italic>fundamental functional similarity</italic> and <italic>functional uniqueness</italic>. Online video platforms have <italic>fundamental functional similarity</italic> with television in that both deliver video content. Although <italic>fundamental functional similarity</italic> between a new video platform and an old video platform is a necessary condition to boost the likelihood to use the new video platform, this condition alone is not sufficient. <italic>Functional uniqueness</italic> of online video platforms compared with television contributes to increasing the likelihood of using the online video platforms. <italic>Functional uniqueness</italic> can be understood as features of the online video platforms that are better—or simply different from television—in terms of satisfying consumer needs. Unlike <italic>functional desirability</italic>, which emphasizes that a new medium has better or more desirable features than the old one,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn43-1077699012439035">43</xref></sup> <italic>functional uniqueness</italic> does not necessarily indicate the existence of a better or more desirable manner in which the new medium gratifies consumers’ needs. This is because the new video platform can gratify consumers’ needs in ways that are completely different from the old medium’s ways—and because the new medium can gratify new needs that the old medium could not.</p>
<p>It appears that users of online video platforms have already found the <italic>functional uniqueness</italic> of online video platforms. Therefore, they are less likely to think that online video platforms are substitutable for television. On the other hand, non-users of online video platforms perceive <italic>fundamental functional similarity</italic> between online video platforms and television. However, they did not see any functional uniqueness in online video platforms. That might explain why they do not use online video platforms. Online video platforms, as a newer medium, should first establish <italic>fundamental functional similarity</italic> with television in order to educate consumers about its role as a video platform. Following that, in order to attract more and more consumers and to convert non-users of online video platforms into users, creators of online video platforms should develop and establish further their <italic>functional uniqueness</italic>.</p>
<p>To reinforce <italic>functional uniqueness</italic> of online video platforms compared with television, the online video industry needs to focus on their platforms’ ability to satisfy consumers’ needs of learning efficiently. In other words, online video venues need to focus on acquiring content that provides consumers with opportunities to learn something new and with the latest news events. Timeliness and accessibility are critical for operators of online video platforms to draw more consumers to their venues. From the perspective of the television industry, it is important for television firms to respond to the changes in consumers’ motives for watching video content. Television has consistently been considered a medium that satisfies ritualistic orientation, such as passing time and habit.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn44-1077699012439035">44</xref></sup> The findings from this study perhaps provide an updated observation that, in today’s multimedia, multi-platform environment, consumers are more likely to watch video content for specific goals, such as seeking information, entertainment, and social interaction.</p>
<p>Regarding the motivations for watching video content in general, this study also found that timely learning is just as salient as relaxing entertainment. Timely learning is also the most salient motive for watching video content, with the highest mean score among users of online video platforms. This is a much different result than that of studies conducted during the era when television was the dominant video platform. In the context of television consumption, numerous earlier studies emphasized entertainment, relaxation, and habit as primary motives.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn45-1077699012439035">45</xref></sup> Today, consumers have more choices in terms of channels, types of video platforms, and content. Thus, their goal-oriented consumption and preferences for, or interests in, a particular video content type are likely to play more significant roles in the process of video consumption. The key to the success of the television industry with the rising use of online video platforms lies in balancing the different types of video platforms. In essence, the findings point to the importance of repurposing and leveraging video content across different types of video platforms, while keeping in mind the functional similarity and uniqueness of each type of video platform expected by consumers. This strategic balancing act is consistent with the game-theoretic spatial differentiated notion, which proposed that television firms should adopt a hybrid operation model (operating across different types of channels) to decrease the competitive intensities of the two channels.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn46-1077699012439035">46</xref></sup></p>
<p>Given the scarce research that has investigated substitutability between online video platforms and television, the current study provides insights into how consumers perceive old and new video platforms, and the difference in how each type of video platform functions. The use of the probability sample also enabled the researcher to move one step closer to generalizing the results of this study to Internet users in the United States. Nevertheless, it should be noted that the present study has limitations. This drew upon prior studies to identify the various motives for watching video content across different types of video platforms. The factor analysis yielded slightly different motivation constructs than those in prior studies that focus on a medium. For instance, some researchers have considered entertainment and relaxation motives to be separate motives. On the other hand, this study had one construct that combined both entertainment and relaxation needs for watching video content. When comparing this with previous studies, one should carefully consider how each study operationalized each motive for watching video content.</p>
<p>As a starting point, this study compares the general use of online video platforms to the general use of television without delving into content types consumed through each video platform. Dutta-Burgman argued that the consumption of a medium should be understood from the aspect of content along with both context and consumer characteristics,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn47-1077699012439035">47</xref></sup> because content can make a difference in the consumption of the medium.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn48-1077699012439035">48</xref></sup> One fruitful approach would be for future studies to address how video content genre preferences are related to the consumption of favorite genres through online video platforms and television. The multiplatform environment in the media industry resulted in the terms <italic>lean-forward</italic> and <italic>lean-back audiences</italic>. Future research can also examine whether some demographic variables, such as age, influence how different audiences perceive online video platforms and television, and why some audiences use or do not use online video platforms or television.</p>
