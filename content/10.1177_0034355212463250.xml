<p>This is a concise, informative video on the employment provisions of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) Amendments of 2008. It contains associated historical background, useful clarifications of major concepts, and sound recommendations on complying with the letter and the spirit of the legislation. The video is divided into two sections (approximately 25 min each) that can be presented separately or sequentially to a range of audiences, including apprehensive employers and students with minimal background on the ADA. The content is data-based and convincing. The narrator (and writer), who introduces himself simply as McMahon, is well known in the rehabilitation counseling profession, most recently for his research on outcomes of ADA-based allegations of discrimination in employment. At the end of the video, Brian McMahon divulges more fully who he is, to lend more credence to what he has presented in <italic>Facts Are Stubborn Things</italic>. He identifies himself as a longtime small-business owner (i.e., vocational rehabilitation consultant), who currently serves as a professor and researcher at Virginia Commonwealth University. The film does benefit from his smooth passing between the worlds of business and rehabilitation. Indeed, one of the film’s strengths is the interesting integration of information based on that dual experience and perspective. For example, he builds arguments by effectively weaving together diverse but relevant components from both fields, such as psychological constructs like “distressed identification” (as a reason for why disability issues often get ignored) and business objectives like “global benchmarks for the outcomes of disability initiatives.”</p>
<p>In Part I, “Employment and Disability for a New Century,” McMahon mentions many issues and arguments related to Title I (employment in the private sector) of the ADA. He summarizes the broad legislative intent of this remedial statute that prohibits discrimination and promotes equal opportunity. Among the many sage and succinct guidelines offered in the film, these core concepts are identified as crucial in shaping appropriate understanding of ADA’s principles and purpose: (a) “All personnel actions must be unrelated to the existence or consequences of disability” and (b) (in regard to a company’s personnel policy manual) “Everything in this book may be subject to reasonable accommodation.” McMahon paraphrases some statements from Title I of the 2008 Amendments that reversed changes, wrought by various judicial interpretations, that narrowed the definition of disability from that intended in the original ADA as ratified in 1990. Among the many pragmatic tidbits offered are several strategies from his list of best practices toward employment equity that have been implemented by 73 different firms.</p>
<p>“Litigation, Accommodation, and Innovation in Employing Persons With Disabilities” is the title of Part II. McMahon gives a few strong suggestions that, if adopted by an organization, will not only pave the way to company-wide compliance but will also serve to protect an employer if litigation arises. His commentary is eye-opening and motivating. He acknowledges that although many businesses comply with the requirements of ADA, few fully pursue its intent. A snapshot of businesses ranging from large corporations to mom and pop enterprises shows the sorry and steady facts of their low rate of employment of individuals with disabilities. Most notable in this part of the film are some rather startling statistics that are reported to debunk myths leading to the perception of ADA’s legal consequences as dire. For instance, in a recent year, among a workforce of 140 million employees, the “flood” of lawsuits alleging employment discrimination against persons with disabilities amounted to 1,400; moreover, only 50 of these went to trial, and the employer prevailed in 95% of the cases. Again in this part, we see the writer’s merging of elements from the social psychology of disability issues with the hard-edged economics of being in business. The video closes with a description of how “extreme environments produce innovation,” whether that be the technological spin-offs of the space program or how motivated individuals creatively manage disability in our society structured for able-bodied norms.</p>
<p>The style of the film is in the spirit of what has been advised by those rehabilitation professionals who have acquired expertise in partnering with the business community for the past few decades. Specifically, regarding working with employers, we think of recommendations for vocational rehabilitation specialists to (a) focus on the bottom-line demands of running a business (e.g., productivity; controlling personnel costs); (b) show personnel managers you appreciate <italic>their</italic> perspective on the issues, but also can allay their concerns (e.g., fears about unfavorable reactions of coworkers or customers to the appearance of employees with disabilities); (c) avoid emotional arguments; (d) be brief (there are eight subsections to the film that runs only 50 min, so no topic gets belabored). Also in keeping with the film’s business-like flavor, McMahon’s glib narration provides a confident presence and an authoritative tone. Overall, he makes the sometimes-dry information understandable and thought provoking. One minor caveat: for these reviewers who grew up in a relatively relaxed audiovisual era before today’s explosive electronic media, the speed with which the spoken and captioned information in the film was often delivered was a bit like watching a video game, or perhaps a squash match—from inside the court. However, for the nonsenior audiences who are the target for the film, we believe the blitzkrieg of “stubborn facts” in the form of bulleted points and pop-up phrases in fast flight will pose no problem at all. Therefore, we recommend this video without reservation for any audience who needs or wants to understand the basics of Title I of the ADA Amendments and how to apply the concepts to comply with the law. However, we have one strong recommendation. Because of the quantity and complexity of the briefly reported information, we believe that any showing of the film should be followed up with a debriefing and discussion session with an informed facilitator. Whether the audience is students or professionals, in rehabilitation or business, it is important for the facilitator to give the viewers opportunity to absorb the information and the advice on applying it in ways appropriate to their role and level of responsibility. Thanks to funding from a Medicaid Infrastructure Grant by the Office for Independence and Employment and Wisconsin Pathways to Independence Projects in the Wisconsin Department of Health Services, the film is available at no charge.</p>
