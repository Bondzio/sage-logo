<p>Sometime in the summer of 2010 I was in the process of soliciting chapters for a collection of ‘sociological self-portraits’ – autobiographical essays, if you will – of famous sociologists of religion. The very first person on my list was Peter Berger, arguably the most cited living sociologist of religion. It was with considerable trepidation that I wrote to Professor Berger (I was told that he prefers titles over ‘Dear Peter’). He kindly replied that, regrettably, he had to decline because he had just signed a contract for a book doing exactly what I suggested for an essay. It was probably the first and only time that I have been happy when someone declined an invitation. A year later I read <italic>Adventures of an Accidental Sociologist</italic> with great interest – and was not disappointed.</p>
<p>Peter Berger needs no introduction. Countless sociologists have read his <italic>Invitation to Sociology</italic> and <italic>The Social Construction of Reality</italic> (co-authored with Thomas Luckmann). For sociologists of religion, his book <italic>The Sacred Canopy</italic> is on the compulsory reading list with the likes of <italic>The Protestant Ethic</italic> and <italic>The Elementary Forms of Religious Life</italic>. Yet, Berger has never quite been in the ‘mainstream’ of sociology. It is the intersection between the personal and the professional that makes sociologists unique and in Berger’s case it is his often seething dislike of Marxism and any other ‘fashionable’ ism – feminism, environmentalism – associated with the ‘counterculture’ of the late 1960s that has characterized his sociology ever since. This – and Berger agrees – goes some way in explaining his marginal position. The somewhat stubborn, if not grumpy, image that Berger has cultivated in commentaries to anthologies discussing his work and in public lectures has perpetuated the image of him as probably the world’s best-selling sociological outsider. </p>
<p>In <italic>Adventures of an Accidental Sociologist</italic>, Berger traces his growth from the Austrian immigrant boy who wanted to learn about American society in the New School for Social Research to world-famous sociologist. He recounts the genesis of his main sociological works and collaborations with a wide variety of academic and non-academic institutions (including a stint as an adviser – and advocate – for the tobacco industry). In a true Weberian spirit, Berger wants to separate the sociologist from the theologian, but the book also includes quite a few interesting scenes from his involvement in theological debate. The tone is personal, but not too much so. Personal portraits of Berger’s closest associates (wife Brigitte, Thomas Luckmann and Richard Neuhaus, among others) feature, but the narrative remains mostly detached and professional, even when Berger is candid about his politics and ethics. </p>
<p>In a work looking back at a career spanning six decades, the question of intellectual legacy is bound to come up. Berger often denies having any, but the two explicit points he discusses are instructive. First, <italic>The Social Construction of Reality</italic> has been quoted by many as the inspiration for their sociological career. Berger has, however, consistently wanted nothing to do with what he in this book refers to as ‘constructivism’ and also rejects ‘postmodern’ theory. He claims he has never argued that there are no ‘facts’ (a common accusation levelled against ‘postmodern’ constructionism). Also – again – the appropriation of his constructionist/constructivist ideas by different ‘liberation movements’ (feminism, for example) seems to be an important reason for denouncing this legacy. Second, in the sociology of religion, Berger is of course famous for his first endorsement and then abandonment of the secularization thesis. Here he recounts the process towards this recantation, which started long before <italic>The Desecularization of the World</italic> – now often quoted as his definitive statement against secularization. As Berger has said several times, for the social scientist it is as much ‘fun’ when one’s theories are falsified as when they are verified. Whether one agrees with Berger’s recantation, there’s an important lesson here: Some of the most profound insights in sociology are products of error rather than triumph.</p>
<p>The least inspiring sections of the book deal with Berger’s love affair with capitalism which read as anachronistic and, at best, one-sided in the current economic climate. While Berger has always been open about his conservatism, it seems that his emphasis on ‘the weight of evidence’ is not applicable when it comes to discussion about economic models. He has been accused of ignoring questions of power and inequality (no doubt courtesy of his aversion to Marxism in all forms) in his social theory, and here he seems to apply the same indifference to global capitalism. There is little discussion of the human costs of capitalism despite ample available data and regardless of the early Berger’s manifesto about sociology’s mission to ‘help make society more humane’ (p. 76). Yet again – and against Berger’s avowed value-neutrality – this is an important example of how the ‘colonisation’ of the public and the professional by the private and ‘ideological’ is a factor in actual sociological practice. Weberian scientific detachment may work in some aspects of research (and this, of course, is contested), but Berger is living proof of how an ideological (pro-capitalism) stance affects both the questions asked and the questions ignored.   </p>
<p>Whether one agrees with Berger’s politics is not the important point, however. The true worth of the book is – as in all sociological autobiography – in illuminating how sociology is <italic>actually</italic> done. Method textbooks tell us how research <italic>should</italic> be done, but life is, obviously, more complex than the research process. The role of creativity, often ignored in fear of losing ‘objectivity’, can only be grasped by hearing or reading stories of how people actually went about <italic>doing</italic> sociology. In this sense, <italic>Adventures of an Accidental Sociologist</italic> may become a classic. The narrative is peppered with humour, and in presenting both the ups and downs of an academic career it often demonstrates the debunking nature of sociology in practice. The message is: Sociology can be serious business, but we should not take ourselves too seriously as sociologists.</p>
