<abstract>
<p>Various concerns and rationales have been the driving force for drug regulation in the United States. The Controlled Substances Act of 1970 (CSA) set up a comprehensive list of schedules and criteria that were intended to guide how all drugs were to be regulated, based on abuse liability and medical utility. This law was also supposed to eliminate the hodgepodge efforts of Congress in determining which drugs were legal to use and which ones were not, often based on utilitarian rationales. A comparative content analysis of the witness testimony at scheduling hearings, regarding two controlled substances, suggests that rationales for the scheduling of gammahydroxybutyric acid (GHB) typically were based on J. S. Mill’s “harm to others” utilitarian approach, whereas the scheduling of methylene-dioxy-methamphetamine (MDMA) was typically based on the utilitarian approach of legal paternalism.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Throughout the history of the United States, American society has been faced with a plethora of unforeseen repercussions from intoxicating substances. These consequences are not due solely to the substances’ effects on users but are also embedded within government action to regulate them. From George Washington strapping on a sword and riding with militia soldiers to combat the Whiskey Rebellion to former First Lady Nancy Reagan imploring people to “Just Say No,” the formulation of American drug policy has a long and rich history. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0022042612456014">Jenkins (1999)</xref> argues, “Over the last century and a half, America’s social problems have often been blamed on the devastating effects of some harmful substance or chemical” (p. 1). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0022042612456014">Zimring and Hawkins (1992)</xref> state, “Control of illicit drugs is the preeminent problem of criminal justice in the United States” (p. xi). It should not be a foregone conclusion, however, that all intoxicating substances should be regulated simply because they alter a person’s consciousness. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0022042612456014">MacCoun and Reuter (2001)</xref> note, “Some see the nation’s principal drug problem not as the drugs themselves but rather prohibition and its enforcement” (p. 1). In a day and age when drugs such as methadone and buprenorphine are prescribed to opiate addicts for maintenance of their addictions and multiple states within America have challenged the federal government’s absolute prohibition on marijuana, it is important to consider why different drugs should be made illegal and thoroughly document these justifications, particularly if MacCoun and Reuter’s analysis is correct and the solution is inevitably worse than the problem.</p>
<p>According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0022042612456014">MacCoun and Reuter (2001)</xref>, one of the most ubiquitous rationales for the prohibition of drugs is based on consequentialist arguments—typically depicted by the utilitarian tradition established by enlightenment thinkers such as Jeremy Bentham and John Stuart Mill. Utilitarian thinkers analyze the value of an action (or in the case of drugs, the substance itself) based on the benefit a drug contributes to society versus the harm it causes society. Perhaps most famous of utilitarian ideas is the “harm principle” developed by Mill. Another type of consequentialist argument is legal paternalism, which operates under the assumption a government should be allowed to pass legislation for the purpose of preventing individual citizens from harming themselves. A more detailed explanation of these rationales will be provided. After a discussion of these rationales is concluded, an overview of the historical development of federal drug laws will be provided. Of specific importance is the motivation behind the passage of these different drug laws.</p>
<p>The literature review will conclude with a discussion of the drugs gammahydroxybutyric acid (GHB) and methylene-dioxy-methamphetamine (MDMA); both of these drugs have been placed into Schedule I, the strictest class of regulation by the federal government. GHB, a drug with a relatively varied medical utility, has also developed a notorious reputation for its association with date rape. Due to this negative association, it seems like the rationales for placing the strictest prohibition on the drug would be indicative of the “harm to others” approach. MDMA, a drug known as an empathogen, showed early promise in the practice of psychiatry. Early studies seemed to indicate that certain patients who had issues with trusting their physicians and discussing their problems were no longer inhibited after ingesting MDMA. The drug’s ability to simultaneously inspire people to be more empathic and open became appealing to many recreational drug users and quickly led to a strong association with raves. Several instances were reported of young people under the influence of the drug, at these events, becoming extremely dehydrated. In a few cases, it was reported users suffered effects ranging from heat stroke to seizures and even death. Due to these negative associations, the rationales for placing the strictest prohibition on MDMA would arguably be indicative of legal paternalism.</p>

<title>The Harm Principle of Mill</title>
<p>John Stuart Mill did not believe people should be as free in their actions as they are in their opinions. He separated these two by arguing a person can have the opinion that an illegal or mischievous action is tenable. However, when a person acts on such an opinion, he often risks running afoul of the law. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0022042612456014">Mill (1859/1981)</xref> stated, “The liberty of the individual must be thus far limited; he must not make himself a nuisance to other people” (p. 197). Being a nuisance to others, or more importantly harming others, should be illegal. In the words of Mill though,
<disp-quote>
<p>But if he refrains from molesting others in what concerns them, and merely acts according to his own inclination and judgment in things which concern himself, the same reasons which show that opinion should be free, prove also that he should be allowed, without molestation, to carry his opinions into practice at his own cost. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0022042612456014">Mill, 1859/1981</xref>, p. 197)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Mill put a premium on individuality and the necessity of people being able to express themselves. He believed people’s freedom to express their individuality is crucial to maintaining any sense of liberty, and people acting as individuals were especially important because they challenged the status quo. Even when the status quo was just, it is important for people to challenge it to reaffirm its worth. Mill recognized the collective experience of human history was important and should be considered by all, but people should not be shackled by it. Nothing new is learned from maintaining the status quo, and even when it is harmful, we learn a great deal from new experience. Slaves to custom have no individuality, no liberty, and these nations become stagnant within the despotism of custom (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0022042612456014">Mill, 1859/1981</xref>).</p>
<p>Mill believed a member of society owed certain obligations to it. He did not go as far as to advocate a social contract but believed “each should be bound to observe a certain line of conduct towards the rest” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0022042612456014">Mill, 1859/1981</xref>, p. 200). However, Mill believed when a person’s actions or behavior did not harm others, he should be punished only by the opinion of others and not by the punitive power of the state. In cases where a person’s actions or behavior only harmed himself, “there should be perfect freedom, legal and social, to do the action and stand the consequences” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0022042612456014">Mill, 1859/1981</xref>, p. 201).</p>

<title>Legal Paternalism</title>
<p>Legal paternalism is a concept allowing the state to prevent its citizens from engaging in certain types of actions or behavior based on the belief these choices are harmful to those making them. While it is argued that the government often stands <italic>in loco parentis</italic> of its citizens, it is simultaneously emphasized that the government should not be extreme in its parenting methods. Indeed, if the citizens of a state are treated like children, they will often act accordingly. Keeping this in mind, many believe “to reject paternalism entirely, and deny that a person’s own good is ever a valid ground for coercion, we seem to fly in the face of both common sense and our long established customs and laws” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0022042612456014">Feinberg, 1971/1983</xref>, p. 3). For instance, the government does not allow a person to consent to murder, persons are not allowed to enter into contracts of slavery, and no one is allowed to enter a bigamous marriage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0022042612456014">Feinberg, 1971/1983</xref>).</p>
<p>One of the more prominent of those advocating some form of government sponsored paternalism is Joel Feinberg. He admittedly did not prescribe to any specific ideology, such as Mill’s advocacy of libertarianism. Rather, he sought to find a consistency of actions or behaviors that should be prohibited based on the government’s status of <italic>in loco parentis</italic> over its citizens. For example, Feinberg noted heroin is too dangerous for anyone to use. However, the government would be going too far if alcohol, cigarettes, and fried foods were banned. In his words, “The problem is to reconcile somehow our general repugnance for paternalism with the apparent necessity, or at least the reasonableness of paternalistic regulations” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0022042612456014">Feinberg, 1971/1983</xref>, p. 4).</p>
<p>Much of Feinberg’s argument in support of governmental paternalism is in refuting Mill’s doctrines. Feinberg did not separate between harm to others and harm to oneself. He believed so long as there is a potential harm to someone, the government has the authority to prevent it. According to Feinberg, one must consider whether a decision made by a person is either voluntary or involuntary. His definition is not limited to whether a person actually meant to engage in a certain action or behavior. It also includes whether people are able to appreciate the full consequences of the choices they make. In many instances, a person does not possess the full knowledge necessary to make a competent decision. Indeed, Feinberg noted most choices made by persons “fall somewhere in between the extremes of perfect voluntariness and complete involuntariness” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0022042612456014">Feinberg, 1971/1983</xref>, p. 7). Feinberg believed what should be considered is whether a person, in the words of Aristotle, made a “deliberate choice” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0022042612456014">Feinberg, 1971/1983</xref>).</p>

<title>Historical Motivations for Drug Controls</title>
<p>The first federal law affecting the regulation of drugs was the Pure Food and Drug Act passed in 1906. The passage of this law was largely targeted at the patent medicine industry. Many so-called patent medicines were often advertised as cure-alls for a variety of ailments. Among the ingredients included in such medicines were alcohol, opiates, cocaine, and cannabis. However, none of these substances were actually banned or controlled. Rather, makers of patent medicines were only required to list what substances were actually in their products. This law simply required truth in advertising. Many patent medicines had previously denied the existence of drugs in their products before the passage of the Pure Food and Drug Act. Often these “medicines” would have large amounts of opiates or cocaine as ingredients. Due to the subsequent collapse of the patent medicine industry, it seems clear most people would not have used these “medicines” had they known what was in them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0022042612456014">Friedman, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0022042612456014">Gahlinger, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0022042612456014">Musto, 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>The first law passed by Congress that actually prohibited the use of a drug was the Smoking Opium Exclusion Act in 1909. Although one might guess such a law was passed for the purpose of banning a certain behavior, the law was passed for more complex reasons. The United States, at that time, was trying to make inroads into the vast Chinese market for trade purposes. Furthermore, many within the United States were calling for an end to the global opium trade and had successfully lobbied for international conferences to be held on this issue and drug trafficking generally.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0022042612456014">1</xref></sup> Advocates of this global policy change believed the United States would be perceived as disingenuous if the United States called for international prohibitions without actually having any laws prohibiting any drug use within the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0022042612456014">Musto, 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>In what would become a recurrent theme in later drug controls (to varying degrees), the Smoking Opium Exclusion Act was passed due to racist attitudes of the day. In this case, the law was primarily passed based on anti-Chinese sentiments within the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0022042612456014">Booth, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0022042612456014">Gahlinger, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0022042612456014">Musto, 1999</xref>). Although smoking opium is harmful, it is not as harmful as injecting opium and was not as widespread at the turn of the 20th century. Anti-Chinese attitudes within the United States had already led to reductions in Chinese immigration. This combined with state controls on opium had already resulted in a reduction in the proliferation of opium dens in which the main attraction was fraternization through the smoking of opium. Furthermore, tales of White women visiting opium dens to engage in drug use and sexual relations with Chinese men routinely circulated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0022042612456014">Booth, 1996</xref>). Such views made the passage of the Act much easier than combating opium use as a whole within the United States. This is especially true considering smokable opium use among Whites was usually confined to elite populations who would often escape the arm of law enforcement based on their privileged status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0022042612456014">Booth, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0022042612456014">Gahlinger, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>In 1914, the Harrison Narcotic Act was passed by Congress, although it did not officially become law until 1915. Largely intended as a record-keeping law, this law became the foundation through which federal and state governments could track the sales of opiates and cocaine. This was useful so both substances could eventually be prohibited for nonmedical use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0022042612456014">Courtwright, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0022042612456014">Gahlinger, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0022042612456014">Musto, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0022042612456014">Spillane, 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0022042612456014">2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0022042612456014">Spillane &amp; McAllister, 2003</xref>). The two drugs that primarily precipitated the passage of the act were cocaine and heroin. Cocaine, originally hailed as a wonder drug,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0022042612456014">2</xref></sup> quickly degenerated into being known as a drug of abuse. Such a reputation was due to the potential for cocaine abuse (through overdose and addiction), the construction of the “cocaine fiend,”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0022042612456014">3</xref></sup> and its association as being abused by Blacks in the American South (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0022042612456014">Courtwright, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0022042612456014">Gahlinger, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0022042612456014">Musto, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0022042612456014">Spillane, 2000</xref>). Heroin, a combination of morphine and acetic acid, was originally developed with the hope it would be less addictive than morphine. Commercial production began in 1898, and it was quickly apparent heroin had a higher addiction potential than morphine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0022042612456014">Gahlinger, 2004</xref>). Heroin addiction spread among American cities, and it was noted many of the people who were addicted began using it in their teenage years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0022042612456014">Courtwright, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0022042612456014">Musto, 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>Marijuana was originally intended to be listed in the Harrison Narcotic Act as well, but objections to its inclusion and the desire to quickly pass the law led to its omission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0022042612456014">Gahlinger, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0022042612456014">Musto, 1999</xref>). However, in 1937 the Marihuana Tax Act effectively made marijuana illegal for recreational purposes. This law required a stamp to be purchased to show a person had paid the taxation for purchasing marijuana. Notwithstanding the high price of the tax, stamps were rarely printed, and as a result, marijuana was essentially made illegal as only a few people could obtain documentation to prove they have obtained marijuana obtained legally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0022042612456014">Gahlinger, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0022042612456014">Goode, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Marijuana had become synonymous with Mexican immigrants to the United States, since certain members of that population had brought the drug with them and racist attitudes of the day among certain segments of the American population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0022042612456014">Bonnie &amp; Whitebread, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0022042612456014">Courtwright, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0022042612456014">Gahlinger, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0022042612456014">Musto, 1999</xref>). In addition to those associations was the work of Harry Anslinger, at that time the head of the Federal Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0022042612456014">4</xref></sup> Anslinger spun fantastic tales to the American public outlining the many societal problems he believed were caused by marijuana use<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0022042612456014">5</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0022042612456014">Becker, 1963</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0022042612456014">Bonnie &amp; Whitebread, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0022042612456014">Brownlee, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0022042612456014">Carroll, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0022042612456014">Courtwright, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0022042612456014">Gahlinger, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0022042612456014">Goode, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0022042612456014">Musto, 1999</xref>). Among his more famous quotes was “How many murders, suicides, robberies and maniacal deeds it causes each year, especially among the young, can only be conjectured” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0022042612456014">Anslinger &amp; Cooper, 1937</xref>, p. 150).</p>
<p>In 1965, Congress passed the Drug Abuse Control Amendments to the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act of 1938.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0022042612456014">6</xref></sup> These amendments prohibited depressant, stimulant, and hallucinogenic substances, primarily as a reaction to the social turmoil and perceived rampant recreational drug use of the 1960s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0022042612456014">Gahlinger, 2004</xref>). The Controlled Substances Act (CSA) was enacted as Title II of the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970. The CSA replaced all previous laws that placed restrictions on controlled substances. Furthermore, the framework within the CSA applied to all controlled substances that would be regulated in the future. As designed, the CSA sought to evaluate individual controlled substances based on abuse potential, safety, and medical utility. The act divides all controlled substances into five categories, or as they are known within the act schedules, based on the previously mentioned criteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0022042612456014">Spillane, 2004</xref>). The passage of the CSA could be viewed as a move away from strictly consequentialist and deontological arguments for drug control to a medical utility model; however, two drugs serve as examples that previous theories and rationales for drug control were not completely abandoned.</p>

<title>MDMA</title>
<p>In 1912, the drug MDMA was first synthesized by the German pharmaceutical company Merck (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0022042612456014">Beck &amp; Rosenbaum, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0022042612456014">Eisner, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0022042612456014">Gahlinger, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0022042612456014">Holland, 2001a</xref>). It was originally hoped MDMA would be effective as an appetite suppressant; however, animal tests were not promising (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0022042612456014">Gahlinger, 2004</xref>). The drug was essentially forgotten until a brief period of 1953 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0022042612456014">Eisner, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0022042612456014">Gahlinger, 2004</xref>). The U.S. Army Office of Strategic Services was conducting its infamous Project MK-Ultra, which consisted of the testing of psychoactive drugs as “non-conventional agents” for use in warfare and interrogation. The army found MDMA was of little use for them in this regard. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0022042612456014">Gahlinger, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Dr. Alexander T. Shulgin, a biochemist, is often credited with bringing MDMA to collective attention. While working for Dow Chemical, he synthesized the drug in 1965. Shulgin was fascinated by psychoactive substances and studied hundreds of them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0022042612456014">Gahlinger, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0022042612456014">Holland, 2001a</xref>). However, his interest in these substances was not merely professional or intellectual. He first used mescaline sulphate in the 1960s. This exploration led him to an “ever-changing quest of curiosity” that fueled his desire to discover and explore these substances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0022042612456014">Eisner, 1994</xref>, p. 2). After studying MDMA, he recounted in a 1978 scientific article the substance often caused even timid persons to open up socially. Based on these findings, he recommended psychiatrists and psychotherapists administer MDMA to their patients. Some therapists found the drug especially useful in marriage counseling. They discovered couples were more likely to share their problems while they were under the influence of the drug and were able to achieve greater levels of insight as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0022042612456014">Shulgin &amp; Nichols, 1978</xref>). Other possible medical uses of MDMA that have been studied are the treatment of posttraumatic stress, depression, and schizophrenia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0022042612456014">Bouso, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0022042612456014">Holland, 2001b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0022042612456014">Riedlinger &amp; Montagne, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>Despite the potential benefits of MDMA, like most illegal or highly regulated drugs, people started to use MDMA recreationally. Some refer to MDMA as a “club drug” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0022042612456014">Drug Enforcement Administration [DEA], 2001</xref>, p. 1). It is no secret people throughout the years have used drugs, other than alcohol, at nightclubs. Studio 54 was as synonymous with disco as it was with cocaine use. Among those who attended nightclubs, or all-night dance parties known as raves,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0022042612456014">7</xref></sup> a new crop of drugs are often consumed. As mentioned previously, MDMA is known to reduce inhibitions and increase empathy toward others. The desire to feel these effects are similar to the rationale for the consumption of alcohol at any drinking establishment. However, use of MDMA also tends to suppress the need to eat, drink, or sleep. People at nightclubs or raves under the influence of MDMA have been known to dance for hours at a time. In some cases, this has led to severe dehydration and symptoms that mimic a heat stroke. In a small number of cases, people have died after their body went into shock (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0022042612456014">DEA, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>Separate from incidents at nightclubs or raves is the fear that use of MDMA might cause permanent brain damage. In studies conducted on rodents and primates, it was observed repeated use of MDMA damaged nerve cells requiring serotonin as a neurotransmitter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0022042612456014">Barnes, 1988</xref>). Critics of these studies have pointed out the doses of MDMA given to lab rats are typically 10 times that of a dose a human would ingest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0022042612456014">Eisner, 1994</xref>). In addition, few studies on the long-term effects of MDMA have been conducted on humans. Furthermore, none of these human studies have been conducted in a controlled scientific manner. In cases where death occurred, few cases have used toxicological studies to determine whether the death can only be attributed to MDMA. Indeed, many of the persons who have died used MDMA as well as other substances. In other cases, the MDMA the person ingested was not pure. Much like other drugs, MDMA is often combined with other substances before it is sold to customers. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0022042612456014">Henry and Rella (2001)</xref>, these cases “do not represent much more than collective anecdotal experience” (pp. 71-72). In one instance, a study reported the administration of MDMA to laboratory animals caused dopamine neurotoxicity. It was later discovered the animals had actually been administered methamphetamine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0022042612456014">Ricaurte, Yuan, Hatzidimitriou, Cord, &amp; McCann, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>On July 27, 1984, after a year of study while collaborating with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the DEA announced it intended to place MDMA under Schedule I classification of the CSA of 1970. Hearings were conducted in Washington, D.C., Kansas City, and Los Angeles to determine whether listing MDMA as a Schedule I substance was warranted.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0022042612456014">8</xref></sup> On July 1, 1985, MDMA was officially listed as a Schedule I substance. However, in 1986, the administrative law judge for the DEA published a 90-page decision, which recommended MDMA be listed as a Schedule III substance. In September 1987, the First District Court of Appeals vacated the DEA’s decision to list MDMA as a Schedule I substance ruling the DEA had failed to properly consider the potential medical use of MDMA. However, the DEA is only required to reconsider their decision administratively. On March 23, 1988, MDMA was again listed as a Schedule I substance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0022042612456014">Eisner, 1994</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0022042612456014">9</xref></sup></p>

<title>GHB</title>
<p>GHB was first synthesized in 1960. Dr. Henri Laborit, a researcher seeking a better anesthetic, developed the drug based on gammaaminobutyric acid (GABA), which is a major inhibitor of the central nervous system. Initially, GHB proved promising as an anesthetic. It is taken orally and rapidly put patients into a deep coma. However, GHB did not prevent pain, and at the dosage required to put a person into a coma, the drug seemed to cause neurological problems in some patients. Although GHB was no longer used as an anesthetic in surgeries, it became popular in Europe as a nonaddictive sleeping aid, and purchasing the substance did not require a doctor’s prescription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0022042612456014">Gahlinger, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0022042612456014">Nicholson &amp; Balster, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>In the United States, GHB first became popular among body builders in the 1980s. It was sold as a nutritional supplement in health clubs and stores. Those selling GHB claimed it stimulated the brain’s production of growth hormones which in turn aided in building muscle and reducing body fat. Certain laboratory and clinical studies appear to buttress these claims (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0022042612456014">Gahlinger, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0022042612456014">Nicholson &amp; Balster, 2001</xref>). According to some, GHB is an excellent sleep-inducing agent. It increases rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and lowers the body temperature, allowing a person to practically enter a state of hibernation. Unlike other substances, those who use GHB wake up quickly and have no hangover (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0022042612456014">Dean, Morgenthaler, &amp; Fowkes, 1993</xref>).</p>
<p>Much like MDMA, GHB is often labeled as a “club drug” because it is commonly used at raves. Users report feelings of euphoria and intoxication. Some consider it an aphrodisiac. Low dosages of GHB have been known to cause drowsiness, dizziness, nausea, and visual disturbances. Persons ingesting high dosages of GHB have been known to suffer unconsciousness, seizures, and severe respiratory depression, and some have slipped into comas. Low dosages of GHB combined with alcohol can result in effects similar to that of higher dosages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0022042612456014">DEA, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0022042612456014">Gahlinger, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0022042612456014">Jenkins, 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>On November 8, 1990, the FDA officially warned consumers against the use of GHB. It was then categorized as a Schedule III substance. However, along with being known as a “club drug,” GHB belongs to a category of substances known as “date rape” drugs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0022042612456014">Gahlinger, 2004</xref>, p. 287). Realizing GHB at higher doses can cause loss of consciousness or memory loss; predators have given the drug to women as an aid to committing sexual assault. After several well-publicized occurrences, many lobbied GHB be moved from Schedule III to Schedule I. On February 18, 2000, President William J. Clinton signed the Hillory J. Farias and Samantha Reid Date-Rape Prohibition Act of 2000, named for two teenage girls who died after unknowingly ingesting GHB. This law changed the status of GHB to Schedule I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0022042612456014">DEA, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>Despite the placement of GHB into Schedule I, there are still several recognized medical applications for the drug. It is still used in Europe as a general anesthetic, a sleeping aid, and as an anxiety and stress reliever. Some have used it to combat alcohol or opiate withdrawal. In France and Italy, it is administered to women during childbirth. It is used for its ability to calm expectant mothers and to accelerate the dilation of the cervix. In 2002, the FDA approved the administering of GHB as a treatment for those who suffer from narcolepsy. However, to ensure GHB remained unavailable to recreational users, a prescription form of the drug was named sodium oxybate and listed as a Schedule III substance. It is sold under the trade name Xyrem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0022042612456014">Gahlinger, 2004</xref>).</p>

<title>Method</title>
<p>The first hypothesis is documented justifications for making MDMA a Schedule I Controlled Substance will tend to utilize a “legal paternalism approach.” This hypothesis is based on the primary concern that MDMA use will lead to deterioration of brain function and possible injury or death when taken at raves. Thus, the primary concern is protecting people from harming themselves. The second hypothesis is the majority of documented justifications for making GHB a Schedule I Controlled Substance will tend to utilize a “harm to others approach,” although we should still expect to see some amount of legal paternalism theory arguments as well. This hypothesis is based on the drug GHB having a reputation as a date-rape drug. Thus, the primary concern is preventing potential predators from using GHB to harm another person.</p>
<p>In constructing a research design, the methodological approach of content analysis was used. Both prohibited substances at issue were made illegal by the DEA. GHB, originally classified in Schedule IV by the DEA, was classified in Schedule I by Congressional legislation. Indeed, in the case of GHB, a special law was made giving it such a status. Bills before Congress are typically debated before the public. In many instances, Congress will request citizens with specialized knowledge to testify as an addition to the individual member’s own statements. For the purposes of this study, a record of these proceedings was obtained and analyzed. The DEA uses a similar procedure in classifying drugs. The agency schedules hearings to consider the nature of an illegal substance, and the DEA director categorizes a proposed illegal substance into a Schedule based on those hearings, such as it did with MDMA.</p>
<p>Each person’s statements were analyzed, and the number of statements indicating either a “legal paternalism” or a “harm to others” justification was recorded. A statement was generally the same as a sentence. However, in certain cases, sentences had breaks within them such as lists or differentiation by number, which necessitated they be broken down further so fewer statements would end up being classified as mixed. These statements were the units of analysis. The statements were then added together. A statement espousing a “harm to others” approach was given a score of positive one for each statement, and each statement espousing “legal paternalism” was given a score of negative one. Using this procedure, it was expected that a set of statements primarily espousing a “harm to others” perspective would have a high positive number trending well above zero and a set of statements primarily espousing a paternalistic perspective would have a negative number trending well below zero. A set of statements that used both justifications should trend toward zero because the mixed set of justifications should cancel each other out. A statement coded as “harm to others” typically involved some mention of date rape or other situation where one person’s use of either substance either directly harmed another person or there was the immediate anticipation of harm. A statement coded as paternalistic typically involved instances or arguments that indicated a person either had harmed themselves or were likely to harm themselves through the use of either substance. A mixed statement contained elements of both and was not able to be separated, as mentioned previously.</p>
<p>Although some means could be used for averaging the collective ratings of all the speakers, there had to be some indication of what the individual ratings were. For instance, if one speaker made a higher number of statements than another, averaging them together would tend to skew the overall results. Thus, the occurrence of a few speakers who advocated one theory might cancel out the results of a much greater number of speakers who still clearly favored a particular theory, but not quite as emphatically. It was also important to identify the occupation or expertise of the speaker. An experimental psychologist, a drug counselor, and/or an employee of the DEA would most likely have differing views about the danger of controlled substances. Therefore, a separate analysis was used in an attempt to determine whether the discipline a person works in might serve as an indicator of whether they would have a high positive or negative rating. After this coding procedure was completed, an attempt was made to ascertain whether the results tended to support the theory (for a complete breakdown of the witness scores, please see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0022042612456014">Table 1</xref>).</p>

<p>Note: GHB = gammahydroxybutyric acid; MDMA = methylene-dioxy-methamphetamine.</p></fn>
</table-wrap-foot>
</table-wrap>
<p>The hearings for GHB were obtained through two sources. First, many of the transcripts of the witness testimonies were available online via LexisNexis. Two hearings were conducted. The first hearing took place on July 30, 1998, before the Subcommittee on Crime, which at that time was part of the Committee on the Judiciary of the 105th Congress (CIS NO: 00-H521-28). The second hearing took place on March 11, 1999, before the Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations, which at that time was part of the Committee of Commerce of the 106th Congress (CIS NO: 00-H271-49). After confirming the hearing dates, the paper booklets publishing committee hearings were consulted and all missing witness testimonies were then obtained. It is important to note the witness testimonies of members of Congress have been omitted from this study.</p>
<p>Since the scheduling of MDMA was conducted before an administrative judge, no members of Congress were present to give their opinions. Thus, in an attempt to keep the analysis as balanced as possible, the omission of the members’ testimony was deemed necessary. Moreover, because the “cross-examination” of the witnesses at the MDMA hearings was only mentioned and not available, the questions directed to the witnesses at the GHB hearings have been omitted as well. These omissions, although they will most likely not affect the outcome of the study, are unfortunate but necessary. Omitting these data may seem like the study failed to consider important data. Indeed, considering it was the members of Congress who voted on the legislation, it would seem important to consider their remarks as well. However, this is a comparative study. Ideally, in a comparative study, the process would be exactly the same, and therefore the data would present itself in a uniform manner.</p>
<p>Finding the witness testimonies for the scheduling of MDMA was more difficult. Although the scheduling was decided before an administrative law judge, there is no apparent case name. Even in cases in which the scheduling of MDMA was further litigated, such as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0022042612456014"><italic>Grinspoon v. Drug Enforcement Administration</italic> (1987)</xref>, the decision is only discussed or eluded to (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0022042612456014"><italic>Grinspoon v. Drug Enforcement Administration</italic>, 1987</xref>). The decision is never mentioned by name, and no citation for it is provided. Indeed, only the date the decision was handed down was provided. This is certainly an oddity considering the meticulous manner in which court cases generally treat citations. Furthermore, the clerk of the administrative judge who authored the opinion can only search for the case or any of the hearings pertaining to it by docket number. Providing this information is difficult considering only the date the decision was rendered is provided within the record.</p>
<p>The data were eventually obtained through a website operated by the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.maps.org">www.maps.org</ext-link>). This website provided all the relevant documentation for the scheduling of MDMA. Although a skeptic might doubt the veracity of the information provided by such a website, the information is credible and impressively complete. Among the many documents provided are scanned copies of the original letters requesting the hearings complete with letterhead and signature pages. All the witness testimonies have the signatures of the witnesses stating the transcripts were accurate under penalty of perjury.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0022042612456014" sec-type="results">
<title>Results</title>
<p>The results supported the first hypothesis. The seven persons giving direct testimony in favor of having MDMA classified as a Schedule I substance had an average score of −6.14. None of the witnesses at the MDMA hearings could be classified as victims. Only one of the witnesses at the MDMA hearings testified from a law enforcement perspective, and his score was 0. The other six witnesses came from the medical field, and their average score was −7.17. Perhaps what is most striking is none of the witnesses at the MDMA hearings even uttered a statement that could be coded harm based according to the criteria set forth.</p>
<p>Support for the second hypothesis was found. The 17 persons testifying in the GHB hearings had an average score of +4.41. Such a positive score is indicative of a greater number of harm-based statements than there were paternalistic statements. The 3 persons classified as victims who testified at the GHB hearings, one of whom was a rape crisis counselor and one would assume was speaking on behalf of those that had been sexually assaulted, had an average score of +17.67. Among those in law enforcement at the GHB hearings, the average score was +2.86. However, among the doctors and scientists who testified at the GHB hearings, the average score was −0.34. Witnesses at the GHB hearings had an overall score indicating a greater number of their statements were harm based than were paternalistic. Two of three witness categories leaned harm based, and the one category that leaned paternalistic did so only slightly.</p>
<p>The majority of witnesses at the Congressional hearings concerning the scheduling of GHB stated the substance should be placed in Schedule I primarily espousing “harm to others” justifications. Alternatively, at the DEA hearings concerning the scheduling of MDMA, most of the witnesses who advocated its placement in Schedule I did so from a paternalistic perspective. Although it appears the hypotheses were supported, it is important to provide a detailed analysis beyond whether such an expectation came to fruition.</p>
<p>Among the persons who testified at the GHB hearings, three can be classified as victims. Raul Farias, the uncle of Hillory whose name is in the law rescheduling GHB, had a score of +13. He only gave one statement that could be construed as paternalistic, and 38.89% of his total statements were labeled as harm based. Candace Pruett, a young woman who was raped after involuntarily ingesting Rohypnol, had a score of +23. None of her statements could be construed as paternalistic, and 76.67% of her statements were harm based. It makes sense witnesses who had suffered harm from GHB would exclusively focus on that harm and not give additional paternalistic reasons. Denise Snyder, a representative of the Washington D.C. Rape Crisis Center, can be considered a victim primarily due to her experience of counseling rape victims. She had a total score of +17. None of her statements were paternalistic, and 60.71% of her statements were harm based. Perhaps what is most interesting about her testimony is she was not necessarily supportive of the legislation. According to her, she had previously been involved with the regulation of so-called “date-rape drugs” when legislation was passed assigning additional penalties to those that used Rohypnol as an accessory to commit rape. Her testimony implied she would support a separate law that punished people who used drugs as accessories to commit date rape regardless of the substance. To her, simply rescheduling GHB did not appear to be a solution to the problem.</p>
<p>Among the witnesses who testified at the GHB hearings, eight were classified as being attached to law enforcement. Their scores were +2, +11, 0, −4, 0, +9, +2, and −1 for a total average score of +4.41. These witnesses discussed a variety of topics throughout their testimony. Obviously, the issue of date rape was preeminent among them. Furthermore, labeling GHB and other substances as “date-rape drugs” is a loaded phrase. Indeed, innocuous statements that would not be coded otherwise ended up in the harm category based on the use of this loaded phrase. In some instances, a passive statement, such as a person giving their name, occupation, or other trivial information, was coded in the harm category by including the phrase “date-rape drugs” within the statement. Such a phrase reinforces the perception that the use of drugs with this label will often lead to the imminent harm to others. Also, in the harm to other categories was a riot blamed on persons who had used GHB and persons driving under the influence of the drug. It was noted several times, by witnesses at the hearings, that low doses of GHB have similar effects as moderate to heavy consumption of alcohol. Along similar lines, considering people are able to use GHB in this manner without the hangover effects they might experience from the use of alcohol, many people are using it to supplement or replace the consumption of alcohol, as suggested during the hearings. Thus, many paternalistic statements were espoused condemning such usage. Last, many emergency room statistics were cited among those placed in this class. In many instances, this was problematic for coding purposes. A failure to differentiate among these statistics led to statements coded as mixed, which quite possibly could have been labeled either harm or paternalistic. Indeed, it was often unclear from these remarks whether these persons ingested GHB recreationally or unknowingly. Unfortunately, one can only make so many inferences based on the context of the remarks.</p>
<p>One might notice although some of the law enforcement witnesses had relatively high scores, the percentage of coded statements was much lower than those of the victim class. Several reasons exist for this discrepancy. First among them was the focus on the extralegal market of GHB and the consequences thereof. As stated earlier, this problem would most likely be eliminated if GHB was regulated in a manner similar to alcohol. Furthermore, the problem of GHB kits and poor quality GHB would be eliminated if the substance was not illegal to manufacture. Another reason for the low percentage of coded statements was several of the witnesses gave testimony describing the scheduling process of drugs. Last, many of the witnesses focused on the history and the effects a person might encounter if they ingested GHB, so long as these effects were phrased as a hypothetical. None of these statements were coded.</p>
<p>One might think law enforcement scores would trend higher toward harm-based arguments than they were. Indeed, it seems as if the problem of drug-assisted sexual assaults would be more pressing and compelling to law enforcement. However, many of the laws that law enforcement are required to enforce are paternalistic in nature. Therefore, their scores in that respect seem completely reasonable.</p>
<p>Of the witnesses testifying at the GHB hearings, five were labeled as medical practitioners. Their scores were +8, −3, +1, +3, and −10 for a total average score of −0.34. Although the scores are somewhat divergent, there is good reason for this. First, considering medical personnel would most likely give greater concern in protecting individuals from harming themselves, it is not surprising their scores trended slightly paternalistic. Second, the occupational duties these individuals perform within the medical industry served as indicators of what their scores might be.</p>
<p>Joye M. Carter, a forensic pathologist, had a total score of +8. Considering her occupation, she most likely deals with a high number of cases involving suspicious deaths that needed to be investigated. Therefore, the problem of persons unknowingly ingesting GHB would be one of her primary concerns.</p>
<p>Paul L. Doering, a professor of pharmacy at the University of Florida, had a score of −3. Many of his occupational tasks serve as indicators that his testimony might lean paternalistic. As a professor of pharmacy, one of his primary concerns is that drugs are safe for human consumption. Due to the possibility of people being harmed by the improper use of or poorly made GHB, it is natural that would be a primary concern. Also, considering he is employed at a large state university in Florida, it is possible substance abuse among students would concern him as well. However, because he mentioned date rape is a problem at most universities, there is good reason his score would not be too far from zero, considering the nefarious manner in which some have chosen to use GHB.</p>
<p>Jo Ellen Dyer is a senior management specialist in toxicology for California Poison Control. Her score of +1 seems perfectly in line with her occupation as well. Although many of her statements were coded as mixed, not enough information was given to code them as harm or paternalistic. She would most likely be in contact with people who had both knowingly and unknowingly ingested GHB and were harmed as a result. Thus, without differentiating between the persons who contacted poison control, these statements had to be coded as mixed.</p>
<p>Felix Adatsi is a toxicologist for the Michigan State Police, and he had a score of +3. Although he has the same occupation as Jo Ellen Dyer, he is employed by the state police rather than poison control. Therefore, his job as a toxicologist gave him a similar score, but his involvement with law enforcement most likely made his score trend a little more toward the harm side. Last, Stephen R. Zukin is the director of the Division of Clinical and Services Research for the National Institute of Drug Abuse. He had a score of −10. Such a score is indicative of his occupation. Considering he is primarily concerned with the impact of voluntary drug abuse, it is completely reasonable he would largely focus on how GHB abuse affects an individual who knowingly uses and/or abuses the substance.</p>
<p>In the MDMA hearings, seven witnesses provided direct testimony that MDMA should be placed in Schedule I. One of the witnesses came from law enforcement and the other six had various occupations in the medical field. Their scores were 0, 0, −6, −7, −13, −6, −11. Although their scores were paternalistically leaning, none of the witnesses had a total percentage of coded scores higher than 18.92%. There are several reasons for this. First was many of the witnesses focused on the extralegal market of MDMA. Many of them seemed to assert that since clandestine labs and drug dealers were selling MDMA, there must be something fundamentally harmful about using it, considering the people responsible for MDMA distribution. As mentioned previously, this is largely a government-created problem, and when there is no means of obtaining a substance legally, people will often turn to extralegal means. Second, another manner in which the witnesses argued MDMA should be placed in Schedule I was to criticize the methodology of the studies of those advocating MDMA should not be placed in Schedule I. It is noted that many of those who attacked the methodology of existing studies had not conducted any experiments of their own. Last, of those who had actually conducted studies to attempt to determine whether MDMA was safe for human consumption, the only studies they conducted used animal testing.</p>
<p>Although animal research is used as a preliminary investigative technique to measure the potential abuse liability of drugs, it is doubtful the results of these tests would indicate to most researchers that the drug was particularly harmful to humans. For instance, one of the most fascinating findings among these studies is one dog, while under the influence of MDMA, repeatedly bumped its head into a wall indicative of a reaction which could be best described colloquially as “freaking out.” The most predominant argument among those who argued MDMA should be placed into Schedule I was the effects of the substance were often similar to those of drugs already in Schedule I and II. Therefore, if this substance is similar to those substances, then it should be scheduled accordingly. Only one death was referred to in which a person had ingested MDMA, and even that death was disputed. Indeed, toxicology reports never firmly established what substance the person actually took, only that it had similar properties to MDMA. Such an argument is similar to those that believe GHB should be placed into Schedule I because persons ingested poorly made GHB. As mentioned previously, both are government-created problems.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In the case of GHB, Congress had pending legislation to make the drug Schedule I, and in the case of MDMA, the DEA had already taken the action of placing the drug into Schedule I via emergency scheduling prior to the aforementioned hearings taking place. From the current study, it appears that ostensibly, the witnesses were not used to actually formulate policy but instead as an added step to justify policy. In his opening statement to the committee hearings, the Chairman of the House Judiciary Committee Bill McCollum (R – Florida) stated, “I am certain that GHB does have some valuable medical uses.” The DEA hearings for MDMA were initiated by a group of people who wanted MDMA to remain available to physicians and researchers. GHB was not placed into Schedule I until 60 years after the drug was first synthesized, and MDMA was not placed into Schedule I until 73 years after the drug was first synthesized. If these drugs were exceedingly dangerous, it seems regulation would have occurred much earlier in the life of the two drugs. In both cases, the reputation of the two drugs and fear associated with them seem to have trumped medical utility. As indicated by the literature review, such a phenomenon is not necessarily new and perhaps more a case of history repeating itself.</p>
<p>Many scholars have noted the media’s vast contribution to the negative reputations of drugs. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0022042612456014">Akers (1992)</xref> used the term <italic>scary drug of the year</italic> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0022042612456014">Jenkins (1999)</xref> developed the term <italic>synthetic panics</italic> to describe relatively the same phenomenon. Both noted it seemed like every year a new drug of abuse was being promoted by the media as a new scourge that would sweep the country. Inevitably, this never occurred and old drugs were often forgotten as soon as a new one was being touted. Jenkins lists both GHB and MDMA as examples of synthetic panics. He argued that there seemed to be little proof that GHB was widely used and even noted there was some controversy as to whether Hillory Farias actually consumed GHB. He posited her death may have been simply used by proponents of prohibiting the drug. Jenkins argued MDMA, which was most often associated with the raving movement, conjured up images of lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) use in the 1960s. Such a social climate was arguably something many in government were not eager to repeat.</p>
<p>There have been countless rationales to justify the prohibitions of one drug or another. In the present study, the rationales for the prohibition of GHB followed a “harm to others” approach, and the rationales for the prohibition of MDMA seemingly followed a legal paternalism approach. A more parsimonious explanation might very well be that GHB and MDMA were simply desired by recreational drug users and that was reason enough to prohibit them. Unless manufactured by a pharmaceutical company, drugs often have few defenders. Arguably, the one recurrent agreement within politics is that any drugs that appeal to recreational users should be prohibited. Nonetheless, two drugs with medical utility were placed into a classification reserved for drugs without medical utility. Such an occurrence should not have occurred if the actual language of the scheduling process had actually been followed.</p>

<p>Some have argued the most important impetus for scheduling of MDMA was the mass production of MDMA by a group of persons known as “The Texas Group.” This group of people ratcheted up production of MDMA in anticipation of possible governmental regulation. Supposedly the group synthesized more MDMA in 18 months than all others had combined. It is not without irony that their anticipation of government regulation may have served as the main impetus for regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0022042612456014">Beck &amp; Rosenbaum, 1994</xref>).</p></fn>
