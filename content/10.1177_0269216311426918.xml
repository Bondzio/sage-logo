<sec id="section1-0269216311426918">
<title>Background:</title>
<p>Despite a recognized need for a palliative approach to caring for people with motor neurone disease (MND), access to palliative care is often limited.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0269216311426918">
<title>Aim:</title>
<p>This project aimed to improve the knowledge of health professionals about a palliative approach to MND care.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0269216311426918">
<title>Design:</title>
<p>A three-phase study was undertaken to develop, implement and evaluate an education program for health professionals that promoted a palliative approach to MND care. This paper discusses the second and third phases: the implementation and evaluation of the project. Education workshops were held for health professionals. Their knowledge of palliative care was measured before and after the workshops and one month later. Attitudes to providing MND care were also measured.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0269216311426918">
<title>Setting:</title>
<p>Workshops were held in South Australia and Western Australia. Participants were health professionals working in the areas of MND care or palliative care. Some aged care and generalist health professionals were included if they had a role in providing care to people with MND.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0269216311426918">
<title>Results:</title>
<p>The participants demonstrated an improvement in MND knowledge (χ<sup>2</sup> = 64.13(2), <italic>p</italic> = 0.000) and palliative care knowledge (χ<sup>2</sup> = 17.24(2), <italic>p</italic> = 0.000); both were sustained at one month. Attitudes to providing MND care also improved (χ<sup>2</sup> = 11.85(2), <italic>p</italic> = 0.003) and were maintained at the six-month follow-up. Participants indicated that the knowledge gained positively influenced their clinical practice.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0269216311426918">
<title>Conclusions:</title>
<p>A targeted education program for health professionals improved understanding about end-of-life care for people with MND. Health care providers also reported having made improvements in the care provided to patients and carers, particularly communication, psychosocial care and symptom management.</p>

<title>Background</title>
<p>Motor neurone disease (MND), also known as Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis or Lou Gehrig’s disease, is a neurodegenerative condition that causes progressive degeneration of the motor neurones, leading to reduced function in the muscles that control movement. This leads to loss of motor function including decreasing ability to speak, swallow and breathe. Median life expectancy from diagnosis is three years and there is no known cure. Disease progression and symptom burden varies greatly between individuals; therefore, there is a need for individualized care to adequately manage symptoms and promote quality of life.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0269216311426918">1</xref></sup> It has also been reported that people with MND are more likely to commit suicide than the general population.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0269216311426918">2</xref></sup> Several authors discussed the need for palliative care to be provided for people with MND to address symptom management across the physical, psychosocial and spiritual domains;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0269216311426918">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0269216311426918"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0269216311426918">5</xref></sup> however, there is evidence that many people with MND have very limited access to palliative care.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0269216311426918">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>To ensure that people with MND have access to palliative care services, the knowledge of palliative care professionals about the requirements of people with MND must be improved. Conversely, providers of specialist MND care need improved understanding of the benefits of palliative care for people with MND. While education programs for health professionals are recommended to improve knowledge about MND and the integration of a palliative approach in MND care, there remains a lack of programs to bridge this identified gap in MND education.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0269216311426918">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0269216311426918"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0269216311426918">9</xref></sup> This three-phase project aimed to improve the knowledge of care providers about a palliative approach to MND care through the development, implementation and evaluation of an education program for service providers focused on the palliative care needs of people with MND. This paper reports on the implementation and evaluation phases of the project.</p>
<p>The objective of the implementation and evaluation phases was to determine whether use of the newly developed education materials:</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<p>Ethical clearance for this project was granted by Curtin University Human Research Ethics Committee (RD-20-07) as the project conformed to the standards required by the Declaration of Helsinki. This project used a phased approach to develop and implement an education program about providing palliative care for people with MND. Phase 1 involved an extensive consumer consultation process, including conducting interviews and focus groups with patients, carers and health professionals, to determine education needs (<italic>n</italic> = 42); this phase is reported elsewhere.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0269216311426918">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0269216311426918">11</xref></sup> The results of Phase 1 were analyzed and informed the development of education materials for use in delivering inter-professional education. Phase 2 involved the development of an education program for health professionals from a range of clinical backgrounds who had the common experience of contact with someone with late stage, progressive MND about a palliative approach to MND care. Phase 3 tested the impact of the program on the clinical practice of participants. This paper reports the findings of Phases 2 and 3.</p>
<sec id="section9-0269216311426918">
<title>Intervention</title>
<p>The findings of Phase 1 suggested that there was a need for information about MND to be more widely available to health professionals in various settings providing end-of-life care. Practical information about how to solve problems encountered in MND care and an explanation of the benefits that palliative care offers people with MND were considered important. Health professionals required a flexible program with an emphasis on experiential learning.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0269216311426918">10</xref></sup> With this in mind, an education program was designed that comprised six learning modules that could be presented as stand alone sessions or as part of a workshop. The modules cover: an overview of a palliative approach to MND care; promoting dignity and quality of life; pathophysiology; symptom management; and psychosocial and spiritual care. Each module incorporates learning objectives, course content, interactive activities and a case study. A facilitators’ workbook was developed to provide course notes, lecture slides, reading materials, learning activities and workshop preparation documents to guide educators. A smaller handbook was developed for workshop participants containing course notes, reading materials and further sources of information.</p>
<p>Information sheets explaining the project were sent to health agencies in South Australia and Western Australia that provided care to people with MND. These included palliative care services, aged care facilities, community care facilities and MND associations. Interested health professionals who were currently caring for someone with MND or were likely to provide care to someone with MND in the near future were invited to register to attend a workshop.</p>
<p>For the purposes of testing the education materials, the six modules were presented as a full-day workshop. An experienced facilitator led the workshop with assistance from relevant experts. Workshops were free of charge and participants were provided with a copy of the workbook to take home.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0269216311426918">
<title>Data collection</title>
<p>A time-series design was used to measure the effect of attending a one-day workshop on participants’ knowledge and attitude to providing a palliative approach to MND care. Data were collected at three time points: Time 1 (T1), prior to commencing the workshop; Time 2 (T2), on completion of the workshop; and Time 3 (T3), one month after the workshop. T1 and T2 were administered at the workshop, T3 was sent by mail or email, depending on participants’ preference.</p>
<p>Satisfaction with the workshop and changes to clinical practice after workshop attendance were also investigated. Demographic details of respondents were collected and project-specific tools were developed to measure these variables, including:</p>
<list id="list2-0269216311426918" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>A 30-item knowledge quiz that focused on clinically relevant knowledge about MND care with emphasis on pathophysiology and treatment of symptoms. The quiz has two subscales, the 24-item <italic>MND subscale</italic> and the six-item <italic>Palliative care for people with MND subscale</italic></p></list-item>
<list-item><p>A 22-item <italic>Attitude to MND care scale</italic> that examined respondents’ feelings about providing palliative care to people with MND</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>A nine-item <italic>Impact of workshop measure</italic> (used at T3 only) to measure if and in what way the participants felt attendance at the workshop had changed their understanding of MND and their ability to provide care for people with MND.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Five short answer questions were also included at T3 to assess changes in clinical practice following workshop attendance. Face and content validity of the questionnaires were assessed by a panel of experts prior to implementation of the intervention. The panel confirmed that items on the questionnaires indexed content adequately, with no evidence of redundancy. Minor suggestions to improve readability of the questionnaires were provided and incorporated. The internal consistency reliability of the Knowledge Quiz and the MND and Palliative Care Knowledge subscales and the Attitude to MND Care Scale was estimated using Cronbach’s alpha coefficient. The Attitude to MND Scale achieved a Cronbach’s alpha coefficient of 0.82 and the Knowledge Quiz attained a Cronbach’s alpha coefficient of 0.67.</p>
<p>Normality testing was undertaken for the Palliative Care and MND Knowledge scores and the Attitude to MND care score using the Kolmorgorov-Smirnov test. The data were not normally distributed nor were observations at T2 and T3 independent of T1. All scores had a positive skew, that is, higher scores were seen on the Knowledge and Attitude to MND scores; seven of the nine scores tested for normality had <italic>p</italic> values ≤ .05. Therefore, the following non-parametric statistical tests were used for this analysis: Friedman test; Kruskal–Wallis test; Mann–Whitney <italic>U</italic>-test; Spearman’s Rank Order Correlation; and Wilcoxon signed rank test.</p>
<p>A further evaluation was conducted six months after completion of the workshops to gauge the impact of the workshop on participants’ clinical practice. In total, nine people were invited to participate using a purposive sampling method to ensure that participants were included from a range of settings, such as MND specialist care, aged care and palliative care. Potential participants were sent an information sheet via email introducing this phase of the project and asking for input. Interested participants were asked to sign a consent form before commencing the interview. In total, 10 people were invited to participate and one declined. Interviews (<italic>n</italic> = 4) or focus groups (<italic>n</italic> = 5) were conducted with participants in the location of their choice, and were audio-recorded. The recordings were replayed, notes taken and relevant quotes were transcribed verbatim. Latent content analysis was used to analyze the transcribed data.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0269216311426918">12</xref></sup> Findings were discussed by the research team to explore different perspectives on the data and reach consensus on the final themes. To ensure rigour, a summary was provided to a senior MND professional to verify that themes were appropriate.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>Six one-day workshops were held to trial the education materials developed and assess the effectiveness of the sessions at changing the knowledge and attitudes of participants. In total 78 people attended the workshops. Most participants were female (94%, <italic>n</italic> = 73), with a mean age of 50 years (SD = 9). Participants had been employed in their profession for a mean of 20.5 years (SD = 9.1) with a range of three months to 47 years. The median length of time providing palliative care was reported as 8.5 years, with a range of no time spent providing palliative care to 42 years. Participants had spent less time providing MND care, with a median of 3.0 years and a range of never to 35 years, with the median number of MND patients cared for per year being two. The occupational details of participants are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0269216311426918">Table 1</xref>. Spearman’s Rank Order Correlation, Kruskal–Wallis and Mann–Whitney <italic>U</italic>-tests were used to determine if there was a relationship between the demographic details of participants and MND and palliative care knowledge and attitude scores at Time 1 and Time 2 testing (the Time 3 sample was too small to draw meaningful conclusions). Small to moderate correlations were found between the time participants had been providing care to people with MND and MND knowledge scores (T1 ρ = 0.31, <italic>p</italic> = 0.006; T2 ρ= 0.39, <italic>p</italic> = 0.01) and attitude to MND care scores (T1 ρ = 0.46, <italic>p</italic> = 0.000; T2 ρ = 0.37, <italic>p</italic> = 0.002). Similarly, the number of MND patients cared for per year showed moderate correlation with T1 MND knowledge score (ρ = 0.3, <italic>p</italic> = 0.008) and T1 attitude to MND care (ρ = 0.37, <italic>p</italic> = 0.002). A relationship was also found between category of occupation and MND scores and Attitude to MND scores. At both T1 and T2 allied health professionals and nurses were more likely to achieve a high MND score than were care workers (T1 <italic>p</italic> = 0.021; T2 <italic>p</italic> = 0.000). Similarly, at T1 care workers were likely to have a less positive attitude to providing MND care than were allied health professionals and nurses (<italic>p</italic> = 0.014), although there was no difference in attitude to MND scores between occupational categories at T2.</p>

<title>Impact of workshop</title>
<p>This scale consisting of nine items was administered at T3 only. Respondents were asked to rate their clinical practice in MND care before and after the workshop on a scale of 1 to 5, with a maximum score of 45 for both the pre- and post-workshop impact scores. Testing using a Wilcoxon signed rank test showed a significant increase in the impact of the workshop scores from before to after the workshop (<italic>z</italic> = −5.65, <italic>p</italic> = 0.000). The mean impact of workshop score rose from 26.01 (SD = 10.61) before the workshop to 38.98 (SD = 4.85) after the workshop, indicating that respondents felt that their clinical practice in MND care was influenced positively by their attendance at the workshop. The areas where respondents reported the greatest changes were their understanding of the pathophysiology of MND and improved knowledge of symptom management.</p>
<p>Comments provided in the T3 survey suggested that attendance at the workshops produced a positive influence on participants’ clinical practice. One respondent said:<disp-quote>
<p>Whilst recently attending a client with end-stage motor neurone I took extra special care in the way I communicated with her. I gave extra time to enable a more effective two-way conversation. I think she really appreciated that. (PW20)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Other participants felt that the benefits of their attendance had made a difference to the way care was provided in their workplace:<disp-quote>
<p>It created a positive framework for change at our workplace and a lot of in-house learning. (PS15)</p>

<title>Feedback from service providers at six-month follow-up</title>
<p>Focus groups/interviews were held with nine service providers from four organizations who participated in the workshops, to investigate the impact the education program had on the care provided for people with MND, and to determine further education needs.</p>
<p>Participants in the education program had a range of experience in providing MND care and this was reflected in the gains they experienced from their participation. One experienced clinician said:<disp-quote>
<p>I maybe have thought more about what has happened before… seeing them more holistically… seeing the losses that are long gone… the person, their character, their job, their interests, I guess their relationships, the whole lot. Not just seeing the losses that we would see… a better understanding. (PF5)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>For less experienced palliative care providers, the workshop underpinned their knowledge of caring for MND patients. One participant explained:<disp-quote>
<p>… the staff that all went to that course, went because they felt some inadequacies in caring for people with MND, and that’s quite challenging, so they actually wanted to go and do the course so they could learn more… (PW12)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Participants discussed specific aspects of the workshops that had been of benefit. Introducing the role of palliative care early in the care journey for people with MND was considered an important impact of the workshop by one participant:<disp-quote>
<p>One of the bigger impacts [the workshop] actually had was I particularly liked the decision around the fact that they were considered ‘palliative’ right from the time they get their diagnosis… (PW18)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Promoting individualized care for MND patients was a highlight for one participant:<disp-quote>
<p>[the workshop]… acknowledged the differences in patients with MND, because each patient is quite unique with what their needs are… the course highlighted what’s right for one patient isn’t right for another, and it’s very much about getting your information beforehand about their particular needs. (PW12)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Another described increased confidence in discussing end of life (EOL) issues, especially advanced health directives:<disp-quote>
<p>I feel more confident now talking to people about, not just EOL stuff but just bringing up enduring powers of attorney, advanced health directives… and to start that earlier… I was a bit scared I guess in bringing it up… (PW39)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This participant developed a pamphlet about these issues for MND patients and carers early in the disease process. Another participant was motivated to do further education in the area of MND care and introduced an adapted plan of information dissemination into her workplace to gain an early and comprehensive understanding of individual care needs from MND patients and carers requiring respite care.</p>
<p>A number of MND specialist care providers attended the workshops. They described developing an insight into how clinicians considered MND patients a burden:<disp-quote>
<p>I was I guess a little surprised at how strongly some of the participants felt about what a huge burden it was to their workload. It gave me a really good insight into why there were sometimes some barriers to us getting people [with MND] into institutional care, for example into hospice. (PW36)</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The findings of this study demonstrate that education focused on the provision of palliative care for people with MND can improve the knowledge of MND and increase the understanding that health care professionals have about this disease. The health professionals who attended the workshops were self-selected. The majority of those attending were nurses, particularly from the aged care and palliative care sectors. Most participants attended because they were currently caring for someone with MND and required further information about this rare disease. Access to timely and appropriate education about a condition that many health professionals will see only occasionally in their career is the appropriate way of disseminating information about MND to improve care provision. The differing knowledge levels prior to attending the workshops suggest there may be a need to offer education programs that are suitable for the different types of health professionals attending the workshops. For this project any interested participants were welcome to attend. However, the differing levels of understanding of MND care at T1 and T2 between university-educated health professionals (allied health and nursing) and care workers with less formal qualifications suggest it may be appropriate in future to tailor education sessions to the needs of participants more specifically.</p>
<p>Relf and Heath<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0269216311426918">13</xref></sup> suggested that experiential workshops such as this provide opportunities for participants to become more aware of their own attitudes and assumptions and to reflect on the complex nature of palliative care work. In particular, gaining improved understanding of the emotional needs of people with MND is likely to influence the way participants interact with patients and families.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0269216311426918">14</xref></sup> Participants described changes in the way they provided care to MND patients, including improved communication with patients and families. Participants also demonstrated increased knowledge of MND care and palliative care that was sustained over a one-month time period, which is important when considered in the context of the findings of a study by O’Brien that showed that 57% of health professionals felt they had inadequate knowledge of MND.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0269216311426918">15</xref></sup> They also described the usefulness of receiving a workbook as a resource to help refresh their memory when they next provided care for a patient with MND, which was potentially some time after the workshop was held. Access to the workbook may also have contributed to the positive changes to attitudes towards providing MND care that occurred some time after workshop attendance.</p>
<p>Simon and colleagues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0269216311426918">16</xref></sup> stress the importance of teaching palliative care attitudes and values to promote excellence in care. If changes in health professionals’ attitudes are seen, corresponding changes to clinical care would be expected. Participants indicated the importance of providing ongoing MND education programs for health care professionals, and in particular for any new staff employed by their health agencies. Provision of appropriate education materials combined with interactive learning opportunities should be considered a priority to assist health professionals who provide care only occasionally for people with this relatively rare disease.</p>
<p>People living with MND and their families will benefit from increased access to palliative care services that are able to provide specialist care, such as complicated symptom management, when required.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0269216311426918">17</xref></sup> A targeted education program for palliative care professionals will assist in improving the understanding of palliative care professionals about the needs of people with MND. Also, having specialist MND care providers increase their understanding of palliative care may improve referral to this valuable service. One benefit of this type of interdisciplinary workshop was the interaction between disciplines that has the potential to improve understanding between them.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0269216311426918">18</xref></sup> In this setting, the interactions between palliative care professionals and specialist MND care providers were unusual and the education workshop served to highlight to both parties the need for greater communication to improve care. Future initiatives that increase interaction between palliative care providers and MND care providers would be useful to increase understanding and improve care coordination.</p>
<p>The main limitation of this study was the inability to determine if the changes in knowledge and attitudes of participants translated into measurable changes in the quality of care provided to people with MND. However, the reports of participants suggest that they felt more able to provide care to people with MND and that they had a greater understanding of their care needs. Further research to understand how attendance at a workshop of this nature translates into changes in clinical practice would be helpful to ensure that education is useful in palliative care settings.</p>
<p>When interpreting the results of this study the small sample size should be considered. When working in an area such as MND care, with a relatively rare disease, it can be difficult to recruit a large sample. Ongoing research in this area will help to determine what sorts of education programs best improve MND care provision and will allow further testing of the instruments used in this study.</p>
<p>Currently, an implementation plan is being developed to ensure widespread uptake of the education program across Australia. The two peak bodies in Australia, Palliative Care Australia and Motor Neurone Disease Australia, will collaborate to ensure that as many MND and palliative care providers as possible have an opportunity to participate in this education program. A targeted, widespread education campaign will improve end-of-life care for people with MND and their families.</p>
