<abstract>
<p>The present study examined prolonged exposure effects of thin-ideal media messages. College-aged females participated in seven online sessions over 10 days including a baseline measures session, five daily measures, and a posttest. Two experimental groups viewed magazine pages with thin-ideal imagery. One of those groups was induced to engage in social comparisons with the thin-ideal models. The control group viewed messages with body-neutral images of women. Prolonged exposure to thin-ideal messages led to greater body satisfaction. This finding was attributed to the fact that the experimental groups reported more dieting behaviors. A mediation analysis showed that the impact of thin-ideal message exposure on body satisfaction was mediated by dieting.</p>

<body>
<p>Idealized body images in the media have been linked to unrealistic body shape aspirations and body dissatisfaction (see meta-analysis by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0093650211400596">Grabe, Ward, &amp; Hyde, 2008</xref>), which, in turn, have been linked to numerous pathological problems, including depression, obesity, dieting, and eating disorders (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0093650211400596">Johnson &amp; Wardle, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0093650211400596">Neumark-Sztainer, Paxton, Hannan, Haines, &amp; Story, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0093650211400596">Ricciardelli &amp; McCabe, 2001</xref>). However, another meta-analysis by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0093650211400596">Holmstrom (2004)</xref> found that the longer the media exposure, the <italic>better</italic> the individuals felt about their body. This inconsistency indicates that the factors and processes at work have not yet been fully understood and captured by the research at hand and deserve further investigation. Social comparison theory is the theoretical framework that has guided much of the related recent research (for meta-analyses, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0093650211400596">Myers &amp; Crowther, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0093650211400596">Want, 2009</xref>) and also informs the current study. Existing research consists mostly of cross-sectional surveys and short-term experiments while a few panel studies have provided longitudinal data. The present study falls between these two time frames that have either focused on immediate or long-term effects and examines thin-ideal imagery effects on body satisfaction through a prolonged exposure experiment across 10 days. The goal is to shed light on the process through which media users’ body satisfaction is influenced.</p>

<title>Idealized Body Images in the Media and Body Dissatisfaction</title>
<p>The media clearly emphasize idealized, lean body shapes for women. For instance, a recent content analysis of 10 women’s magazines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0093650211400596">Wasylkiw, Emms, Meuse, &amp; Poirier, 2009</xref>) showed that 95% of the models in fashion magazines were lean; in fitness magazines, 55% were lean and 36% were muscular—only 6% of the models in both magazine types had a soft, round body type. Content analyses of images in women’s magazines from 1901 to 1980 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0093650211400596">Silverstein, Perdue, Peterson, &amp; Kelly, 1986</xref>) and from 1959 to 1999 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0093650211400596">Sypeck, Gray, &amp; Ahrens, 2004</xref>) found that the models have become increasingly thinner over time. An increasing discrepancy between body shapes portrayed as ideal in the media and actual body shapes found in the general population has been observed for both women and men (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0093650211400596">Spitzer, Henderson, &amp; Zivian, 1999</xref>). Two thirds (67%) of adult Americans were overweight or obese in 2005-2006 (compared to 55% in 1988-1994; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0093650211400596">National Center for Health Statistics, 2008</xref>, p. 311) and the majority of Americans (53%) try to lose weight (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0093650211400596">International Food Information Council, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>In light of the thin ideal featured in the media and the prevalence of being overweight in the general population, it is not surprising that body dissatisfaction is widespread in the United States. However, body dissatisfaction is also extremely common among individuals with <italic>normal</italic> weight, especially females (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0093650211400596">Paeratakul, White, Williamson, Ryan, &amp; Bray, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0093650211400596">Pritchard, King, &amp; CzajkaNarins, 1997</xref>), attesting to the crucial role of self-perception. Body dissatisfaction is fairly ubiquitous among women and has been studied extensively (e.g., see meta-analysis by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0093650211400596">Grabe et al., 2008</xref>). More women than men are trying to lose weight and do so at lower Body Mass Index levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0093650211400596">Bish et al., 2005</xref>). Increasingly in Western cultures, where there is a ready supply of food, the cultural ideal of attractiveness for women is a slender body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0093650211400596">Polivy &amp; Herman, 2004</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0093650211400596">Fredrickson and Roberts (1997)</xref> posited that women are more likely to be judged on appearance than men and that the greater social focus on women’s bodies leads them to focus more on their bodies: “Women’s focus on their appearance, which was previously thought of as vanity, can be looked at as women’s strategy for helping to determine how others will treat them” (p. 179).</p>

<title>Social Comparison Explanation of Body Dissatisfaction</title>
<p>Social comparison theory has informed much of recent body image research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0093650211400596">Myers &amp; Crowther, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0093650211400596">Want, 2009</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0093650211400596">Festinger’s (1954)</xref> social comparison theory was originally developed to explain how people evaluate themselves when no objective criteria are available. Individuals generally prefer similar others to engage in comparisons of salient opinions or abilities, often using biological sex as the basis for similarity. The original theory dealt with comparisons within groups and face-to-face comparisons, but it has since been recognized that individuals also compare themselves to larger social categories, like models in advertisements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0093650211400596">Richins, 1991</xref>). In certain circumstances, people may not choose a similar other for comparison, as originally suggested. Dissimilar others may be selected for comparison if they possess expertise on a subject of comparison or are perceived to have more relevant information on a subject than a similar other—for instance, comparison with a model for being thin and attractive rather than comparison with an average woman (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0093650211400596">Kruglanski &amp; Mayseless, 1990</xref>). Hence, media exposure may often entail upward social comparison—when one compares oneself to someone who is better off.</p>
<p>This specification of comparison direction—typically upward for thin-ideal media images—relates to social comparison motives. At least three motives have been suggested to guide social comparisons: self-evaluation, self-enhancement (to feel better about oneself through downward comparisons with those who are worse off), and self-improvement (to perform better through information derived from upward comparisons with those who are better off; e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0093650211400596">Helgeson &amp; Mickelson, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0093650211400596">Martin &amp; Kennedy, 1994</xref>). Upward comparison typically takes place for self-improvement purposes, where one compares oneself to someone who is better on the dimension of comparison in order to set a standard to live up to. Though upward social comparison is typically used for self-improvement purposes, it can lead to negative feelings since the comparer is acknowledging that they are (he/she is) not as good in some way as the comparison target (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0093650211400596">Wood, 1989</xref>). Accordingly, the average woman who is engaging in upward social comparison with a media figure that is most likely much thinner than herself will experience more negative affect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0093650211400596">Tiggemann &amp; McGill, 2004</xref>). However, social comparison motives such as self-evaluation, self-enhancement, or self-improvement have only occasionally been differentiated in body image research (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0093650211400596">Martin &amp; Kennedy, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0093650211400596">Myers &amp; Biocca, 1992</xref>), even though diverse methodological approaches to capturing social comparison phenomena exist in this line of research.</p>
<p>The various approaches highlight several methodological issues pertaining to the operationalization of social comparisons. The phenomenon has been conceptualized as a moderating variable, thus measured as trait, or as a mediating variable, being measured as a state, or was manipulated experimentally. Social comparisons at the trait level have been measured with various self-report scales that aim to identify to what extent the participants compare themselves to others in general (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0093650211400596">Dittmar &amp; Howard, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0093650211400596">Jones, 2001</xref>). State social comparisons measures have served to capture the degree to which participants engage in social comparison following exposure to a stimulus. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0093650211400596">Tiggemann and Slater (2003)</xref> asked women two questions to assess their level of state comparison: To what extent they thought about their appearance during exposure, and to what extent they compared themselves with the images of women in the stimulus material. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0093650211400596">Tiggemann and McGill (2004)</xref> incorporated both state and trait measures of social comparison into their design and concluded that both trait social comparison readiness and state social comparisons affect how women are influenced by idealized body imagery.</p>
<p>Research with experimental manipulations of social comparison has used treatments with different levels of explicitness. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0093650211400596">Cattarin, Thompson, Thomas, &amp; Williams (2000)</xref> used an explicit instructional set to induce state social comparisons by asking the participants to compare themselves to the models in stimulus videos and to notice what they are wearing. They found that there was a larger main effect for video type rather than instructional set (comparison, neutral, distractor) such that participants in the neutral group also engaged in social comparison. In response to this design dilemma, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0093650211400596">Dittmar and Howard (2004)</xref> simply declared social comparison too difficult to manipulate and used measures of trait social comparison instead. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0093650211400596">Tiggemann and McGill (2004)</xref> manipulated social comparison more successfully by asking participants to respond to a so-called consumer response questionnaire, in which they had to rate their level of agreement with statements right after viewing each ad, that was manipulated for social comparison, appearance focus, or control groups. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0093650211400596">Want (2009)</xref> concluded based on a meta-analysis of body image experiments that media stimuli have stronger impacts if the social comparisons occur spontaneously as opposed to being induced and processed at a salient level.</p>
<p>In light of the theoretical relevance of the concept and the methodological considerations outlined, the current research will examine social comparison processes by inducing comparisons in one experimental group and comparing them with spontaneous processes occurring in another experimental group. Furthermore, trait social comparison readiness will serve as a control variable.</p>

<title>Amount of Exposure and Effect Processes</title>
<p>Despite a general consensus that exposure to idealized body images leads to negative effects among women (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0093650211400596">Grabe et al., 2008</xref>), research pertaining to length of exposure to idealized body images has yielded some counterintuitive results. A meta-analysis of 25 experiments by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0093650211400596">Groesz, Levine, and Murnen (2002)</xref> showed that women’s body satisfaction was significantly more negative after viewing thin model images; yet the impact was significantly weaker as more stimuli were presented (comparing 1-9, 10-19, and 20 or more stimuli).Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0093650211400596">Holmstrom’s (2004)</xref> meta-analysis found that longer media exposure times led to a significant increase in women’s body satisfaction, which is a finding in direct contrast to the notion that cumulative exposure can cause lasting, negative effects. The adverse effects of media exposure on body image may be thought of as temporary; however, many argue that these temporary effects compound into more permanent, long-lasting effects due to pervasiveness of idealized media images along the lines of the sociocultural explanation of body dissatisfaction and internalization of the thin ideal (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0093650211400596">Thompson &amp; Stice, 2001</xref>). Yet summaries of the research at hand do not perfectly corroborate this idea.</p>
<p>Several studies found positive effects of ideal body image exposure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0093650211400596">Henderson-King &amp; Henderson-King, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0093650211400596">Mills, Polivy, Herman, &amp; Tiggemann, 2002</xref>, Study 1; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0093650211400596">Myers &amp; Biocca, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0093650211400596">Wilcox &amp; Laird, 2000</xref>). Such findings suggest that “Instead of feeling worse about herself after seeing slim body images, a dieter may engage in a fantasy of believing herself to be thin and experience a temporary feeling of thinness” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0093650211400596">Mills et al., 2002</xref>, p. 1692). Hence, social comparisons may be driven by self-improvement desires. So far, a few studies have examined specific <italic>motives</italic> of social comparisons with body ideals in the media (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0093650211400596">Halliwell &amp; Dittmar, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0093650211400596">Martin &amp; Gentry, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0093650211400596">Martin &amp; Kennedy, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0093650211400596">Mills et al., 2002</xref>, Study 2). They found that, when a self-improvement perspective was induced or the body ideal was presented as more attainable, affective responses to the ideal body images were significantly less negative or even more positive. The attainability of the displayed achievement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0093650211400596">Buunk, Collins, Taylor, VanYperen, &amp; Dakof, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0093650211400596">Lockwood &amp; Kunda, 1997</xref>) thus may influence whether upward comparisons have a self-deflating or inspiring impact.</p>
<p>We thus propose the following model of the short- and middle-term impacts of idealized body imagery, as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0093650211400596">Figure 1</xref>. First, exposure to idealized body imagery, if relevant for social comparisons because of similarity based on same sex (Zanna, Goethals, &amp; Hills, 1975), will increase the salience of body ideals.</p>
<fig id="fig1-0093650211400596" position="float">

<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0093650211400596-fig1.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>Second, the extent to which social comparison processes are salient and deliberate versus automatic will be an important moderator. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0093650211400596">Want (2009)</xref> found through a meta-analysis that social comparison inductions reduced the detrimental impact of idealized imagery exposure on body concerns. He argued that, if more cognitive resources are allocated to appearance-focused social comparisons, onlookers are more likely to engage in self-defensive thinking, for example, by reducing the relevance of the appearance dimension or by questioning the fairness of comparing oneself with professionally produced and often digitally enhanced photography. Want connected this argument with various studies and concluded that social comparison instructions may often lead participants to allocate more cognitive resources to the “undoing” of self-deflation from spontaneous upward comparisons. On the other hand, as it stands, automatic and effortless social comparisons will generally lead onlookers to perceive a discrepancy between their actual body and body ideals.</p>
<p>Third, outcomes of salient social comparisons should depend on preexisting body dissatisfaction—especially media users with less body dissatisfaction and/or low BMI may conclude that they do not deviate so drastically from the ideal, which is related to the observation that not all women are equally affected by idealized body imagery (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0093650211400596">Posavac, Posavac, &amp; Posavac, 1998</xref>).</p>
<p>Fourth, the perceived attainability of improving toward a body ideal will determine whether related messages have an inspiring or deflating impact. Attainability perceptions will in part be based on prior experiences with attempts to change one’s body toward an ideal but may often be induced by message components. Several authors have noted (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0093650211400596">Malkin, Wornian, &amp; Chrisler, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0093650211400596">Posavac et al., 1998</xref>) that idealized body images in the media are often accompanied by attainability messages, either explicit messages such as diet tips or implicit messages such as advertising a product associated with physical beauty. However, most effects research on idealized body images employed image-only stimuli without these elements pertaining to attainability, which most likely led to stronger detrimental impacts along the lines of self-deflation than natural ideal-body messages with the common attainability elements. If attainability of body improvement is perceived as high, exposure will then lead to inspiration and engaging in a body ideal fantasy (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0093650211400596">Mills et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0093650211400596">Myers &amp; Biocca, 1992</xref>) and hopes for self-improvement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0093650211400596">Martin &amp; Kennedy, 1994</xref>). As a result, recipients may actually engage in weight loss behaviors such as dieting and exercising, which should further enhance body satisfaction. In brief, recipients appear to activate some self-bolstering mechanism in the course of idealized-body imagery exposure. These mechanisms help to explain why media users choose to attend to messages that are commonly thought to have self-deflating effects and thus should be avoided in the interest of maintaining a positive self-concept.</p>
<p>Going beyond short-term effects, much less is known about ideal-body messages’ impacts. A few longitudinal studies examined media impacts on body satisfaction and disordered eating, with a focus on females. The results, however, have been inconsistent in that some show a detrimental impact and some do not. Four of these investigations conducted interviews at Time 1 and 1 year later at Time 2 and mostly found that TV exposure affected appearance satisfaction negatively and increased disordered eating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0093650211400596">Dohnt &amp; Tiggemann, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0093650211400596">Harrison &amp; Hefner, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0093650211400596">Moriarty &amp; Harrison, 2008</xref>). The fourth panel study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0093650211400596">Tiggemann, 2006</xref>) of this type, however, found media exposure had no appreciable impact on body image, and body satisfaction did not predict change in media exposure either. The most extensive longitudinal evidence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0093650211400596">Field et al., 1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0093650211400596">2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0093650211400596">2008</xref>) investigated a sample of over 6,900 girls. It yielded that, over a 1-year period, the key predictor of the <italic>development</italic> of weight concerns and dieting was “making a lot of effort to look like same-sex figures in the media” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0093650211400596">Field et al., 2001</xref>, p. 54). A 7-year follow-up showed disordered eating was predicted independently by frequent dieting and attempting to look like media characters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0093650211400596">Field et al., 2008</xref>). Hence, this research suggests that social comparison processes play an important role in media effects on problematic eating habits driven by weight-loss goals. The only longitudinal experimental design (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0093650211400596">Stice, Spangler, &amp; Agras, 2001</xref>) found no uniform effect of a 15-month subscription to a fashion magazine on adolescent American girls: No main effects of long-term exposure to thin images emerged—only vulnerable adolescents were adversely affected by exposure to these images. In short, three out of four 1-year panel studies showed negative effects and one did not; Field et al.’s extensive work underlined the importance of social comparison processes more than actual exposure; the only longitudinal field experiment failed to show general impacts of exposure.</p>
<p>The existing evidence leaves several questions open. How does the media impact evolve over time? Based on evidence from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0093650211400596">Holmstrom’s (2004)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0093650211400596">Groesz et al.’s (2002)</xref> meta-analyses, more exposure to thin model images may even result in greater body satisfaction. Such an improvement or at least a lack of negative effects has been addressed by a few authors; they suggested that women may engage in fantasy rumination on a better life with a thin body when viewing thin-ideal imagery in the media (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0093650211400596">Mills et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0093650211400596">Myers &amp; Biocca, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0093650211400596">Tiggemann, Polivy, &amp; Hargreaves, 2009</xref>) or that women may not experience negative effects from viewing these images when motivated by self-improvement goals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0093650211400596">Halliwell &amp; Dittmar, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0093650211400596">Martin &amp; Gentry, 1997</xref>). These processes may develop with some delay, such as a first exposure may instigate them and lead to more exposure and, in turn, greater motivation for self-improvement and so on. Impacts of prolonged exposure may thus be of crucial interest and speak to the paradox that millions of women choose to attend to idealized body imagery that is said to have a self-deflating effect on them. Prior research consists mostly of cross-sectional surveys, short-term experiments, and a few long-term panel studies—in contrast, the present study examines a middle-term time span of 1 week and lasting effects 3 days after the last exposure.</p>

<title>The Present Research</title>
<p>The present research aims to gain insight into effects processes for extended exposure to thin-ideal media images on body satisfaction. To complement existing longitudinal research on media effects on body satisfaction that spanned longer periods of 1 year or more, our study applies a prolonged exposure experimental design, which has also been applied to study effects of media violence, pornography, and talk shows (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0093650211400596">Linz, Donnerstein, &amp; Penrod, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0093650211400596">Roessler &amp; Brosius, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0093650211400596">Zillmann &amp; Weaver, 1999</xref>). Participants are presented with magazine pages emphasizing the thin-ideal across five daily sessions, in comparison to a control group that receives magazine pages without a thin-ideal focus. We are interested in how salient social comparisons influence the media portrayals’ effects across time, as prior research has demonstrated the crucial role of this psychological phenomenon in media effects on body satisfaction. Thus social comparisons will be induced in one experimental group.</p>
<p>From a methodological perspective, the present study was designed to address various concerns discussed in the literature (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0093650211400596">Levine &amp; Murnen, 2009</xref>, p. 35). For instance, the design aimed to avoid demand characteristics by presenting the study as a magazine content enjoyment study and presenting plenty of distracter questions. The stimuli had high ecological validity, as actual magazine pages were used, which comes at a price—the pages did not only differ for body types but also by topics and advertised products. However, given the large number of stimuli used, the ways in which the stimuli differed aside from displayed body types showed much variation and reflected what is naturally found in the real media environment. Furthermore, exposure was assigned and controlled experimentally instead of relying on self-reports that may undermine the validity of causal inferences due to impaired recall and self-selection processes. State measures are used to capture fluctuations in participants’ daily body satisfaction. As state body satisfaction has been shown to fluctuate based on dietary restraint (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0093650211400596">Lattimore &amp; Hutchinson, 2010</xref>) as well as exercise behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0093650211400596">Campbell &amp; Hausenblas, 2009</xref>), these behaviors will be assessed as well as recent media use. In addition, participants accessed the material online instead of a lab setting.</p>
<p>Based on the prior discussion, the following hypotheses are subject to empirical test. The first hypothesis is based on the assumption that natural media messages pertaining to body ideals entail attainability elements and will allow onlookers to view themselves in a positive light, leading to body satisfaction increases. Furthermore, salient (vs. automatic) social comparisons have been demonstrated to reduce the commonly found negative body-ideal exposure impacts, possibly because of self-defensive thoughts. As we suggest a self-enhancing exposure effect in H1, it is unclear whether salient social comparisons foster such self-enhancement even further or counteract positive prolonged exposure impacts as found for negative effects from short-term exposure. Thus we simply propose that the salience of social comparison processes moderate the suggested body satisfaction improvements resulting from body-ideals exposure, without specifying a direction. Furthermore, the first research question addresses impact processes across time, as effects of prolonged exposure to thin-ideal media messages have not been studied so far. Finally, a second research question suggests that the thin-ideal media messages affect body shaping behaviors. Even even though much of the existing literature has focused on engaging only in fantasies of a thinner self; yet, this might translate into actual behavioral outcomes. If this were the case, any increase in body satisfaction could be mediated by these behaviors, as suggested in a third research question.</p>

<title>Overview</title>
<p>Female college students (<italic>n</italic> = 140 with complete data for 7 sessions) participated in an online study that ostensibly dealt with magazine journalism and advertising evaluations. Participants completed a baseline session on a Friday, five “daily exposure sessions” on the following weekdays, and a postmeasure session on the next Monday (see schema of research design in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0093650211400596">Table 1</xref>). The displayed magazine pages differed by experimental group—two experimental groups were exposed to pages with thin-ideal female body types from fashion/fitness magazines; the control group saw newsmagazine pages with images of women, which did not emphasize the thin ideal (“Messages without Body Ideal Focus” group). The two experimental groups differed in that questions about the magazine pages were either designed to evoke social comparisons (“Body Ideal Messages, Social Comparison Induced” group) or dealt solely with issues of layout and content (“Body Ideal Messages Only” group).</p>

<title>Respondents and Group Assignment</title>
<p>The baseline-measures session was completed by 157 individuals; 140 of those participants went on to complete the daily measures and posttest. A hierarchical cluster analysis with the baseline session measures (see related section below for details), using the Ward method and squared Euclidian distances, yielded a four-clusters solution (per scree plot of explained variance) and served to compile the three experimental groups, so that each cluster was represented in each group in proportion to its share in the total sample. This approach served to ensure that the three experimental groups were equivalent regarding baseline measures and combinations thereof.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0093650211400596">
<title>Procedure</title>
<p>Participants were contacted by email; instructors at a large Midwestern university sent a recruitment message to students enrolled in introductory undergraduate classes. The recruitment message informed recipients that college-aged females (18-30 yrs) were invited to participate in an online study on magazine advertising and magazine journalism, with a claim that “This type of consumer research helps us to design more effective messages in future applications.” The total participation time was estimated to be 3 to 4 hours, spread out into seven online sessions (with the specific dates listed), with each session taking a maximum of 30 minutes. Participants were to receive US$50 as monetary compensation through mailed checks. A link in the email provided access to a web site that presented a consent form and a sign-up form. Participation was conducted exclusively through a web site designed specifically for the study. Participants were tracked via login names that they created when they signed up for the study. Upon logging in for a daily session, participants would be greeted with a welcome message that included instructions like the one below.</p>
<p>“Welcome back for a daily session of our online study on magazine advertising and magazine journalism! Today, you will look at 16 magazine pages. [. . .] We will then ask you about your personal impressions and evaluations of these pages. Before we get to this part, we ask you to indicate how satisfied you are TODAY with various aspects of your life. These questions are included in the study because personal outlooks on one’s own life have been shown to influence evaluations. As always, please take your time to respond to the questions and to review the magazine pages.”</p>
<p>After responding to a set of questions in which body satisfaction scales were embedded, participants viewed 16 magazine pages and completed questions after each page. The pages viewed and the questions presented varied by experimental group. Finally, for the postmeasure session, respondents reported body satisfaction and body-shaping behaviors such as dieting or exercising and were debriefed.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0093650211400596">
<title>Experimental Treatment</title>
<sec id="section10-0093650211400596">
<title>Media imagery exposure</title>
<p>Two of the three groups were exposed to messages featuring the thin-ideal body type. The third group was a control group that was exposed to messages that did not pertain to the thin ideal. The stimuli pages were collected from magazines that ranked within the top 100 most popular magazines of 2005 (per <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://magazine.org">magazine.org</ext-link> from the Magazine Publishers of America). The thin-ideal pages were collected from the October/November 2007 issues of <italic>Allure, Women’s Health, Shape, Cosmopolitan, Redbook</italic>, and <italic>Self</italic>. The control group stimuli pages were collected from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0093650211400596">2007</xref> issues of <italic>Newsweek, Time, National Geographic</italic>, and <italic>US News &amp; World Report</italic>.</p>
<p>When selecting the thin-ideal ads, most or all of the body had to be visible, and the shape of the body had to be clear. The thin-ideal articles were not selected for content but for their inclusion of a picture of an idealized female body shape somewhere on the page. Ten article pages and six ads in this group showed celebrities focusing on their physical beauty, for example, what they were wearing at a festive event. None of the pages pertained to celebrities’ life circumstances such as relationships, as the focus was clearly on their appearance. The neutral ads had to include women, but they were of average body type and were wearing modest clothing. The neutral articles were also selected because they contained a picture of a woman that did not represent the thin-ideal body type. This group of pages also featured celebrities such as Hillary Rodham Clinton or Rachael Ray. The content of the articles was secondary and ranged from payday loans and divorce issues to “raising healthy kids.” For both sets of pages, the size and position of the images that featured women varied, but the images were always the dominant graphic element on each page.</p>
<p>The stimuli for each group were divided evenly between advertisements and magazine articles for each of the five exposure sessions. Each group viewed 16 magazine pages a day consisting of eight ads and eight articles for a total of 80 pages in the control group, and a different set of 80 for both experimental groups. The ads and articles were alternated in an ad-article-ad-article pattern. The sequence of the presented pages was counterbalanced by reversing it for the entire set of 80 pages for half of the participants in each experimental group.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0093650211400596">
<title>Media stimuli differentiation</title>
<p>To establish the differentiation between idealized body images and images featuring women without emphasizing the thin ideal, a separate stimuli test was conducted with additional respondents drawn from the same population. Thirty-three female participants completed a paper questionnaire, which presented 20 full magazine pages taken from the 160 stimuli pages used in the main experiment, or 12.5% of the stimuli pages. For each page, the participants responded to the following question on a 9-point scale: “How ideal is the model’s body shape?” The two sets of magazine pages were significantly different, as reflected in an ANOVA with repeated measures for the “ideal” ratings for 10 pages in each of the two sets, <italic>F</italic>(1, 32) = 91.55, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, η<sup>2</sup> = .741. Even the highest rating in the neutral set and the lowest rating from the thin-ideal set were significantly different, <italic>t</italic>(32) = 5.43, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001. The mean “ideal” rating was 7.69 (<italic>SD</italic> = 1.59) for the set of idealized body images and 4.68 (<italic>SD</italic> = 1.15) for pages without body ideal emphasis.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0093650211400596">
<title>Social comparison treatment</title>
<p>All three groups responded to a set of four questions after each magazine page. The control and one experimental group received neutral questions asking about layout and content of the pages. One experimental group (“Body Ideal Messages, Social Comparison Induced” group) was given a set of questions designed to induce social comparisons to the women representing the thin ideal. This method was adopted from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0093650211400596">Tiggemann and McGill (2004)</xref>. There were separate sets of questions for ads and for articles.</p>
<p>The following questions served to induce social comparisons: (1) I like the layout of this ad/article, (2) I would like my body to look like this woman’s body/women’s bodies, (3) This woman is thinner than me/these women are thinner than me, and (4) This ad is effective at promoting its product/The text is effective at explaining the issue(s). For groups for which no social comparisons were induced (“Body Ideal Messages Only” group and “Messages without Body Ideal Focus” group), the following questions were presented: (1) If I saw this ad/article in a magazine, it would catch my eye, (2) I like the layout of this ad/article, (3) This ad makes me interested in the product/The text makes me interested in the topic(s), and (4) This ad is effective at promoting its product/ The text is effective at explaining the issue(s).</p>

<title>Baseline Session Measures</title>
<sec id="section14-0093650211400596">
<title>Media use</title>
<p>Participants were asked about the frequency with which they consumed television, movies in theaters and at home, magazines, music, and online media and how often they had read different types of magazines in the last week (i.e., newsmagazines, sports, entertainment) on a scale from <italic>not at all</italic> to <italic>10 or more times</italic>. The items of actual interest were frequency of fashion (<italic>M</italic> = 1.31, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.68) and fitness (<italic>M</italic> = .51, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.16) magazine consumption. There were no significant differences between the experimental groups for these two variables (<italic>p</italic> = .704/.545).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-0093650211400596">
<title>Body mass index</title>
<p>Participants were asked to report their height and weight, which was later used to calculate body mass index (BMI; <italic>M</italic> = 22.94, mdn = 22.47, <italic>SD</italic> = 3.30). This measure was embedded in other demographic and distracter questions on the same page such as age, ethnicity, length of residence at their current address, car ownership status, and type of Internet connection. Experimental groups did not differ by BMI (<italic>p</italic> = .813).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section16-0093650211400596">
<title>Body satisfaction levels</title>
<p>Questions about body shape and weight satisfaction were embedded in a set of 24 items about current satisfaction in various life domains such as health, finances, family, and so on. Participants were instructed to report their satisfaction for “today.” The response format was a visual analogue scale (VAS). VAS use phrases (i.e., <italic>very satisfied</italic>/<italic>very dissatisfied</italic>) as anchors on a straight line that represents a 400-point scale. Participants could click anywhere on the line to place their mark and drag their mark to any point on the line. VAS were used because they are sensitive to small state changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0093650211400596">Agliata &amp; Tantleff-Dunn, 2004</xref>). Also, because there are no numbers or reference points on the line other than the anchors, it would be harder to recall one’s previous responses from day to day. It is worthwhile noting that participants were by far least satisfied with their weight (<italic>M</italic> = 204, <italic>SD</italic> = 115), followed by finances (<italic>M</italic> = 218, <italic>SD</italic> = 105) and body shape (<italic>M</italic> = 219, <italic>SD</italic> = 106), and then romantic relationship or lack thereof (<italic>M</italic> = 242, <italic>SD</italic> = 122). The two relevant items on body weight and body shape were correlated at <italic>r</italic> = .87 (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .001) and were thus collapsed in a baseline measure of body satisfaction (<italic>M</italic> = 211, <italic>SD</italic> = 105). The experimental groups did not differ by baseline body satisfaction (<italic>p</italic> = .767).</p>

To veil the purpose of the study, these items were mixed with the Iowa–Netherlands Comparison Orientation Measure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0093650211400596">Gibbons &amp; Buunk, 1999</xref>), which is an 11-item scale used to assess the extent to which one compares their life and situation in general to that of others. The PACS was reliable at α = .77 (<italic>M</italic> = 3.24, mdn = 3.20, <italic>SD</italic> = .78). PACS scores did not differ significantly by experimental group (<italic>p</italic> = .458).</p>

<title>Body satisfaction change</title>
<p>The same target items as above were used in the same format as above (embedded in distractor items) for the daily measures to assess state changes in body satisfaction over the course of stimuli exposure. These ratings were collected before the daily exposure to magazine pages, as the interest was to capture overall satisfaction levels and not short-lived impacts of body-image exposure. As mentioned above, the ratings were explained to participants as follows: “These questions are included in the study because personal outlooks on one’s own life have been shown to influence evaluations.” The two target items on body shape and body weight were collapsed for each day into a mean score. To capture change, differences between daily mean scores and the mean score collected right before the first stimuli exposure were computed to represent body satisfaction change per day, resulting in four change scores.</p>

<p>The measure for body satisfaction was presented exactly as in earlier sessions. The two target items on body shape and body weight were again collapsed into a mean score.

<sec id="section22-0093650211400596">
<title>Dieting behavior</title>
<p>This index was developed to assess any weight change that may have occurred by the end of the study, any dieting behavior participants may have engaged in, and whether or not they had exercised in the participation week. Weight change was measured using an open-ended text box where respondents could enter in the amount of weight they had gained and/or lost during the last 7 days. Dieting behavior during last 7 days was measured using a “check yes to all that apply” question, where the response options were <italic>ate smaller portions, cut carbs/sweets, skipped meals, dieted</italic>, and <italic>lost weight in another way</italic>. On average, 1.33 (<italic>SD</italic> = 1.41) behaviors were reported. Exercise behavior was measured using one item that asked how many times the respondent had exercised in the last week (<italic>M</italic> = 2.59, <italic>SD</italic> = 2.20). These items were mixed with three distracter items about buying cosmetics or clothes, or changing one’s hairstyle.</p>

<title>Media Exposure Impacts on Body Satisfaction Change</title>
<p>An analysis of variance was conducted with experimental group as between-group factor and with the five measures of body satisfaction change as repeated measures. The ANOVA utilized baseline body satisfaction, recent reading of fashion and fitness magazines, BMI, and PACS as covariates. The experimental treatment yielded a significant impact, <italic>F</italic>(2, 126) = 3.43, <italic>p</italic> = .036, η<sup>2</sup> = .052. Both groups that were exposed to idealized body messages showed increases in body satisfaction throughout the time period of the study, whereas the control group reported significantly smaller increase in body satisfaction. Indeed, within the control group, body satisfaction did not change significantly from levels right before first exposure. The interaction between the between-group factor of experimental treatment and within-group factor of repeated measures only approached marginal significance (<italic>p</italic> = .137). In addition to the experimental treatment, the covariates of baseline body satisfaction, <italic>F</italic>(1, 126) = 15.68, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, η<sup>2</sup> = .111 and recent consumption of fashion/fitness magazines, <italic>F</italic>(1, 126) = 3.85, <italic>p</italic> = .052, η<sup>2</sup> = .030 affected the dependent measures. In interaction with the within-factor of repeated measures, PACS, <italic>F</italic>(4, 504) = 2.69, <italic>p</italic> = .031, η<sup>2</sup> = .021 as well as baseline body satisfaction, <italic>F</italic>(4, 504) = 3.85, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .000, η<sup>2</sup> = .089 produced significant impacts.</p>
<p>Hence, the analysis showed that exposure to idealized body images led to body satisfaction improvement, supporting H1. Furthermore, no substantial difference resulted from the induction of social comparison with idealized body images, which means H2 was not supported. With regard to RQ1, impact processes across time are illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0093650211400596">Figure 2</xref>.</p>

Given that individuals with higher BMI might feel particularly compelled to engage in dieting when being confronted with idealized body imagery, another parallel ANOVA incorporated BMI as a between-group factor (low vs. high per median split), which found a significant interaction between the experimental group factor and BMI, <italic>F</italic>(2, 125) = 4.25, <italic>p</italic> = .016, η<sup>2</sup> = .064. This interaction is illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0093650211400596">Figure 3</xref>, which compares the three experimental groups, along with subsequent <italic>t</italic> tests of mean differences. Among individuals with high BMI, exposure to idealized body imagery led to more dieting behaviors compared to their counterparts in the control group. Individuals with low BMI who were exposed to idealized body imagery differed in their dieting behavior based on the social comparison induction—mere idealized images exposure led to significantly more dieting behaviors than such exposure combined with social comparison induction, as if the induction made these low-BMI individuals realize that they already were comparatively lean. Participants with low BMI in the control group fell between the two experimental groups with regard to number of reported dieting behaviors.</p>

<title>Indirect effects of Idealized Body Imagery Exposure on Body Satisfaction</title>
<p>A mediation analysis based on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0093650211400596">Preacher and Hayes (2008)</xref> addressed the process suggested in RQ3—did exposure to media messages with idealized body images have an indirect effect on body satisfaction through weight loss behaviors? It should be noted that this is a standard cross-sectional mediation analysis—weight-loss behaviors were only measured in the postmeasure session, as daily questions about them would have sensitized participants to the issue of body image. Body satisfaction change (between level reported right before first magazine pages exposure and postexposure measure 3 days after last exposure) served as dependent measure, idealized body imagery exposure (dichotomous variable, with 1 for the experimental groups and 0 for the control group) served as independent variable, and number of dieting behaviors and exercise frequency served as mediators. Idealized body imagery exposure had a marginally significant impact on exercise frequency (<italic>p</italic> = .081), with .70 more exercise occasions in the last 7 days, but a significant impact (<italic>p</italic> = .048) on dieting, with participants in the experimental groups reporting .50 more dieting behaviors than participants in the control group. This dieting, in turn, affected body satisfaction significantly (<italic>p</italic> = .029), with a 14-increment increase per reported dieting behavior, based on the causal assumptions that guided the mediation analysis. The total effect of idealized imagery exposure on body satisfaction was not significant (<italic>p</italic> = .228; current methodological work on mediation analysis does not consider a significant effect of the independent variable on the dependent variable a precondition for mediation effects; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0093650211400596">Hayes, 2009</xref>). The analyses revealed, with 95% confidence, that the indirect effect of idealized imagery exposure on body satisfaction change through dieting was significant, with a point estimate of 6.73 and a 95% bias-corrected and accelerated (BCa) bootstrap confidence interval of .204 to 19.75.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Dissatisfaction with body weight and shape is so widespread among women that it has long been recognized as a “normative discontent” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0093650211400596">Rodin, Silberstein, &amp; Striegel-Moore, 1985</xref>). The young women in the current sample also indicated their body weight as the aspect of their life they were by far least satisfied with, out of a list of more than 20 diverse domains. However, despite an overwhelming number of correlational and experimental studies attesting to detrimental effects of idealized body media images on onlookers’ body satisfaction, the present study found that such exposure led to an increase in body satisfaction (supporting H1).</p>
<p>Participants who were exposed to thin-ideal messages for 5 days in a row reported body satisfaction increases, whereas no change occurred in the control group that was not exposed to idealized body messages. The increase emerged independent from the induction of social comparisons (contradicting H2). While visual inspection of body satisfaction changes across time suggest that the most substantial shifts occurred a few days after the onset of idealized imagery exposure, the interaction between experimental treatment and time fell short of significance. It is likely that the exposure impacts evolved at a different pace among participants, with both thin-self fantasies and weight loss behaviors being responsible for these impacts. Thus, regarding RQ1, no uniform pattern across time could be identified except for an overall increase of body satisfaction from prolonged exposure.</p>
<p>The unusual finding of a body satisfaction increase after idealized body image exposure must be interpreted in light of the present research design, which aimed to capture processes over time. It differs strongly from much of the prior experimental work, as the current investigation used a prolonged exposure experiment to study delayed and accumulated impacts—body satisfaction was never measured directly after exposure but 1 day later or 3 days after the last of five daily exposure sessions. This approach allowed insights into how women responded to the idealized body imagery exposure by changing their eating and possibly their exercising behavior.</p>
<p>In line with RQ2, the experimental groups differed from the control group by reporting more dieting behaviors, which was moderated by the social comparison induction. While exposure to idealized images without social comparison induction led to more dieting behavior among all participants, exposure to idealized images with social comparison induction fostered more dieting among high-BMI individuals but not among low-BMI individuals who may have felt closer to the presented comparison standards. This difference suggests that, if more processing capacity is allocated to social comparisons, impacts of thin-ideal messages can actually be mitigated (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0093650211400596">Want, 2009</xref>), whereas spontaneous comparisons appear to lead to general impacts. Furthermore, a mediation analysis addressing RQ3 found that the positive impact of idealized body image exposure on body satisfaction was mediated by dieting behaviors. Impacts from exercise behaviors just fell short of significance.</p>
<p>Based on the present analyses with a sample of young American women, exposure to thin-ideal body images leads to more dieting behaviors, possibly more exercising, and ultimately enhances body satisfaction most likely through these mediators. In other words, viewing magazine pages with thin body ideals appears to induce behavior changes and, as a result, increases body satisfaction. These findings are not readily aligned with much of the existing body image research on media impacts. One difference between the current study and much of the prior work (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0093650211400596">Want, 2009</xref>) is that full-page ads and articles, thus real-life stimuli, were used instead of just idealized body <italic>images</italic> from magazines. These real-life stimuli may often combine images of the thin-ideal with messages on its attainability (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0093650211400596">Malkin et al., 1999</xref>) and thus induce self-improvement motivation more so than the mere body dissatisfaction caused by image-only stimuli. Advertisements in particular may convey such attainability. In one of the few studies that found a positive impact of ideal-body messages on body image, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0093650211400596">Myers and Biocca (1992</xref>, p. 127) reasoned that “The young women may have seen the ideal as more attainable and within reach. The commercials invited them to fantasize themselves in their future ideal body.”</p>
<p>Moreover, this area of research consists mostly of cross-sectional surveys and short-term experiments while a few long-term panels have provided longitudinal data. The present study falls between these two time frames of studies that have either focused on immediate or long-term effects. From a middle-term perspective, exposure to those idealized body images can motivate individuals to engage in body-shaping behaviors. This reasoning is in line with the social comparison framework that suggests that upward comparisons serve self-improvement motivations—by comparing with others who are better off, even with stars and celebrities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0093650211400596">Lockwood &amp; Kunda, 1997</xref>), individuals may derive hope to aspire to greater success for themselves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0093650211400596">Thomsen, 2002</xref>). The resulting dietary changes then enhance body satisfaction, at least for the time being, which is in line with other empirical research (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0093650211400596">Lattimore &amp; Hutchinson, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>This middle-term self-enhancing effect can explain the paradox of women engaging in media exposure to images that have self-deflating impacts according to ample body image research on media influences. In hopes for a slimmer body, women may engage in exposure to idealized body messages, which encourage them to diet, and then after engaging in self-improvement behaviors like dieting, they feel better about their bodies. Hence, the motivation derived from such message exposure may subsequently lead women to consume more of these messages in order to maintain the dieting motivation. These considerations were summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0093650211400596">Figure 1</xref> as a model of middle-term effects of body-ideal media messages. Yet the present study did not address selective exposure patterns that are suggested to result from the motivational processes specified by the model.</p>
<p>The present investigation did not pertain to processes and effects beyond a 10-day time frame, but some considerations on such implications will be offered in the following. Dieting is known to result in long-term weight gain for the vast majority of dieters (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0093650211400596">Neumark-Sztainer, Wall, Haines, Story, &amp; Eisenberg, 2007</xref>). As a result, attainability perceptions may eventually change after unsuccessful dieting attempts, which should lead media users to avoid body-ideal messages because of their self-deflating impact in case of perceived low attainability. However, if the lack of success is attributed to oneself (i.e., perceived lack of self-control), the individual may continue attending to body-ideal messages, hoping to diet with more success in the future. Thus media exposure may contribute to a vicious cycle of greater thin-ideal internalization, engaging in dieting that often entails unhealthy eating behaviors, and long-term weight gain; moreover, these processes will typically involve much negative affect, reduction in self-esteem, and potentially the development of a serious eating disorder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0093650211400596">Heatherton &amp; Polivy, 1992</xref>).</p>
<p>The current research has certain limitations. In light of the crucial mediating role of dieting behaviors for media impacts on body satisfaction, the measure of dieting behavior could be refined in future studies. Similar to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0093650211400596">Field et al.’s (1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0093650211400596">2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0093650211400596">2008)</xref> substantial longitudinal studies, we employed a simple ad hoc single-item measure. Capturing dieting behavior through self-report standard scales on restrained eating, however, has proven to be very difficult (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0093650211400596">Stice, Cooper, Schoeller, Tappe, &amp; Lowe, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0093650211400596">Stice, Fisher, &amp; Lowe, 2004</xref>). Another issue is that, despite the cover story and the large number of distracter questions, some participants in the experimental group in which social comparisons were experimentally induced may have noticed the actual research intent. With regards to the stimuli, while they carried high ecological validity, using actual magazine pages also meant that the experimental groups did not differ only in body types they viewed but also in what topics and products were covered in articles and ads, which added some “noise” to the experimental manipulation. However, realistically, ads for a perfume are simply unlikely to show individuals with average body type, while ads for investment funds will rarely show a fragile, scantily dressed female. In other words, there is a trade-off between a perfectly clean experimental manipulation and using stimuli that would normally be encountered in everyday media use. Furthermore, selective exposure mechanisms that have been frequently discussed to channel media impacts on individuals’ response to idealized body images, with the more vulnerable selecting more thin-ideal images and being particularly affected by them (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0093650211400596">Harrison &amp; Cantor, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0093650211400596">Moriarty &amp; Harrison, 2008</xref>), may have even played a role in the forced-exposure design we used. Individuals who did not perceive exposure to idealized imagery as inspiring may have been more likely to drop out of the study—8 women from the ideal imagery exposure group and 6 from the ideal imagery exposure with social comparison group did not complete the study, compared to 3 from the control group. Thus a self-selection process may have slightly strengthened the pattern we found. Finally, the sample size did not allow for detailed examination of mediation processes involving experimental manipulation of social comparison salience, preexisting body concerns and BMI levels, as well as dieting affecting body satisfaction levels.</p>
<p>Future research should test more specifically what processes are at work in the dynamics detected in the present study. One approach to conceptualizing the specific effects processes in future research is chronic accessibility due to repeated priming that may then affect subsequent behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0093650211400596">Roskos-Ewoldsen, Klinger, &amp; Roskos-Ewoldsen, 2007</xref>). Yet, if social comparisons driven by self-improvement motivations are an important factor, then the perceived attainability of the ideals presented in the media should determine whether media users respond to idealized body imagery exposure with behavioral changes to achieve those ideals (if perceived as attainable) or with self-deflation and possibly avoidance (if perceived as unattainable). This reasoning draws on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0093650211400596">Lockwood and Kunda’s (1997)</xref> work and has been tested fruitfully in one short-term experiment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0093650211400596">Knobloch-Westerwick &amp; Romero, 2011</xref>). The stimuli used in the present study—such as ads that may have induced greater attainability of attractiveness standards—were assumed to lead onlookers to perceive thinness as more attainable than stand-alone idealized body images used in other studies. Future research should investigate attainability perceptions induced by natural stimuli more specifically.</p>
<p>The present findings demonstrate that middle-term process data are crucial for understanding how the media may affect recipients with regard to their body esteem and body-shaping behaviors. Moreover, the motivations with which media users attend to thin-ideal imagery deserve further attention. They may explain why not all women are equally susceptible to the negative effects of media images (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0093650211400596">Posavac et al., 1998</xref>). The paradox of media exposure to messages that undermine women’s self-esteem on a crucial dimension (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0093650211400596">Dohnt &amp; Tiggemann, 2006</xref>) needs to be resolved. A better understanding of these processes and motivations should help design more effective interventions and support parents and educators in mediating harmful media effects on body esteem. Fighting a losing battle against body weight, fueled by media exposure to unrealistic ideals, consumes too much of women’s psychological and financial resources and hurts their physical and mental health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0093650211400596">Kilbourne, 1995</xref>).</p>
