<p>The edited volume starts with a small anecdote from the ninth World Youth Festival, which took place in the summer 1968 in Bulgaria. It evokes brief moments of discords between various national European delegations, some from one side of the Iron Curtain, some from the other, at the time of the tensions generated both by the large strikes in May in France and the entry of Soviet tanks in the Czechoslovak capital. This episode, where Western European speakers were joined by Yugoslav and Czechoslovak representatives to condemn the invasion by Soviet tanks of Prague, set the stage for a collection of other moments of “opposition and revolts” in Europe, the focus of this book.</p>
<p>The main aim of the book is to take stock of the “transnational quality of postwar European protest movements” (p. 2) and to go against what the editors consider the dominant interpretative grain about analyses of protests in and around 1968, namely, narratives and myths favoring national viewpoints. Instead, the volume wants to respond to the “transnational turn” and focuses “on sub- or non-state actors operating across borders” and distinguishing these from international (state-to-state) contacts (p. 2). The book is the seventh volume in a series entitled “Protests, Culture and Society,” which aims at understanding the development of both national and transnational civil society. It is a perfect match in this collection, by adding historical depth to what has often been published under the banner of “Europeanization of social movements.”</p>
<p>The book is a neat collection of 16 chapters, ending with a substantial chronology of the protests in Europe in the year 1968. While it does offer a series of valuable studies on nonstate transnational connections and how these generate protest movements outside a given country, the reader can be left at times with a sense of frustration for four main reasons.</p>
<p>First, it is quite obvious that much of the protests that shook 1968 Europe, east and west, cannot be taken in isolation from one another. Hence, part of the claim of novel readings because of the transnational prism of analysis evoked in the introduction can be at times shallow. One expects that the Vietnam War would resonate with radical movements in Europe, or that variants of communist ideologies, which were tried out throughout the world at that critical moment, would acquire a new meaning according to the different local contexts. In other words, it is hard to claim that transnational linkages have been overlooked in previous studies of European protests.</p>
<p>Second, the quality of the different chapters can vary quite substantially. Some texts are very short and offer a simple narrative, and other ones much more elaborate in their interpretation. While there is nothing intrinsically negative with different lengths in the different chapters, and to the credit of the editors the book offers a mixed line up of senior and junior scholars, what can be problematic is the lack of a systematic discussion of the methodology(ies) used by the individual authors. It is not always clear if the single chapters are based on oral history, on archival work, or simply on secondary literature. More editorial work could have helped clarify these essential points which would have, in turn, clarified what is really novel in each of these contributions.</p>
<p>Third, not all authors display an intimate knowledge of what “radical left” can actually mean. The main problem we are thinking of is whether Stalinism is synonymous or not with radical left. If it is, then it is a convenient justification (for this book’s declared aim) to show that other (i.e. non-Stalinist) actors in given countries have been more prone to engage with transnational connections. If one looks beyond the pale of the orthodox communist parties (which have been notorious for their chauvinist tendency of concentrating mostly on domestic issues), it is quite obvious that more transnationalist communist ideologies (Maoism, Trotskyism), or ultra-left groups (situationists, anarchists, council communists) would create links beyond national limits, precisely because such organizations were trying all they could to avoid the stricture of national(ist) politics. Indeed, many authors in this book seem to identify communism with Stalinism, a quite problematic view indeed, which in some texts can lead to views reminiscent of the simplistic accounts generated by the <italic>Livre Noir du Communisme</italic> a decade ago (e.g. Chapter 3 by Thomas Ekman Jorgensen speaking of a “World Communist Movement” without explaining what this movement exactly is, beyond the reference to Stalinist or Maoist groups). Put differently, a lack of nuanced discussion of what radical left might mean in different contexts reinforces the illusion that it is a novelty to find transnational links (and it is not this reviewer’s claim that some authors do not know about such internal divisions inside the radical left, but rather that they should have sharpened their argument and been more explicit in relation to this plurality of leftist views). Otherwise, one would expect transnational links to be at play throughout the countries where revolts erupted in the famed year of 1968.</p>
<p>Fourth and last, the division between the four parts (“I: Politics between East and West,” “II: Protests without Borders,” “III: Media-Staging of Protests,” and “IV: Discourses of Liberation and Violence” followed by an “Epilogue” dedicated to French intellectual Régis Debray, which does not really represent an epilogue, but more of a stand-alone chapter) is not always consistent, or can be seen at times as artificial. Chapter 1 (“‘Out of Apathy’: Genealogies and Meanings of the British ‘New Left’ in a Transnational Context, 1956–1962” by Holger Nehring) and Chapter 3 (“The Left and the Nation in Denmark and Sweden” by Thomas Jorgensen) have more to do with north–south relations, or with colonial linkages or legacies, particularly with the discussion of the British New Left’s connection with the Caribbean in the case of Stuart Hall, or the evocation of Frantz Fanon in the Scandinavian context, than with an East–West question. More generally this minor criticism of the architecture of the book reflects a lack of many of the studies on the “left” movements to engage seriously with the relations between the industrialized northern countries (be they in the “East” or “West”) and the colonial south. And revealingly for our point, Maud Brack has a footnote in her fascinating chapter on the French Communist Party (PCF), where she laments the absence of monograph on the PCF and decolonization (n. 11, p. 81). Such renewed engagement of the more global relations could have also benefitted from thematizing the question of gender, a topic totally absent from all the contributions (except for a side remark about Norwegian TV representation noting the absence of female journalists on p. 192). These two points would force authors and readers to reconsider more globally the emergence of these protest movements and enrich the otherwise rich section on media (Part III), which concentrates marginally on how the south or colonial world is depicted in European media. In other words, we are still in need of more detailed analysis (as some chapters offer) of how “transnationalism” should not only mean east–west, but also north–south, or colonizers–colonized, away from paternalistic innuendos of how the first and second worlds explained to the south how politics should develop. An understanding of how “public” and “private” may differ in terms of gender (a gender unpacking of those terms) could have yielded more nuanced accounts and led the authors to unpack certain categories used in the book. Thus, in Chapter 8, the author would have been better off in pitting “personal” as a category (rather than the “private”) against the “political” to analyze the evolution of the two Communes in East and West Berlin, a conceptual alternative that has been rightly adopted by another contributor in this book, Niek Pas, in Chapter 10 (p. 164).</p>
<p>Beyond these general criticisms, the volume offers some innovative material, and solid individual contributions. Maud Bracke offers detailed research on the PCF elite’s reaction to the massive strikes in 1968, while Chapter 5 reveals an innovative and rich account of the student protests in 1968 Yugoslavia and connects with the current nongovernmental organization (NGO) scene in post-Yugoslavia in the 1990s and 2000s. Chapter 10 (on the mediatization of the Provos) is a subtle account of how international factors influenced the development of the Dutch libertarian Provo movement, while becoming itself a commodified object of transnational duplication. Provo not only inspired but was inspired by a variety of motives that the author analyzes with great attention. Finally, the last two chapters, that of Jacco Pekelder on the <italic>Rote Armee Fraktion</italic> (RAF; Red Army Faction) Solidarity Movement and of Ingrid Gilcher-Holtey’s nine scenes on Regis Debray’s trajectory, contribute to ending the book on stimulating material that one would have expected more systematically throughout the rest of the book. Pekelder’s discussion of how debates on the conditions of detention for RAF militants spread in various countries is an apt approach for the study of transnationalism that goes beyond the ideological identification with various radical groups, and which looks at debated issues as a unit of analysis (rather than as a network of people or organizations).</p>
<p>While readers of <italic>Memory Studies</italic> might not find much material directly relevant for mnemonic studies, some of the chapters implicitly offer stimulating material, for example, about the controversial legacy of the Yugoslavian 1968 student protest (in which future Serbian president Zoran Djindjić featured prominently; Chapter 5, by Boris Kanzleiter), or Chapter 15 (by Jacco Pekelder), which shows how a Solidarity Movement emerged in certain European countries with the RAF, less on the condivision of violence as a means, but on the question of sensory deprivation and question of torture in detention.</p>
<p>The book could have benefited from more rigorous editorship. This would have improved the book further, in particular, on three issues: (a) to make sure that the themes of the four sub-parts are treated systematically; (b) that the methodology would be spelled out more in detail (except for two chapters, which are quite thorough in their elaboration about the “media archaeology” as in Chapter 11 and Chapter 7, which is an interesting account of the linguistic differentiation of international, intercultural, multicultural, cross-cultural or trans-cultural subthemes in German construction of transnationality in German manifestos); and (c) that authors adopt homogenous analytical frames. On the last point, it is worth noting that the book is not only about 1968; at least three chapters have actually little to do with this famous year, so this contributes to undermining the centrality of the theme carried in the title of the book (<italic>Between Prague Spring and French May</italic>), and the fact that the rather detailed chronology placed at the end of the volume deals <italic>only</italic> with 1968. Indeed, some chapters covering pre- or post-1968 events would merit being accompanied by even a brief chronological posting. This little fault also reproduces the myth that 1968 was an essential watershed moment, when in reality, and as some of the authors point out, many European countries faced upheavals well before 1968 (e.g. the Dutch May 1968 was in 1966 (p. 158); but the point has also been made elsewhere in the literature on transnational protests, e.g. in Italy or Switzerland). Readers of this review or of the book (even better!) can also find a host of rich bibliography and chronology per European countries on this very useful website: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.1968ineurope.com">http://www.1968ineurope.com</ext-link>.</p>
<p>Despite these few shortcomings, this volume is a very good contribution to historical studies, and for the study of transnational protest movements. Its strength derives from the variety of cases presented and from its focus on sub- or nonstate actors in a good selection of European countries.</p>
