<abstract>
<p>We explore the paths related to college men’s involvement in all-male antirape prevention groups using in-depth interviews conducted with twenty-five male college students who are active members of such groups from eleven campuses located on the East Coast of the United States. Major themes deriving from analysis of the interviews were all related to the engagement of the participants with the programs on four different levels. These themes, which are developmentally related, are (1) a disclosure which makes sexual assault a <italic>personal issue</italic> at the same time that it reveals a lack of knowledge and skills on the part of the respondents, (2) the evaluation of the <italic>approach</italic> of individual programs, (3) the evaluation of the relative effectiveness of the <italic>approacher</italic>, and (4) the <italic>creation of a social context</italic> which the engagement facilitates. Overall, we find that when the men in our study were approached in a nonconfrontational, alliance-building fashion <italic>by other men, </italic>they reported that their knowledge related to sexual assault, their empathy toward sexual assault survivors, and their motivation to actively engage in the prevention of sexual violence all increased. Thus, we see evidence of a pathway to <italic>behavioral</italic> change represented by the recruitment and participation of men to these programs.</p>

<p>Sexual assault has long been defined as a woman’s problem. As a result, many sexual assault prevention efforts have been directed at women and risk reduction, such as increasing women’s safety outdoors with blue light alert systems or addressing their vulnerability through offering self-defense classes. A 1990 survey of twenty-six universities revealed that, of the twenty-one institutions with sexual assault prevention programs, only two included programs aimed at changing male behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1097184X12458590">Parrot 1990</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1097184X12458590">Schewe and O’Donohue 1993</xref>). While the number of universities incorporating programs aimed at men has increased in recent years, they continue to represent a small minority of the total number of programs aimed at sexual assault prevention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1097184X12458590">Choate 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1097184X12458590">Fabiano et al. 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1097184X12458590">Gold and Villari 2000</xref>) and many are coeducational (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1097184X12458590">Anderson and Whitson 2005</xref> for a review) despite the fact that goals for men’s and women’s sexual assault related programming are not necessarily the same (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1097184X12458590">Gidycz, Orchowski, and Berkowitz 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1097184X12458590">Gidycz, Rich, and Marioni 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>This dearth of specifically male-directed programs continues to exist despite the fact that research has demonstrated such interventions to be successful at changing attitudes of male participants regarding acceptance of rape myths and interpersonal violence as well as increasing empathy toward victims (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1097184X12458590">Anderson and Whitson 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1097184X12458590">Brown &amp; Messman-Moore 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1097184X12458590">Foubert 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1097184X12458590">Foubert and Perry 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1097184X12458590">Johannson-Love and Geer 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1097184X12458590">O’Donohue, Elizabeth, and Fanetti 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1097184X12458590">Paul and Gray 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1097184X12458590">Schewe 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1097184X12458590">Stein 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1097184X12458590">Vladutiu, Martin, and Macy 2011</xref>). These changes are not a matter of reinforcing preexisting beliefs, however, as such programs have shown greater efficacy at changing attitudinal responses of high-risk participants relative to their low-risk counterparts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1097184X12458590">O’Donohue, Elizabeth, and Fanetti 2003</xref>). Aside from the attitudinal change fostered by male-directed intervention efforts, behavioral changes are also seen in a limited number of studies. For instance, five months after participating in such a program, male participants identified specific behavioral changes as a result of their participation. Such changes included no longer telling jokes related to rape, confronting the sexist behavior and language of peers, and increased support of a friend who had been assaulted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1097184X12458590">Foubert, Newberry, and Tatum 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1097184X12458590">Foubert and Perry 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>The present study extends our knowledge of these programs and their effectiveness in two ways. First, by taking a qualitative approach, we are able to gather more detailed information on what exactly participants find effective about such programs than was previously offered. Second, this study offers new information on how such programs affect not just attitudinal change, but provide pathways to behavioral change, specifically in the form of their involvement in moving from program participation to program delivery.</p>

<title>Data Sample and Methods</title>
<p>We explore the paths related to college men’s involvement in all-male antirape prevention groups using responses from in-depth interviews conducted with twenty-five male college students who are active members of such groups from eleven campuses located on the East Coast of the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1097184X12458590">Piccigallo 2008</xref>). The rape prevention groups were organized, official campus groups whose memberships are primarily or exclusively male. Respondents had to be at least eighteen years of age and were located either through the group or institution’s website or by contacting a representative at the Women’s Studies department of the school and requesting the contact information for the group’s president. In order to be considered an active member, the men had to attend group meetings and to participate in group functions as opposed to simply being listed as a member of the group. Four respondents were men of color and twenty-one of the men identified as white. Most of the respondents were either seniors or juniors in college (nine men in each category) followed by three sophomores, two freshmen, one graduate student, and one recently graduated senior, with the age range from eighteen to twenty-seven (the graduate student was twenty-seven; the average age was twenty). About half attended a private college or university, while the other half attended a public institution.</p>
<p>Interviews were semistructured and respondents were asked questions about specific topics and were given the opportunity to raise additional issues and offer their own input on issues they deem salient; since many questions were open-ended, participants provided more detailed and richer responses without feeling constrained to a predetermined set of answers or testing hypotheses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1097184X12458590">Bachman and Schutt 2007</xref>). The majority of the men preferred to be interviewed over the phone, although several interviews were conducted face to face, and five were interviewed online.</p>
<p>A grounded theory approach was used to analyze the interview data. Grounded theory methods are ideal in order to facilitate the exploration of a substantive area about which little research has been conducted and hypothesis testing is not needed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1097184X12458590">Straus and Corbin 1998</xref>). Grounded theory allows using both inductive and deductive methods (Patton 2002) and previous studies on male-directed rape prevention programs provide a source of possible categories for data analysis while simultaneously facilitating the emergence of additional themes and new categories. Open coding was used to identify parts of the transcripts that lead to an understanding of categories and their meanings. To qualify as a theme, at least five of the men had to include a particular concept in their responses although, as with most of the themes that emerged, an overwhelming majority of respondents raised and discussed the issue. The major themes that we identified through analysis of the interviews were all related to the engagement of the participants with the program on four different levels. These themes, which are developmentally related, are (1) a disclosure which makes sexual assault a <italic>personal issue</italic> at the same time that it reveals a lack of knowledge and skills on the part of the respondents, (2) the evaluation of the <italic>approach</italic> of individual programs, (3) the evaluation of the relative effectiveness of the <italic>approacher</italic>, and (4) the <italic>creation of a social context</italic> which the engagement facilitates.</p>

<title>“My Jaw Dropped:” Making Sexual Assault a Personal Issue</title>
<p>The men in this study identified one of the primary motivations for their participation in these groups was a personal issue, such as knowing someone who had been assaulted. This motivation falls in line with Casey and Smith’s (2010) finding that men’s exposure to a sensitizing experience is one of the initial pathways to men’s involvement in antiviolence against women work. It helps create the empathy that prior research has shown as necessary to affect attitudinal and behavioral change in regard to sexual assault and provides the personal link that creates the sense of being a stakeholder for many men. Indeed, for over three-quarters of the men in our sample, personal issues were a motivating factor for becoming involved in the antirape organization. Seven of the men explained that hearing personal stories from female victims helped influence factor their decision to join an antirape group. An additional ten men personally knew someone who had been sexually assaulted, and three mentioned their concern for women in their lives. Harold, a senior, illustrated the power of this motivation,</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>Back when I was in high school, I dated this girl for about a year and a half and after we broke up . . . the year before I came to college . . . she had contacted me . . . and she told me that she had been raped over the summer . . . I really didn’t know what to do or how to handle the situation because this was like the first time that I had ever come in contact with it and I’ve never really like even learned about sexual assault or like what it was or anything like that. So through that event . . . I knew I wanted to do something to help this issue and educate people and stuff like that, just help prevent these kinds of occurrences. And so that’s the event that kind of led up to me joining the group.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Lonnie, another senior, recounted a similar experience,</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>Spring of my sophomore year I began dating a woman who was a senior at [my school] at the time. She had been the victim of sexual assault the winter of that year . . . over the course of our relationship she pretty quickly began to tell me first that it had happened, and then some more details about the incident, her recovery process, how she thought about her attacker, and other things, giving me a lot of insight into the effects of sexual violence that I otherwise wouldn’t have.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Henry, also a senior, discussed his reaction to a close friend’s disclosure of victimization,</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>My jaw dropped. I was crushed beyond words; I didn’t think this happened in small towns, especially not to people I knew. Rape happened on “Law and Order,” not in my high school.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In each case, these three men not only pointed to their personal connection to someone who had been assaulted as a motivation to action, they also recounted their general ignorance of the issue prior to these disclosures and a lack of skills related to handling such disclosures when they do occur. These stories illustrate what is a common situation for many men: prior to being confronted by someone who had been victimized, they had never given the issue of sexual violence much thought. Indeed, with the exception of three men, who all coincidentally attended the same school that had institutionalized a freshman orientation focused on sexual assault, all of the men in our study spoke about the lack of awareness of the issue among men in general that leaves them unequipped to deal with the issue when confronted with it. The fact that only three of our participants had been part of any formalized discussion related to sexual assault prior to a personal disclosure is telling and reinforces the idea that sexual violence is, fundamentally, a woman’s problem.</p>
<p>Without question, we feel that engaging men in the conversation is a necessary and important step. Yet, as far as policy and programmatic implications are concerned, it is neither possible nor preferable to rely on this <italic>personal</italic> link in order to engage men and foster empathy on their part. A primary reason for this is that such reliance still leaves men unequipped to effectively and supportively respond to disclosures when they do occur. Moreover, without this skill set in place, one could argue that the potential for such disclosures to occur would be lessened for fear, on the part of the female victim, of how the man might react. This is why many programs attempt to build empathy by centering on, or including, the stories of victims. This approach accounts for engaging men and can be effective (seven of the men said that hearing stories about women’s victimization on campus, whether they were friends, classmates, <italic>or strangers</italic> helped motivate them to join), yet they are not necessarily ideal. Effectively, this approach places the onus for increasing men’s knowledge and empathy related to sexual assault on those who have been victimized. Obviously, there are those who are more than willing to share their personal stories and are quite effective and transformational educators. Still, this approach represents only one strategy used to engage men in the discussion toward preventing sexual violence. Aside from sexual assault becoming a personal issue via disclosure, our research uncovered three additional themes related to men’s involvement in these types of programs that represent the major contributions of this article. These themes are the approach of the program, who is doing the approaching, and the social context that the program fosters.</p>

<title>“We Don’t Blame You:” The Importance of the Approach</title>
<p>Sexual assault prevention programs that show greatest effectiveness at generating attitudinal and behavioral changes approach men as potential allies, not as potential rapists. Whether or not men have ever committed a sexually coercive act, the fact remains most men do not view themselves as potential rapists and are prone to rejecting educational interventions that focus on men as potential perpetrators. Conversely, men respond more positively when approached as potential helpers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1097184X12458590">Scheel et al. 2001</xref>). Not only does such an approach preempt any potential defensiveness to the topic on the part of participants, it also renders men stakeholders in what has traditionally seemed to them a topic that only affects women. For instance, one respondent, Geoff, indicated that not seeing oneself as stakeholder is a primary obstacle to changing men’s attitudes and/or behaviors:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>I think a big thing is that people see it [sexual assault] as a women’s issue and I think a lot of men are like, you know, “I’m not the one being raped; I don’t need to know exactly what acquaintance rape is.” I think that’s . . . probably the big problem with just not having an awareness of what it is.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>One successful way that men are rendered stakeholders in these programs is by focusing on male-on-male rapes as opposed to male-on-female. Research has shown that casting the male in the role of victim leads to significant increases in empathy as well as declines in rape myth acceptance and men’s likelihood of raping women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1097184X12458590">Foubert 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1097184X12458590">Foubert and Marriott 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1097184X12458590">Foubert and McEwen 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1097184X12458590">Gilbert, Heesacker, and Gannon 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1097184X12458590">Schewe and O’Donohue 1993</xref>). Some (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1097184X12458590">Davis 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1097184X12458590">Lee 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1097184X12458590">Scarce 1999</xref>) have expressed concerns over utilizing this approach and its potential to use homophobia as a foundation for empathy. In light of these concerns, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1097184X12458590">Berkowitz (2002</xref>) has suggested that programs can enhance victim empathy by including both male and female victim perspectives. Still, the men in our study gave us insight as to why this particular approach might be effective in, at least, <italic>initially</italic> engaging men in the discussion:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>. . . it’s the idea that learning about a male being raped gives guys, for the first time often, the ability to put themselves in the shoes of being a rape survivor. And so that really helps us to have a pretty meaningful discussion about what it might feel like to be raped, what you can do to help, things like that, and building empathy within guys . . . Once guys talk and the video is over, we often try to translate it into the terms of what it means for a female survivor (Ralphy).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In this sense, then, the video is used toward engaging men in a discussion that they have traditionally felt had nothing to do with them and to give them an opportunity to empathize with a victim of a crime with which they have a limited understanding.</p>
<p>Another respondent, Trevor, discussed how the development of this empathy can then translate into behavior;</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>Instead of treating men as potential rapists (like a lot of programs do) we’ve decided to take an approach of education based on empathy—help the men understand what it might feel like to be raped, help them realize that it can happen to <italic>anyone,</italic> including those they love, and you can really start affecting the way they go about their own personal prevention efforts.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Other men expressed the importance of this nonconfrontational, alliance-building approach but also indicated that something more may be involved. Drew remarked that,</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>… it’s good for us as <italic>guys</italic> to deliver the message because . . . it’s not like just a woman’s issue. Everyone should care about it and <italic>we’re uniquely in a position to say</italic>, we know that you guys have sat through programs before where they get up in front of you and they basically chastise you for being part of the problem when we don’t think that you raped anyone, we don’t blame you for rape. We want you to understand what you can do to help your friend if she is assaulted. So I think that that’s really effective for us because<italic> it is a peer group </italic>and . . . we can get the guys to sort of step outside what they might think about rape and reconsider it.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This represents the other component of the approach that makes such prevention efforts effective: the fact that these male-directed programs are delivered by other men.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1097184X12458590">
<title>“When Men Talk, It’s ‘Us’, It’s ‘We,’”: The Importance of the Approacher</title>
<p>When we asked our respondents what they believed was “the best way to get male students involved in the prevention of acquaintance rape,” most of the men in our study emphasized how “having men talk to other men” was one of the key and most effective components of the groups. We also asked them if it made a difference if the information was given by females or males. They all gave several reasons why men would be more receptive to hearing these messages from other men as opposed to women. While Harold contended that men are just “more comfortable being open with each other when it’s just guys,” Ralphy attributed at least part of the difference to the novelty of the message/messenger combination:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>I think it’s an unexpected situation because you’re so used to hearing different messages from your male friends that hearing guys say that it’s cool to care about sexual violence and it’s cool to stand up against it, it’s in some ways so novel and so bizarre for these guys that it’s something that they listen to and that they remember because it is different.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Clark and Marc both talked about the more typical message/messenger combination and how that is typically received:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>I think when women talk about sexual assault to men, men get on the defense . . . just go straight to the defense . . . when women, men like to stereotype, but usually when women talk about this, it’s “you men, you men” . . . and . . . when you use the word “you” you’re automatically on the defense . . . when men talk, it’s “us,” it’s “we,” you know, you’re involving yourself so it’s easier to talk about it . . . men to men. (Clark)</p>
<p>I believe it’s more effective if they’re [men] actually being told by other males because . . . the typical male who’s not terribly aware of the issue may see a female as coming off as lecturing them or complaining or something, or assuming that they are a perpetrator, and that may turn a person off when it comes to getting them to listen and try to persuade them. (Marc)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Other respondents point to this tendency to pay greater attention to men as a reflection of male privilege:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>… just from . . . some latent or inherent sexism, I feel that men would probably respond better if they’re hearing this from another male, which is why I thought [it] was such a good group . . . I wanted to, you know, be able to get men talking with other men about issues of rape and domestic violence. (Geoff)</p>
<p>I think the presentation has to be given by males because I’ve seen presentations presented by women and I know that I respect women, but at the same time, it doesn’t come across in the same way because guys just respect guys more, just the way the world is set up, men have a lot of advantages over women. So if a man is telling other men that this is a problem, the guys will listen. I wish it wasn’t set up like that, but I realize we have to use this strategy. (Sal)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>While all of the above quotations are couched in terms of why the “typical male” would react more favorably to a male presenter, it is interesting to note that the men in this program also seem to be affected by the norms and evaluations of their male peers to a greater degree than they are by those of females. For example, when asked about their friends’ reactions to their participation in a male-led rape prevention group, more than half of the men described only the feedback they had received from male friends. This may be due to the fact that, among those who specifically described reactions by female friends, such reactions tended to be mainly positive while the reactions of male friends tended to be mixed, ranging from supportive, indifferent, and questioning of their motivations, to dismissive and insulting. Still, it is interesting that the majority of the men tended to focus solely on the feedback of their male friends.</p>
<p>One potential explanation for these findings is the peer relationship of the men in the group. While Anderson and Whitson’s (2005) meta-analysis of sexual assault prevention programs found that those led by professionals were more effective at positively changing rape-related attitudes and behavioral intentions, other research not included in this meta-analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1097184X12458590">Audrey, Holliday, and Campbell 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1097184X12458590">Clements and Buczkiewicz 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1097184X12458590">DiClemente 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1097184X12458590">Finn 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1097184X12458590">Jarvis 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1097184X12458590">Milburn 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1097184X12458590">Perry 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1097184X12458590">Sloane and Zimmer 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1097184X12458590">Woodcock, Stenner, and Ingham 1992</xref>) shows peer-led programs to be more successful.</p>
<p>This discrepancy in the research may be a result of two things. First, what is being measured. Research has shown that while nonpeer/adult educators are more effective than peer educators at transferring information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1097184X12458590">Mellanby et al. 2001</xref>), peer educators are more effective at transferring norms, values, and attitudes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1097184X12458590">Audrey, Holliday, and Campbell 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1097184X12458590">Mellanby et al. 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1097184X12458590">Milburn 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1097184X12458590">Sloane and Zimmer 1993</xref>). Along with the family, peer-friendship groups are the most important of “those groups which control individuals’ major sources of reinforcement and punishment and expose them to behavioral models and normative definitions” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1097184X12458590">Akers et al. 1979</xref>, 638). Moreover, not only does peer education positively affect the audience, research has also indicated that peer education has a self-reinforcing effect on the educators in that they tend to absorb and commit to the messages that they deliver in the prevention programs (Kelly et al.1991; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1097184X12458590">National Hemophilia Foundation 1994</xref>; O’Hara et al. 1996; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1097184X12458590">Rickert, Jay, and Gottlieb 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1097184X12458590">Slap et al. 1991</xref>). These peer effects have been seen in programs on topics including smoking prevention, alcohol and drug use prevention, as well as forms of sexual education, including the encouragement of condom use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1097184X12458590">Audrey, Holliday, and Campbell 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1097184X12458590">Clements and Buczkiewicz 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1097184X12458590">DiClemente 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1097184X12458590">Jarvis 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1097184X12458590">Perry 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1097184X12458590">Woodcock, Stenner, and Ingham 1992</xref>).</p>
<p>Second, if we extend our operationalization of peer networks to include not only status but also gender in this sense, we can find another potential explanation for the discrepancy in the research listed above. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1097184X12458590">Kimmel (2010</xref>) has discussed the homosocial nature of men’s relationships and its impact on the construction of a heterosexist and sexist masculinity (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1097184X12458590">Schwartz and DeKeseredy 1997</xref>). At the same time, however, we must also see the homosocial nature of men’s relationships as an entry way, or starting point, for reconstructing masculinity toward nonviolence. In other words, if male peer support serves to encourage and promote violence against women, then male peers who confront and openly oppose sexist attitudes and behavior may help discourage and possibly prevent such violence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1097184X12458590">DeKeseredy and Schwartz 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1097184X12458590">Schwartz and DeKeseredy 1997</xref>). Indeed, recent research has found that perceived <italic>peer</italic> attitudes toward sexual assault were a significant predictor of willingness to intervene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1097184X12458590">Brown &amp; Messman-Moore 2010</xref>). Thus, the personal issue or the increased empathy may provide the desire to “do something” but it is the nonconfrontational, ally-building approach by <italic>other men</italic> that provides a structured outlet for this desire. Moreover, this peer effect is also reflective of what may be seen as the most powerful contribution of this study; the extension of the peer influence into the creation of a new social context that gives men cultural permission to “do something” about sexual assault.</p>

<title>“A . . . Thing that Men Rarely Get to Do:” The Creation of a New Social Context</title>
<p>Many of the men in our study discussed how the homosocial characteristic of the programs was part of their appeal. This finding is supported by narrative analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1097184X12458590">Vladutiu, Martin, and Macy 2011</xref>) that has shown single-sexed programs affecting greater behavioral change in participants than those programs directed at mixed-sex audiences. Likewise, some meta-analysis has shown single-sexed programs also result in greater attitudinal change than their mixed-sex counterparts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1097184X12458590">Brecklin and Forde 2001</xref>). The meta-analysis conducted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1097184X12458590">Anderson and Whitson (2005</xref>), however, finds the evidence for same sexed programs to be more complicated. While the authors found larger effect sizes for males in mixed-sex programs, they were unable to find any statistically significant difference between outcomes for males in single-sexed versus mixed-sex programs. As for females, the authors found that both mixed- and single-sexed programs resulted positive attitudinal change, though the effect size for the latter was not statistically significant and was based on only three studies. In terms of behavioral intentions, however, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1097184X12458590">Anderson and Whitson (2005</xref>) found tentative evidence (based on only four studies) that single-sexed programs were effective in producing positive change whereas mixed-group settings were not. The evidence gathered in this study extends our understanding of the debate in that it operationalizes the peer effect as one involving both gender and status.</p>
<p>Many of the men described the all-male aspect as the main reason they joined the group and 84 percent of the men stated their feeling that, to get male students involved, it would be more effective if the messenger were male as opposed to female. While most research to date has focused on attitudinal change or the projection of, and plans for, future behavioral change; here we have evidence of <italic>behavioral</italic> change in the recruitment and participation of men to these programs. Thus, it becomes intervention on a larger scale that not only affects one’s immediate peer group but also acquaintances and program participants.</p>
<p>In a comment that was echoed by the majority of our respondents, Ralphy discussed his motivation to join,</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>… the major reason that I got involved when I decided to . . . was because the guys I knew that asked me to get involved were guys I looked up to, who I trusted a lot, and who I had a lot in common with, and who I also thought had similar values and abilities, so that was a huge factor.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Sammy reinforced this sentiment by explaining the power of the peer effect in recruiting members,</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>It’s always hard to get guys involved [in sexual assault prevention]. A lot of guys don’t want to touch the issue. I think really you just have to find the guys who are willing and eventually they start pulling more and more guys in and making other guys feel comfortable getting guys involved in it.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>While groups relied heavily on nomination of new members by current members (as P. J. stated, It’s difficult to judge a man’s character by a résumé), and over half of the men responding knew members of the group prior to joining, the peer effect was also present among men who knew each other only as acquaintances or classmates. For example, Ari noted that he saw in particular members “examples of . . .  [what] I wanted to be on campus: student leaders, outspoken for a good cause, etc.” In this way, peer exposure affects not only the attitudes of program participants but the recruitment of peers to the program functions as a self-replicating and perpetual peer-based intervention proven to affect both attitudinal and behavioral change. At schools where the group was well established, active, and strong, the self-replicating mechanism of peer recruitment tended to be the strongest and the status and prestige of the group and its members increased exponentially. That is, as the reputation of the group grew, recruitment of influential peers became easier which, in turn, helped further grow the group’s reputation. Ralphy discussed this process in recounting the role the positive reputation of the group had on his decision to join and recruit his friends:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>It was a pretty well-known group on campus and a group that a lot of, I guess you could say “higher-profile students” were involved in, which was lucky because it meant that, in some ways, it was cool to be a part of “One in Four” at my undergrad and so I was never embarrassed or quiet about it.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Trevor made similar remarks:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>I mean, these guys were really cool. They were the kinds of guys you really looked up to and wanted to be like . . . .A lot of our members were really guys’ guys and well-liked throughout the University community. Not only did that contribute to our well-attended meetings, but I also feel like it made us very effective in our message to other men. Since we were “normal guys” it was easy for them to relate to us and our experiences and they seemed very willing to open up and listen.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Oscar, a junior, also echoed the importance of the influential status of a peer recruiter and educator,</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>… the main person who I knew in the group was someone who a lot of people respected . . . He was a good athlete, but also someone who people really respected for other reasons. He cared a lot and what not . . . having him as a role model I think played a big part.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Together, these comments indicate the importance of the charismatic leader (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1097184X12458590">Weber 1948</xref>) in the recruitment of young men to the program. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1097184X12458590">Casey and Smith (2010</xref>, 969) remark, the “project of engaging men and encouraging them to view themselves as allies is therefore perhaps best done individually through existing social networks and by admired peers.” If college men can be influenced by a presentation delivered by other men, it is no surprise that this influence might grow and encourage participation when the messenger is a high-status male, an insight consistent with the literature on peer to peer education and opinion leaders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1097184X12458590">Audrey, Holliday, and Campbell 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Research also indicates that the continued involvement of peer educators with the men they are trying to reach is key to changing norms and behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1097184X12458590">Stein 2007</xref>). Instead of being limited to a one-time presentation, this charismatic peer effect of the programs shifted, by way of recruitment, to a continuing relationship. Trevor expressed how these normative organizations became a new kind of social network/peer group that addressed the expressive and social needs of the men involved,</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>Often our meetings deal mostly with business of the group, but it’s still a lot of fun. It’s really just a bunch of guys getting together and joking around . . . However, it can go from “guy time” to a serious discussion very quickly . . . I used to really enjoy being able to have serious discussions with other men about masculinity, the things that society expects from us as guys and which things were bullshit, the kinds of things that are going on in the world that were fucked up, and also the ability to share personal stories that really affect us but we rarely get to share because we really don’t have any place to do it. I remember one meeting . . . one of the guys in the group (who I thought was just the coolest guy ever) broke down and cried when he was telling us about his grandfather dying. That was amazing. Knowing it was a safe place to do something like that, but also knowing that you could still be treated like a “real man”—that was a rare thing that men rarely get to do.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Robert made similar comments about the difference between this new social context and the normal homosocial relationships to which men are subject,</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>… there’d be a more informal discussion afterwards and it was just for guys . . . you didn’t have to talk about male things, but often that’s what people used this space for because they thought that it’s not very common to have a serious, all-male setting. A lot of the guys [in the group] went to that because that was probably the best thing we could do to kind of challenge the sort of masculine . . . things that we thought were part of the problem.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Together, these stories help illustrate the fact that these organizations become self-sustaining in two ways. First, they rely on the power of influential males to draw otherwise reluctant participants into the organization. Yet, these programs also become self-sustaining in that they provide a supportive peer network for the men involved. Thus, aside from serving the manifest normative functions, participation in organizations such as these also operate to meet the expressive and social needs of the men involved.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Sexual assault prevention programs are increasingly informed by research showing programs directed at men to be successful at changing pro-rape attitudes and behaviors of male participants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1097184X12458590">Anderson and Whitson 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1097184X12458590">Brown &amp; Messman-Moore 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1097184X12458590">Foubert 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1097184X12458590">Foubert and Perry 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1097184X12458590">Johannson-Love and Geer 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1097184X12458590">O’Donohue, Elizabeth, and Fanetti 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1097184X12458590">Paul and Gray 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1097184X12458590">Schewe 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1097184X12458590">Vladutiu, Martin, and Macy 2011</xref>). This article extends our knowledge of these programs and their effectiveness by offering more detailed information than was previously available. The men in our study have indicated what exactly they find effective about such programs, and have offered us insight on the mechanisms that affected their behavioral change, specifically in the form of movement from program participation to group membership and program delivery. Specifically, we find that when the men were approached in a non confrontational, alliance-building fashion <italic>by other men, </italic>they reported that their knowledge related to sexual assault, their empathy toward sexual assault survivors, and their motivation to actively engage in the prevention of sexual violence all increased. This last effect represents the major contribution of this study and is seen in the 84 percent of men in our study who discussed the impact of the peer effect on their decision to join such programs. Additionally, it is evidence of the self-sustaining and reproductive nature of these organizations.</p>
<p>Moreover, male-directed and male-led peer to peer education programs such as these help create and foster alternative social networks and peer groups. As such, these groups operate beyond their normative organizing principles and serve to meet the expressive and social needs of the men involved. In doing so, the organization functions as a supportive system that helps bond the men involved to one another, as well as the organization, in a fashion that helps ensure its continuance.</p>
<p>There are certainly limitations regarding our findings. First, a disproportionate number of the men in the sample were white and it is unclear if there are additional pathways to involvement for other populations or if the same pathways would hold as much import. Likewise, the programs in which our participants were members are all located on the East Coast, so there may also be regional effects that are unaccounted for in our data. When sensitive material is being discussed, there will always be a concern of social desirability and the possibility that respondents might underreport behaviors regarded as undesirable in order to present a favorable image of their selves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1097184X12458590">Johnson and Fendrich 2002</xref>). While it is possible that the men’s responses in this study were influenced in this manner, it did not appear that the men were purposely giving false answers in order to improve their image. It is possible that the men felt their membership in these organizations was sufficient means to present a positive self-image and, as a result, there may not have been a need to provide any false or misleading information.</p>
<p>The interviews did not include questions to address concerns of homophobia and heterosexism arising from the homosocial nature of the programs and their reliance on male-on-male sexual assaults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1097184X12458590">Davis 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1097184X12458590">Kimmel 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1097184X12458590">Lee 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1097184X12458590">Scarce 1999</xref>). This omission represents another limitation of these data and this line of questioning should have been included in the design and execution of the study. This is especially important, given Trevor’s remark about a lot of the members being “guys’ guys.” Future research should examine these issues directly.</p>
<p>Additionally, the gender of the researcher can also affect the research process. Having a woman interview men about an issue that has typically been regarded as a woman’s issue might affect the men’s willingness to openly talk about their experiences or beliefs toward the issue. Yet, prior research has found that female interviewers may actually facilitate the research process and allow for more open and honest dialogue with participants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1097184X12458590">Mansley 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1097184X12458590">Meloy 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1097184X12458590">Scully 1990</xref>). Considering that the fundamental topic of the interviews, however, the gender dynamic of the interviewer and participants may have actually reduced any potential social desirability bias.</p>
<p>Finally, the ability to interview men who attend such programs but do not decide to join might problematize some of our conclusions. That said, we believe that the data provided by the men in our sample offer us valuable insights regarding both policy and future research.</p>
<p>While the men in our sample provide a contextualization of the pathways to involvement in male-centered peer to peer prevention efforts, prior research, as well as the related experience of men in our sample, indicates that such programs are somewhat rare. To that end, we would suggest that college and university administrations actively and formally seek to establish, institutionalize, support, and to further evaluate such programs on their campuses to supplement and compliment existing efforts. The impact of these programs could be exponentially increased with university support in the form of access to freshman orientation, fraternal and athletic organizations, as well as classes across the campus in addition to access to academic resources in the form of evaluation and assessment. Since the majority of the men in our study also pointed to the fact that they were not exposed to such groups until reaching college, we would further suggest that the college or university partner with area junior and senior high schools in the community. By doing so, the effectiveness and outreach of these organizations could be maximized. The college or university, in partnership with the local schools, could also help establish similar programs at the pre- and secondary levels. Such partnerships have previously been proven effective at the reduction in school-based violence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1097184X12458590">Renfro, Huebner, and Ritchey 2003</xref>) and the institutionalization of similar programs aimed at the reduction of sexual violence could work to increase the knowledge and empathy of incoming students, potentially stemming any future issues at the postsecondary level.</p>
<p>As with any outcome-oriented program, it is important to continuously assess and evaluate their effectiveness. While qualitative studies such as ours are valuable in providing insight and context into meanings and behaviors of its participants, we join others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1097184X12458590">Teten Tharp et al. 2011</xref>) in calling for rigorous outcome evaluation in the form of quantitative studies as well.</p>
<p>We also want to be clear that we are not calling for the replacement of existing efforts with male-led and male-centered programs. Rather, our evidence suggests that such programs may be beneficial to engaging men in the discussion and providing them with the structured opportunity to address sexual assault and act as complimentary and supplementary efforts. In working to prevent sexual assaults, with all their attending individual and social consequences, it is crucial that we look toward multiple levels of intervention. While we feel that programs such as blue light alert systems, self-defense classes, and other programs largely aimed at women as potential victims are valuable and should not be discarded, we also believe that they represent only part of the solution. Moreover, when we package and present these risk reduction programs as <italic>preventative</italic> measures, we run the risk of sending the signal to females who are sexually assaulted that the incident was somehow their fault. Young women replay the incident in their head alongside the lessons taught by these programs and try to find where they went wrong; what precautions they did not employ that the self-defense program would have had them take, or what “mistakes” they might have made that the sexual assault program warned them not to.</p>
<p>For true prevention, men must be engaged. If they are not, we run the risk of more situations where young men like Harold are left unprepared and unequipped to adequately support friends who disclose their victimization. Moreover, we also leave uninterrupted and unchallenged norms of masculinity that are rape supportive. This last point is central to our position that men must begin to engage other men in this discussion in a way that is supportive but also challenging without being confrontational. Men must have the conversation that expresses how, in Ralphy’s words, “it’s cool to care about sexual violence and it’s cool to stand up against it.”</p>
