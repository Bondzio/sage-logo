<abstract>
<p><bold>Purpose:</bold> To explore the experiences and feelings of pediatric nurses who care for hospitalized children that are unaccompanied by their parents. <bold>Design and Methods:</bold> This phenomenological study consisted of interviews with 12 pediatric nurses. Verbatim transcriptions were reviewed with participants and analyzed. <bold>Findings:</bold> Pediatric nurses viewed the circumstances of unaccompanied hospitalized children through the perspective of their own life-worlds. They used both cognitive and emotional constructs to describe the phenomenon. Nurses’ perceptions were affected by day-to-day contingencies of their life worlds which come through the four dimensions of space, mind/body, time, and relationships. These perceptions affected their assessment of parents’ situated contexts. Nurses’ assessments could lead to negative judgments of parents because they worried about ill effects on the unaccompanied children. Meanwhile,nurses often perceived that parents demonstrated trust when they relegated their child’s care to them. <bold>Conclusions:</bold> Pediatric nurses dealt with increased emotional work while remaining compassionate with their patients. Nurses indicated that they needed to understand their own life-worlds andthatparents’ day-to-day contingenciesmay affect parents’ ability to remain with their hospitalized children. Participants were aware of judgmental attitudes which could interfere with the development of therapeutic relationships with parents, and therefore, with hospitalized children.</p>

<title>Background and Significance</title>
<p>Between World War I and the 1950s in the United States and England, parents were not allowed to remain with their hospitalized children. This philosophy was most likely the result of difficulties in maintaining infection control before the widespread use of antibiotics and a more paternalistic attitude in health care. This attitude began to change after World War II, and psychologists such as John Bowlby began to study the effects of family separation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0898010111423422">Jolley &amp; Shields, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>The current environmental context at pediatric hospitals is the philosophy of family-centered care (FCC). The Institute for Family-Centered Care (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.familycenteredcare.org">www.familycenteredcare.org</ext-link>) core concepts include respect and dignity, information sharing, participation, and collaboration. Each of these concepts require some level of parental presence in practice. Pediatric nurses strive to provide holistic care and seek to become therapeutic partners with the child’s family. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0898010111423422">Shields, Hunter, and Hall’s (2004)</xref> research found that staff’s need for parental presence was not being met. The research demonstrated a discrepancy between perceptions of nurses and parents about how much parental presence is adequate.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0898010111423422">
<title>Literature Review</title>
<p>Although there are some nursing studies documenting the effect of parental presence on hospitalized children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0898010111423422">Daneman, Macaluso, &amp; Guzzetta, 2003</xref>), there is a dearth of research about parental absence. Two studies were published to reveal nurses’ perceptions of unaccompanied hospitalized children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0898010111423422">Livesley, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0898010111423422">Zengerle-Levy, 2006</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0898010111423422">Livesley’s (2005)</xref> qualitative study conducted in England revealed that nurses felt an emotional burden when caring for unattended children. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0898010111423422">Zengerle-Levy (2006)</xref> found that pediatric burn unit nurses believed their therapeutic role was to help unaccompanied children sustain human connections. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0898010111423422">Roberts’s (2010)</xref> incidence study substantiated that children do spend time alone in the hospital. However, there are even fewer studies about children’s or parents’ perspective of parental absence.</p>
<p>Hospitalized children’s voices were heard in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0898010111423422">Wilson, Megel, Enenbach, and Carlson’s (2010)</xref> study. Through the researcher’s made-up stories to children about hospitalization, “being alone” was mentioned more often than any other phenomenon. Aloneness meant sadness, fear, uncertainty, and boredom for these children. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0898010111423422">Bjork, Nordstrom, and Hallstrom’s (2006)</xref> qualitative study of young children with cancer reviewed that their most salient need was to have their parents present with them. In <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0898010111423422">Wright’s (1995)</xref> synthesis of the literature, lack of parental presence was a large factor toward placing hospitalized children at risk of poor behavioral outcomes.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0898010111423422">Power and Frank’s (2008)</xref> systematic review of 21 research articles revealed that parents welcomed the opportunity to participate in their children’s hospital care. The studies also disclosed that parents felt stress because of their perception that nurses expected them to be available and to perform the child’s basic care.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0898010111423422">
<title>Aim of the Study</title>
<p>The aim of this phenomenological study was to explore nurses’ perceptions as they cared for unaccompanied hospitalized children and explicate meanings from the perspective of pediatric nurses. Additional aims were to determine a definition for the phenomenon and whether parental absence presented inequities for the child, family, and/or nurse. Our ultimate goal was to use these understandings to improve the quality of children’s care.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0898010111423422">
<title>Phenomenological Framework</title>
<p>Phenomenological research methods were used as a basis for this study. This design lets investigators move into the data and interpret meanings of everyday experiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0898010111423422">Munhall, 2007</xref>). Often phenomenological research is focused on understanding the person experiencing the phenomenon, but others can be intertwined in these experiences. Individuals come to an understanding of a phenomenon in the context of their own culture and time frame (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0898010111423422">Wojnar &amp; Swanson, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Day-to-day contingencies affect nurses’ perceptions of a phenomenon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0898010111423422">Munhall, 2007</xref>). Contingencies are defined as the events and circumstances of an individual’s life. Researchers attempt to understand the lifeworlds of the participants through the lens of each individual’s own context. Munhall places emphasis on contextual processing, which includes analyzing emergent situated contexts, day-to-day contingencies, and assessing the lifeworlds of individuals and those close to them. We intuited that the evolving narratives of pediatric nurses would comprise these existential considerations.</p>
<p>Contingencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0898010111423422">Munhall, 2007</xref>) comprise the four dimensions of the lifeworlds: spatiality (environment), corporeality (mind/body), temporality (time frame), and relationality (relationships). The spatiality of this study was in a children’s hospital in the midwestern United States. The nurses’ mind/body dimension included their experience, age, thoughts, and feelings. The time frame was the early 21st century when FCC was the expectation. Relationships within this study were among nurses, pediatric patients, and parents of the pediatric patients. These contingencies of the lifeworlds are congruent with the practice of holistic nursing through the recognition of interconnectedness of humans.</p>
<p>The researcher is the “instrument” and must strive to be decentered—to attempt to suspend presuppositions and ideas about experiences of the nurses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0898010111423422">Munhall, 2007</xref>). Researchers must first identify that their own experiences have shaped their views. They must be cognizant of intersubjectivity: a striving to understand the perceptions of participants while recognizing their biases. As researchers, we identified that our own experiences shaped our views. The first author was alone in the hospital as an infant and during an influenza epidemic quarantine as a teenager. Although open visitation was becoming the practice in U.S. children’s hospitals by the late 1960s, the other author was frustrated dealing with restricted visitation policies when both of her infants were hospitalized in a Canadian hospital during this period.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<sec id="section6-0898010111423422">
<title>Sample</title>
<p>Once institutional review board approval was secured, study solicitation was conducted through an e-mail to all registered nurses at a multisite children’s hospital. Each participant voluntarily signed an approved informed consent form and was asked to participate in two interviews. A purposive sampling process was used to attain participants from a variety of the hospitals’ workplaces and years of experience to get a wide range of responses. The 12 study participants worked in different units, including medical/surgical (both urban and suburban), pediatric intensive care unit, neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), the operating room, and emergency department (ED). Participants were primarily women (<italic>n</italic> = 10), between the ages of 20 and 50. Four nurses had worked 16 to 32 years, whereas eight had worked less than 5 years. Seven nurses were parents, and one nurse had an infant who died at birth. Ethnicity was self-described as Caucasian (<italic>n</italic> = 9), Black (<italic>n</italic> = 2), and Hispanic (<italic>n</italic> = 1).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0898010111423422">
<title>Data Collection</title>
<p>Pediatric nurses were interviewed to hear their voices regarding hospitalized children who were unaccompanied by their parents (<italic>parents</italic> will be used as an inclusive term for all family configurations). Each nurse was interviewed face-to-face by the principal investigator either in a university office or in a semiprivate hospital conference room to provide confidentiality and foster comfort (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0898010111423422">Gerow et al., 2010</xref>). The first interviews lasted 45 minutes to 1 hour, and gift cards were given to each participant at the close of the second interview.</p>
<p>Open-ended questions were asked to elicit responses regarding experiences caring for unaccompanied hospitalized children and feelings toward the children, toward the parents, and for themselves. The nurses were asked whether parental absence caused differences in the child’s care and to define the phenomenon and elaborate on its meaning. Participants were asked to ponder these questions and encouraged to disclose any new ideas at the second interview. All of the interviews were digitally recorded, transcribed verbatim, and given to each participant for content approval. At the second interview, the nurses were asked if the text was accurate and revealed their intended voice. Since none of the interviewees had any appended comments nor were any new data disclosed, it was determined that study saturation had been reached.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0898010111423422">
<title>Analysis</title>
<p>Analysis proceeded after member checks were employed during the data collection process. Transcriptions from the interviewed nurses were read, examined, and considered by both investigators and the consultant to describe the essence of the phenomenon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0898010111423422">Embrey, 2009</xref>). Main points were noted and were catalogued into broad themes to avoid a reductionist approach. As themes emerged, the researchers reread the narratives to determine how each theme was addressed by all participants. Cognitive and emotional constructs were used as an overall organization of the narratives. Perceptions are formed by the connectedness of these constructs. Themes (i.e., absence, age, safety, meanings) were identified and later integrated into the four dimensions of the lifeworlds of pediatric nurses. Poignant stories were identified to illuminate the nurses’ perspective.</p>
<p>The nurses’ accounts were processed with awareness of the nurses’ lifeworlds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0898010111423422">Munhall, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0898010111423422">van Manen, 1990</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0898010111423422">Munhall (2007)</xref> directs that the phenomenological interpretive interaction occurs after (a) describing the situated contexts of the participants, (b) analyzing their day-to-day contingencies, and (c) assessing their lifeworlds. This phenomenological contextual processing leads to integration and description, then to a “meaningful, holistic, simultaneous interpretation of an experience” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0898010111423422">Munhall, 2007</xref>, p. 198). The four interconnected dimensions of the life worlds are illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0898010111423422">Figure 1</xref>. Contemplating the nurses’, children’s, and families’ contexts of space, mind/body, time, and relationships allowed the researchers to interpret meanings of narratives.</p>

<sec id="section9-0898010111423422">
<title>Findings</title>
<p>The responses were studied, and similar themes were extracted. We classified the responses into major constructs demonstrating how nurses experienced (cognitive constructs) the circumstances of unaccompanied hospitalized children and what they perceived (emotional constructs) about the phenomenon. Further analysis identified how the themes fit into the dimensions of nurses’ lifeworlds.</p>
<sec id="section10-0898010111423422">
<title>Nurses’ Cognitive Constructs</title>
<p>Nurses attempted to understand the context of the child and family through their own lifeworlds. They used the objective knowledge they had gathered, such as the family’s reasons for absence, the child’s age, apparent safety concerns, and the outcomes of care to give insight into this phenomenon. The participants analyzed their observations through their own definitions of unaccompanied hospitalized children.</p>
<sec id="section11-0898010111423422">
<title>Definitions of unaccompanied hospitalized child</title>
<p>Significant variations existed in the nurses’ definitions of an unaccompanied hospitalized child. Nurses arrived at their definitions by differing parameters. The time frame defining absence ranged from 1 hour to an entire day. When nurses defined the phenomenon by the child’s age, they usually expected greater parental presence with children younger than 6 or 7 years. Many nurses took into account the parents’ extenuating circumstances when defining unaccompanied status. Several nurses noted that children were never unaccompanied in the hospital because staff was always in attendance.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0898010111423422">
<title>Parental absence</title>
<p>Nurses seeking meaning for parental absence gave voice through “explanations.” Predominantly among these were economic issues including the need to remain employed, transportation issues, and need to take care of siblings. One nurse stated that “everyone throws that FMLA [Family and Medical Leave Act] out like it is the new Godsend” but that many parents do not qualify for this benefit. Some stated that older parents were more likely to be in attendance than younger parents who may not perceive untoward consequences.</p>
<p>Many of the nurses stated that when the child was hospitalized with an acute versus chronic disorder, parents were more likely to be present. If a child had a mental disorder or disabling condition, parents stayed at the hospital. When NICU infants were hospitalized for a long period, parents often visited during the weekends. Parents spent less time with children who were hospitalized for long periods, and nurses became like family to the child.</p>
<p>Nurses identified special circumstances that prevented families from accompanying their hospitalized child and some that aroused concern. During this study period, the H1N1 influenza pandemic occurred and isolation was standard. A NICU nurse remarked that families may stay away because “they are trying to protect themselves . . . from getting too connected with this baby.” When nurses felt uncertain about why parents were not present, many perceived that parents thought the hospital was a “day care.” Some families were not present for their child’s birthdays. Nurses reported their impression that life was better for some children in the hospital than living with a dysfunctional family.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-0898010111423422">
<title>Age of child</title>
<p>Nurses volunteered that the child’s age made a difference in reactions to separation from parents. There was agreement among the nurses that toddlers and young school-aged children had the most difficult time without their parents. Nurses described that older infants sensed separation from parents. Toddlers could not understand their parents’ absence as in the following description: “She doesn’t know if she is in this new place to live forever.” Toddlers in the ED could often be distracted until their parents arrived. Boredom was the descriptor used for nurses’ impressions of school-aged children when alone. Some nurses wondered if school-aged children’s pain was real or a means to increase interaction with the nurse. Adolescents appeared worried about separation from friends, their physical appearance, being stoic, and being resourceful when seeking health care on their own. Participants believed that newborns and young infants were left alone the most, followed by adolescents.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-0898010111423422">
<title>Child’s safety</title>
<p>A few nurses noted that there were no differences in safety related to parental absence on their unit, but most nurses stated that there were additional risks. In the pediatric intensive care unit, parents provided a resource to nurses by monitoring subtle changes and these accompanied children needed less restraints or sedation. Many nurses noted that young children unsupervised in adult-sized beds had increased safety risks. Side rails did not serve as barriers to inquisitive children. The cardiac nurse reported that crying was a health risk for young children with heart conditions who needed to be held. A problem in the ED was the accuracy of unaccompanied adolescents’ history or their exposures to violence. The overall perception was that children needed consistent supervision to remain safe.</p>
<p>There was also an increased dependence on multiple caretakers when parents were absent that affected safety and continuity. Nurses reported that when children were alone, they sometimes used child life personnel, volunteers, and care assistants to attend to children’s needs for interaction and comfort. Participants often stated that these resources were not enough to make up for lack of parental presence and were not available during the night. One effect of multiple personnel caring for hospitalized children is revealed in the following account:</p>
<p><disp-quote><p>[He was] throwing tantrums, um, acting out . . . feeling abandoned and having no family and having a new nurse every single night and every single day and different care assistants and doctors coming in. There was no constant there.</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Nurses described potential legal issues of unaccompanied hospitalized children that could affect their safety. Many nurses were concerned about parents’ ability to assimilate discharge teaching when they had not been observant of the child’s care. Teaching parents about future care at home was a daunting task for nurses and stressful for parents. As attendant parents observed the type and quantity of the child’s care, they could adjust to making these accommodations in their home life. If instructions were hurried and incomplete; families might seek unnecessary health care or struggle with possible deterioration of the child’s health. Nurses reported situations when children were dying and they had to locate absent parents.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-0898010111423422">
<title>Outcomes</title>
<p>The participants spoke about the short- and long-term outcomes for unaccompanied hospitalized children, such as slower intellectual and emotional development, lack of bonding, and higher incidence of failure to thrive. Another predominant narrative was that nurses attempted to minimize negative outcomes. It was common for nurses to take young unaccompanied children to the nurses’ stations to interact with more people. Nurses articulated that caring for these children demanded more time. It was challenging to make health care decisions when parents were difficult to locate. An exemplar was of a child whose custodial grandparents were present only once and the nurses were not instructed how to use the child’s medical device. This caused confusion, was time-consuming, decreased procedural adherence, and ultimately led to resentment. There were also consequences for families, such as in the case of parents who quit their jobs to minimize the effect of hospitalization. Primarily, the nurses spoke about the outcomes of the phenomenon on children or nurses.</p>
<p>The participants expressed that adequate nursing care was provided to children whether accompanied or not. However, attendant parents often advocated for their child for additional food, diagnostic tests, or staff time. Nurses reported that they compensated for parents’ absence by spending more time, getting more attached, advocating, playing, taking on a parenting role, or holding and rocking these young children.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section16-0898010111423422">
<title>Nurses’ Emotional Constructs</title>
<p>Nurses also portrayed their feelings about children who were unaccompanied during hospitalization. Again, they tried to place these into the dimensions of their lifeworlds, particularly those of corporeality and relationality.</p>
<p>Nurses conveyed their feelings about caring for unaccompanied children, emphasizing professionalism. Emotions ranged from sadness, compassion, frustration, understanding, and worry. Participants felt badly because they were often prodding and poking children while trying to console them. Many nurses tried to understand the parents’ perspective. Comments were recorded such as “To me, it’s just how could you leave a child?” or “That as a mother you would want someone to do for your child.”</p>
<p>The following exemplar demonstrates a situation when a pediatric nurse was clearly distressed about her two sibling patients with cystic fibrosis. The young nurse felt sadness for the children as reflected through this vignette. A little girl and her brother were in separate isolation rooms with no parents present. She began by describing the loneliness of the little girl who wanted to come out of her room and the strategies the nurses used.</p>
<p><disp-quote><p>Her parents aren’t there . . . we are going to have to keep her in her room without coming out. So it gets hard with that. What we ended up doing was we had to give her . . . a line. . . and she can actually come 12 inches out of her room and we would draw like a line of tape there. It was like “alright you aren’t completely isolated in your room. You can come out . . . this far and say hi.” Her brother [was] in the adjacent room and he had it [isolation] too . . . [T]heir openings were facing each other so it was good that they had company. She was like 3 and he was 7 . . . it was good that their doors were open and they were facing each other. And she could actually come out. She needed to have some type of interaction . . . whether with her parents, it had to be with somebody. So she would come out and be like, “Hi, I’m outside of my room, please don’t lock me back in there.”</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Participants worried about long-term separation effects particularly for infants. Nurses mentioned potential feelings of abandonment, lack of trust, and anxiety for the children. The perception was that children who did not have an attachment to family were more affectionate with staff. One nurse alleged that building a trusting relationship with a child who felt abandoned was challenging. At the end of the shift, the nurse also abandons the child. Short-term effects included an inability to calm children as evidenced by increased anxiety and heart rate.</p>
<p>Nurses assumed that sick children needed their parents. They believed that older children were resigned to their parents’ absence: “I’ll be okay here. The nurses and doctors are going to take care of me.” Corroborating age-related variations was a viewpoint that children older than 7 years were comfortable with an adult caring for them, like in school. Some older children socialized or played games with nurses. Some children expressed that their parents did not want to be with them. One parent told the nurse, “Don’t call me back unless she is dead!” If the child’s first hospital experience was not pleasant, it appeared more difficult for the child to adjust at subsequent visits. An overarching theme was that nurses wondered what children really felt.</p>
<p>Nurses had stronger reactions to parents. A fundamental source of nurses’ anger was the parents’ failure to communicate the reason for their absence. Some parents stated that they were leaving for a short time and did not return for hours. Some situations raised “red flags” about parenting particularly if the parent left a nonworking phone number. One nurse expressed concern that some parents might have substance abuse issues and another about children’s lack of safety at home. Many nurses told stories of parents who never visited until they were required to take their child home. Overall, nurses reported worse relationships with families who were rarely at the hospital.</p>
<p>Potential legal issues also increased the nurses’ emotional toil. These issues included consent for care or situations when the child was being placed in protective custody.</p>
<p><disp-quote><p>I had a real bad experience that the kid was taken from the mother and the father, the police came and escorted the parents out, the child said, “My mother has done the best she can. Leave my mother alone. I hate you guys.” . . . It was a kid that was not being fed and not being taken care of but she was being loved by her parents the only way she knew . . . So I told her, “You know I had nothing to do with that, but I am here to take care of you.” . . . And she was hostile, but I understood where she was, I ran into things I never had to happen to me personally . . . I just tried to redirect the fact that I had nothing to do with that and I’m here to take care of you.</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>At the opposite end of the continuum of nurse feelings were those of compassion. Leaving one’s child becomes inevitable over time. The nurses wanted to give the parents the benefit of the doubt. This attitude of empathy was stronger if nurses were aware of parents’ circumstances or if parents expressed gratitude. Comments were made that parents need to take care of themselves too. One story was of quadruplets of which the sickest stayed at the hospital frequently and how nurses accepted that the mother needed to be home. Another nurse applauded a mother who was unable to provide adequate care for her infant and placed her in foster care. A profound statement was that parents who leave their children might be the strongest, that they “love their kids so much that they have to leave them in order to provide for them.” The following is a nurse’s moving account:</p>
<p><disp-quote><p>So, it’s not that Hospital X is a babysitter . . . At least the parent brought the child to the hospital to get some care. But she has to work because when the child leaves here they’ve got to have shelter, food, and clothing and stuff. So if she is told either you stay at the hospital with your baby or you lose your job she might say “OK, I’ll go to work, because they’re supposed to be people there taking care of my child.”</p></disp-quote></p>

<title>Being judgmental</title>
<p>A prevailing theme of the emotional construct was of judgment and resentment. Nurses stated that they tried not to judge the parents’ reasons for their absence from the hospital. Although nurses’ feelings were usually unspoken, they perceived that parents could sense their feelings through body language and tone of voice. Parents left comments in the suggestion box or “fired” nurses they felt were condemning them. The surveyed nurses mentioned that a few nurses gossiped and stereotyped parents. Experienced nurses thought that as younger nurses gained experience, they became more accepting. Other parents were also judgmental of those parents who did not appear to visit their child. A few nurses noted that the majority of expressions of judgment were aimed at parents of lower socioeconomic status. Comments were made that the health care of poor families is publically financed or that parents enjoyed their free stay at the Ronald McDonald House. Conversely, some parents were challenging, and therefore their absence gave nurses emotional relief.</p>
<p>Nurses stated that they did not want to judge. One touching story was told about a 3-year-old who spent most of his early life in the hospital. His parents rarely came to the hospital. He asked each day if he could go home and live with the nurse. Some parents worried about being judged. One mother who could not be present asked, “Is anybody going to think badly of me?” even though she called frequently. The following story was of a mother who was instructed not to leave her infant’s room.</p>
<p><disp-quote><p>[S]he said, “I was told I could never leave this room.” I said, “Who told you that?” She told me, “The nurse before you told me I could not leave this room I had to stay with my baby the whole entire time.” And so a lot of things ran through my head . . . is she telling her this because she is young? . . . or because she doesn’t want to take care of the baby? . . . or because she is scared that if she lets the mom leave she won’t come back?</p></disp-quote></p>

<title>Meaning</title>
<p>The most thought-provoking question for the participants was what the phenomenon meant to them as nurses. The question necessitated that they examine their paradigms of parental responsibility and family functioning. One nurse noted that oftentimes generations in families have viewed health care for children as the providers’ domain. Some families did not have the resources or knowledge base to feel part of the health care team. Parental responsibility to accompany their sick child was viewed as a necessity by some, as the ideal by others. Although parents were often made to feel bad about leaving their children at the hospital, one nurse noted that the parents were demonstrating trust. Nurses attempted to provide equal care to all children, but most nurses stated that caring for these vulnerable children extracted a greater emotional toil.</p>

<title>Relating Themes to Nurses’ Lifeworlds</title>
<p>All of the nurse participants tried to place the experience of caring for unaccompanied hospitalized children into their own situated context. Nurses used cognitive constructs to describe their experiences and used emotional constructs to express their feelings. The participants synthesized their experiences and feelings as they looked for meaning. Nurses’ perceptions of this phenomenon were affected by the contingencies of their life worlds which came through the four dimensions of space, mind/body, time, and relationships (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0898010111423422">Figure 1</xref>).</p>
<p>Nurses developed their attitudes, values, and behaviors in their work environments (diverse units of a children’s hospital system). The distance from the hospital was a dimension of space that affected parents’ ability to remain with their child. Residential location of parents and nurses became a spatiality dimension because socioeconomic status determined where they lived. Community values of differing U.S. locations were reflected in statements when nurses described their reaction as if they were the parent.</p>
<p>The lifeworlds of the nurses included their mind/body dimension, the child’s health status, parent’s emotional disposition, and nurse’s cognitions and feelings. Nurses’ perceptions varied by their work units as they cared for critically, acutely, or chronically ill children. Parental visitation varied greatly and depended on health condition contingencies. Parents’ emotional status often varied with the health status of their child. Nurses’ expectations also differed depending on the child’s condition with those feelings projected as anger or compassion, judgment or understanding.</p>
<p>The study time frame was the prevailing philosophy of FCC in the early 21st century. Age was a time-related factor as were years of nursing experience. Parents’ age was a variant, with older parents being generally more attentive. The age of the child was significant to all interviewed nurses. Time that parents spent with children was the fundamental question of this research.</p>
<p>Relationality was a dominant theme of the narratives. There was a triad of relationships: nurses, parents, and children. Parents demonstrated some form of relationship not only with their hospitalized child but also with siblings at home. Whereas there seemed to be stigma toward absent mothers, fathers were rarely mentioned. Nurses described forming relationships with children whose parents were unavailable. Sometimes, nurses intervened in a dysfunctional parent–child conflict for the protection of the child.</p>
<p>Each of the four dimensions was connected to the others. Nurses’ perceptions were formed through thinking and feeling and within their work location, community, age and experience, perspective of time in history, health status of the child, age of the child, and relationships with both parents and hospitalized children.</p>

<sec id="section20-0898010111423422" sec-type="conclusions">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The phenomenological method was used to interpret nurses’ experiences of caring for unaccompanied hospitalized children. The major assumption of the study was that hospitalized children should not be alone. Research on child–parent attachment demonstrates that children have psychosocial attachment needs throughout the world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0898010111423422">Shields et al., 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Coming to know the contingencies (space, mind/body, time, relationships) of the nurses’ lifeworlds revealed the context from which these nurses understood the phenomenon of unaccompanied hospitalized children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0898010111423422">Munhall, 2007</xref>). The nurse was the “knower” but could not completely understand the contingencies of the other two intertwined groups, parents and children. Nurses made assumptions based on the historical context of FCC, their own community values, work environment, the child’s health status and age, and the perceived child–parent–nurse relationships.</p>
<p>A phenomenological paradox seems to have emerged in this study as we attempted to gain understanding of nurses’ lifeworlds. The paradox is that the nurses were trying to understand the lifeworlds of the children and parents, almost as if trying to gain a phenomenological perspective. We heard nurses projecting meaning onto the children and the parents but without validating the others’ thoughts. It was revealing to hear nurses state their thoughts about the family’s dynamics without truly “knowing” another set of contingencies.</p>
<p>Limitations of this research are that the actual voices of children or parents have not yet been heard and whether these nurses’ perceptions are prevalent in other settings. As an example, in areas of China the parents/family members must stay with the child for the entire time the child is hospitalized on medical/surgical units (Lin Yan, personal communication, June 2009). The aim of this study was to hear the voices of participating nurses but not to generalize.</p>

<title>Nursing Implications</title>
<p>Although the nurses were not asked about judgmental attitudes, these attitudes permeated the interviews of many nurses. Nurses recognized bias in themselves or their peers. Judgments can impair relationships with families and children, influencing care that nurses provide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0898010111423422">Tillett, 2010</xref>). Nurses need to be able to distance themselves from the situation, examine their own lifeworlds as well as their patients’, and identify their feelings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0898010111423422">Little, 1996</xref>). This process of “unknowing,” knowing that one does not understand someone else’s perspective, allows nurses to gain perspective of another’s lifeworld (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0898010111423422">Munhall, 1993</xref>). Silence of nurses and repression of their feelings toward absent parents can damage relationships. This can result in dehumanizing the parents, thus preventing nurses from establishing therapeutic connections. In the stress of caring for hospitalized children, it is natural to find ways to relieve anxiety, such as blaming the parents.</p>
<p>The study calls us to become introspective and to raise our consciousness to the possibility and ramifications of being judgmental. Alternatively, nurses recognized parents’ feelings of trust. Nurses tried to make sense of the phenomenon of unaccompanied hospitalized children, demonstrating their openness to “unknowing.”</p>
<p>These findings provide direction to nursing practice and education. “Unknowing” should be emphasized in education as in phenomenological research. We can hear our patients’ stories and individualize care, respecting contingencies in their lives. Practiti-oners can benefit from this study by becoming aware of their own contingencies that influence their perspectives. We emphasized the need to understand lifeworlds of parents and to understand their emotional turmoil (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0898010111423422">Miceli &amp; Clark, 2005</xref>). The resulting understanding can open communication and reduce negative or hostile feelings between both parties. Children will benefit from a more collegial relationship with the adults in their lives. Emphasizing the benefits of other adult–child relationships could ameliorate a child’s loneliness. This substantiates the findings from Zengerle-Levy’s study (2006) that pediatric nurses sought to help their patients sustain human ties. Nurses provide generous and exceptional care at this critical time to hospitalized children to compensate for the absence of parents and to provide a safe environment for unaccompanied children.</p>
<p>In future studies, we must bring together all voices, understanding that “knowing” relationships are vital. There is a great need for communication with children and parents: to validate feelings, find contingencies in parents’ lives, and work with them to bring about optimal care. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0898010111423422">Galvin and Todres (2009)</xref> compel us to recognize the value of nursing experiences and then to use these experiences to discover ways to promote humanizing, holistic care. The aim of hearing nurses’ voices now leads to a goal for greater human understanding.</p>
