<abstract>
<p>Organizing grassroots groups, particularly among the deeply disadvantaged may require initial facilitation through a leader. This article suggests that such facilitative leadership will adopt a diffused form with increased participation and involvement of members in groups. Thereafter, members are less likely to rely on the facilitative leader for decision-making or collective action. Based on primary data from <italic>sanghas</italic> organized as grassroots groups through the Mahila Samakhya Karnataka (MSK) program in rural India, the article examines the effects of group characteristics; structure and leadership; and individual participation on the political-cultural empowerment of members. The analyses suggest that older bureaucratic grassroots groups are more likely to be empowering for women members. Members’ involvement in the process of creating, setting up and adopting rules and procedures is significant for change within the family and the community, particularly for the poor illiterate <italic>dalit</italic> women in this case.</p>

<p><bold>Les comités populaires et le renforcement de l’autonomie des femmes pauvres dans l’Inde rurale</bold></p>
<p>L’organisation de comités populaires, particulièrement parmi les populations les plus déshéritées, peut nécessiter l’intervention initiale d’un leader facilitateur. Nous pensons que ce leadership doit être relayé par une participation et une implication accrus des membres de ces groupes. Dès lors, les membres sont moins tentés de compter sur le leader facilitateur pour prendre des décisions ou engager une action collective. En nous basant sur les données primaires en provenance des <italic>sanghas</italic> organisés dans l’Inde rurale en comités populaires par l’intermédiaire du programme du Mahila Samakhya Karnakata (MSK), nous examinons les incidences des caractéristiques du groupe, de sa structure, de son leadership et de la participation individuelle, sur le renforcement de l’autonomie politico-culturelle des membres du groupe. Nos analyses donnent à penser que les comités populaires bureaucratiques les plus anciens ont plus tendance à favoriser l’autonomie des membres féminins. L’implication des membres dans le processus de création, de mise en place et d’adoption de règles et de procédures est déterminante pour qu’il y ait un changement au sein des familles et des communautés, en particulier, dans ce cas, pour les femmes intouchables (<italic>dalit</italic>) pauvres et analphabètes.</p>

<p><bold>Grupos de base y empoderamiento de las mujeres pobres en la India rural</bold></p>
<p>Organizar grupos de base, particularmente entre los profundamente desaventajados, puede requerir facilidades iniciales a través de la figura de un líder. Yo propongo que este liderazgo facilitador adopte una forma difusa con participación creciente e implicación de los miembros de estos grupos.

Tomando como base datos primarios de comunidades (<italic>shangas</italic>) organizadas como grupos de base en el programa <italic>Mahila Samkhya Karnataka</italic> (MSK) en la India rural, examino los efectos de las características del grupo, la estructura y liderazgo y la participación individual sobre el empoderamiento político-cultural de los miembros del grupo. Mi análisis sugiere que es más probable que los antiguos grupos de base burocráticos contribuyan al empoderamiento de las mujeres que pertenecen a los mismos. La implicación de los miembros en el proceso de crear, preparar y adoptar reglas y procedimientos es determinante para producir un cambio dentro de la familia y la comunidad, particularmente para las mujeres intocables (<italic>dalit</italic>) pobres e iletradas.</p>

<p>Early scholarship on social movement organizations (SMOs) emphasized the formal bureaucratic structure as essential for mobilization and as a resource for protest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0268580911423044">Jenkins, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0268580911423044">McCarthy and Zald, 1973</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0268580911423044">1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0268580911423044">Rothschild-Whitt, 1979</xref>). These assertions have since been expanded by feminist scholars to conceptualize the hybrid form (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0268580911423044">Bordt, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0268580911423044">Ferree and Martin, 1995</xref>). The hybrid form combines bureaucratic and collectivist characteristics and results from increasing involvement of members to develop and configure tasks and rules for action.</p>
<p>Analyses of effects of participation in formal and hybrid groups, such as feminist organizations, women’s groups and self-help groups, have contributed to the theoretical understanding of collective action as facilitating consciousness-raising and as leading to empowering changes in women’s lives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0268580911423044">Batliwala, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0268580911423044">Bystydzienski and Sekhon, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0268580911423044">Chow, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0268580911423044">Ferree and Martin, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0268580911423044">Gilkes, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0268580911423044">Goetzé and Sen Gupta, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0268580911423044">Hashmi et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0268580911423044">Kabeer, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0268580911423044">Purkayastha and Subramaniam, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0268580911423044">Purushothaman, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0268580911423044">Rose, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0268580911423044">Taylor, 1996</xref>). These qualitative analyses acknowledge the significance of the collective mobilization of women as social actors but rely on data at either the individual <italic>or</italic> group level overlooking the effects of group characteristics, such as leadership and structure, on members. I address this gap by examining the effects of the characteristics of <italic>grassroots</italic> groups on members.</p>
<p><italic>Grassroots</italic> groups are community-based, generally small in scope and scale, and focus on issues that directly impact members’ lives. The groups provide a space for women to articulate their experiences, listen to others and consider individual and collective challenges to injustices. Participation in such groups can be critical for the deeply disadvantaged, such as poor women, who have accepted silence and repression as part of their lives. But initial facilitative leadership is essential for organizing such grassroots groups.</p>
<p>I focus on grassroots groups of poor and mostly illiterate women from the developing world: <italic>dalit</italic> (lowest caste) women who have little or no resources.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0268580911423044">1</xref></sup> I examine the combined effects of group structure, leadership and individual-level participation on members’ political-cultural empowerment. By political-cultural empowerment, I mean the ability to act to change culturally based gender norms and to actively seek representation in political institutions. It may include individual and/or collective acts of resistance to rituals and norms of domination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0268580911423044">Bell, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0268580911423044">Scott, 1985</xref>).</p>
<p>Quantitatively, I utilize hierarchical linear modeling (HLM) to explore the effects of group structure on the political-cultural empowerment of participants. The HLM technique makes it possible to analyse data at the individual <italic>and</italic> group level as well as control for individual characteristics to more clearly identify the additional effects of group structure and leadership and distinguish among groups in their effectiveness in change for individuals. I also draw on qualitative observational data to explain the case and my findings. My analyses suggest that older bureaucratic groups are more likely to be empowering for participants. This is plausible because the primary objective of the Mahila Samakhya Karnataka (MSK) program is to enable members’ involvement in shaping the form of the <italic>sangha</italic>. As discussed later in this article, members may draw from past experiences to make decisions and/or take action making the <italic>sanghas</italic> appear bureaucratic.</p>
<p>My approach builds on the scholarship referred to above and expands on it in three ways. First, I draw attention to the significance of grassroots groups particularly for women’s empowerment. Although dismissed by social movement scholars as related to development intervention, organizing grassroots groups can lead to political mobilization of a specific constituency. This has implications for gender and social movement scholarship, particularly for the ways in which we understand mobilizing and organizing for change. Second, although initial organizing may require some facilitation, grassroots groups may eventually be structured by members who feel empowered by being involved in setting up practices and procedures. Such involvement creates a diffused form of leadership but yet retains connections to the facilitator to some extent. Third, I bring in a perspective from the developing world and use a two-level analysis to provide quantitative evidence of the effects of group characteristics on the political-cultural empowerment of poor, low caste and largely illiterate women in rural India.</p>
<p>Based on primary data from the MSK program, I examine the effects of the structure and leadership of grassroots groups on women’s political-cultural empowerment. ‘<italic>Mahila’</italic> means ‘women’ and <italic>‘Samakhya’</italic> is a compound of the Sanskrit words, ‘<italic>sama’</italic> meaning ‘equal’, and ‘<italic>akhya’</italic> meaning to be valued or weighed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0268580911423044">Mahila Samakhya Karnataka, 1996</xref>). The MSK program is a component of the Literacy Mission of the Indian government. The program was born out of the 1986 National Policy on Education’s emphasis of formulating education programs that serve as a positive intervention for women’s equality. It broadens the meaning of ‘education’ or ‘literacy’ to encompass learning and social awareness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0268580911423044">Government of India, 1997</xref>). The strategy of the program is to organize village-based groups of poor women called <italic>sanghas</italic> which are not merely activity oriented but enable women to raise their self-image and confidence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0268580911423044">Mahila Samakhya Karnataka, 1996</xref>). A majority of the <italic>sangha</italic> members are <italic>dalits</italic>.</p>

<title>Political-cultural empowerment and grassroots groups</title>
<p>Gender is a primary organizing feature of society (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0268580911423044">Lorber, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0268580911423044">Scott, 1986</xref>). Gender, along with other forms of structural inequities such as caste and race, organizes social prestige and enacts status in rituals of interactions. Cultural norms of seclusion and segregation can exacerbate gender inequality by their assumptions about what men and women need and to what they are entitled. Studies from developing countries provide accounts of practices that differentially allocate resources, such as food and medical care, within households, particularly in poor households (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0268580911423044">DasGupta, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0268580911423044">Griffiths et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0268580911423044">Malhotra and Mather, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0268580911423044">Messer, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0268580911423044">Sen, 1993</xref>). In addition, greater aspirations for sons versus daughters results in greater opportunities for boys to attend school. Gender and caste inequities also limit women’s ability to participate in community-based networks such as formal political institutions.</p>
<p>Women challenge gender and caste-based power through daily acts of individual or collective resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0268580911423044">Scott, 1985</xref>). Acts of resistance allow disadvantaged individuals to negotiate the circumstances of their lives and gain personal and political power (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0268580911423044">Bell, 2001</xref>). Such actions that challenge culturally based gender norms within the family and caste-based discrimination in the community is what I refer to as political-cultural empowerment. Although daily acts of resistance to oppression and discrimination considered in this article may not fit the conventional western understandings of movement action involving mass campaigns and visible protests, they serve as mechanisms for disadvantaged women to challenge cultural norms within the home and seek entry into local political/governance institutions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0268580911423044">Bystydzienski and Sekhon, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0268580911423044">Naples and Desai, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0268580911423044">Purkayastha and Subramaniam, 2004</xref>). Challenges are made possible through collective organization to acquire analytical skills, information and experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0268580911423044">Batliwala, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0268580911423044">Bookman and Morgen, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0268580911423044">Kabeer, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0268580911423044">Karl, 1995</xref>). The strategy for women’s political-cultural empowerment on which I focus is the organizing of grassroots groups for change.</p>

<title>Grassroots groups: Structure and leadership</title>
<p>Feminist scholars have persuasively argued for considering informal and hybrid forms of organizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0268580911423044">Bordt, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0268580911423044">Ferree and Martin, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0268580911423044">Purkayastha and Subramaniam, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0268580911423044">Staggenborg, 1988</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0268580911423044">2</xref></sup> In doing so, they highlight the importance of the process that is the ‘means’ as well as the ends for change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0268580911423044">Acker, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0268580911423044">Ferree and Martin, 1995</xref>). In a similar vein, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0268580911423044">Martin (1990)</xref> calls for examining the concrete forms and practices of feminist organizations and their transformative impact on members. Such transformative impact is possible in grassroots organizations.</p>
<p><italic>Grassroots</italic> organizations, which are sometimes known as base groups, people’s organizations, or local organizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0268580911423044">Bystydzienski and Sekhon, 1999</xref>), emerge and/or work at the local level to improve and develop their communities either through community-wide or more specific memberships, such as women or farmers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0268580911423044">Fisher, 1993</xref>). Grassroots groups are neither bureaucratically structured nor entirely collectivist in form because of the ways in which they may engage in power sharing and distribution of authority. However, the context within which grassroots groups emerge, such as the life experiences of members and/or program goals, can also shape group form. Older groups may develop the potential to influence and even alter state policies and structures at the local community level. They often perform a mediating role between the private and the public; the state, the local community and the family.</p>
<p>Many grassroots groups are a significant part of efforts to create and expand spaces to enable a process that redefines the form and content of politics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0268580911423044">Bystydzienski and Sekhon, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0268580911423044">Purkayastha and Subramaniam, 2004</xref>). For instance, grassroots groups may aim to gain greater representation for the disadvantaged in local political institutions compelling them to address issues having a direct impact on members’ lives. In fact, such groups are particularly effective in consciousness-raising and promoting group solidarity through participation.</p>
<p><italic>Participation</italic> in locally based groups has been explored in the literature primarily in reference to community organizing in the United States as well as in developing countries. Examples include Black women during the Civil Rights Movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0268580911423044">Barnett, 1993</xref>), community-based ethnic organization in the US (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0268580911423044">Chow, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0268580911423044">Gilkes, 1994</xref>) and work in low income communities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0268580911423044">Naples, 1998</xref>). This scholarship as well as that on women’s participation in local groups in developing countries (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0268580911423044">Batliwala, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0268580911423044">Rose, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0268580911423044">Tripp, 2000</xref>) suggests that there are advantages to involvement in grassroots groups. However, discussions of participation often conflate ‘active’ membership with ‘passive’ followership in the form of attendance measures that do not necessarily capture the degree of engagement in a group.</p>
<p>I conceptualize participation as not merely membership but as involving interest and commitment to the group. Initially, one becomes nominally a member of a group which is typically measured as membership or attendance. This is followed by participation in group activities such as discussion and decision-making, and speaking up or voting in the group. It includes leadership action that may occur in a distributed and non-hierarchical form; a diffused form of leadership which becomes salient in older groups.</p>
<p>Scholarship on the structure of informal and grassroots groups overlooks the leadership dimension; whether it impacts the ways in which people organize and how individuals involved in the groups may shape leadership (a notable exception is <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0268580911423044">Staggenborg, 1988</xref>). Within social movement scholarship, early analyses of leadership focused on the function and roles of leaders, including the ways they may gain legitimate authority (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0268580911423044">Morris and Staggenborg, 2004</xref> for a review). Scholars have studied leaders as entrepreneurs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0268580911423044">McCarthy and Zald, 1973</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0268580911423044">1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0268580911423044">Oberschall, 1973</xref>), the gendered notions of leadership, and noted the lack of recognition of the work of women leaders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0268580911423044">Payne, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0268580911423044">Robnett, 1997</xref>).</p>
<p>Leadership is crucial for mobilization, for articulation of interests, for projection of a vision that change is possible and to bring together people who could interact within a ‘free space’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0268580911423044">Evans and Boyte, 1986</xref>). Leadership can be ‘structured as innovative action’ rather than ‘hierarchical command’, to convert potential into actual contribution from others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0268580911423044">Ferree and Hess, 1985</xref>: 26; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0268580911423044">Payne, 1989</xref>). The active participation of members can enable a ‘group-centered’ leadership (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0268580911423044">Payne, 1989</xref>: 896) so that direction rests with the group. Group-centered leadership represents a diffused nature of authority which may be related to the involvement of members. It is therefore likely that member participation at the individual level and structure and leadership at the group level will be significantly associated with the empowerment of members.</p>

<title>Case: Data and methods</title>
<p>My data are drawn from four districts, Bidar, Bijapur, Gulbarga and Raichur, in the state of Karnataka, where the MSK program was in place in 1998.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0268580911423044">3</xref></sup> The demographic trends speak to the low status of women in these four districts, which are among the less economically developed areas compared to the state of Karnataka as a whole. For instance, the mean age at marriage is lower and fertility rates are higher than the state averages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0268580911423044">Government of Karnataka, 1998</xref>). Social norms, such as child marriage and dedication of young girls at local temples, along with low female literacy rates and high female school drop out rates are also key characteristics of the low status of women in these areas. These issues underlie the MSK program’s efforts to form <italic>sanghas</italic> as a collective effort for change.</p>
<p>Primary data collection in these rural areas was physically demanding and logistically challenging. I encountered poor quality transportation facilities, a lack of regular transportation to many rural villages and difficulties with lodging once there. In each study district, only a few major towns were connected to one another by buses and/or trains. The smaller villages had to be reached by a precarious tram-like pedicab and/or a hired private car. Either of the latter options, as well as lodging, had to be negotiated in terms of my status as a woman, in general, and also my privileged class and caste position (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0268580911423044">Subramaniam, 2009</xref>). In spite of these challenges, I spent several months in the four study districts to study the program and gather data.</p>

<p>The MSK program is a national government intervention that emerged in the context of two major developments in India during and after the 1980s: the rise of caste-based organizing and the influence of feminist politics to seek social change for women, particularly <italic>dalits</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0268580911423044">Subramaniam, 2006</xref>). The MSK’s village-level <italic>sanghas</italic> are expected to serve as spaces for collective reflection and analysis to enable participants to recognize their own potential to bring about change in their lives. This idea was not entirely new as it was the basis of some earlier interventions as well. Several ‘awareness-generation’ government programs, such as the Development of Women and Children in Rural Areas (DWCRA), were built to address social change for women. But, these large-scale programs were not entirely successful as they were target-driven and did not provide women the space to initiate and seek change. In contrast, feminist activists and representatives of grassroots NGOs were involved in formulating the MSK program and were instrumental in keeping the project ‘women-centered’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0268580911423044">Government of India, n.d.</xref>).</p>
<p>MSK’s <italic>sangha</italic> membership comprises mainly <italic>dalits</italic>, who are at the bottom of the caste hierarchy. Caste and religion form the basis for the structure of villages including the location of households in relation to the central area of the village. <italic>Dalit</italic> women struggle against great inequalities at the intersections of class, caste and gender.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0268580911423044">4</xref></sup> Decades of violence, both overt and covert, against <italic>dalit</italic> women serve as a mechanism of control to instill fear and constrain them in articulation of their experiences. The MSK program’s <italic>sanghas</italic> facilitate articulation as a means to recognize oppression and challenge power, which contributes to the political-cultural empowerment of members. Caste-based prestige affects <italic>dalit</italic> women’s social position to make shame and disrespect central to their suffering. Thus, their resistances also challenge human degradation.</p>
<p>In the state of Karnataka, the MS program has sub-units at two levels: the District Implementation Unit (DIU) at the district level and the <italic>sangha</italic> at the village level. The DIU, headed by a district program coordinator, comprises resource personnel, accountants and administrative staff. While the district office has a definite hierarchical structure, it is not bureaucratic like government departments but is relatively more formal compared with the <italic>sanghas</italic>. Several <italic>sanghas</italic> fall within the purview of a DIU. A cluster of 10 <italic>sanghas</italic>, in the same area, is overseen by one <italic>sahayogini</italic>, or facilitator, who is an employee of MSK. <italic>Sahayoginis</italic> are trained to visit villages and meet women informally. The MSK’s training program for <italic>sahayoginis</italic> provides them with opportunities to learn, participate and connect with other staff as well as other individuals and organizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0268580911423044">Subramaniam, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>The program follows no specific strategy for selecting villages to initiate <italic>sanghas. Sahayoginis</italic> or facilitators work to mobilize women and motivate them to organize as a group, one in each village. As the <italic>sahayogini</italic> unfolds the idea of a ‘<italic>sangha</italic>’ she makes no promises, emphasizing that if the women decided to form a <italic>sangha</italic>, the MSK would not provide economic incentives or assistance. But she assures them support for issues they decide to pursue. Thus, group participation is an unfolding process, from the initial decision to begin to meet, the continued commitment to meeting despite local resistance, to the increasing resources gained by the <italic>sangha</italic> for investment in collective goods.</p>
<p>Most <italic>sanghas</italic> meet once a week but this schedule varies by season, reflecting when women have to be out for long hours for wage labor or when the monsoon makes wage labor typically unavailable. <italic>Sangha</italic> women meet in the village community hall, under a tree, in the front of a temple, or their own place referred to as the <italic>sangha</italic> ‘<italic>mane</italic>’ (home). After about two to three years, <italic>sanghas</italic> try to find ways to construct their own <italic>sangha mane</italic> and receive an initial fund from the MSK, called an honorarium, at this point. Some <italic>sanghas</italic> use this resource for acquisition of land and/or construction of the <italic>mane</italic>. Over time, the MSK program has made moderate inroads into the <italic>panchayat</italic> – the village-level governance structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0268580911423044">Subramaniam, 2006</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0268580911423044">5</xref></sup> <italic>Sangha</italic> women have benefited somewhat from the MSK’s training programs to contest <italic>panchayat</italic> elections and gain formal representation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0268580911423044">Subramaniam, 2006</xref>).</p>

<title>Data</title>
<p>In contrast to the developed world, the documentation, creation and maintenance of records are not a major concern of programs like the MSK in the developing world. Because of limited resources and staff, the program emphasizes action rather than documentation. The MSK program had little by way of records on <italic>sangha</italic> initiation or non-survival. However, with the assistance of the district offices of the MSK, I created a sampling frame of <italic>sanghas</italic> in existence at the time of the study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0268580911423044">Subramaniam, 2001</xref>). Adopting a multi-stage probability sampling strategy, I selected 31 <italic>sanghas</italic> across the four districts of Bidar, Bijapur, Gulbarga and Raichur where MSK was involved in initiating <italic>sanghas</italic>. All members from each of the sampled <italic>sanghas</italic> were targeted for the structured survey. Data were collected between September and December 1998 from 502 respondents who were members of the 31 <italic>sanghas</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0268580911423044">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>A structured questionnaire was administered to individual respondents in the local language by trained field investigators because most of the <italic>sangha</italic> women are not literate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0268580911423044">Subramaniam, 2001</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0268580911423044">7</xref></sup> Group-level data were gathered through structured interviews with facilitators (<italic>sahayoginis</italic>) of the sampled <italic>sanghas</italic>. In addition, I attended 11 <italic>sangha</italic> meetings in the four districts covered in the study and audio-taped the deliberations. Nine of the 11 <italic>sanghas</italic> were from among the 31 sampled <italic>sanghas</italic>. While in the field, I observed program activities, conducted informal interviews with employees of the MSK program and visited several <italic>sanghas</italic> in the four study districts. For this article, I draw from (1) the information gathered about the program from documents as well as observations of program activities and <italic>sangha</italic> meetings and (2) individual- and group-level data obtained through a survey.</p>

<sec id="section6-0268580911423044">
<title>Variables and measures</title>
<p>The key measures used for the variables at the individual and group level are detailed below. The complete list of measures used is given in <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-0268580911423044">Appendix A</xref>.</p>
<p><italic>Political cultural empowerment</italic> is a summed scale of five item measures.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0268580911423044">8</xref></sup> Two of the five measures are statements related to cultural norms within the family; about respect that women are expected to accord to male adults and other elders in the family such as by leaving the room when a male/elder member of the family enters the room. The three additional measures relate to working to seek freedom to visit the nearby town (that is beyond the village) and seeking representation in local government, i.e. the <italic>panchayat</italic>, and in the committees of the <italic>panchayat</italic> (these oversee institutions such as the village school or water resources).</p>
<p>The individual-level independent variables include <italic>sangha</italic> participation and respondent and household characteristics. Participation was measured using two main variables. The first variable is membership per se, measured as a dichotomous variable. The second variable taps the respondent’s degree of participation in <italic>sangha</italic> meetings (refers to ‘current’ participation at the time of the survey). Respondents indicated if they never participate, sometimes participate, or actively participate.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0268580911423044">9</xref></sup> The respondents’ duration of membership was also measured. Additional independent variables include respondent characteristics (age, household size, form of family).</p>
<p>At the group level, I measured group size by the number of members in the <italic>sangha</italic>. Using the founding year as a basis, the number of years for which the <italic>sangha</italic> has been functional is defined as the age of the <italic>sangha</italic>. Drawing from the earlier work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0268580911423044">Freeman (1974)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0268580911423044">Rothschild-Whitt (1979)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0268580911423044">Martin (1990)</xref>, I defined the structure of a group to explain the way in which control or authority is organized and power is distributed, the way work is divided up and integrated, the decision-making arrangements and the normative internal arrangements. However, lack of scholarship on operational measures for these dimensions focusing particularly on grassroots groups in developing countries required starting with several item measures, as explained below, keeping in mind the context within which the <italic>sanghas</italic> are formed and are functional. In the case of the MSK, the flexibility in the relationship between the village <italic>sanghas</italic> and the higher (district and state) levels of the organization and at least some independence in functioning implies differences in the way authority is exercised or rules are applied.</p>
<p>I operationalized group structure using specific measure for three sub-dimensions: authority, rules and incentive structure. Starting with a total of 13 item measures for authority, seven items for rules and five items of incentive structure, I developed a set of reliable measures in two steps; first a reliability analysis and second a factor analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0268580911423044">Subramaniam, 2001</xref>). The five-item measure index was a summed scale and included who convenes meetings, whether rules exist for <italic>sangha</italic> membership, whether the facilitator makes decisions in the best interests of the MSK, whether the <italic>sangha</italic> received an honorarium and whether the <italic>sangha</italic> has constructed a ‘hut’. In order to assess the structure of the 31 sampled <italic>sanghas</italic>, I standardized the scores for the dimension of structure (using the reliable scale) and categorized the <italic>sanghas</italic> as bureaucratic, hybrid and collectivist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0268580911423044">Subramaniam, 2006</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0268580911423044">10</xref></sup> Ten groups are bureaucratic, 15 are hybrid and six are collective. Therefore, the groups differed in form when this study was conducted. I use this classification of bureaucratic, hybrid and collective for the HLM analysis discussed later.</p>
<p>To measure leadership, I focused on the role of the <italic>sahayogini</italic> in leading the group and acting as a bridge between the members and external institutions. The leader shapes the strategies of the group and may thereby create a hierarchy between the participants and the leaders. I sought responses about specific situations on whether the <italic>sahayogini</italic> has led the <italic>sangha</italic>. In order to develop a reliable index from the five-item measures used to measure leadership, I conducted a two-step analysis: first reliability analysis and then factor analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0268580911423044">Subramaniam, 2001</xref>). The final reliable scale I used for the HLM analysis discussed later comprised three items: whether the <italic>sahayogini</italic> led protests, whether she forced a decision on nomination to the local <italic>panchayat</italic> and whether she campaigned for a <italic>sangha</italic> member contesting <italic>panchayat</italic> elections. Let me turn to provide an overview of my sample of members and <italic>sanghas</italic>.</p>
<p>Respondents in my sample are between 20 and 50 years old and most of them (over 80 percent) are <italic>dalits</italic> and included <italic>devadasis</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0268580911423044">11</xref></sup> <xref ref-type="app" rid="app2-0268580911423044">Appendix B</xref> gives a overview of the respondents. About 32 percent of respondents have been <italic>sangha</italic> members for three years or less. A little over 50 percent of respondents have been <italic>sangha</italic> members for between four and six years and about 15 percent have been members for seven years or more. The size of the 31 <italic>sanghas</italic> based on membership varies between 12 and 50. <italic>Sanghas</italic> varied in age from about six months to eight years with about 48 percent of the sampled <italic>sanghas</italic> being five years or older. According to the <italic>sahayoginis</italic> of 16 of the sampled <italic>sanghas</italic>, women stay at a meeting for two to four hours; a rough indication of participant interest in the <italic>sangha</italic>.</p>

<title>MSK’s <italic>sanghas</italic>: Leadership and structure</title>
<p>In the following sections, I discuss <italic>sangha</italic> structure and leadership and then assess the combined effects of group and individual characteristics on political-cultural empowerment.</p>
<sec id="section8-0268580911423044">
<title>Sangha structure</title>
<p>The predominance of hybrid forms supports earlier assertions that the ‘ideal’ forms of groups, bureaucratic and collectivist, are unlikely to exist in reality. Earlier research by others like <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0268580911423044">Bordt (1997)</xref> suggests that organizations that start committed to staff collectives become less concerned with structure and more concerned with strategy. Their new overall organizational ‘hybrid’ forms combine in innovative ways the best characteristics of both collectives and bureaucracies. In the case of the MSK, the objective is to involve participants in the <italic>sanghas</italic> who may then shape the structure, although the connection to the <italic>sahayogini</italic> is not completely severed. Considering my observational data about increasing involvement of members in older groups (such as the cases of Kulali and Kanakgeri discussed later), I analysed the bivariate relationship between structure and age. Group structure and age are positively correlated (significant at <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01). I explore both these characteristics (age and structure) further in the HLM analysis.</p>
<p>Based on the above, two points are worth noting. First, a major proportion of the <italic>sanghas</italic> are hybrid (not bureaucratic). Second, the tendency of older groups toward greater bureaucracy possibly stems from the primary objective of members’ involvement in shaping the <italic>sangha</italic>. As members draw from past experiences to make decisions or take action, they may rely on ‘blue-prints’ making the <italic>sanghas</italic> appear bureaucratic. Hybrid groups may engage in joint decisions made by both the participants and the representative/s of the MSK district or state office together. While this is not indicative of control by the <italic>sangha</italic> participants, it draws attention to the involvement of the participants in the activities. Such a working together is indicative of the MSK’s commitment to providing a space for the local community to facilitate building women’s strength and self-image and is in direct contrast to the state’s ‘clientelistic’ approach. Thus, there is possibly a relationship between member participation, <italic>sangha</italic> structure and leadership which I explore in the HLM analysis later.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0268580911423044">
<title>Sangha leadership</title>
<p>The MSK program’s <italic>sahayoginis</italic> are non-professional facilitators engaged in mobilizing women to form grassroots groups. In most cases, during the initial formation period of the <italic>sangha</italic>, a <italic>sahayogini</italic> informally meets with village women. Soon thereafter, the <italic>sahayogini</italic> plays an active role in holding the group together in the interval between actions or activities. She chooses issues to be discussed in the <italic>sangha</italic> meeting based on her ‘understanding of the local situation and of women’s needs’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0268580911423044">Government of India, n.d.</xref>: 48). <italic>Sahayoginis</italic> are able to relate with <italic>sangha</italic> women because they are selected from the same group of villages that form a cluster, are predominantly from among the lowest caste and have similar life experiences, particularly in reference to gender- and caste-based discrimination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0268580911423044">Government of India, n.d.</xref>). Over 50 percent of the <italic>sahayoginis</italic> of the sampled <italic>sanghas</italic> belong to the lowest caste.</p>
<p>The initial relationship between the <italic>sahayogini</italic> and participants reaches a peak as she takes on the mantle of leadership. However, the involvement of the <italic>sahayogini</italic> tapers off as <italic>sangha</italic> members assume the responsibility for organizing meetings and planning activities, seeking assistance from the <italic>sahayogini</italic> and/or program staff sparingly. The role of the <italic>sahayogini</italic> shifts from a greater degree of involvement and commitment to the <italic>sangha</italic> in the initial stages to a gradual reduction in interaction with the members. Moreover, <italic>sangha</italic> women gradually gain the strength and confidence as they look for collective solutions to their problems.</p>
<p>In the majority of cases, the collectives have taken their first steps as they gained access to vital information, on their rights and laws, and about help available through other government programs. As the <italic>sangha</italic> women begin to make ‘connections between their personal experiences of oppression and universal questions of women’s rights, between the personal and the political’ the role of the facilitator is taken over by them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0268580911423044">Government of India, n.d.</xref>: 48). But this is a slow process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0268580911423044">Government of India, n.d.</xref>). This shift implies a gradual transfer of leadership of the <italic>sangha</italic> from the <italic>sahayogini</italic> to the participants. Thus, the role of the <italic>sahayogini</italic> is challenging because she has to constantly maintain a balance between providing assistance to the <italic>sangha</italic> and ensuring they do not become entirely dependent on her.</p>
<p>The shift in the role of the <italic>sahayogini</italic> in providing information and support is evident from the following discussion in the Mogadal village <italic>sangha</italic> which was about eight years old at the time of this study. During a <italic>sangha</italic> meeting discussion of how to try and get power reconnected for the <italic>sangha</italic> meeting hall, <italic>sahayogini</italic> Prema and junior resource person Shyla said, ‘You have done so much for your <italic>sangha</italic>. Why don’t you go to the government office in town to seek reconnection of power? You’re at the front, we’re at the back. We will teach you and tell you what you can do. You discuss and decide.’ While <italic>dalit</italic> women typically have had little access to local government officials, they have increasingly drawn on the <italic>sangha</italic> as a collective resource to seek support for their activities from government offices.</p>
<p>At the group level, the notion of leadership is diffuse as the facilitator’s involvement with the <italic>sangha</italic> gradually tapers off. The MSK’s staff and <italic>sahayoginis</italic> encourage <italic>sanghas</italic> to create a rotational position of leader from among members. About 16 percent of the women members of the sampled <italic>sanghas</italic> indicated that they led activities for some period of time. However, my field observations of the <italic>sanghas</italic> indicate that this position was fluid as members took on tasks based on convenience and often shared responsibilities. In fact, documents such as the register for recording details of weekly savings are stored in the house of a member who may not be responsible for collecting savings and depositing it in the bank. Thus, as <italic>sangha</italic> members set procedures and take on, rather than allocate, tasks and responsibilities, they are involved in shaping the <italic>sangha</italic> through a process that can be empowering. In order to explore this further, I turn to analyse individual-and group-level data in a set of HLM models.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0268580911423044">
<title>HLM analysis: Structure, leadership and political-cultural empowerment</title>
<p>In the first part of the HLM analyses, I examine an unconditional model (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0268580911423044">Table 1</xref>). In this model, the variance in the dependent variable, political-cultural empowerment, measured at the individual level, is considered as comprising two parts: between individuals within a <italic>sangha</italic> and between <italic>sanghas</italic> (identified as between group variability and within group variability in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0268580911423044">Table 1</xref>). The results indicate that about 63 percent of the variance in individual political-cultural empowerment is between <italic>sanghas</italic>, implying that group characteristics matter in members’ empowerment. Keeping these results in mind, I developed the models reported in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0268580911423044">Tables 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0268580911423044">3</xref>.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0268580911423044">12</xref></sup> I discuss all the models below.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0268580911423044">13</xref></sup></p>

<p>In Model 1 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0268580911423044">Table 2</xref>), I examined the effects of group age and size on members’ political-cultural empowerment. Models 2 and 3 in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0268580911423044">Table 2</xref> included additional variables: group structure in Model 2 and group leadership in Model 3. In Model 1, group age has a positive significant effect (γ<sub>01</sub> = 0.57) and this effect remains after controlling for group size. I then successively introduced the variables group structure and leadership to assess the effects on political-cultural empowerment (Models 2 and 3). Group structure, along with group age, is significantly associated with political-cultural empowerment but leadership has no effect. There is also some difference in the variance among groups in the levels of member political-cultural empowerment; it was 38 percent in Model 1 but increased in Models 2 and 3 to 46 percent and 45 percent respectively. I discuss these results below.</p>
<p>The results in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0268580911423044">Table 2</xref> suggest that <italic>sanghas</italic> with a greater degree of bureaucracy are more likely to be empowering for members. However, it is plausible that the more bureaucratic <italic>sanghas</italic> are a result of the increasing involvement of members in creating, setting up and adopting rules and procedures. Such involvement can be reaffirming for the extremely disadvantaged such as <italic>dalit</italic> women. Moreover, it raises women’s confidence to recognize their own abilities to organize for change. While one could argue that the collectivist and hybrid forms also involve members in varying degrees, they do not result in concrete practices that the <italic>sangha</italic> may adopt and retain as blue-prints.</p>
<p>In contrast to group structure, leadership measured as the ‘facilitative’ leadership of the <italic>sahayoginis</italic> has no significant impact on members’ empowerment. This is meaningful as the <italic>sangha</italic>’s reliance on the <italic>sahayogini</italic> diminishes gradually with emphasis on providing information and assistance rather than directing the course of action. It implies that leadership adopts a diffused form rather than ‘hierarchical command’ possibly because of the involvement of members. So, what are the effects of <italic>sangha</italic> women’s participation in these models?</p>
<p>After examining the effects of <italic>sangha</italic> structure and leadership on empowerment, I proceeded to determine if the inclusion of individual-level variables of current participation along with respondent and family characteristics have an effect on political-cultural empowerment. Models 4, 5, 6 and 7 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0268580911423044">Table 3</xref>) allow for considering situations in which <italic>sangha</italic> characteristics along with the aforementioned individual variables affect political-cultural empowerment, either amplifying them or attenuating them.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0268580911423044">14</xref></sup> First, even after controlling for individual and household characteristics, <italic>sangha</italic> age and structure have a positive significant association with political-cultural empowerment (Model 4). Second, these associations hold in Model 7 along with a positive significant association of current participation as well on political-cultural empowerment. Third, it is important to note that leadership is not significant in any of these models. However, there is no major difference in the total parameter variance among groups in mean levels of member political-cultural empowerment; it was 41 percent in Model 4 and increased to 42 percent in Models 5, 6 and 7.</p>
<p>These findings draw attention to the plausible complicated relationship between <italic>sangha</italic> structure, leadership and empowerment. The results confirm that the pursuit of the goals of the MSK program involves two related issues: one is the decreasing involvement of the <italic>sahayogini</italic> as a facilitative leader and the other is the involvement of the members in the <italic>sangha</italic>. However, village women are not mobilized and organized in predetermined formal bureaucratic structures. As women members set the agenda for their <italic>sangha</italic>, it is very likely that these structures emerge as participants connect, interact and develop mechanisms to actively engage as a group and challenge gender- and caste-based structures of power. This is a significant experience for <italic>dalit</italic> women who are likely to be empowered through participation in the <italic>sanghas</italic> they shape. For instance, one <italic>sangha</italic> woman told me, ‘What do we do in our <italic>sangha</italic>? We talk, we sing, we laugh. We speak our innermost thoughts. We make each other happy.’ However, this is more likely to occur in older groups that have provided more time for learning and sharing of life experiences such as caste and gender prejudices. This is also borne out from my field observations in other <italic>sanghas</italic>. I discuss the cases of two <italic>sanghas</italic>, Kulali and Kanakgeri, below.</p>
<p>‘We need to raise money and complete this hall for our meetings. We have some amount from what we raised on the foundation laying day. But we have to quickly decide about visiting the <italic>Zilla Panchayat</italic> soon’ (<italic>sangha</italic> member). This excerpt is drawn from the discussion at a late night meeting in Kulali village; a <italic>sangha</italic> which was over five years old. I attended this meeting along with the group facilitator and a staff member from the district office. While we sat in a dimly lit, partially constructed hall, members first sang and then laid out a list of three items they planned to discuss. The <italic>sahayogini</italic> watched silently and made no move to intervene. The <italic>sangha</italic> women discussed what they described as an urgent issue: the completion of the construction of the meeting hall for which they needed resources. The meeting continued for over an hour and ended with a decision to seek the honorarium amount that the MSK earmarks for <italic>sanghas</italic> and then also visit the district-level government office (<italic>Zilla Panchayat</italic>) to seek additional funds. The <italic>sangha</italic> members took on the mantle of leadership confidently and the <italic>sahayogini</italic> provided information but she remained marginal to the proceedings.</p>
<p>Kanakgeri <italic>sangha</italic>, which was less than two years old, is a direct contrast to the case of Kulali. I attended a <italic>sangha</italic> meeting in Kanakgeri, late one evening, after the women had returned from agricultural wage labor. The <italic>sangha</italic> women meet in an open space in front of a village temple. The <italic>sangha</italic> facilitator and a district staff member were also present. The <italic>sangha</italic> women took quite some time to assemble for the meeting, wherein deliberations were minimal. In fact, the district staff member, who had earlier worked as a <italic>sahayogini</italic>, noted that these experiences were not uncommon. The <italic>sangha</italic> women were reluctant to introduce themselves, explain what they had discussed in previous meetings, or even suggest agenda items for the meeting. Questions such as, ‘would you like to know about the village school council or would you like to nominate a <italic>sangha</italic> member to contest the elections to the local governance institution’, posed by the <italic>sahayogini</italic>, evoked no verbal response but only the nodding of heads.</p>
<p>The two cases discussed above reinforce the findings from the quantitative analysis, specifically the complex relationship between age and structure of groups, the participation of members and empowerment. The active role of the <italic>sahayogini</italic> is evident in the Kanakgeri <italic>sangha</italic> in contrast to the marginal role she played in the Kulali <italic>sangha</italic> meeting. This suggests that group structure has to be considered beyond merely the existence of rules and authority to consider member participation, as I do in the models in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0268580911423044">Table 3</xref>, because the involvement of members has consequences for making rules and decision-making blue-prints.</p>
<p>The process of scheduling meetings, discussing and finalizing decisions is not uniform across the <italic>sanghas</italic> I visited. While the <italic>sanghas</italic> followed a ritual of starting meetings with a song in praise of a local deity or God, they had no set procedures for considering issues at the meeting. In fact, as I observed at the meetings in Mosabinal <italic>sangha</italic> (Bijapur district) and Taj Sultanpur <italic>sangha</italic> (Gulbarga district), members volunteered to take on specific responsibilities such as visiting the office of the <italic>Zilla Parishad</italic> to seek resources. Such a flexible mode of operation enables <italic>sangha</italic> members to maintain time commitments to their family and wage labor. The exceptions to this flexible mode of operation included adherence to rules for contesting local <italic>panchayat</italic> elections. <italic>Sanghas</italic>, thus, develop a convenient mode of functioning; and for repetitive tasks the members create a blue-print that is not recorded in a book. These variations in the ways <italic>sanghas</italic> function are reflected in the structure as being more collectivist, hybrid, or more bureaucratic.</p>
<p><italic>Sangha</italic> members challenge power not only in the public sphere but in the private sphere of the family as well. Their gains in power in both spheres are evident from the threats they face from men in their families, including the disruptions of <italic>sangha</italic> meetings by village men (<italic>dalit</italic> and others) as I saw happen in Udhunur village. Moreover, <italic>sangha</italic> women actively resist domestic violence and cultural practices such as child marriage.</p>
<p>At a meeting I attended, the Gabbur <italic>sangha</italic> women discussed a case of violence against a woman and collectively decided to confront the husband of the woman, a local tea stall owner. At the <italic>sangha</italic> meeting, they determined that a few of them would speak to him. They warned him that the <italic>sangha</italic> took the matter of such violence very seriously and they followed up on this issue.</p>
<p>
<disp-quote>
<p>He owns a tea stall, works and earns money. And at night he goes to the liquor shop with other men, gets drunk, and comes home and abuses her. We, in the <italic>sangha</italic>, had to find a way to deal with this. First, we thought we would get him to come during one of our <italic>sangha</italic> meetings – like by ordering tea from his tea stall. Then, we felt that it might be difficult to speak to him with all of us here. We, then, decided that few of us, older women, would speak to him one day, and warn him about abusing his wife. We warned him that the <italic>sangha</italic> will take this matter very seriously if he does not mend his ways. And, now we have been keeping track and following up. He has still not completely given up on drinking. (<italic>Sangha</italic> woman in Gabbur village)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>At the same time, <italic>sanghas</italic> find ways to respond to women who have been victims of violence. For instance, the Ashok Nagar <italic>sangha</italic> decided to employ a young woman from a neighboring village to oversee the crèche they had initiated. This young woman was a victim of domestic violence who was looking for a place to live and put her life back together. The crèche, a small one-room concrete structure, served as her home at night.</p>
<p>In a similar vein, <italic>sangha</italic> women recognize the need to prevent child marriage as was evident in a song and dance sequence performed at the Gulbarga Taluka Mahasabha meeting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0268580911423044">Subramaniam, 2006</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0268580911423044">15</xref></sup> This recognition of the lack of respect for women and young girls was also translated into action as <italic>sangha</italic> women and their daughters successfully averted a case of child marriage in Bijapur.</p>
<p><italic>Sangha</italic> women also work to gain economic power within their households. For instance, in Mugalnagaon, <italic>sangha</italic> women sought ownership of a small piece of land to begin a project of growing local herbs, with medicinal value, as an economic activity. This is significant because in rural India land is an inherently local resource and so its control imparts a unique character to politics of class, caste and gender.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>By focusing on grassroots groups, this article draws attention to the localized organizing of poor women from among the lowest caste in rural areas of India. Social movement scholars may tend to classify such grassroots-based movements as development interventions without considering the impacts that individual and collective resistances can have, particularly for the disadvantaged. As noted by others such as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0268580911423044">Basu (1995)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0268580911423044">Katzenstein and Mueller (1987)</xref>, the grassroots groups, <italic>sanghas</italic>, considered in this article suggest that the vibrancy of the women’s movement does not lie primarily in the activities of large national organizations. While they may not be the most visible actors, grassroots groups often provide the dynamism for social change.</p>
<p>Empirical investigation of group structure and participation has involved the use of qualitative data alone and has largely focused on women in western contexts. While observational data are well suited to show the process aspect of group functioning (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0268580911423044">Polletta, 2002</xref>), they do not provide a basis to systematically consider how individual and group characteristics interact. Moreover, the focus on western, urban cases overlooks the possibility of very poor illiterate women who experience gender and caste discrimination to organize and shape grassroots groups. This article addresses both these gaps. Moreover, this initial attempt to consider the combined effects of individual and group characteristics using cross-sectional data can be extended in future research by using longitudinal data to explore effects over time.</p>
<p>Although these findings should be viewed as provisional, they have implications for social movement theory in developing and developed countries.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0268580911423044">16</xref></sup> The analysis in this article has four main implications. First, it challenges the view that poor women only organize around economic issues in a passive and defensive way, which denies them agency and consciousness. The struggle to address multiple oppressions can be a politically transformative process. It is through the grassroots <italic>sanghas</italic> that women in the villages are building their self-confidence, organizational capacity, leadership and analytical skills to participate in civil society and becoming aware of the need to press for policy changes. Their involvement in creating rules and procedures for the <italic>sanghas</italic> and determining their course of action contributes to raising their self-confidence and building their skills. Although much of women’s associational activity takes place in the social non-state focused sphere it is closely intermeshed with the more political state-oriented activity; thereby interfacing the public and the private.</p>
<p>Second, this article draws attention to two main issues in social movement research: member participation in shaping group structure and group leadership. <italic>Sanghas</italic> as grassroots groups are relatively small in size and participation of members facilitates shaping and maintaining the structure. Thus, grassroots groups adopt various forms: bureaucratic, collectivist and hybrid. The emergence of hybrid forms supports earlier assertions made by scholars that the ‘ideal’ forms of groups, bureaucratic or collectivist, is unlikely to exist in reality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0268580911423044">Bordt, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0268580911423044">Ferree and Martin, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0268580911423044">Polletta, 2002</xref>). <italic>Sanghas</italic> leaning toward a bureaucratic or a collectivist trend (rather than the ideal) may emerge as members set up rules and procedures or do not feel the need to do so. As the ‘connecting link’ between the state/district and the <italic>sanghas</italic> is never completely severed, a bureaucratic element remains. However, members of <italic>sanghas</italic> that adopt a more bureaucratic form are more likely to be empowered. Earlier findings about the shift to a more bureaucratic form of organization as necessary for maintenance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0268580911423044">Staggenborg, 1988</xref>) can be extended to include the likely impact on members of the groups. Members’ involvement in setting up rules or following specific procedures can be empowering particularly for poor and severely disadvantaged people like the <italic>dalit</italic> women in this case. The variations in the structure of such grassroots groups in the developing world confirm assertions by other scholars such as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0268580911423044">Tripp (2000)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0268580911423044">Desai (1996)</xref>. Thus, early debates were subject to misinterpretations by assuming that there is a single typical form of movement organization. Grassroots groups can serve as ‘living’ repertoires that can be drawn upon possibly in specific cultural contexts.</p>
<p>Third, this analysis adds a new dimension to our consideration of leadership of movement organizations and particularly of grassroots groups. The case of the MSK <italic>sanghas</italic> calls for considering the possibility of changes in the form of leadership. Although <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0268580911423044">Robnett’s (1997)</xref> research rightly calls attention to women’s work in grassroots organizing in the Civil Rights Movement and referring to them as ‘bridging’ leaders, it does not capture the changing nature of the facilitative leadership I discuss with regard to the work of the <italic>sahayogini</italic>. While the <italic>sahayogini</italic> adopts the mantle of leadership as she mobilizes women and organizes the <italic>sangha</italic> initially, her role becomes less conspicuous as the <italic>sangha</italic> is established and members shape activities. Leadership is diffuse as members negotiate responsibilities and tasks.</p>
<p>The points on structure and leadership discussed above have major implications for our understanding of women’s organizations, leadership and empowerment. Women typically rely on less authoritative modes of leadership or hierarchical command to engage participants and thereby emphasize the ‘means’ for empowerment. In contrast to the more traditional conception of leadership as directing events and administering rules, leaders of women’s organizations focus on learning processes and redefining what it means to be successful (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0268580911423044">Ferree and Hess, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0268580911423044">Freeman, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0268580911423044">Payne, 1989</xref>). As noted earlier, the <italic>sangha</italic> women and <italic>sahayogini</italic> pursue similar ideals, which possibly manifests in the complex intertwining of participation by members, the form of the group and the nature of leadership. Facilitative leadership and flexible and diffuse authority that is open and temporary will constrain the institutionalization of power because ultimate decisions will be made by the group, or at least the group will have the power to determine who shall exercise authority within it. However, these analyses do not explicitly indicate that bureaucracy is an inevitable outcome for longevity. While groups of people coming together for any length of time may structure themselves in some way, that structure may be flexible, may vary over time and differentially distribute power and resources across group members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0268580911423044">Freeman, 1974</xref>).</p>
<p>Finally, these analyses have policy implications for national governments and international agencies that design literacy and empowerment programs for the disadvantaged. It alerts policy-makers to the creation and maintenance of local structures that simultaneously recognize processes to facilitate consciousness-raising to raise demand from ‘within’ (by <italic>dalit</italic> women in this case) for basic needs such as literacy. The conventional meaning of literacy has in itself been reconsidered by the MSK program and the <italic>sangha</italic> members as participants set the pace of change rather then adopt the typical ‘top-down’ approach advocated by governments and international agencies.</p>

<p>More than one-sixth of India’s population, about 160 million people, is categorized as <italic>dalits</italic> (meaning ‘downtrodden’) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0268580911423044">Government of India, 1999</xref>). Under Articles 341 and 342 of the Indian Constitution, certain castes, specified by public notification, have been deemed to be Scheduled Castes (SC) and are still among the poorest sections of Indian society.</p>
</fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn2-0268580911423044">

<p>According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0268580911423044">Staggenborg (1988)</xref>, the term, ‘informal’ is used to describe SMOs that do not adopt a more ‘corporate’ form. The term ‘collectivist’ used by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0268580911423044">Rothschild-Whitt (1979)</xref> refers to a specific type of decision-making structure, which is distinct from ‘bureaucratic’ organizations, but not all informal social movement organizations are collectivist.</p>

<p>A district is an administrative unit of the state and is made up of several <italic>talukas</italic>, and a <italic>taluka</italic> comprises several villages. Activities in one other district, Mysore, were temporarily suspended in 1998.</p>
</fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn4-0268580911423044">

<p>See <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0268580911423044">Joshi (1986)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0268580911423044">Jogdand (1995)</xref> for details. ‘Untouchability’, along with rituals and ritual prohibitions, is an essential feature of the caste system. The practice of untouchability isolates <italic>dalits</italic> from those belonging to the upper castes. ‘Untouchables’ may not cross the line dividing their part of the village from that occupied by higher castes. They may not use the same wells for drawing water or drink from the same cups as used by others in tea stalls. Although abolished by law, untouchability, as a practice, remains an integral part of daily life in rural India.</p>

<p>In 1983, Karnataka established a <italic>panchayat</italic> system to reserve 25 percent of local council seats for women; before the 1993 national stipulation of one-third seats for women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0268580911423044">Vyasalu and Vyasalu, 2000</xref>).</p>

<p>The data are cross-sectional in nature; not longitudinal. The data are drawn from a larger project with a quasi-experimental design of 503 members from the 31 sampled <italic>sanghas</italic> and 103 non-members from villages where <italic>sanghas</italic> had not been formed. This design made it possible to test for differences, if any, in the mean scores of political-cultural empowerment between women members of <italic>sanghas</italic> and women from non-<italic>sangha</italic> villages. The results show that the mean political-cultural empowerment is significantly higher for <italic>sangha</italic> members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0268580911423044">Subramaniam, 2001</xref>).</p>

<p>The response rate is 90.8 percent for <italic>sangha</italic> members. The survey instrument is available with the author, who is familiar with this geographical region and is fluent in the local language.</p>

<p>The complete list of measures from which the reliable scales were constructed is available from the author. I selected item measures using a cutoff at loading &gt; 0.50. A reliability analysis was conducted to screen item measures prior to running a factor analysis of the selected items.</p>

<fn fn-type="other" id="fn9-0268580911423044">
<label>9.</label>
<p>Response option ‘never participate’ means the respondent does not engage in discussions in the <italic>sangha</italic> meetings; ‘sometimes participate’ means the respondent occasionally involves herself/engages in discussions in meetings; ‘actively participate’ means the respondent engages and is involved in discussions in the meetings regularly/always.</p>
</fn>

<label>10.</label>
<p>I used the following criteria to categorize the <italic>sanghas</italic> based on the standardized scores. I categorized <italic>sanghas</italic> with <italic>Z</italic>-scores greater than +0.5 as bureaucratic, those with <italic>Z</italic>-scores between + 0.5 as hybrid and those with scores below –0.5 as collective. Hybrid groups are therefore <italic>sanghas</italic> which fall close to the mean score for the dimension ‘bureaucratic-collective’.</p>

<p>Ninety percent of the SC/STs described themselves as Hindus. ‘<italic>Devadasi</italic>’ is a Sanskrit term that literally means ‘servant or slave of God’. In the <italic>devadasi</italic> practice, young girls (not young boys) are dedicated, before attaining puberty, to the goddess Yellamma. The practice continues but <italic>devadasis</italic> lack respect in the community.</p>

<p>I use the applications in organizational research in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0268580911423044">Bryk and Raudenbush (1992)</xref>. In the first set of models (Models 1, 2 and 3), only the intercept parameter in a level 1 model is assumed to vary at level 2.</p>
</fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn13-0268580911423044">
<label>13.</label>
<p>Group age was a significant variable in this model and several others that I ran. And, the proportion of variance explained by the models was around the same or lesser than that for the models reported here.</p>
</fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn14-0268580911423044">
<label>14.</label>
<p>The estimated variance in the one-way random ANOVA model, without including ‘significance of group goals’ as a level-1 predictor was 1.91569. Therefore, proportion of variance explained at level 1 = [σ<sup>2</sup> (random ANOVA) – σ<sup>2</sup> (significance of group goals)]/ σ<sup>2</sup> (random ANOVA). This forms the basis for the calculation of the proportion of variance accounted for at level 1 in Models 4, 5, 6 and 7.</p>

<p>The song as translated from the local language, Kannada, is as follows: ‘Why have this little girl wear a sari, have her don a dress; Have her don a dress; Why such an early marriage for her; Why have this little girl wear a sari, have her don a dress; Have her don a dress; Have her attend school, teach her the alphabets.’</p>
</fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn16-0268580911423044">
<label>16.</label>
<p>I call for caution in the interpretation of the results because of some constraints posed by the data. Although the total number of individuals in the sample is fairly large (502 women), data at the group level are limited to the 31 groups sampled, which posed some restriction on the number of variables that could be introduced in the models. However, this initial attempt can serve as a basis for additional research to explore such multi-level effects in the areas of gender and social movements. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0268580911423044">Bryk and Raudenbush (1992)</xref> also refer to the concern with robustness in the presence of unbalanced data such as a unit with a very small sample size.</p>
