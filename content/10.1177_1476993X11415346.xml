<abstract>
<p>Recent studies of the letters of the New Testament have uncovered intentional words, phrases, ideology and imagery that carry the weight of anti-imperial rhetoric. The second of three articles, this is an investigation of current scholarship concerned with the use of anti-imperial rhetoric in the New Testament epistles. While it is impossible to ignore the Jewish nature of many of the New Testament epistles, both mild and overt, anti-imperial rhetoric challenges the emperor worship and the propaganda of the Roman imperial authorities of the first century. The first part of this article, published in Currents 10.1, is a brief summation of the scholarly developments that have taken place in the discipline of the New Testament epistles. Over decades of research, scholarship has moved from the understanding of the intersection of the book of Acts and the Pauline letters, to the connection between the Apostle Paul and Judaism, to the realization of the junction between Paul and the Gentile world. The second part of the article focuses on a number of Pauline epistles and general epistles where we catch a glimpse of a newer scholarly development, which is a postcolonial approach to the context of the New Testament epistles and the Roman Empire. In a general sense, the response of the authors of the New Testament epistles to the dominating government seems to be, ‘Jesus is Lord, not Caesar!’</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>In the first century of the Common Era, the Roman Emperor (Caesar) was considered to be divine, a privilege and a position relished by the emperor and recognized by his subjects throughout the Empire. The fact that the Christian church grew and spread rapidly in this century, despite the worship of another ‘god’ besides Caesar, is truly remarkable. Our historical knowledge of the imperial context in which the early church thrived helps contemporary readers to see a better picture of the setting, political climate and culture in which the New Testament was written.</p>
<p>In view of this historical background concerning the Roman Empire, some scholars are increasing their efforts to demonstrate that numerous passages in the New Testament can be understood as ‘anti-imperial rhetoric’. Certain passages in the New Testament contain language and imagery that were used by the authors to address the threatening realities of life for Christian believers in this controlled, powerful empire. This is the second of three articles that will present current scholarship as it relates to ‘anti-imperial rhetoric’ and ‘anti-emperor’ positions in the New Testament writings. The first article addressed anti-imperial rhetoric in the New Testament Gospels and Acts. The third in the series will consider the Book of Revelation (the Apocalypse of John) as the literary climax of politically-charged rhetoric in the New Testament. The purpose of the series is to consider how current biblical scholarship is dealing with anti-imperial rhetoric and anti-emperor implications found in the New Testament.</p>
<p>Specifically, this essay focuses on the development of scholarly approaches to the texts of the New Testament epistles and discusses the possible anti-imperial rhetoric found in these writings. We are asking relevant new questions pertaining how New Testament academics understand the epistles of Paul, as well as the New Testament general epistles. How are we to understand the messages of these ancient writers and the circumstances of the people to whom they wrote? Did the first-century Christian missionaries find it necessary to formulate their messages in a conscious reaction to the Roman imperial authority and emperor worship? Was Jesus Christ seen as an adversary to the reigning Emperor in the region where Paul and his contemporaries preached? The thesis question is, how does the context of the ancient Roman Empire and the imperial cult stimulate current interpretations of the New Testament epistles, if indeed, it does?</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1476993X11415346">
<title>1. Part One: Scholarly Developments</title>
<p>The first part of this article is a brief outline of the scholarly developments that have taken place within the discipline of the New Testament epistles. Over decades of analysis, scholarship has moved from (1) a perception of the intersection of the book of Acts and the Pauline letters, to (2) the connection between the Apostle Paul and Judaism, to (3) the realization of the junction between Paul and the Gentile world. Finally, we give consideration to a fourth development, which is the newer postcolonial approach. This leads into part two of the essay where we investigate in more detail a number of the Pauline epistles and a few of the general epistles in the New Testament as they expose the context of the first-century Roman Empire.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, due to time and space, we are unable to sufficiently cover all the scholarly publications pertaining to the early Christian church and the effects of the Roman Empire. The focus of this study is not so much on the complex historical issues surrounding the early Christian church and the impact of the Empire on its expansion, as much as it is a focus on the letters of the New Testament and how they reflect the perspectives of the writers and the readers. Further, it is impossible to adequately cover all the recent scholarship on all of the New Testament epistles. It is necessary to consider only a representative selection of recent scholarship; we cannot consider each and every epistle in depth, so some brevity is required. It is also easy to see that more scholarship needs to be done on various, more disputed letters. While not all the epistles in the New Testament are Pauline, of course, we will begin with his letters, with the assumption that if the Christian communities known to Paul felt the heavy hand of the Roman government, the other recipients of New Testament letters were also very conscious of the social, economic and political climate of the Empire.</p>
<sec id="section3-1476993X11415346">
<title>a. The Apostle Paul and the Book of Acts</title>
<p>The first development of scholarship was an historical evaluation of Paul’s letters especially in relationship to the book of Acts. Much of our knowledge about the life of Paul, his missionary travels and his epistles to the churches has been based on accounts in the book of Acts relative to the letters that follow. Richard Cassidy notes that the book of Acts ‘nearly overflows’ with conflict between Paul and the imperial authorities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1476993X11415346">1987</xref>: 34). However, he also observes a clear ‘tension’ between Luke’s picture of Paul in Acts and the portraits of Paul that emerge from studies of his own letters. There is some question as to whether the Paul we see in Acts 22–28 is the same person who wrote all the epistles normally attributed to him. Both a geographical plan and a chronological order of Acts and the Pauline letters are an attempt to put his life into a ‘real context’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr93-1476993X11415346">Seesengood 2010</xref>: 35). Seesengood believes that even if the book of Acts is ‘reliable history’, the ‘conflicts and disparities’ between Luke’s account and the letters of Paul must make us cautious of how they are used together (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr93-1476993X11415346">2010</xref>: 35).</p>
<p>Unfortunately, neither historians nor biblical scholars can construct a precise, fool-proof time-line and travel itinerary of Paul’s life and mission work. If we knew with certainty when a letter was composed and delivered, it would be easier to determine its audience and the precise conditions that precipitated the communication. If we could discern an accurate order and timing of Paul’s letters, we could better judge if there is a change in his theology and/or rhetoric from one decade to the next. This makes it difficult to super-impose the letters attributed to him on top of the historical life of Paul as seen in Acts. Such differences in timing, various omissions, and a lack of clarity need to be reconciled if, indeed, they are obstacles in our understanding of Paul and his letters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr93-1476993X11415346">Seesengood 2010</xref>: 37).</p>
<p>A parallel development in scholarship is an historical approach to the Roman Empire, to the political, cultural, social and religious footmarks that it made on the known world, including the literature that was produced in the first century. Interestingly, we have very detailed historical accounts of all the Roman Emperors of the first century <sc>ce</sc>, as well as historical events of the Empire at that time, while we have only sketchy (and sometimes puzzling) information about the life, work and death of Paul in that Empire. From the historical perspective, there is an abundance of known evidence of power and persecution, oppression and domination by the Roman imperial authorities over the ‘colonized’ people, such as Christians and the Jews. We know, for example, that Jews were evicted from the city of Rome by the edict of Emperor Claudius in 49 <sc>ce</sc>. The edict had far-reaching effects concerning not only the Christian congregation in Rome, but on the other congregations across the Empire. Thus, how did a leader like Paul lead, direct and encourage fellow-believers in the midst of known persecution? Moreover, throughout the vast Empire, conditions could shift over a period of time. Life in the first century could radically change, based upon a whim of the reigning emperor. During the early decades of Christian writing, there was nothing constant or stable about the controlling government. The volatile, changing environment affected the manner in which the New Testament writers disseminated information to their audiences in Asia Minor, as well as the way communications were received by the churches.</p>
<p>It is also worth noting that from the historical perspective of the Roman government, the Christian movement in the first century was small and insignificant. There may have been few reasons for the necessity of ‘hidden’ or subversive language in the Christian congregations. On the one hand, in the book of Acts the Roman authorities actually aided and protected Paul in his conflict with the Jewish leadership in various cities: in Corinth (Acts 18.12-17), in Jerusalem (Acts 21.27-40; 22.22-30), in Caesarea (Acts 23–25), and in Rome (Acts 28.17-20). It appears that they did not perceive Paul as a major threat to the imperial system. On the other hand, the Roman authorities may have been merely attempting to maintain peace and order in chaotic situations rather than assisting and supporting the Christian mission (Acts 21.27-32).</p>
<p>Historically and traditionally, we can be fairly certain about key items of interest concerning the Apostle Paul. First, even as a Jew by birth, Paul is considered to be the ‘apostle to the Gentiles’ (Acts 13.46-47). He is almost an ironic selection for such a task. Second, we know that, as a Roman citizen (Acts 22.22-29), Paul traveled freely and extensively throughout the Roman Empire as a Christian missionary, teaching in synagogues, establishing churches, and visiting those which he did not begin. It is interesting that Roman Gentiles worshiped the Jewish Messiah in Jewish synagogues. Third, an early detention resulted in Paul being held in the city of Rome for ‘two whole years’ (Acts 28.30). This meant that Paul was a resident in the capital for a lengthy time, and was allowed to continue his missionary work, right under the noses of the powerful pagan opposition (Acts 28.31). Ultimately, history has it that Paul was imprisoned and executed in the city of Rome, under the authority of the Roman government.</p>
<p>As a result of this information, Cassidy poses significant questions concerning the history and theology of Paul: was there a distinct development in Paul’s view of the Roman Empire government from the time of his trials in Rome (Acts 24–28), through the years of his ministry in the Empire, as seen in his letters to the churches? Historical events do affect the manner and necessity of writing letters; so, did Paul’s perspective of the imperial system change over his period of ministry? (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1476993X11415346">1987</xref>: 2). Was Paul executed by the Roman authorities; if so, when and why? Did his death have anything to do with the ‘Great Fire’ and persecution of Christians during Nero’s reign? Is it possible that Paul changed his mind about going to Rome because of a change in the reigning Emperor (that is, after the death of Claudius)? Did the advancement of time and changes in the reigning officials affect Paul’s perception of the imperial government? Ideologically, do we see a different position taken by Paul toward the imperial government from his earlier letters to his (often debatable) later letters? In other words, how did the Roman Empire affect Paul, and how did Paul navigate his way through such a powerful Empire dominated by offensive, opposing cultures and religions?</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1476993X11415346">
<title>b. Paul the Jew, and the Apostle to the Gentiles</title>
<p>In spite of these historical connections to the Roman imperial system, recent scholarship has spent a great deal of time and effort analyzing Paul as a Jew. The second development in scholarship is also reflected in history and in tradition: the relationship between Paul and Judaism.</p>
<p>Paul’s proclamation, his theology, Christology, eschatology, soteriology, anthropology and even his adversaries, have been evaluated in terms of his Jewish-ness: that is, facets of Paul and his writings are seen in connection to his Jewish heritage and his knowledge of the Jewish Scriptures. Outstanding scholars such as E.P. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-1476993X11415346">Sanders (1977</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-1476993X11415346">1991)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr122-1476993X11415346">N.T. Wright (1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr124-1476993X11415346">2005)</xref> and Francis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr108-1476993X11415346">Watson (2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr109-1476993X11415346">2007)</xref> have correctly brought to our attention the Jewish aspects of Paul’s life and letters. Sanders perhaps initiated the ‘New Perspective’ on Paul in the late twentieth century. His main concern was with the manner in which the original Christian communities read and understood Paul’s declarations about Judaism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr93-1476993X11415346">Seesengood 2010</xref>: 4).</p>
<p>Though he was Jewish by birth and custom, perhaps it was the ‘Roman-ness’ of Paul that allowed him to travel freely in the Empire, to speak relatively openly, and to write with comprehension to Roman audiences. It is apparent that the combination of Paul’s Jewish background and his Roman citizenship helped him advance the gospel message across Asia Minor. Yet, we know that not infrequently, Paul and his message were rejected by the local Jews (Acts 22–23). Surrounded by hostility on all sides, Paul and his associates may have found it necessary to ‘codify’ their words, or use ‘hidden language’ so as not to incite the wrath of the Roman establishment, or of the Jewish leaders. When he wrote to his fellow believers in the Empire, was he cautious with his language so that he did not place his recipients in danger of treason? How did Paul’s message about a Jewish messiah figure effectively explain the ‘kingdom of God and the lordship of Christ’ in an environment that recognized only ‘Caesar as Lord’?</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1476993X11415346">
<title>c. Paul and the Roman World</title>
<p>The third movement in scholarship is the recognition of how the Roman Empire affected Paul and the communities to whom he wrote. There is one specific historical occurrence that intersects the world of Rome and the world of Paul the missionary. That key feature was the worship of the reigning human emperor, or what has become known as the imperial cult. The gospel message of Paul and his fellow missionaries would have been in direct opposition to this custom. In his 1984 book, S.R.F. Price contends that imperial worship was both prevalent and powerful throughout the extensive Empire (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-1476993X11415346">1984</xref>: 248). Historians and theologians alike have become increasingly aware of the existence of the imperial cult in the form of ancient artifacts, such as impressive temples, priests, altars, inscriptions and statues. From the time of Augustus Caesar until about the fourth century <sc>ce</sc>, the worship of the emperor as a god was not uncommon. Scholars have come to believe that in Paul’s day (perhaps 30–60 <sc>ce</sc>) emperor worship and the imperial cult were not only ‘influential’, but also ‘widespread’ in the region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-1476993X11415346">Price 1984</xref>: 80).</p>
<p>Richard A. Horsley agrees, insisting that emperor worship is an important element that contributes to our understanding of Paul’s letters. Horsley has made major contributions to the study of Paul and the Roman Empire in three edited volumes as well as numerous ‘solo’ books and essays on the subject. In a general sense, Horsley contends that the Roman imperial government, and specifically the imperial cult, was the main force shaping the world of Paul. In his 1997 edited book, Horsley and other contributors bring to our attention a wide variety of diverse topics relevant to the discussion of Paul’s writings and anti-imperial rhetoric. Contributors include Paul Zanker, Dieter Georgi, Helmut Koester, Neil Elliott and Karl Donfried. This volume focuses on ‘imperial salvation, patronage, priesthoods, the power of images, Paul’s counter-imperial Gospel, and an alternative society’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1476993X11415346">1997</xref>: v, vi).</p>
<p>In his introduction, Horsley reminds us that it was primarily though the mission of Paul that the ‘crucified Christ’ became the dominant symbol of the prevalent movement that eventually developed into Christianity. The spread of the Christian movement continued despite the fact that the Roman military employed crucifixion as an ‘instrument to terrorize subjected peoples into submission to imperial rule’. The symbol of the cross is a reminder that the Romans ‘established their empire initially by superior force of arms, using systematic destruction, slaughter and enslavement as their means to the end of <italic>imperium</italic>’. It was under such political, religious and moral ideology of ‘empire’ that the Christian movement proliferated through the writings of the missionary Paul (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1476993X11415346">1997</xref>: 10).</p>
<p>Horsley sets the stage for modern readers by writing that ‘for nearly three generations’ before the time of Paul’s missionary travels to the area of Asia Minor, the imperial government had established order and control in the region. As a result, the imperial authorities managed the colonized people politically, religiously, socially and economically. Throughout the vast region, the Empire established ‘images, shrines, temples, sacrifices and festivals of the emperor cult’. Moreover, the local ‘elite’ citizens, who were ‘imperial clients’ of the Roman authority, sponsored ‘religious-political institutions’ that were ‘virtually inseparable from the local social-economic networks of society’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1476993X11415346">1997</xref>: 11).</p>
<p>Paul Zanker relates that from the time of Caesar Augustus, a ‘uniform visual language’ began to develop, communication based on adoration, esteem and homage paid to the imperial emperor. In Rome and in cities throughout the region, this homage followed a natural course of progression without the necessary instructions from the rulers themselves. The concept of worship of a human ruler was inherited from the ‘Hellenistic ruler cult’; familiar imagery and symbolism were adopted and were easily integrated into the newer Roman system. Leading ‘elite’ families contributed the most financially to the ruler cult, and were the ones who profited the most from it. ‘Temples, theaters, water systems and city gates’—all Roman icons—unified the appearances of the cities in the West. Thus, embracing the ruler cult typified the new trend of ‘Romanizing’ the previously ‘Hellenistic’ cities. The visual expressions of the ruler cult gave the local aristocracies a new means of conveying and preserving their positions of power (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr129-1476993X11415346">Zanker 1997</xref>: 86).</p>
<p>Roman ‘religion’, then, was woven into the same cloth as the other vital aspects of the society, such as military might, economics and politics. The religion/politics of the imperial cult was such a part of all public life and culture in general that the emperor ‘represented divinity to the society’. But the emperor also needed the divine security obtained by sacrifices to the gods on his behalf. As a result, any alternative ideology or ‘religion’ promoted to the people would necessarily have carried political implications as well. Such a concept runs contrary to the familiar separation of ‘religion and politics’ which is common in the minds of today’s readers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1476993X11415346">Horsley 1997</xref>: 24).</p>
<p>With Horsley and others, N.T. Wright agrees that we have an abundance of evidence which demonstrates that,</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>the cult of Caesar was not simply one new religion among many in the Roman world. Already by Paul’s time it had become the dominant cult in a large part of the Empire, certainly in the parts where Paul was active, and was the means whereby the Romans managed to control and govern such huge areas as came under their sway. Who needs armies when they have worship? (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr126-1476993X11415346">2010</xref>: 1-2).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Wright also points out that current scholarship needs to ‘reconsider the imperial cultic context of Paul’s work and thought, not simply as one topic among others but as a theme which will colour and redirect the whole’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr126-1476993X11415346">2010</xref>: 2).</p>
<p>Additionally, J.D. Crossan and Jonathan Reed stress the ‘pervasiveness of the Roman imperial theology’s emperor cult across the Mediterranean as one of the key features of Paul’s world’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1476993X11415346">2004</xref>: 142-43). Cult-worship created unity across the Empire, and ‘held the civilized world together’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1476993X11415346">2004</xref>: 142). Crossan and Reed cite archeological evidence of cultic worship across the region, in the major cities that Paul visited; such evidence demonstrates that ‘imperial theology’ permeated the culture and forms a backdrop for the context of Paul’s letters (ibid.).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1476993X11415346">
<title>Response</title>
<p>While most scholars see great significance in the Roman worship of Caesar as a god, there may be good reasons to question the far-reaching impact of the religious expression. In response to current scholarship, Colin Miller has written an essay on the influence of the imperial cult on the Pauline communities in the Mediterranean region. Miller explores the worship of ‘Caesar among many gods’, and gives consideration to the relationship between the emperor cult and the Pauline communities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1476993X11415346">2010</xref>: 319). Miller’s aim is to investigate the Roman cities in which Paul ministered at the time of his writing, to determine the precise nature of Paul’s relationship with the imperial cult. While Crossan and Reed deduce extensive influence, Miller argues against such conclusions, writing that,</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>the archeological evidence reveals that, in the cities Paul visited, in Paul’s time, emperor-cult was marginal. In more than half of Paul’s missionary cities there is no evidence of the imperial cult at all. In others, the emperor was only one cult alongside many others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1476993X11415346">2010</xref>: 316).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>For Miller, the imperial cult was merely one expression of worship among others, and was often ‘indistinguishable from the cult of any other god’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1476993X11415346">2010</xref>: 320). Feasts and festivals were celebrated on the birthday of the emperor, but the people also celebrated the birthdays of other gods, with the same elements: ‘games, and daylong feasts, the singing of hymns, burning incense and the lighting of lamps’ (ibid.). Miller suggests that the emperor cult was ‘nothing particularly new or exciting’, even down to the details of the practiced rituals (ibid.). There is some question, too, as to how seriously the inhabitants took the worship of the emperor. Celebrations were grand, but it appears that prayers to Caesar were ‘rare, to say the least’. It is difficult to accurately judge if the peoples’ prayers, praise and oaths were directed toward the emperor himself or to those gods who were connected to the reigning ruler (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1476993X11415346">2010</xref>: 321).</p>
<p>The cities in Asia Minor without early first-century evidence of the imperial cult include Paphos, Lystra, Iconium, Derbe, Colossae and Laodicea (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1476993X11415346">2010</xref>: 321). Miller writes that Colossae has a ‘mound’ that has yet to experience excavations, so it is necessary to consider analogies with other cities nearby (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1476993X11415346">2010</xref>: 322; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr127-1476993X11415346">Yamauchi 1980</xref>: 59). Further, there is no evidence of imperial cult before the second century <sc>ce</sc> in Philippi. The imperial cult data from Thessalonica is late, dating from 238 <sc>ce</sc>. While Beroea offers evidence from 96 <sc>ce</sc>, there is no evidence in Cenchreae. Miller concludes that previous scholarship has not accounted for the lack of evidence of extensive dispersion of the imperial cult, at least in the cities known to Paul (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1476993X11415346">2010</xref>: 322). It appears that even large metropolises like Thessalonica and Philippi did not adopt the emperor-worship culture as rapidly as once thought. He insists that ‘we have absolutely <italic>no evidence</italic> that several of Paul’s main ministry centers had cults of the Roman emperor during his lifetime’ (ibid., his emphasis).</p>
<p>Nevertheless, there is a varied amount of evidence of the imperial cult in some of the Pauline cities: Tarsus, Pisidian Antioch and other Galatian cities, Hierapolis, Ephesus, Athens, and Corinth. In Ephesus, there is abundant evidence of temples for the emperor that date back to the time of Augustus’ reign, imperial shrines in the ‘<italic>agora</italic>’, and an inscription from 29 <sc>bce</sc> refers to a sanctuary for Augustus. A coin from 65–66 <sc>ce</sc> is inscribed with the title of Ephesus, ‘<italic>Epheson Neokoron</italic>’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1476993X11415346">Miller 2010</xref>: 326; also see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1476993X11415346">Friesen 1995</xref>: 229-50). Certainly there were forms of emperor worship at Ephesus at the time of Paul’s ministry, but Miller questions whether or not it actually ‘permeated public life’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1476993X11415346">2010</xref>: 327). Apparently there is no evidence of the emperor’s dominance over the revered city goddess Artemis. Thus, Ephesus was indeed ‘the city of Artemis’, and the city’s allegiance to Rome was not exclusive, over and above other cults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1476993X11415346">2010</xref>: 327-28). In fact, the statuary implies a plethora of deities where the human emperor was only one among many.</p>
<p>Cultic evidence in Corinth is a bit more ‘fragmentary’, but it is very likely that Paul encountered the imperial cult in this city. ‘Approximately sixty-two inscriptions of various and sometimes disputed date[s] mention the cult’, and ‘the large civic building at the end of the forum was found to be filled with Julio-Claudian statues’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1476993X11415346">2010</xref>: 330). Miller suggests it is probable that ‘from an early date, there was worship of Julius Caesar, the founder of the “new” city of Corinth in 44 <sc>bce</sc>’ (ibid.). One inscription honors the ‘high priest of the first provincial imperial cult of Achaia’. If there were a high priest, then there must have been ‘other priests’ as well, and the presence of priests would mean the presence of a temple in the area (ibid.). However, as in Ephesus, the statuary in Corinth shows evidence of ‘the highly polytheistic’ city, where the imperial cult took its place, without exclusivity, among the other gods so crucial to city life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1476993X11415346">2010</xref>: 331). Miller writes that there is some evidence that implies that the imperial cult permeated the Corinthian society; this is ‘perhaps more striking as well as more historically telling than for any other Pauline city’ (ibid.).</p>
<p>In summary, Miller observes that the imperial cult in the major Pauline cities is ‘not nearly as vast’ as other recent studies have indicated. Also, it was not as substantial at the time of Paul’s writings as it would become in later decades. Because the evidence reveals only a ‘marginal’ imperial cult, it would be incorrect to conclude that Paul’s missionary work was done in a culture pervaded by Roman dominance as seen through the imperial cult (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1476993X11415346">2010</xref>: 331). That is, Paul did not encounter a strong imperial cult everywhere he visited (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1476993X11415346">2010</xref>: 332).</p>
<p>Even so, if we do not have tangible evidence of widespread emperor worship in the days of Paul’s ministry, could there still have been political, economic and cultural subjugation, oppression and imperial domination experienced by the people to whom Paul was ministering? If so, such conditions could affect the language and the manner Paul used to communicate to specific churches. Miller does not attempt to make any claims about the concept of ‘Romanization’ of the region or ‘Roman ideology’ in a general sense in the Pauline cities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1476993X11415346">2010</xref>: 332). He does not address the evidence of the imperial cult in the capital city of Rome itself. He is only attempting to establish the kind of culture Paul would have encountered as he moved through the Empire. Based on the evidence, Miller believes that it would not be correct to say that the ‘fabric’ of Paul’s environment was ‘held together by the imperial cult’ (ibid.).</p>

<title>d. Roman Empire and Postcolonialism</title>
<p>The fourth development is the intersection of the Roman Empire, Christianity and postcolonialism. Recently, scholarly work on Paul has begun to shift the emphasis from history and tradition to issues of culture, politics and religion. While scholarship still depends heavily on historical, traditional and cultural backgrounds, a recent collection of essays provides an excellent introduction to current thinking that is ‘beyond traditional theological and historical concerns’ of Paul’s writings. In <italic>Paul Unbound</italic>, editor Mark Given reminds us of the myth of Prometheus, who was tied and bound by Zeus because Prometheus granted knowledge and fire to the human race. Relating the Greco-Roman tale to Paul, Given writes that ‘certainly Paul was not bound by God [literally or metaphorically], but one might playfully suggest that he has often been bound by tradition and theology’. While Given recognizes the term ‘new perspectives’ in relationship to progressing Pauline scholarship, he writes that these contributors are trying to demonstrate how, in recent years, the study of Paul has been ‘liberated from a variety of traditional or conventional perspectives’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1476993X11415346">2010a</xref>: 1).</p>
<p>One example of an earlier traditional perspective is seen in Steven Friesen’s essay on Paul’s economic practices. In the past, Friesen observes, scholars have investigated Paul’s ideas, his history, and his language, while avoiding a discussion of Paul’s financial interests (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1476993X11415346">2010</xref>: 27). Further, Friesen’s research reveals that generally, the scholars of the early twentieth century assumed that the people in Paul’s churches were from the ‘lower classes’ of the economic strata. A ‘new consensus’ by scholars in the later twentieth century presumed Paul’s audiences to be from a ‘cross-section’ of the population; yet, the consensus remained very tenuous. Ironically, Friesen notes that ‘nearly all scholars throughout the twentieth century’ were in agreement that the majority of first-century Christians were poor, while a scholarly discussion of poverty was rare (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1476993X11415346">2010</xref>: 29). Friesen feels that modern scholarship is beginning to address a common ideology that he calls ‘capitalistic criticism’. He outlines four fallacious characteristics that are assumed in this type of analysis:</p>
<list id="list1-1476993X11415346" list-type="order"><list-item><p>Religion has no integral connection to economy.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Christianity was not generated by economic factors, and therefore it was not a movement of the urban proletariat in the first-century Roman Empire.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Religion operates according to market principles; religion that responds with the best product gets a larger market share.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Poverty is irrelevant in the interpretation of Christian origins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1476993X11415346">2010</xref>: 30-31).</p></list-item></list>
<p>He compares the ‘poverty profile’ of the ancient Roman Empire with eight modern societies, including the United States and Japan, using poverty scales based on the ‘undisputed’ letters to replicate the economic circumstances for Paul’s ‘assemblies’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1476993X11415346">2010</xref>: 38-40).</p>
<p>Friesen then moves into an investigation of poverty, inequity, economic class and stratification within the Roman imperial system. He considers Paul’s appeal for funds for the church at Jerusalem (2 Cor. 8–9) and evaluates this collection in terms of the Roman practice of ‘patronage and benefaction’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1476993X11415346">2010</xref>: 48).</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>The collection for the destitute among the saints in Jerusalem should not be understood as a replication of the patronage system that characterized economic relationships under Roman imperialism. Rather, it was a different system, an attempt by Paul to promote financial redistribution among the poor people, Gentile and Jewish, in the assemblies. It contradicted the normal expectations of patronage and replaced them with an economy of voluntary redistribution among the saints (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1476993X11415346">2010</xref>: 51).</p>

<title>Postcolonialism</title>
<p>Fernando F. Segovia and R.S. Sugirtharajah compiled and edited a thorough volume of contributions that aid in our study of the New Testament writings from a postcolonial approach. Calling this book a ‘landmark achievement’, Segovia gives readers an impressive list of contributors who investigate each book of the New Testament. This collection brings together the extent and significance of the newer postcolonial approaches to the New Testament writings. Proponents of this approach contend that today,</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>it is more important than ever to find hermeneutical strategies that will refuse the complacency of nationalistic endeavors, as well as the neglect of the local in favor of the global. Postcolonial biblical interpretation has the potential to address these concerns, and offers a valuable hermeneutical strategy for exposing and countering imperialist, hegemonic readings of Scripture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-1476993X11415346">Punt 2007</xref>: 363).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Familiar contributors such as Warren Carter, Neil Elliott, Richard Horsley, Abraham Smith, Elisabeth Schüssler-Fiorenza and Stephen Moore join others in looking at all the New Testament books through the lens of postcolonialism. With respect to the letters in the New Testament, for example, Ralph Broadbent defines postcolonial criticism as ‘concerned with power and hierarchy and as oppositional in mode’. In his application of such criticism to the Pastoral letters, he raises the question of the community situation behind them and why they reacted to Rome as they did. In the case of the Pastorals, he basically agrees with current scholarship on the ‘hierarchal impulses of empire’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1476993X11415346">2007</xref>: 323). The perceived imperial power and authority is evident from ‘key passages having to do with the attitude of colonial subjects, the condition of slavery, the role of women, and the qualifications for male leadership in the community’ (ibid.). As we now move to the second part of this article, we will view some of the New Testament letters in detail, and we will again see the rise of the postcolonial approach to interpretation.</p>

<sec id="section9-1476993X11415346">
<title>2. Part Two: Anti-Imperial Rhetoric and the Letters of Paul</title>
<p>In his 2006 introductory text, Warren Carter notes that at that time in scholarship, there was hardly a Pauline letter that was immune to views on anti-imperial rhetoric. Carter gives brief introductions to the ancient communities that received letters from Paul and outlines a number of different ways in which the early Christians responded to the imperial authorities in their own cities and towns. A great deal of diversity is demonstrated when it comes to the believers’ beliefs and behavior in reaction to the domination of the Empire. Paul offers his help and encouragement to the early Christians, yet we do not know precisely how they received his words, living and worshiping in the cities that were ruled by imperial systems and demands (2006: 63).</p>
<p>Then, in a 2010 essay, Carter offers a review of more recent perspectives on Paul and the Roman imperial system. He looks at other important scholars and gives several critiques of recent works. Further, he presents key challenges for future work in the field. It is this latter discussion on future challenges that contributes most to the discussions in this article. Carter concludes that at this point in current scholarship, there is not a ‘monolithic stance’ on this topic, and ‘further work will need to refine the central question of Paul’s negotiation of the Roman Empire’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1476993X11415346">2010</xref>: 24). As mentioned above, past investigations into Paul’s apocalyptic and eschatological views tend to reflect Jewish traditions. While it has been acknowledged that his writings reveal Jewish ideas, it has not been commonly recognized that, as such, they are ‘categorically anti-imperial’ in nature. At the same time, such views also expose strong imperial ideas such as domination, power and rule, as well as the violent destruction of enemies. Carter draws attention to Paul’s Christology, his claims about Jesus, and significant titles he gives to Jesus in his writings which indicate an answer to emperor worship in the Empire (ibid.).</p>
<p>Carter notes that certain social-science methods of analysis have been only minimally used and may be effective in furthering scholarship in this area. ‘Models of empire’ are developing, and attention is being directed to the concept of ‘rhetoric’ in the New Testament epistles, but both topics need further study. While some scholars have reminded us that we cannot lose sight of Paul’s ‘Jewish identity’ and his interaction with the Jewish communities, others have observed a new facet of the Jewish missionary who ‘talked’ his way across a Roman imperial world. Paul appears to have one foot in each of these worlds, so the challenge is to balance these two strong socio-cultural forces. Was Paul using anti-imperial rhetoric that was easily recognized by his audiences, or was he using familiar Jewish terminology—or both? As modern readers, we may have to recognize that the first-century Christian believers were affected by both a common Jewish milieu as well as the dominating Roman philosophies (ibid.). It was difficult for Paul to maintain a foot in each world, speaking to and uniting both Jews and Gentiles; it is even harder to discern this co-existing rhetoric in our present culture, nearly two thousand years later. Finally, future scholarship does, indeed, have more challenges. Carter feels that there is still much to be said about Paul and the ‘politics of interpretation’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1476993X11415346">2010</xref>: 25). While scholars have given attention to vital topics such as slavery and feminism in the church, little is being said about ‘Paul and politics’ (ibid.). Perhaps a newer rereading of his letters in light of Roman politics could have even more impact on believers today (ibid.).</p>
<sec id="section10-1476993X11415346">
<title>a. Paul’s Letter to the Romans</title>
<p>Paul’s epistle to the church at Rome may be the most influential Pauline letter in the New Testament. From the inception of Christianity, the letter to the Romans has profoundly affected Christian readers theologically, doctrinally and spiritually. If, indeed, the apostle Paul felt it necessary to use subversive language in his communications with his fellow Christians, we would assume that it would most likely appear in this letter to the church in the imperial city, in the heart of the Roman Empire.</p>
<p>From the end of the nineteenth century throughout the twentieth century, the volume of scholarship that deals with Romans is almost staggering. European and American scholars have debated Paul’s presentation of key theological issues in the letter that stood as foundational stones in the building of the Christian faith. Further, scholars noted the Jewish flavor of the letter, including Paul’s allusions to the Old Testament and God’s treatment of the nation of Israel (chapters 9–11), even though it was written to people living in a Roman city. In fact, relatively little was mentioned about the influence of the Gentile context of the letter and the volatile political milieu of the Roman Empire on the church and on Paul himself. Perhaps our investigation into the letter to the Romans has not been exhausted.</p>
<sec id="section11-1476993X11415346">
<title>Occasion and audience</title>
<p>In the view of Neil Elliott, scholarship has a ‘problem’ accurately determining the purpose and occasion of the letter to the Romans: is it an historical debate with Judaism, an introduction of Paul himself to a church he did not plant, an exposition of Paul’s message, a ‘theological confession by Paul’ or an attempt to resolve religious and ethnic tensions within the Roman congregation? (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1476993X11415346">1990</xref>: 13). Elliott seeks to resolve this tension by suggesting that the letter actually has a ‘double character’. Basically, this ‘double character’ is found first in the debate between Paul’s gospel message and Judaism, and second in the discussion between the Pauline message and Gentile Christians (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1476993X11415346">1990</xref>: 11). Historical solutions alone disregard the letter’s ‘rhetorical integrity’, while many sociological readings are not sufficient to answer our questions about the composition of the Roman audience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1476993X11415346">1990</xref>: 35). Elliott sees the synagogue as the key, because the Christian gospel message was spread through the preaching in the synagogues (see the pattern of the Christian mission in Acts). Elliott contends that there was ‘considerable’ Gentile interest in Judaism in Rome, and the Gentile people who had converted to Judaism were the first ‘Christians’ in the city (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1476993X11415346">1990</xref>: 51). In this earlier book, Elliott argues that the primary debate by Paul in Romans is concerned with the Jews, with their laws, and the Gentiles’ relationships with them. Elliott’s analysis is concerned with the theology and the rhetoric of the letter, with little regard for the socio-economic or the political controlling forces behind the presentation of Paul’s message.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, in Horsley’s later book, Elliott wrestles with a notoriously contentious passage, Rom. 13.1-7, in the ‘context of imperial propaganda’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1476993X11415346">1997b</xref>: 184). The passage that begins, ‘everyone must submit himself to the governing authorities…’ (Rom. 13.1, <sc>niv</sc>) is problematic exegetically, theologically and politically. Is it an example of Paul’s use of ‘hidden’ or ‘coded’ anti-imperial rhetoric? Paul does not explain his use of the phrase ‘governing authorities’ (<italic>exousiais hyperechousais</italic>, literally: ‘superior authorities’) in Romans 13. In contrast, he uses the term ‘rulers’ (<italic>archontōn</italic>), or ‘leaders’ in 1 Cor. 2.6-8. As a result, some scholars have determined that Paul could not be making reference to the Roman authorities.</p>
<p>Elliott reviews the state of historical scholarship on this passage, and then views the features of political rhetoric, especially at the time of Emperor Nero, which may help us to better understand these verses. He writes that the phrase is ‘too questionable’ to be used to actually express Paul’s political views (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1476993X11415346">1997b</xref>: 185). Others have noted that the passage makes sense if we read it against an assumed ‘general climate of anti-Jewish sentiment in Rome’ (as evidenced by the banishment of the Jews by Nero), but this attitude may be tied to ‘a narrowly constrained political situation in Rome’ (ibid.). Such a position effectively ‘relativized’ Paul’s phrase over against any universal concept of Romans 13 as illustrating a ‘theology of the state’ (ibid.). The implication is that historical events concerning the Jewish Christians can explain Paul’s peculiar political position. However, it remains a big mystery as to why Paul would communicate such a view in his letter, whatever the situation of the Roman believers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1476993X11415346">1997b</xref>: 187).</p>
<p>Because most scholars understand the letter to be written primarily for the ‘Gentile-Christian’ believers, Elliott determines that Paul was trying to protect the Roman church from ‘mistakenly being identified with the Jews by the Roman authorities’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1476993X11415346">1997b</xref>: 188). This makes Romans ‘a theological defense of the gentile-Christian church, directed polemically against <italic>Jewish</italic> boasting or particularism’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1476993X11415346">1997b</xref>: 189, his emphasis). As such, Romans 13 was written to protect the Gentile church from ‘the dangerous political fallout of Jewish nationalist agitation’ (ibid.). Elliott calls Romans a ‘paraenetic letter directed primarily against an emergent supersessionism among gentile Christians in Rome, an “incipient Marcionism”’ (ibid.). Thus, Paul’s arguments in the letter are formed around two main issues: Gentile-Christian views of anti-Judaism, and a ‘practical antinomianism’ which some Gentile Christians may have confused with Paul’s gospel message (ibid.).</p>
<p>Cassidy also interacts with Rom. 13.1-7. Historically, he asserts that ‘Romans predates Paul’s letters to Philemon and Philippians’, indicating that the chances are that Paul’s perspective changed over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1476993X11415346">2001a</xref>: 17). Thus, he determines that Paul’s perspective in Romans 13 represents only his <italic>initial</italic> perspective on the Roman authorities. His ‘ultimate, defining perspective, a perspective explicitly grounded in Paul’s allegiance to Jesus, is expressed in Philippians’ (i.e., 3.18-21). The ‘governing authorities’ in Rom. 13.1 are, in Cassidy’s view, definitely the rulers of the Roman Empire, as familiar to the readers in Paul’s day as the taxation demanded from them. Specifically, Cassidy places the time of Paul’s words within the reign of the Emperor Nero (54–68 <sc>ce</sc>); Nero becomes the central figure in Romans 13, while the implication is that other ‘authorities’ were deserving of respect and honor as well. Paul gives his rationale for his call for subjection to these people, based on God’s establishment of the rulers (13.1a-2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1476993X11415346">2001a</xref>: 26).</p>
<p>However, why would Paul give such directions to the Roman church, in view of the domination of such rulers, and in view of his perspectives on the Roman government in his later letters? While we cannot be certain of all the social and political factors that fully explain Paul’s positive ‘accommodation’ of the Roman officials and their taxation, Cassidy suggests that Paul had not yet fully experienced the Roman systems at the time of writing this letter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1476993X11415346">2001a</xref>: 35). Paul had just completed a ‘fruitful ministry’ in the eastern provinces of the Empire. While he had suffered trials in this area, he had not yet been severely imprisoned by the Roman government (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1476993X11415346">2001a</xref>: 26). His positive experiences of being a Roman citizen, traveling extensively in the Empire, with his ‘lack of encounters with the Roman judicial system’, influenced his relationship with the Romans officials at that time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1476993X11415346">2001a</xref>: 35).</p>

<sec id="section12-1476993X11415346">
<title>Justice and arrogance</title>
<p>N.T. Wright declares that there is an issue behind the question of why Romans was written that is ‘not normally noticed’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr126-1476993X11415346">2010</xref>: 5). ‘Paul went to Rome with the message of Jesus the Jewish Messiah, the Lord of the world, claiming that through this message, God’s justice was unveiled once and for all. Rome prided itself on being the capital of Justice, the source from which Justice would flow throughout the world’ (ibid.). Wright suggests that those who declare Jesus as the King who brings the justice and righteousness of God, ‘challenge the imperial pretention’ of justice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr126-1476993X11415346">2010</xref>: 6). In addition to justice, ‘nothing about what we might call the political dimension of Paul’s argument should obscure for a moment that the message of the gospel is good news to sinners’. Remarkably, ‘nothing, not even Caesar’s system can separate us from God’s love shown in the Messiah, Jesus’ (ibid.).</p>
<p>Wright adds additional, distinctive thoughts about the cryptic Rom. 13.1-7 passage. In the context of chapters 12–13, ‘Paul argues that, however much the emperor may proclaim himself to be sovereign, without rival in the divine as well as the human sphere, he remains answerable to the true God’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr126-1476993X11415346">2010</xref>: 6). In these chapters, Paul is reminding the subjects of the Empire that Caesar is accountable to the true, just God; thus, Paul is diminishing ‘imperial arrogance’, not subjugating people to it. If this is true, then the Christian believers owe to the emperor ‘appropriate civil obedience’, but not the worship Caesar claimed. Agreeably, Wright concludes that ‘the subversive gospel is not designed to produce civil anarchy’ (ibid.).</p>
<p>Elliott surmises that Paul’s ‘field of vision’ in the first chapter of Romans is ‘narrowly focused on people who refused to honor God, who embraced idolatry instead, and were abandoned by God to degrading sexual acts and profound wickedness’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1476993X11415346">2008</xref>: 78). That is, Elliott believes Paul intends his audience to understand these wicked people as ‘none other than <italic>the Caesars themselves</italic>’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1476993X11415346">2008</xref>: 79, his emphasis). Thus, Paul writes to the believers in Rome to warn them that ‘appearances can be deceiving; what may seem to be just is nothing of the kind’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1476993X11415346">2008</xref>: 85). Paul wrote against the ‘arrogant presumption, fueled by imperial ideology, of standing at the “end of history”’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1476993X11415346">2008</xref>: 164). He concludes that ‘an uncritical appropriation of Paul today too readily reinforces tropes of subordination and a pious political quietism’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1476993X11415346">2008</xref>: 164).</p>
<p>Another interesting approach is that of Sylvia Keesmaat, who contends that Paul uses the ‘exodus tradition’ and the ‘Scriptures of Israel’ in his letter to the Romans in such a way as to encourage his readers. With an emphasis on historical features, she writes that the community was primarily Gentile after the ‘expulsion of the Jews in 49 <sc>ce</sc>’. Later, when the Jews returned to Rome, a ‘tension’ resulted in the believing community between the Jewish Christians and the Gentile Christians (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1476993X11415346">1999</xref>: 154). In his letter, Paul’s language calls for both factions to be unified in an ‘ethic of suffering love’ (ibid.). The exodus tradition reflected in Romans 8 shows the path which the Roman believers are to walk with one another. The same tradition is used by Paul to form the basis for a more particular discussion of God’s faithfulness to Israel in Romans 9–11, as well as a call to reconciliation between Roman believers in chapters 12–15.</p>
<p>Bruce Winter argues that in Romans 12–15, Paul is ‘a radical critic of the prevailing culture of privilege in Rome’s society’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr114-1476993X11415346">1994</xref>: 99). Paul repeatedly calls for actions that oppose accepted social expectations. Paul refuses to accept the idea that Christianity should be a part of the normally expected patterns of social behavior, including unequal patron-client relations, dealings between (unequal) friends, and the manner in which ‘associations’ conducted themselves. Instead, Paul ‘scandalously’ employs familiar ‘family language’ to describe the relationships in the Christian community (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr114-1476993X11415346">1994</xref>: xiv). Throughout Romans 12–15, Paul exhorts the Christians to a behavior that is ‘the antithesis to Roman social and legal expectations’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr114-1476993X11415346">1994</xref>: xv).</p>

<title>Romans and Pompeii</title>
<p>A newer study by Peter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-1476993X11415346">Oakes (2009)</xref> takes the reader to the historical site of the Roman town of Pompeii, which was destroyed by a volcanic eruption in August of 79 <sc>ce</sc>. Oakes makes the significant archeological ruins come alive, as he helps modern readers to better understand how the letter of Romans may have been received by its original audience. Oakes indicates that the archeological artifacts of Pompeii (houses, mansions, gardens, tools and household items) reveal a great deal about the types of people that would have been first to read Paul’s letter. The people Oakes ‘found’ in Pompeii, male and female slaves, laborers, common people, or the ‘non-elites’, were pictures of the economic situation and social dynamics in the first-century Roman city. He uses the evidence at Pompeii to construct a typical ‘house church’ in real life, and to surmise how the church might have responded to the various instructions and admonitions of Paul.

<title>Inscriptions and competing narratives</title>
<p>In a new volume edited by Stanley Porter and Cynthia Westfall, Porter evaluates the relationship between Roman imperialism, specifically the imperial cult, and Paul’s letters to the Romans and to the Corinthians. Porter writes that ‘one of the most important recent transformations in the study of Paul has been from seeing Paul as the Jewish religious leader into recognizing Paul the world-citizen within the Roman Empire’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-1476993X11415346">2011a</xref>: 10). Porter investigates ancient inscriptions that reveal the extensive Roman Emperor cult; specifically, he notes a calendar inscription from 9 <sc>bce</sc> that gives readers insights into the three Pauline letters. These preserved inscriptions had been a part of public buildings and structures, and were reminders to honor and revere various emperors. A public, bi-lingual inscription proclaims the birthday of the ‘divine Caesar’, while Paul’s letter explains the coming of Jesus Christ. An inscription declares that ‘good favor has fallen on humanity because of the divine Augustus on account of the good things that he has done’; yet, Paul uses the language that ‘deified Caesars’ to recognize Jesus Christ as the One who is superior to Caesar (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-1476993X11415346">2011a</xref>: 11). While an inscription may publicize the rulers’ ‘divine beneficence’, Paul writes that eternal benefits come through Jesus. Therefore, Porter suggests that Paul ‘styles himself as the erector of a new inscription to the true Lord, Jesus Christ’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-1476993X11415346">2011a</xref>: 11).</p>
<p>Another feature is apparent in Paul’s letter. Paul crafts a ‘competing narrative of empire’ by comparing the Roman Empire that revolved around a human authority, and the ‘kingdom’ centered on Jesus Christ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-1476993X11415346">2011a</xref>: 11). This is first observed in Paul’s lengthy introduction of himself to the recipients (Rom. 1.1-6), titling himself as a mere ‘<italic>doulas</italic> of Christ Jesus’, in stark contrast to the leading Roman authorities. Porter’s concept of a ‘competing narrative’ is used to develop his view of Rom. 13.1-7. He summarizes previous scholarship on this passage as being positive toward the empire, as negative subversive language, or as neutral comments about governments in general. Reminding his readers that Paul has previously revealed that he is an opponent of the imperial reign (in 1.1-6), Porter contends that Paul is demanding that the Roman leaders be ‘just authorities, and, because Christians are under the Lordship of Christ, they are called to obey just authorities’. That is, Roman ‘unjust authorities’ fall completely outside of the ‘parameters that Paul defines’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-1476993X11415346">2011a</xref>: 11). The Roman authorities become ‘relativized by the Lordship of Christ’ so that only the just authorities are to be obeyed. ‘This approach is consistent with the concept of hierarchy in the Corinthian letters and in a larger circle of literary context in the Pauline corpus.’ Porter shows how ‘layers of context’ can affect, constrain and limit our interpretation of this passage as well as many other difficult portions of Paul’s letters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-1476993X11415346">2011a</xref>: 12).</p>

<sec id="section16-1476993X11415346">
<title>Corinthian letters</title>
<p>Perhaps following the letter to the Romans, the two canonical epistles addressed to the believers in Corinth may be the next best examples of anti-imperial rhetoric found in Paul’s communications. Corinth was also a capital city, located in the Roman province of Achaia. By the 50s <sc>ce</sc>, the population in Corinth was perhaps between 80,000 and 130,000 people (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1476993X11415346">Carter 2006</xref>: 56). Historians have substantially agreed that the city was ethnically and religiously diverse. A small group of wealthy families controlled the city’s power and prestige, and the church at Corinth was Paul’s ‘wealthiest church’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr93-1476993X11415346">Seesengood 2010</xref>: 18). Thus, in Corinth, we see a ‘typical hierarchal social and political structure’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1476993X11415346">Carter 2006</xref>: 56).</p>
<p>The Acts account indicates that Paul’s message was rejected by the Jewish community in Corinth (18.6), and a conflict arose (18.12-17). Yet, the 1 Corinthians epistle does not reveal any conflict with the synagogue or any disagreements between the Gentile and Jewish believers. Carter notes that the conflicts and divisions within the church are rooted in loyalty to ‘different leaders’ (1.10-11). He contends that Paul had to address issues that were concerned with the behaviors and practices of the ‘elite’ members of the church (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1476993X11415346">2006</xref>: 56-57). Paul’s letters to the Corinthians must be understood within this setting, and Paul takes significant risks by opposing the accepted Roman imperial culture. It was a high risk to instruct the Christian believers on how to live in direct opposition to the prevailing cultural conditions.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section17-1476993X11415346">
<title>Social divisions</title>
<p>The scholarly discussion concerning the divisions in the Corinthian church has been active for many years. In the latter twentieth century, scholars used perspectives from the social sciences to address issues particularly found in 1 Corinthians (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1476993X11415346">Esler 1994</xref>: 2). By employing social-scientific methods, some Pauline scholars deduced that the evident difficulties in 1 Corinthians are due to strong social divisions within the church; conflicting divisions are understood as a split between the wealthy and the poorer classes of people in the community. Gerd Theissen’s work on 1 Corinthians identified the elite members as <italic>educated</italic> members of the church. Theissen contends that our understanding of Paul’s interaction with the Corinthians is enhanced by an application of the ‘ancient education model’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr103-1476993X11415346">1982</xref>: 3). Theissen uses 1 Cor. 1.26-29 as an example of the split between the lower, working class and the upper class of educated believers. The ‘wise’ belonged to the educated classes (1.26); they were the ‘dominant majority’, which gave them a ‘disproportionate’ amount of influence in the church. Thus, Theissen’s argument concerning the social divisions in 1 Cor. 1–4 was considered innovative in terms of employing social-scientific methods in Pauline scholarship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr103-1476993X11415346">1982</xref>: 29).</p>
<p>Horsley comments on the second letter to the Corinthians. It is evident from 2 Corinthians that Paul is having difficulties in reconciling ‘a fledgling group of people of diverse viewpoints and interests to coalesce into a coherent and disciplined community’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1476993X11415346">2007</xref>: 237). While much of the second letter is a defense of his own mission, Paul brings attention to his ministry activities by using ‘unmistakable imperial imagery’ in 2 Cor. 2.14-16. He actually ‘mocks’ the triumphant imperial processions into a city. Horsley sees two effects of this imagery: first, such a procession (‘with pomp and splendor’) would have been ‘all too familiar’ to the readers of the letter, along with the ‘devastating imperial conquests that they celebrated’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1476993X11415346">2007</xref>: 240). Second, the readers would understand Paul’s attempt to establish travel plans in an environment of ‘periodic arrests and imprisonment’ to which he was subject as he moved from city to city (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1476993X11415346">2007</xref>: 241).</p>
<p>In addition, the act of collecting funds for the poor ‘saints’ in Jerusalem (2 Cor. 8–9) confirms the fact that Paul was trying to create an ‘alternative society’ to the Roman imperial economic system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1476993X11415346">2007</xref>: 241). Horsley writes that more than any other issue Paul addresses, the collection for the poor of Jerusalem illustrates to modern readers that Paul was not only opposed to the accepted Roman system, but was trying to form a new kind of order and community in spite of it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1476993X11415346">2007</xref>: 243).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section18-1476993X11415346">
<title>Patronage</title>
<p>The concepts of ‘patronage’ and ‘benefaction’ are noteworthy examples of the manner in which Paul deals with the ideologies of the Corinthian culture. Porter asserts that ‘Paul argues for a replacement of one hierarchy of the Greco-Roman patronage system, which was the basis of abuse in the Corinthian church, with a divine hierarchy that incidentally overthrows distinctions based on status, power and wealth’. That is, Paul is not attempting to replace the existing authority with no authority, or the existing hierarchy with no hierarchy at all. The true hierarchy is headed by God, not the human ruler. In the end, Paul is replacing a false ‘son of god’ with the true ‘son of God’. In 1 Cor. 7, God is seen as the ultimate authority, Jesus Christ is the only mediator between God and humanity, and Paul is God’s trustworthy servant to the Corinthian Christians. In a similar manner, in 2 Cor. 8 there is a clear hierarchy of ‘beneficence’ that begins with the Lord Jesus Christ and passes through Paul to the believers in Corinth, and then to the believers in Jerusalem. Paul replaces the position of the emperor with that of the Lord Jesus Christ. ‘There is no divide between serving God and the state, but the only way one can serve the state is by following Christ’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-1476993X11415346">2011a</xref>: 11-12).</p>
<p>In agreement, John K. Chow specifically notes that if the Roman emperor was comparable to the ‘patron’ of the entire realm, he was also the patron of Corinth. The emperor was revered as the one who could bring peace, order and prosperity to the city. As we have seen before, honorable titles were used of the emperor in Corinth: ‘patron, benefactor, savior, son of a god’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1476993X11415346">1997</xref>: 105). There was a strong concept of the Roman emperor as the ultimate patron in the city, which was named for Julius Caesar, ‘<italic>Colonia Laus Julia Corinthiensis</italic>’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1476993X11415346">1997</xref>: 106). Chow writes that as he visited the city of Corinth, Paul could not have overlooked the ‘visual communications’ that displayed the power and presence of the Roman emperor: ‘coinage, statues, temples, monuments and inscriptions which brought honor to the emperor and to the local imperial families’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1476993X11415346">1997</xref>: 107). Chow notes the pervasive patronage relationships in Corinth including trade associations, local officials, literary guilds and in the common household (slaves and masters) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1476993X11415346">1997</xref>: 120-21). It appears that in first-century Corinth position and power, in politics and in religion, were achieved by ‘ambitious men’ who were competing for honor and recognition from the higher authorities. This ‘patronal society’ was visible in all aspects of the culture. Chow contends that it would be unreasonable to think that the early Christians were ‘untouched’ by the influences and practices of this way of life. Therefore, these features become a background for our understanding of the Corinthian church and the ‘vexing issues’ that confounded Paul in his ministry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1476993X11415346">1997</xref>: 125).</p>

<sec id="section19-1476993X11415346">
<title>Rhetoric and 1 Corinthians</title>
<p>Knowing what we do about the historical, cultural situation in Corinth, perhaps such subversive language was necessary. Yet, consideration of Paul’s language and rhetorical style creates the question: if Paul’s first letter to the Corinthians was written in conformity with the rhetorical culture of his day, does that mean that he was acquiescing to the Roman society and culture?</p>
<p>In his edited book, Mark Given discusses ‘Paul and Rhetoric: A <italic>Sophos</italic> in the Kingdom of God’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1476993X11415346">2010b</xref>: 175). In the past three or four decades, scholarship has ‘witnessed an explosion of rhetorical studies of Paul’. Past evaluations have been content to describe the ‘rhetorical situations’ Paul faced, and to the ‘rhetorical means’ he used to address them. Given writes that a newer approach considers the ‘ideological issues’ as expressed through language and through interpretation itself (ibid.). In Given’s view, the Corinthian letters demonstrate that Paul was well aware that he was being judged as a writer/speaker according to classical rhetorical standards of his day, and that he was judged as weak in his persuasion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1476993X11415346">2010b</xref>: 176-77). Given applies a rhetorical approach to the whole of the 1 Corinthians letter. He agrees with Margaret <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1476993X11415346">Mitchell (1993)</xref> and demonstrates how Paul can ‘artfully’ combine ‘the epistolary genre with the deliberative species of rhetoric’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1476993X11415346">2010b</xref>: 183). In all likelihood, Given contends, Paul could not escape the influence of his culture, not only in his speech patterns, but also in his interactions with other church leaders in the area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1476993X11415346">2010b</xref>: 177). Speaking, writing and ministering in this society, Paul contrasts the ‘wisdom (<italic>sophia</italic>) of the world and the wisdom of God’ (1.17–3.23). He considers himself to be a ‘wise’ messenger (1 Cor. 3.10). The Greco-Roman cultural element of ‘wisdom’ creates an ‘illuminating backdrop’ for our current reading of the Corinthian letters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1476993X11415346">2010b</xref>: 193). Given concludes that Paul was a ‘<italic>sophistes</italic>’ or an early ‘wise-man’ who, regardless of the civil authorities, ‘dispensed mysterious knowledge and power for the benefit of humankind’. Despite the theological, academic and literary restraints placed upon him by human beings, Paul was a ‘<italic>sophos</italic> in the kingdom of God’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1476993X11415346">2010b</xref>: 198).</p>
<p>Corin Mihaila tends to see a rejection of the use of ‘sophistic rhetoric’ (or ‘wisdom’ in 1 Cor. 2.1-5), and suggests that Paul opposed the social practices of the ‘sophistic movement’ of the time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1476993X11415346">2009</xref>: 13). Yet, Paul intentionally and creatively uses familiar rhetorical devices and figures of speech in his writings to the Corinthians. Paul’s relationship with his fellow orator Apollos may be used as an example of the use of ‘comparative rhetoric’ in Paul’s letter (1 Cor. 1.12; 3.22). Thus, Mihaila shows that there is a type of godly ‘wisdom’ that can be used in a rhetorical form which is quite suitable to Paul (see 1 Cor. 1.18-21; 3.19-20). Paul cleverly used his own ‘weaknesses’ and the attacks of his opponents as an opportunity to help his readers understand that his authority rests in Jesus Christ, and not in a form of human persuasion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1476993X11415346">2009</xref>: 13).</p>
<p>In view of these opinions, it may be concluded that the rhetoric of 1 Corinthians is not so much ‘anti-imperial’ in nature as it is rhetoric of comparison. Paul simply borrows familiar forms of language and epistolary writing; using known tools, he compares the wisdom ideology of the Roman elites to the wisdom of God in a rhetorical manner to impact his readers with the truth of the Christian gospel.</p>

<sec id="section20-1476993X11415346">
<title>Opponents</title>
<p>If Paul was a Jew, and he was the ‘Apostle to the Gentiles’ at the same time, then who exactly were his opponents in his work of the spread of the Christian gospel? Another topic that continues to evoke debate, is how our understanding of Paul’s opponents affects the way in which we read the New Testament letters. Jerry Sumney re-evaluates the identity of Paul’s adversaries by writing that ‘identifying those Paul writes against helps us to see what kinds of diversity were accepted in the earliest church and what types of beliefs and practices Paul said were unacceptable’. Fundamentally, Paul’s use of the form of an epistle as his selected method of communicating and instructing means that he chose a type of contact that can serve as an interchange of ideas; he was able to address the individual questions, issues and problems of each church (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr101-1476993X11415346">2010</xref>: 56). While the identity of these opponents may vary from city to city, opposition to Paul’s gospel appears to be a fairly consistent issue among the early churches. Did the imperial government stand in opposition to his writings, or was Paul writing against Jewish opponents, or both—or neither? Can we make some generalities about Paul’s ‘enemies’, and about those people opposed to Paul, that cover all of his letters?</p>
<p>Past scholarship has suggested the existence of two parties: the ‘Petrine or Jewish Christianity, and the antithesis, Pauline or Gentile Christianity’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr101-1476993X11415346">Sumney 2010</xref>: 56). Later, scholarship suggested the theory that Paul’s opponents were ‘the Gnostics’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr101-1476993X11415346">2010</xref>: 57). Yet, such proposals were perceived as insufficient to explain the whole Pauline corpus. It is Sumney’s contention that past scholarship has allowed ‘historical movements’ of the time to ‘constrict the meaning of the primary text in its own context’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr101-1476993X11415346">2010</xref>: 62).</p>
<p>The key for Sumney is to understand that there is a difference between those people who opposed Paul and those whom Paul opposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr101-1476993X11415346">2010</xref>: 58). He uses the example of earlier scholarship concerning the letter to the Colossians. He notes that some modern interpreters have used only a limited number of ideas or phrases in the text, and have read everything as an ‘outside movement’; the result was broad conclusions that are drawn about Paul’s opponents. Sumney has determined that, ‘reconstruction dominates the exegesis’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr101-1476993X11415346">2010</xref>: 65). Sumney’s answer is not to ‘allow reconstructions of other movements or detailed reconstructions of the early church to dominate our identification of opponents’; thus, we are able to gain more clarity about the true identities of those groups who opposed the Christian gospel message in the Roman Empire (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr101-1476993X11415346">2010</xref>: 66). In his view, it is possible to recognize a wide diversity among early believers, and readers should avoid ‘simplistic’ categories such as the ‘orthodox church’ or the ‘heretics’ of the first-century church. Sumney would like to eliminate even the long-held types of ‘Jewish Christianity’ and ‘Gentile Christianity’ because they tend to act as presuppositions as we begin to investigate the existent opponents of Paul (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr101-1476993X11415346">2010</xref>: 67).</p>

<title>Galatians</title>
<p>By the first century <sc>ce</sc>, the region of Galatia was extensive, stretching from the Black Sea to the Mediterranean. The large Roman province was a mixture of people from a variety of ethnicities, backgrounds, languages and religions. Both the destination and the date of this letter are subjects of scholarly debate. When Paul wrote this letter depends greatly on the original audience, but the identity of the original readers depends upon when the letter was written. As Sumney has observed, another complication facing scholarship is the identity of the people who are misleading Paul’s audience (i.e., 1.6; 3.1). Who were the ‘false brothers’ in particular (2.4-5), and what exactly were their intentions? Why would the act of ‘circumcision’ be such an issue in the northern Roman province (5.2)? If the letter was written early in Paul’s ministry, who were these early opponents? If it was written later in the century, does that change the nature of the possible opponents, and their ideology that seemed to contradict Paul’s message to the Galatians?</p>
<p>In the hope of answering such questions, Mark Nanos sets the letter to the Galatians within the specific type of rhetoric called ‘ancient letters of ironic rebuke’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1476993X11415346">2002</xref>: 298). Paul is placing his own message of Christ next to the opposing views of the ‘influencers’. Specifically, Paul juxtaposed his proclaimed ‘good news (<italic>euangelion</italic>)’ about Christ with the other ‘good news’ presented by those attempting to influence the Galatian readers (1.6-7) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1476993X11415346">2002</xref>: 284-85). In Paul’s day, the term ‘good news’ functioned as an announcement of important events concerning the ‘divine ruler’ of the Roman Empire. This news could mean a birth, an enthronement, speeches or decrees; ‘glad tidings’ were usually news of military victory. Such imperial announcements were aimed at assuring the people who lived ‘under the benevolent wings of the empire’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1476993X11415346">2002</xref>: 290). Further, the same terminology of ‘good news’ was also meaningful in Jewish literature, especially at the time of the writing of the New Testament (see, for example, Isa. 52.7-10; Mark 1.1) (ibid.). Therefore, the common concepts of ‘good news’ are blended into one message of positive expectation for the Jewish and the Roman Christians alike. In Gal. 3.8, for example, Paul uses the term in regard to the ‘good news in advance of Abraham’. Nanos quotes N.T. Wright: ‘the all-embracing royal and religious claims of Caesar are directly challenged by the equally all-embracing claim of Israel’s god. To announce that <sc>Yhwh</sc> is king is to announce that Caesar is not’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1476993X11415346">2002</xref>: 291; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr123-1476993X11415346">Wright 1994</xref>: 228). Again, Wright supports Nanos’s view by writing, ‘the more Jewish we make Paul’s “gospel”, the more it confronts directly the pretensions of the Imperial cult, and indeed all other paganisms whether “religious” or “secular”’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1476993X11415346">2002</xref>: 291; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr123-1476993X11415346">Wright 1994</xref>: 228).</p>
<p>Nanos confirms that ‘the ironic nature of the letter is present on the very surface of Paul’s language’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1476993X11415346">2002</xref>: 319). He contends that Paul designed the letter to rebuke the Gentile members of a Jewish ‘coalition’ who had begun to move away from the patterns that they knew to be true, and were trying to sway the Galatian audience. As a result, Paul uses a milder approach by employing ‘hidden language’ and implied correction; his ironic approach was ‘clear and persuasive’ for the Christian believers in Galatia, but Paul deliberately ‘obscured the identity of the players and the situations’. Therefore, the meaning of Paul’s gospel message may have been ‘hidden’ to his original audience as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1476993X11415346">2002</xref>: 321). The questions remain, was this approach taken for someone’s (or everyone’s) protection? If so, who was being protected from whom?</p>
<p>Another issue in the Galatians letter is the persecution and suffering of the Galatian believers; yet, what was the origin of the persecution? Sylvia Keesmaat contends that Paul used the ‘exodus tradition’ as the basis for ministering to the Galatians. For her, the dissension in Galatia was not a Jewish/Gentile issue, but was almost entirely a Jewish debate. She contends that the Galatian community ‘quite possibly had been told a story in which the law was central to God’s new act of salvation that would free God’s people from slavery and restore their inheritance’ (1999: 214). Thus, it was Paul’s desire to unite the Galatians into an ‘ethic of suffering love and faithfulness, even in the face of persecution’ (1999: 215).</p>

<title>‘Vanquished people’</title>
<p>In a new volume, Brigitte Kahl adds fresh insights of Roman imperial ideology to her reading of the letter to the Galatians. Kahl places Paul’s letter in the context of the Roman viewpoint of ‘vanquished people’; that is, that population who are counted among the nations conquered by the Roman Empire. Kahl sets up the historical events that were important to the ‘Celtic inhabitants of Asia Minor (contemporary Turkey) and the Celts of Western Europe’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1476993X11415346">2010</xref>: xix-xxiii), as well as clear maps of the tribal areas of Europe in ancient times. These are helpful to her descriptive background of the imperial presence in the Galatian province (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1476993X11415346">2010</xref>: 69). She carefully describes imperial symbols and images of Roman power over against the distinction of subjugated peoples, including the Galatians.</p>
<p>Kahl notes that Paul’s argument for justification by faith and freedom from law in this letter should not be interpreted through the lens of Christianity versus Judaism:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>To trace the historical meaning of Paul’s criticism of the law, and thus of justification by faith, in the hermeneutical framework of Roman imperial language and representation is a rarely taken path, and it radically changes the way we read the letter… Traditionally what we had imagined as the context of Galatians was a dispute between Jews and Christians… This imagined contexuality, which has so profoundly shaped our understanding of Galatians, illuminates one isolated segment of a larger historical picture… The Roman Empire in Paul’s time was the most basic reality of life for both Jews and non-Jews of all kinds, and is programmatically obscured in [a] theological reading (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1476993X11415346">2010</xref>: 6).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The more universal worldview that Paul presents in his letter to the Galatians involves all the nations (the ruled and the ruling) in a move toward greater peace and justice, universal law and order, through the gospel message of Jesus Christ. Kahl determines that the ‘political, ideological and theological threads are interwoven’ in Paul’s quarrel with the Galatians and their freedom from the Jewish ‘law’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1476993X11415346">2010</xref>: 7). Ultimately, Kahl asks, ‘what if Paul were targeting Greco-Roman imperial <italic>nomos</italic> much more than the Jewish Torah?’ (ibid.).</p>
<p>One of her most important contributions is Kahl’s recognition of rhetorical images (statues, inscriptions, sculpture, and the like). In her view, imperial imagery is as important to our understanding of early Christianity as are the written texts. Historical images and records of the Roman authorities’ struggles with the Gauls document events and resistance movements that would have been of great concern to the first readers of Paul’s letter. She says, ‘the dominated always know how to communicate in “other words” under the eagle eye of their censors, using abbreviations, allusions, omissions, and the camouflage of a “double-tongue” to say what they want to say, without saying it’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1476993X11415346">2010</xref>: 252). In Gal. 2.4, for example, Paul refers to ‘false brothers’ who are ‘spying’ on the believers and intend to make them ‘slaves’. Kahl believes these infiltrators to be ‘social control agents’, and the ‘political implications’ of these kinds of terms in Paul’s letters is ‘usually significantly downplayed’ (ibid.).</p>
<p>In her epilogue, Kahl considers the ‘competing empires’ of Gaul, Judea and Rome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1476993X11415346">2010</xref>: 291). At the time of Paul’s communications with the Christian churches located in outlying Roman provinces, ‘there was nothing innocent about gathering Galatians and Jews around the table of a crucified “emperor/king [<italic>basileus</italic>]” of the Jews (Mark 15:26)’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1476993X11415346">2010</xref>: 294). Further, the ‘vanquished’, from a Roman perspective, were unable to create peace among themselves, ‘unless the heavy hand of Rome was upon them’ (see Paul’s frustration with the Jews in Acts 22.30–23.10). The letter to the Galatians, then, becomes ‘an apocalyptic critique of the dominant ideology and idolatry that are inseparably intertwined’. Therefore, Paul framed his whole theological argument on a ‘messianic monotheism’ that challenges his Galatian readers ‘to see and to think both critically and faithfully’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1476993X11415346">2010</xref>: 303).</p>
<p>Justin Hardin, too, places the recipients of the Galatian letter squarely within the context of the Roman imperial cult system. The social and cultural circumstances of the imperial domination are foundational to his thesis that the ‘crisis in Galatia’ was indeed ‘exacerbated, or perhaps even generated, due to the pagan background of the Galatians readers’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1476993X11415346">2008</xref>: 149). In Hardin’s view, the ‘agitators’ of the crisis wanted to escape ‘civic reprisals’ for being affiliated with the Gentiles who no longer chose to observe the public worship of the emperor. Some of the Gentile believers did not want to be considered part of a suspicious group because they associated with the Christians; the agitators, therefore, were ‘compelling them to be circumcised’ (Gal. 6.12) in order to look Jewish to the civic authorities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1476993X11415346">2008</xref>: 114). Thus, the circumcising of the Gentile believers in Galatia would have been a means of convincing Roman authorities that the Christians were part of the Roman ‘<italic>religio licita</italic>’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1476993X11415346">2008</xref>: 114; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr116-1476993X11415346">Winter 2002a</xref>: 75). Hardin suggests that if Paul’s opponents (the agitators) feared Roman persecution because they were not counted among the protected Jews, ‘can we assume that the Gentile believers in Galatia (the readers of the letter) were under social or political pressure as well?’ The obviously positive answer reveals that the widespread Roman imperial cult provides a ‘fresh angle’ from which we can read Paul’s letter with regard to the nature of the ‘Galatian crisis’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1476993X11415346">2008</xref>: 150).</p>
<p>Hardin asserts that the agitators were Jewish Christians in the region who had recently separated themselves from Paul’s readers (who were primarily Gentiles). Paul’s words in his ‘postscript’ to the letter, Gal. 6.12-13, reveals their true motive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1476993X11415346">2008</xref>: 149). The agitators were concerned about making a ‘good impression outwardly’ and avoiding being ‘persecuted for the cross of Christ’ (6.12). Again, Paul’s rhetorical aim is to contrast his own outward appearance with his opponents’ in Gal. 6.14-18 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1476993X11415346">2008</xref>: 114). In addition, Hardin examines the claim that the Jews were exempt from the obligation to observe the imperial cult. Surprisingly, he notes evidence that Jewish communities in Jerusalem and in the Diaspora actively participated in the cult by setting up honorary inscriptions to the emperors in their synagogues: ‘Jews in the Roman world not only willingly honoured the emperor, but also employed the same methods as the Greeks and Romans’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1476993X11415346">2008</xref>: 108-109). In light of Hardin’s claim, perhaps the real issue that Paul faced was the relationship between the Galatian believers and the Jewish communities in the region who were also participants in the imperial cult. The agitators were not attempting to excuse any of the Christian believers from the imperial cult practices. They were merely concerned about the ‘status ambiguity’ in their society and about avoiding persecution because they did not appear to be a part of either ‘normalized’ groups, the Romans or the Jews (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1476993X11415346">2008</xref>: 115). Paul’s ‘postscript’ advises his readers to imitate him in his compliance to suffer whatever persecution is necessary ‘for the cross of Christ’, the very thing that the agitators were trying to avoid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1476993X11415346">2008</xref>: 151).</p>
<p>Matthew F. Lowe points out the distinct use of ‘the cross’ by Paul in Galatians. In the first-century Empire, the act of crucifixion was a quintessential display of imperial power and domination. While the Romans did not invent crucifixion, it was ‘a distinctly Roman tool of social control’ in Paul’s world; that is, it was the most obvious example of ‘state-sponsored terrorism’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1476993X11415346">2011</xref>: 201). For the Jewish Paul, it would have been extremely difficult to accept the ‘lordship’ of ‘a crucified Jew’ as an ‘agent of God (God incarnate)’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1476993X11415346">2011</xref>: 200). Even so, by the time Galatians was written, Jesus was not only perceived as the ‘Lord’ (<italic>kyrie</italic>), but Paul employs the ‘Roman torture device as an instrument of purification’ (5.24). Paul writes in his postscript that the cross can still be understood by his readers as a cause of ‘persecution’ (6.12), but it also becomes the ‘foundation for boasting’ (6.14). His positive approach to the cross may have ‘shocked’ his readers, but certainly the irony of the cross was not missed by Paul’s audience. It is possible to consider crucifixion without any intended reference to the Roman imperial system, but because the Roman were very involved in the crucifixion of Jesus, it is almost impossible not to make the connection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1476993X11415346">2011</xref>: 201). In Galatians, then, Rome’s scheme of ‘cruel execution’ is revealed as a distinct means to an end: Jesus’ cross becomes the supreme implementation of the plans of God (ibid.).</p>

<title>Ephesians</title>
<p>Regardless of one’s view with respect to the authorship of the letter to the Ephesians, the ‘new perspective’ presented by such noted scholars as J.D.G. Dunn focuses on the ‘Jewish character of Ephesians and defines the context in broad categories of Jewish thought and praxis’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr128-1476993X11415346">Yee 2005</xref>: 29; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1476993X11415346">Dunn 1996a</xref>: 139). A great deal of research on the Pauline letters has been focused on the church and Israel, and on the conflict between the Jewish and Gentile believers. The study of Tet-Lim Yee is concerned with ‘ethnic reconciliation’ in view of a predominantly Jewish backdrop (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1476993X11415346">2005</xref>: 31). In his examination of the letter in general and of Ephesians 2 specifically, Yee makes fresh conclusions concerning the Jewish perception of the Gentiles, who are placed in an ‘other’ or an ‘out of place’ category (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1476993X11415346">2005</xref>: 32). The author of the letter, a Christian Jew, is writing to a community of Christian Gentiles, to assure them that they are no longer in a peripheral position, but are people of God. The reconciliation is accomplished by the ‘Messiah Jesus’ whose saving work is ‘undisguised inclusivism’; all believers, then, are to accept the ethnic ‘other’ in their midst (ibid.). In addition, Yee suggests that another issue in Ephesians is the puzzling terminology of ‘heavenly places’ (1.20-21; 3.10; 6.12). While this phrase has usually been seen as a reference to the readers’ eschatological future, Yee writes that the phrase should be seen as effort on the part of the author ‘to destigmatise the Gentile’s defective status’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1476993X11415346">2005</xref>: 220).</p>
<p>Lowe writes that Ephesians has received ‘little attention’ in recent examinations of the ‘minor’ New Testament letters in the imperial context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1476993X11415346">2011</xref>: 202). Perhaps any references to the imperial system in the letter are ‘subtle—but not necessarily untraceable’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1476993X11415346">2011</xref>: 202). Lowe looks at the language of the ‘powers’ which are a major topic in Ephesians; the author announces Christ’s supremacy over the familiar ‘powers’ in the Empire. The ‘divine-warfare myth’ from the Old Testament is situated in an imperial context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1476993X11415346">2011</xref>: 205). We can see how the ideology of ‘divine warfare, myths of power and exaltation’ are rooted in the Hebrew Old Testament, and the ‘victorious warrior’ role may have been conveyed to the kings of Israel, as seen in Psalm 68 (cited in Eph. 4.8) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1476993X11415346">2011</xref>: 204). While they were familiar with the Old Testament Scriptures, the New Testament authors also knew the customary Roman imperial imagery of a ‘triumphal procession’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1476993X11415346">2011</xref>: 205). Paul ‘reworked’ Psalm 68, and then ‘superimposes’ the ‘unmistakable’ Roman image of the imperial triumph as ‘an overlay’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1476993X11415346">2011</xref>: 206). Lowe notes that ‘seeing both sides of triumph and captivity, experiencing (whether personally or vicariously) the status of both victor and victim, Paul, Ignatius and their Ephesian readers would have found a christocentric recasting of the triumph to be an <italic>appropriate</italic> image—if not always a positive one’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1476993X11415346">2011</xref>: 206-207, his emphasis).</p>
<p>Jennifer Bird takes another approach to the Ephesians letter. She summarizes her view by writing that ‘the author creates a counter-empire by drawing upon terminology typically associated with imperial claims, decrees and restorative actions’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1476993X11415346">2007</xref>: 277). The author of the epistle creates ‘an empire that has conquered that of Rome’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1476993X11415346">2007</xref>: 278). Yet, in this letter, Christ as the Conqueror, and his empire, are ‘thoroughly spiritualized’. This gives people who are subjects of the spiritual realm no reason to pursue a realm of ‘unjust rulers and systems’. In fact, they are to passively ‘acquiesce to its systems’ in the earthly realm (ibid.). The emphasis in Ephesians is the empowerment of people who may have appeared to ‘threaten the system’; yet, they can ‘lead the way into new understandings of community and liberation for all people’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1476993X11415346">2007</xref>: 278).</p>

<title>Philippians</title>
<p>In the city of Philippi, Carter sees a situation that seems to be closer to the environment at Thessalonica than to Corinth. A smaller city, Philippi was a colony, settled primarily by Roman citizens. Carter surmises that the church was probably small, comprised more of ‘artisans’ than of ‘elites’. He also suggests that the believers had probably separated themselves from the worship of idols and from the imperial cult festivities, as they had done in Thessalonica. The early Christians may have had significant pressure from the opposing forces: ‘economic sanctions, verbal abuse, broken relationships and perhaps occasional acts of violence’. As a result, Paul urges them to ‘stand firm’ (4.1); this is Paul’s method and response to the acting sovereignty of Rome. Written while Paul was in prison under imperial guard, his position did not prevent the spread of the gospel message ‘through the Praetorian guard’. Paul draws attention to the believers, even in the emperor’s household (4.22) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1476993X11415346">2006</xref>: 60-61). He has confidence in God’s power, even to the point of asking Roman citizens to renounce their citizenship status, just as Christ renounced his status and became a slave (2.5-11). Slaves were, of course, the lowest members of the imperial society with few rights or privileges. Yet, Paul reassures his audience that, in the end, God’s sovereignty will triumph over Rome’s Empire (3.12-21) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1476993X11415346">2006</xref>: 62).</p>
<p>Porter agrees with Carter, writing that Paul uses the prison context to focus on three aspects of civilization known to the believers in Philippi: ‘citizenship, peace, and the crucifixion as the focal point of the Christ-hymn in Philippians 2’. The reference to ‘citizenship in heaven’ in 3.20 indicates ‘a degree of expatriated discontent with Roman citizenship’. The ‘peace of God’ in 1.2 and 4.7 is seen in contrast to the concept of Roman peace. The ‘Christ-hymn’ of 2.6-11 is a masterpiece of irony; first, it contrasts Jesus’ humble obedience to the imperial power over life and death. While the cross is seen as a ‘clear stamp of empire’, it is translated into Jesus’ exaltation and glory. Second, Porter sees the account of Jesus’ ascension in the hymn (2.9-11) as clearly a ‘reminder of the adoration of a Roman emperor’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-1476993X11415346">2011</xref>: 13).</p>
<p>Further, Lowe suggests that with his Jewish ties and his Roman ties, in all his travels and imprisonments, Paul, to some degree, may have felt like a man without an ‘earthly citizenship’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-1476993X11415346">2011</xref>: 208). It is little wonder that he looked forward to a ‘citizenship in heaven’, as well as the ‘peace of God’. The visual picture of the cross in Paul’s letters should not be missed: in addition to the imagery in the book of Galatians, Lowe shows that the crucifixion and resurrection of Jesus are seen as ‘descent and ascent’ in Ephesians 4, and they form a ‘similar arc’ in Phil. 2.9-11 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-1476993X11415346">2011</xref>: 210). He writes that ‘whenever Paul’s churches read about or made reference to the cross…the “atonement” carries a reminder of the empire’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-1476993X11415346">2011</xref>: 211).</p>
<p>Peter Oakes explores the Pauline rhetoric in the letter to the Philippians. Paul himself is under the pressure of the imperial authority, imprisoned and facing possible execution. Moreover, his readers at Philippi were Christians who were also suffering. In view of the situation, what Paul chooses to tell his audience is unexpected. A common theme seems to be the sovereignty of Christ over every aspect of his imprisonment and suffering. Such a theme forms a link with other material in the letter about Christ’s universal sovereignty, and the hope it brings. In life or in death, in imprisonment or in release, Paul returns to the supremacy of Christ. Through this language, readers can grasp a comparison between the Roman authorities and Christ’s sovereignty over them. The polarity between Paul’s imprisonment texts and those passages about Christ can be connected if we see both as expressions of Paul’s reaction to the Roman government. Paul assures the Philippians that they can be confident and ‘stand firm’ in their trying situations because God is sovereign over the human rulers, both in Paul’s detention and in the ultimate victory of Christ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-1476993X11415346">2001</xref>: xvi).</p>
<p>N.T. Wright explores passages in Philippians that advance his thesis concerning Paul and the Empire. First, as we have seen before, the hymn or a poem in chapter 2 sounds like familiar ‘imperial acclamations’; yet it is Jesus, and not the Roman emperor, ‘who has been a servant, and is now to be hailed as Lord (<italic>kyrio</italic>)’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr126-1476993X11415346">2010</xref>: 7). Second, Paul says ‘our citizenship is in heaven, and from it we await the Saviour, the Lord Jesus, the Messiah’ (3.20); here, Paul explicitly employs imperial emperor titles. Third, Wright explains that the Empire expanded and colonized other regions because of the crowded conditions in the capital city of Rome. Should a colony experience difficulties from an outside force, the emperor would travel to the colony to rescue his loyal subjects and protect them from danger. Paul’s portrayal of Jesus and his divine saving actions could easily have been understood by the inhabitants in the colonized city of Philippi as a contrast to the Roman emperor. Wright calls this ‘imperial eschatology: Jesus is the reality, Caesar the parody’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr126-1476993X11415346">2010</xref>: 6).</p>
<p>Moreover, Wright expands on the idea of Paul’s rhetoric from Oakes. Wright contends that it is not Paul’s desire to warn the Philippians against a Jewish threat; Paul’s concern is to warn them against the ‘Caesar-cult’. He does this in chapter 3 by encouraging his readers to remain steady in the ‘counter-empire of Jesus’. This message is given to them ‘for the most part, in code’. By telling his own story (3.4-6), Paul shrewdly shows how his own denial of status and position was forfeited for the ‘surpassing greatness’, and the true status and privilege ‘of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord’ (not Caesar) (3.8). Paul writes that ‘it is no trouble for me to write the same thing to you again, and it is a safe-guard for you’ (3.1). His letter is safe because no one reading chapter 3 would surmise that the recipients of the letter were being encouraged to be disloyal to the emperor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1476993X11415346">2010</xref>: 7). Therefore, if Phil. 3.2-11 was intended to be a ‘coded challenge’ to the Empire and its leaders, Wright suggests that the passage was also intended to persuade the readers, subjugated to Caesar, to have the confidence to trust in Jesus as Lord, and the confidence to ‘renounce the imperial claims of Caesar’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr126-1476993X11415346">2010</xref>: 8).</p>

<title>Colossians</title>
<p>In the world of music, the concept of ‘remixing’ is a melding of an older, original song with newer, more modern music, to form a new composition. Brian Walsh and Sylvia Keesmaat have combined their efforts to do the same thing with the letter to the Colossians. They assert that the ‘older voice’ of the Colossians letter can be remixed for our contemporary society. Colossians was an ‘explosive and subversive tract in the context of the Roman Empire’. In the context of imperial realities, the letter can function in much the same ways in our day (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr106-1476993X11415346">2004</xref>: 7). Paul presents an ‘alternative vision of reality, animating a way of life that was subversive to the ethos of the Empire’ (ibid.). Walsh and Keesmaat challenge modern readers by saying, ‘if it is true that Christ is the Creator and Redeemer of “all things” as the Colossians poem so eloquently puts it, then what might be the implications of such a breathtaking comprehensive worldview for our ecological, political and economic lives?’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr106-1476993X11415346">2004</xref>: 8).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section27-1476993X11415346">
<title>Alternative community</title>
<p>Walsh and Keesmaat compose an ‘ethic of community’, based on the view that Colossians is a ‘subversive tract for subversive living; it insists that such an alternative imagination and alternative way of life is formed and sustained in the context of community’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr106-1476993X11415346">2004</xref>: 9). The Christian household, for example, is shaped very differently from the accepted Roman model of family life. Paul also creates a ‘secessionist ethic’, of ‘putting to death’ the evidences of the Empire, and ‘the “stripping off the old self” that was deformed by the empire’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr106-1476993X11415346">2004</xref>: 172). His readers are called to new, resurrection life that is ‘clothed’ in a new set of values. Paul offers his readers a realm that stands out against what his audience knew of the Roman Empire. The ‘old’ way of life included idolatry (3.5), and the new way was ‘renewal in the image of God’ (3.10). The imperial government promoted false and ‘violent’ ideology (1.21; 3.9); Paul offered ‘a renewal of knowledge’ (3.10).</p>
<p>While the Romans imposed emperor worship, ‘religious, ethnic and economic divisiveness and marginalization’, the alternative was a community where ‘Christ is all and in all’ (3.9) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr106-1476993X11415346">2004</xref>: 172). Remarkably, Paul argues, ‘all things are created in, through and for Christ’; and ‘all things are reconciled through this death on a Roman cross’ (1.15-20) (ibid.). Walsh and Keesmaat point out that Paul was encouraging ‘a comprehensive salvation [that] must permeate all of the life’. This description of the ethical Christian life was not limited to the life of one person, but to the life of the entire church, which was the ‘beginning of the new humanity for the new creation’. Old idolatry commitments and imperial political loyalties were replaced by the ‘restoration of the image of God in history’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr106-1476993X11415346">2004</xref>: 172-73). Further, ‘as an alternative to the foolish belief that peace, prosperity and social well-being are secured through the growth of the economy and the military expansion of imperial control, the Christian community seeks political wisdom by being rooted in the <italic>word of Christ</italic>’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr106-1476993X11415346">2004</xref>: 183, authors’ emphasis).</p>
<p>The renewal of knowledge was the beginning of a ‘transformed social order’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr106-1476993X11415346">2004</xref>: 173). Thus, in the Colossian community, ‘it all begins and it all ends with Christ’, and not the Roman emperor. As a result of death and the resurrection life, Christian love cannot remain an ‘abstract idea’; it must take on the ‘flesh in the embodied life of the Christian community’, even in places and times that are not favorable to its presence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr106-1476993X11415346">2004</xref>: 179). ‘There is something wildly audacious about all this!’ the authors claim (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr106-1476993X11415346">2004</xref>: 177).</p>
<p>Walsh and Keesmaat take a stab at interpreting the cryptic Romans 13 passage, by relating it directly to the poem in Colossians 1. They would argue that Paul <italic>does</italic> honor the Roman authorities, because the magistrates are exercising a God-given authority (1.16) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr106-1476993X11415346">2004</xref>: 185, their emphasis). Those public officials who misuse their positions and power must acknowledge such exploitation in public. So, Paul honors these magistrates by correctly exposing their maltreatment and calling them to task. Because he believes that their power is not finally rooted in the Roman emperor, but is of God, Paul ‘demands that they use their authority in a way that demonstrates that they really are servants of God’. Moreover, when political power ‘clearly abrogates its responsibility to do good, when it acts against the will of God, then the Christian community has a responsibility to call it back to its rightful duty, and even to engage in civil disobedience (see Acts 12.6-23). The state has no authority to do evil’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr106-1476993X11415346">2004</xref>: 185). After much discussion concerning the language of Romans 13, the authors conclude that,</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>when the state functions as an empire, when it bears an uncanny resemblance to Babylon, then ‘seeking the welfare’ of the state requires shaping an alternative community that practices an alternative politics. If the empire is war-mongering, then the Christian community is called to be a witness for peace (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr106-1476993X11415346">2004</xref>: 186).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>From an ‘ethic of community’ Walsh and Keesmaat move to an ‘ethic of liberation’ as expressed by Paul in the book of Colossians. Again, their words are worth regarding in full:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>We can argue until we are blue in the face that Colossians is good news for an oppressed and marginalized community at the heart of the Roman empire, but unless this good news is for those truly at the margins—slaves, children, women—it is nothing but a noisy gong and a clanging cymbal… The household code not only reinscribes the traditional oppressive ordering of a household in the empire, it is also ‘the integral consequence of Christ’s universal lordship’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr106-1476993X11415346">2004</xref>: 201; the latter phrase is from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1476993X11415346">D’Angelo 1994</xref>: 322).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Ultimately, Walsh and Keesmaat assert that it ‘all comes down to worship’. That is, while Paul calls the community to confess Christ as the only Lord, ‘worship is demonstrated through word and deed’, through an alternative manner of loving and living in a world that is not a godly kingdom (2004: 183).</p>
<p>Finally, N.T. Wright compares Gal. 4.1-11 with Paul’s rhetoric in Colossians. In Galatians, Paul warns the believers that ‘if they submit to circumcision they will not only not escape from the paganism they have rejected in becoming a Christian, but will actually be returning to it in a subtler form’. In Colossians, however, Paul warns against a Judaism that is ‘described in terms of paganism’. That is, in Col. 2 Paul implies that the Jews who reject Jesus as their Messiah are thereby ‘subject to the same critique as paganism’. Wright perceives that Paul is using ‘an inner-Jewish rhetorical strategy’ where the unbelieving Jews were cast as ‘pseudo-pagans’. In this way, Paul is cleverly setting up a Jewish polemic that serves another purpose, namely his ‘anti-Caesar message’ (2.8). Wright concludes that Paul is asking his audience to ‘reconsider their allegiance to the Roman emperor, just as he reconsidered his allegiance to Judaism’. Thus, the Philippians, the Colossians, and the Galatians—all the believers—must find their whole identity in Jesus the Messiah and nowhere else (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr126-1476993X11415346">2010</xref>: 11).</p>

<title>1 and 2 Thessalonians</title>
<p>From about 146 <sc>bce</sc>, the city of Thessalonica (or, ‘Thessalonike’) had been the capital of the Roman providence of Macedonia. The city remained quite Greek in its culture, in spite of Roman rule. History tells us that the people of Thessalonike ‘deliberately cultivated and solicited the benefaction of Rome’, and the city depended heavily on the ‘benevolence’ of the emperor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr119-1476993X11415346">Witherington 2006</xref>: 3, 9).</p>
<p>Paul’s first letter to the Thessalonians may have been written in the late 40s <sc>ce</sc>, when the imperial cult was on the rise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr119-1476993X11415346">Witherington 2006</xref>: 1). Ben Witherington III notes that the ‘emperor cult was syncetized with the local worship of the Cabiri, the mystic deities of Samothrace (and a cult patronized by Philip and Alexander)’. The ancient coins show that the emperor was ‘deified as <italic>Kabeiros</italic>, “the ancestral and most holy of all gods”’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr119-1476993X11415346">2006</xref>: 5). The mixture of the Greek cults, foreign cults (Isis and Serapis), and the Roman emperor cult created fertile ground for the Jews and early Christians of the day (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr119-1476993X11415346">2006</xref>: 6). History also relates other features that favored the city including the celebration of both the ‘Olympic and Pythian games’ (ibid.). Suffice it to say that it was a difficult city for the Christian believers, who were opposed by both the Jews (Acts 17) and by the influential pagans.</p>
<p>Carter suggests that the church in Thessalonica may have been composed of ‘a small group of mainly artisan converts’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1476993X11415346">2006</xref>: 52). The epistle mentions neither slaves, nor does it make reference to a wealthy ‘elite’ class of patrons. Problems among ethnic groups or different socioeconomic groups within the church are not mentioned, in contrast to what we see in 1 Corinthians. As in other cities, to renounce city gods and not participate in celebrations of the imperial cult were most likely seen as acts of disloyalty and subversion. In fact, Paul and his associates were in danger in Thessalonica because they are accused of ‘defying Caesar’s decrees, saying that there is another king, one called Jesus’ (Acts 17.7). Witherington writes that Paul uses ‘political language’ which had previously been reserved for pagan deities (1 Thess. 1.1, 10; 5.3-9) or the emperor (1 Thess. 5.3, 23; 2 Thess. 2.3-4; 3.16) in reference to Jesus. Yet, for Paul, the ‘only God on earth was Jesus, not the emperor’, and he wanted to make that clear to the people of Thessalonike (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1476993X11415346">2006</xref>: 6).</p>
<p>In addition, Carter suggests that the reference to coming of the ‘parousia’ in 1 Thess. 4.15-17 may have been designed to parallel the celebration of the arrival of an imperial official or military general into the city. Jesus is seen as ‘the rightful ruler’ who returns with ‘a loud command, the voice of the archangel and the trumpet call of God’ (4.16). Thus, perhaps Paul is not necessarily considering an imminent ‘parousia’ in this early letter, as much as he is adapting common, familiar empire concepts and terminology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr119-1476993X11415346">2006</xref>: 53-54). Helmut Koester agrees: neither 1 Thessalonians nor Romans was written by someone who was worried about the ‘delay of the parousia’. The Thessalonian letters show that the believing community rested in the idea that they ‘already belonged to the “day” in their present existence’ (1 Thess. 5.1-5). Koester writes that Paul envisioned the believing community presenting an alternative to the ‘prevailing eschatological ideology of Rome’. In doing so, Paul radically changes the ‘traditional apocalyptic topics’, giving hope and warnings to the church about the days ahead (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1476993X11415346">1997</xref>: 166).</p>
<p>Porter concurs, noting that,</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>in 1 and 2 Thessalonians, while references to idol worship and kingdom/dominion are directed at the empire, the strongest locus of imperial content is located in 1 Thess 4:13-18 and 5:3, where the Lord’s <italic>parousia</italic> contains loaded imperial content, and the empire’s offer of peace and security is nullified. Paul renders the <italic>parousia</italic> as a clear imitation of the imperial event of a royal visitation, where the tombs and mausoleums of the dead are encountered first and a greeting committee meets him and escorts him back. The timing of his coming will disrupt the imperial program of peace and security (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-1476993X11415346">2011a</xref>: 13).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The ‘parousia’ offered a hope unlike anything the Empire had to offer. The New Testament epistles give an ultimate hope that Rome would eventually meet its demise. Implicit in 1 Thessalonians is a hope that the early Christians would see the fall of the imperial system, which was an opponent of the purposes of God. The picture of the return of Jesus (4.15-17) may have reminded the original readers of the victorious return of the emperor and the imperial army; yet, the promise of God’s reign in the world will be fulfilled only when the rule of Rome is overcome (5.8-9). Certainly more will be said about the ‘parousia’ and the Roman Empire when I address the book of Revelation in my next article.</p>

<title>Philemon</title>
<p>Cassidy makes an interesting comparison between Paul’s letter to Philemon and his letter to the Romans. The two letters obviously contrast in length, but Cassidy notes that they also contrast in terms of the circumstances which precipitated the writing of each epistle. Cassidy contends that at the time Paul wrote to the church at Rome, he was probably working elsewhere in Asia Minor, perhaps on his last missionary journey, hoping to return to Rome (1.7-15; 15.22-29). Yet, his letter to Philemon was written probably three to four years later. Cassidy argues that at that time of writing Philemon, Paul was an ‘old man’, imprisoned in Rome (though some have suggested imprisonment was in Ephesus), ‘in chains’ and under Roman guard (Phlm. 9–10) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1476993X11415346">2001b</xref>: 68). In Philemon, Paul refers to his imprisonment and his chains ‘four times in thirteen verses’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1476993X11415346">2001b</xref>: 73), and we do not see the ‘great vigorousness’ that ‘pervades’ the letter to the Romans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1476993X11415346">2001b</xref>: 81). Other similar letters such as Philippians (1.13), Colossians (4.7-18), and Ephesians (4.1) may have been written about the same time, and his imprisonment is in the forefront of these letters. Paul declares that he is a ‘prisoner of Jesus Christ’ (Phlm. 1), implying that it was his Christian message that put him ‘in chains’. Historically, then, Paul’s circumstances changed between the writing of Romans and his communication to Philemon, as did his perspectives concerning the Roman imperial system. Dating Philemon after Romans, after Paul had experienced the full force of Roman custody, ill health, a dependence upon friends and fellow workers, hope for release, and battles within the judicial system, the small letter of Philemon takes on a sense of anti-imperial rhetoric that is not found in Romans 13.</p>
<p>In terms of a postcolonial approach, A.D. Callahan writes that Paul addresses his recipients of Philemon with the ‘language of <italic>agape</italic>’. Callahan notes that the epistle of Philemon does not emphasize a hierarchal class structure. It makes no mention of titles or positions (‘apostles nor bishops’). Rather, Paul refers to a ‘prisoner, brother, friend, fellow-worker, sister, fellow-soldier, [and] all the saints’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1476993X11415346">2007</xref>: 336). Hence, he uses language of unity, without reference to status, ‘entitlements, rights or threats of coercion’. It is the language of ‘co-worker and comrade, the language of the brother beloved’ (ibid.).</p>

<title>3. Part Three: Non-Pauline Canonical Epistles</title>
<p>Cynthia Long Westfall surveys the theme of ‘empire’ in the book of Hebrews, the general epistles and the book of Revelation. These letters often display a more obvious context of Jewish Christianity, drawing out a different response from the readers compared to what is observed in the Pauline letters to the Gentile churches. The different natures and purposes of these epistles demonstrate a different relationship with imperial issues. In her view, the study of ‘empire’ involves the use of specialized ‘tools’ to uncover features of each individual text. Like the Pauline epistles, one can analyze these letters by using ‘models of the social sciences’, such as ‘political, economic, social, military and religious power’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr111-1476993X11415346">2011</xref>: 231). Westfall writes that ‘the literature of early Jewish Christianity in the non-Pauline epistles has a tendency to display the negotiation of one aspect of empire more distinctly than others’ (ibid.). Therefore, she investigates each of these letters featuring one highly visible model. James, for example, is analyzed with an ‘economic model’ and addresses economic issues including exploitation, materialism and poverty. 1 Peter is analyzed with a ‘social model’, in terms of securing honor and dignity for the powerless. 2 Peter, Jude and the Johannine Epistles are analyzed in terms of ‘ethics and values’, because they emphasized the ethics and values of God’s kingdom in contrast to those of a secular kingdom. Hebrews is analyzed with a ‘religious/political’ model because it ‘challenged the Roman view of reality and kingdom’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr111-1476993X11415346">Westfall 2011</xref>: 231, 256; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-1476993X11415346">Porter 2011a</xref>: 14).</p>
<p>The Jewish Christian communities may have provided the clearest resistance to the Roman Empire in the New Testament. The writers to these communities drew upon the ancient concepts of ‘empire’ and ‘kingdom’ including earlier traditions with ‘Egypt, Assyria, Babylon, Persia and Greece’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr111-1476993X11415346">Westfall 2011</xref>: 255). Jewish Christianity occupied a far more difficult position as it fought for its existence between the Roman Empire and traditional Judaism. The alienation that grew between the Jews and the Jewish Christians weakened the Christian resistance to the imperial ruling system. The dominance of the Roman Empire was seen as being ‘in competition’ with God’s sovereignty, and posed a threat to Jewish Christians. The believers’ response to a tyrannical empire began with personal repentance before God, which separated the Christian from the traditional Jewish struggles, and from the Roman system of exploitation. The response may have led to forms of ‘non-violent active resistance’. On the positive side, Christian believers found their place of true value and reality in the kingdom of God (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr111-1476993X11415346">2011</xref>: 256).</p>
<sec id="section31-1476993X11415346">
<title>a. Epistle of James</title>
<p>Sharon Ringe presents a discussion on the letter of James from a postcolonial perspective. She relates that in the past, scholarship has approached the book from two angles: the historical questions of date, occasion and readers, and the theological angle of its content. It has been interpreted by various voices of scholarship, many of whom have set it alongside Paul’s letter to the Romans. What has been missing is the letter’s ‘indictment’ of the economic and social elites, the landowners and merchants (5.1-6; 4.13-17) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-1476993X11415346">2007</xref>: 369).</p>
<p>Ringe notes the ‘power of speech’ and the fact that ‘one tool and expression of colonization was language’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-1476993X11415346">2007</xref>: 374). On the one hand, in a hierarchal system, the dominant power can define or even re-define the meaning and significance of events that play a major role in people’s everyday lives. In the Roman Empire, the concept of <italic>Pax Romana</italic> was maintained by ‘enforced tranquility’. ‘In short’, she writes, ‘“truth” is reduced to a term of power and language, to a device of manipulation’ (ibid.). On the other hand, the book of James brings awareness to the use of speech and language as a means of ‘integrity’ and ‘wholeness of life’ (see 1.18) (ibid.). Thus, Ringe considers James ‘a postcolonial voice’, calling for a response to the imperial system, not by escaping from it through a ‘spiritualized religion’, but through an ‘alternative integrity’ that shows its power through a reflection of God himself—a power greater than Rome or any other human institution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-1476993X11415346">2007</xref>: 378).</p>
<p>In their recent book on James, authors Craig Blomberg and Mariam Kamell place the New Testament book into the ‘broad literary and rhetorical genre of <italic>paraenesis</italic> or exhortation’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1476993X11415346">2008</xref>: 32). It appears that ‘most or all of [James’] readers are literal, ethnic Jews’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1476993X11415346">2008</xref>: 28). However, the Jewish recipients were spread across the Roman Empire (the ‘<italic>diaspora</italic>’), perhaps centered in the area ‘in and around’ the region of Syria (see Gal. 2:12; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1476993X11415346">2008</xref>: 29).</p>
<p>Blomberg and Kamell indicate that there are strong language parallels between James and Galatians. These authors discuss the relationship between Paul and the writer of James, concluding that James was likely written ‘independent of and therefore prior to Paul’s views’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1476993X11415346">2008</xref>: 30). If this historical dating is accurate, it gives a reason to believe that James’s readers did face the same trials and oppositions in the Syria region that Paul’s audiences encountered in other regions of the Roman Empire. In James, however, there is a ‘complete absence of any mention of Gentiles’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1476993X11415346">2008</xref>: 31). There may be any number of reasons for this omission, but perhaps, at the time of writing, the author of James found it necessary to be cautious about how he wrote about the imperial authorities.</p>
<p>The book of James addresses a variety of ‘trials’ that were being faced by the recipients. In spite of the Jewish environment familiar to the original readers, the human trials outlined in James may also reflect historically known circumstances of the wealthy, elite class and the poverty of the common, poorer class people in the first-century Roman Empire. Further, the dialogue of the true nature of ‘wisdom’, and the quality of performed, ‘rhetorical speech’ were familiar topics among the educated wealthy class of the Roman society (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1476993X11415346">2008</xref>: 31). Certainly personal trials would have included various situations faced by both the ‘rich’ and the ‘poor’ in their ‘earthly circumstances’; thus, ‘socioeconomic disparities were causing problems for his congregations’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1476993X11415346">2008</xref>: 29). This economic inequity is seen in the example of ‘discrimination’ in 2.1-4; it is this material disparity that ‘drives the theology in 2.14-26’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1476993X11415346">2008</xref>: 30).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section32-1476993X11415346">
<title>b. Epistle of Hebrews</title>
<p>Westfall writes that ‘Hebrews can be convincingly portrayed as an exhortation written by an educated Hellenistic Jew to a group or church composed of Jewish believers whose world is falling apart’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr111-1476993X11415346">2011</xref>: 248). These Jewish Christians had experienced ‘public humiliation, imprisonment, the seizure of property’ with shame, guilt and conflict within their society. They were feeling severe pressure (10.22-39); as an example, we can observe the ‘different aspects of death [that] dominate chapter 11’ (ibid.). The author even attempts to prevent them from rejecting their ‘spiritual foundation’ (5.11–6.6) as a result of their persecution. Westfall offers two suggestions for the impending crisis: imminent persecution of Christians located in Rome, or the impending violence and destruction by the Roman Imperial army between 68–73 <sc>ce</sc> as a result of the Jewish uprising in Palestine (ibid.). In either situation, the ‘mortal danger’ is directly associated with the Roman government (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr111-1476993X11415346">2011</xref>: 249).</p>
<p>Yet, the book of Hebrews does not directly ‘counter-attack’ the Roman authorities; rather, ‘the author redefines the reader’s existence so that the Roman Empire does not define reality for the reader’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr111-1476993X11415346">2011</xref>: 249). The existing maltreatments are seen in light of ‘God’s discipline and training’ as well as their partnership with the sufferings of Christ (12.1-11) (ibid.).</p>
<p>The author of Hebrews artfully employs language, terminology, metaphors and imagery in such a way as to give them new definitions and meanings. In this sense, Hebrews reflects a subversive interaction with the first-century culture. The readers find their ultimate existence in a ‘heavenly kingdom’ with a ‘heavenly tabernacle’. The advent of a newer and better priesthood, tabernacle, covenant, city and law are used to describe new realities for believers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr111-1476993X11415346">Westfall 2011</xref>: 249). In this way, the readers are encouraged to navigate their way through the adversities of the Roman Empire as well as those of traditional Judaism. ‘As the people of faith in Hebrews 11 exemplify, they are no longer to find their status in the society of the Empire; they have a city “already and not yet” that rivals Rome and replaces the earthly Jerusalem’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr111-1476993X11415346">2011</xref>: 250). People of faith may be rejected, tortured and persecuted, but ‘the world is not worthy of them’ (11.36-38). Westfall concludes that Hebrews prepares the readers to avoid the sin of apostasy and endure the hostility of the Empire, ‘to the point of shedding blood’ (12.4). Ultimately, ‘Rome has been denied the privilege of defining reality for believers and is stripped of the clout of its military power’ over those people who value their faith in Jesus over ‘their own life’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr111-1476993X11415346">2011</xref>: 251).</p>
<p>Consequently, Jeremy H. Punt reminds the modern reader that Hebrews provides a ‘valuable perspective on the tenuous character of faith and religious expression’, in the midst of a continuing ‘reinterpretation of Christ’. The nature of the book challenges the ‘comfort and security of orthodoxy’. In Hebrews, we perceive a distinct ‘dualism’ in thought, a focus on cultic activities, a ‘quest for the final rest’, and a reference to a distinct people of God. Thus, Hebrews can be associated with the ‘imperialism which often characterized Christianity’s past’. Punt contends that the benefit of a postcolonial reading of Hebrews incorporates the discovery of ‘liberating strands’ in the texts, while revealing ‘the text’s (and history’s) collusion with known imperial actions’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-1476993X11415346">Punt 2007</xref>: 363).</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Recent studies of the letters of the New Testament have uncovered intentional words, phrases, ideology and imagery that carry the weight of anti-imperial rhetoric. While it is impossible to neglect the Jewish nature of some of the New Testament epistles, as well as some of the authors, both mild and overt rhetoric challenges the worship and the propaganda of the Roman imperial authorities. In a general sense, the response of the authors of the New Testament epistles to the dominating government seems to be, ‘Jesus is Lord, not Caesar!’</p>
<p>Nevertheless, there is one book left in the New Testament that has not been addressed in this series of articles. Westfall contends that, unlike the general epistles or the book of Hebrews, the book of Revelation has been ‘central’ in the discussion of ‘empire’ and New Testament studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr111-1476993X11415346">2011</xref>: 251). Revelation encounters conflicts with the Roman Empire at a number of the same points as each of the general epistles, ‘running the gamut’ of different facets of resistance by Christians in the midst of imperial domination. It is ‘the New Testament document that is most critical of the empire’, and it is the focus of our third and final article in this series (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr111-1476993X11415346">2011</xref>: 251). The final chapter in our analysis of current scholarship and anti-imperial rhetoric will feature the challenges and the inspiration of the book of Revelation.</p>
