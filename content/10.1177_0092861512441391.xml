            <p>
               <italic>Background:</italic> Advances in medicine, clinical trial design, and statistical methods affect product approvals. Over the last decade, there were many breakthroughs in the development of novel cancer therapies, including the wide application of biomarkers in drug development. Understanding trends and patterns of trial design and data submissions that lead to the approval of these novel agents assists oncologists, investigators, and regulatory personnel. <italic>Methods:</italic> All new molecular entity (NME) therapeutic oncological agents approved for the first time within the past 13 years (January 1, 1999 to December 31, 2011) were analyzed for product features, approved indications, regulatory metrics, and clinical trial design. Patterns and trends were reviewed. July 2005 marked the midpoint of this review, concurrent with the FDA establishing the Office of Oncology Drug Products (OODP). Regulatory metrics before and after the establishment of the OODP were compared and analyzed. The Fisher exact test was applied for statistical analyses. <italic>Results:</italic> A total of 47 new oncological approvals were identified, 2 to 7 approvals per year (median, 3.0), with 6.0-month median reviews. Comparing the pre- and post-OODP period, there was trending towards more approvals (4.3/year vs 2.9/year) along with more targeted agent approvals (50% vs 21%) in the post-OODP period, although these metrics did not reach statistical significance due to relatively small numbers and large variances. There were also numerically fewer orphan designations (36% vs 53%) and accelerated approvals (32% vs 37%) in the post-OODP period. Approvals were for small molecule targeted agents, 38% (frequently kinase inhibitors); monoclonal antibodies, 17%; conventional cytotoxics, 28%; hormonal agents, 13%; and miscellaneous agents, 4%. Two 2011 approvals were associated with companion diagnostics. First-line indications accounted for only 36%; 62% were parenterally administered. Multinational, multicenter, randomized phase II or III trials utilizing overall survival or progression-free survival endpoints were common pivotal trial features in solid tumors. Hematological malignancy trials involved multiple small, single-arm phase II studies measuring mainly response rate, commonly resulting in accelerated approval. Placebo controls (19%) and blinding (24%) were both seldom employed. <italic>Conclusions:</italic> Over the last 13 years, 55% of NME approvals were targeted agents or monoclonal antibodies, most not for first-line use. Most applications relied upon a single pivotal study for approval. Randomized trials supported most solid tumor approvals, whereas single-arm phase II studies supported (mostly accelerated) approvals in hematological malignancies. After establishment of the OODP, there were trends towards more approvals and less orphan designations.</p>

         <title>Introduction</title>
         <p>The past decade witnessed advances in medical science with breakthroughs in the development of novel agents, especially targeted therapies for cancer treatment.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0092861512441391">1</xref>

            </sup> In contrast to the 1990s, which brought few new therapies like trastuzumab (Herceptin, Genentech, South San Francisco, California) and rituximab (Rituxan, Genentech), the most recent decade was characterized by the development of many novel classes of therapies such as kinase inhibitors, EGFR inhibitors, angiogenesis inhibitors, mTOR inhibitors, HDAC inhibitors, and proteasome inhibitors. Unlike conventional cytotoxic agents, these targeted agents are usually associated with less bone marrow suppression. </p>
         <p>Meanwhile, discovery of the human genome, expansion of proteomics research, and emergence of many exciting new molecular, computational, and imaging techniques heralded an era of personalized medicine, allowing tailored therapies and subclassification of diseases.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0092861512441391">5</xref>

            </sup> Demand for evidence-based medicine also encouraged the rapid adoption of predictive and prognostic biomarkers and gene testing during clinical development. Consistent with the development of targeted therapeutics in clinical oncology, use of biomarkers is now common in many oncological drug development programs.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0092861512441391">10</xref>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0092861512441391"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0092861512441391">12</xref>
            </sup> 
         </p>
         <p>Rising drug development costs as well as low success rates for drug approvals have led to interest in exploring new approaches in drug development. During this period, advances in statistical methodology and analyses have led to interest in using adaptive trial designs for clinical studies, particularly in oncological development.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0092861512441391">13</xref>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0092861512441391"/>

               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0092861512441391"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0092861512441391">18</xref>
            </sup> This interest in designing a trial with adaptive features so that changes in design or analysis plan can be guided by analyzing the data accumulated during an interim analysis could potentially lead to higher probability of clinical success, more flexibility in trial design, and cost savings in drug development programs. Such an approach could potentially make the trials more efficient, more likely to show an effect of the drug, and/or more informative.   </p>
         <p>The US regulatory environment also changed when on July 1, 2005, the FDA elevated the status of the oncological review group, establishing a new Office of Oncology Drug Products (OODP) within its Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) with dedicated resources and authority to approve oncological drugs and biologics.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0092861512441391">19</xref>
            </sup> There has been no comprehensive review previously published on analysis of the OODP impact on regulatory metrics or FDA review efficiency for an extended period. In addition, there have been safety concerns with nononcology drugs such as rofecoxib (Vioxx, Merck, Whitehouse Station, New Jersey), rosiglitazone (Avandia, GlaxoSmithKline, London, United Kingdom), and sibutramine (Meridia, Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, Illinois) focusing additional public attention on the safety of approved medications in the US.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0092861512441391">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0092861512441391">21</xref>
            </sup> While oncological pharmaceuticals differ from other therapies, increased public scrutiny may also apply to oncology therapeutics.        </p>
         <p>Finally, there is an often stated belief that smaller biotechnology companies (biotechs) are more agile and innovative than more established pharmaceutical companies (pharmas).<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0092861512441391">22</xref>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0092861512441391"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0092861512441391">24</xref>
            </sup>  Many biotechs were founded during this period with many devoted to oncological product development.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0092861512441391">25</xref>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0092861512441391"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0092861512441391">27</xref>
            </sup> Did this proliferation of biotechs result in more oncology approvals?   These questions formed the basis for our review of US oncological approvals over the past 13 years to explore emerging trends and patterns, with particular focus on assessing whether the establishment of the OODP impacted regulatory metrics or review efficiency. For our analysis, we reviewed the past 13 years (6.5 years before and after the establishment of the OODP) of experience in US oncological approvals based upon examination of public information to assist oncological investigators and regulatory personnel in program planning for future pharmaceutical development and to enhance clinicians’ understanding about the current environment leading to approval of these therapies. Because oncology is an area with a huge unmet need, such approval metrics have enormous clinical and financial impact. The lessons learned from our review and analyses can certainly aid in enhanced clinical development strategy for the readers.</p>

            </sup> For data verification, additional commercial sources such as CenterWatch.com and other pharmaceutical publications such as the Pink Sheet were utilized.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0092861512441391">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0092861512441391">33</xref>
            </sup> In the case of discrepancies, FDA data were prioritized.   </p>
         <p>Many oncology care–related products were approved over this review period. To enhance the focus and manageability of our review, only new molecular entities (NMEs) for first approved therapeutic indications in a malignancy were included. Formulation changes or approvals of additional dosing ranges were excluded. Because there are differences in the nature of the applications and in the urgency of medical need, subsequent indications (line extensions) were also excluded. (Data required and submitted as well as the review and evaluation of a supplemental new drug application [sNDA] or biologics license application [sBLA] differ from a first approval.)  In addition, because the primary focus of this review is for therapeutic indications, supportive care approvals (mainly analgesics, antiemetics, growth factors, stem cell stimulants), agents for imaging or other diagnostic purposes, or preventive therapies (cancer vaccines or prophylactic care for future cancers) were excluded. Radioimmunotherapy, phototherapy, and cell therapy were also excluded due to significant differences from conventional agents. The single exception to these criteria was the inclusion of lenalidomide (Revlimid, Celgene, Summit, New Jersey). This commonly prescribed agent was first approved for myelodysplastic syndromes in December 2005 using an endpoint of reduced blood transfusion but was thereafter quickly approved (as accelerated approval) for multiple myeloma in June 2006 on the basis of favorable interim results of 2 randomized phase III trials. The myeloma approval was added to our current review. </p>
         <p>Thus, all NME oncological agents approved by the FDA for the first time with a therapeutic intent (plus lenalidomide for multiple myeloma) within the past 13 years (January 1, 1999 to December 31, 2011) were included. Approved agents were evaluated for product characteristics (class of drugs, mechanism of action, route of administration), indication approved (solid vs hematological malignancies, type of tumors, line of therapy), regulatory metrics (review time, orphan designation, priority vs standard review, accelerated approval, number of pivotal trials submitted), and clinical design (phase of study, sample size, randomization, comparator, blinding, primary endpoints) leading to approval. Patterns and trends were examined, and statistical comparisons (Fisher exact test) were employed wherever applicable (StatXact 8 Software, Cytel, Cambridge, Massachusetts). The review time frame was further divided into equal halves (6.5 years each) and designated as pre-OODP (January 1999 to June 2005) and post-OODP periods (July 2005 to December 2011). Regulatory metrics (number of approvals per year, types and classes of drugs approved, types of review employed, and the median review time for approval) before and after the establishment of OODP were analyzed and compared. Of note, many of the approved products carried specific FDA labeling restrictions. Consistent with the objective of this review, only broad classifications of use are referenced.   </p>
         <p>Two additional analyses were conducted. First, a comparison is provided for approved NME agents from established pharmas or from biotechs to assess which entity secured more approvals and whether biotechs significantly contributed to an increase in approvals, if any. However, many interactions between companies occur before, during, or after an approval that might confuse the identity of major developer(s) of the approved products. For the purpose of this review, any merger, acquisition, or collaboration that took place either right before or after an approval was disregarded. In other words, only the original sponsor or a collaboration/acquisition occurring long before the approval was attributed. Second, we provide an analysis of the time of year for submissions and approvals to determine whether there was preferential timing. Besides the month, the quarter where most submissions or approvals occurred was attributed.   </p>

            <title>Approval Metrics</title>
            <p>There were a total of 47 NME oncological approvals identified from 1999 to 2011. The number of new agents approved each year ranged from 2 to 7 (median, 3.0). Among these approvals, small molecule targeted agents were the most common with 38% (n = 18), followed by conventional cytotoxics with 28% (n = 13), monoclonal antibodies with 17% (n = 8), hormonal agents with 13% (n = 6), and miscellaneous agents with 4% (n = 2). Among the 18 targeted agents approved, the majority were kinase inhibitors (n = 13), with HDAC inhibitors (n = 2), mTOR inhibitors (n = 2), and a proteasome inhibitor (n = 1).    </p>
            <p>The most common therapeutics approved for solid tumors were for the treatment of breast (n = 6), prostate (n = 5), renal cell carcinoma (n = 5), colorectal (n = 4), and non–small cell lung (n = 3) cancers. The most common therapeutics for hematological malignancies were for lymphoma (n = 6), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (n = 3), and chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) (n = 3). All approvals were for only one indication except in 3 instances: sunitinib was approved for both gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) and renal cell carcinoma (RCC); nelarabine was approved for both T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma and T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL); and brentuximib-vedotin was approved for both anaplastic large cell lymphoma and Hodgkin lymphoma. Most approvals were for second or later lines of treatment (64%) in either relapsed or refractory malignancies, while first-line treatment represented slightly more than one third (36%). Parenteral administration (IV, IM, and SQ) was most common (62%), with oral (38%) administration less common.   </p>
            <p>Most submissions were designated for priority review (77%), with standard regulatory review comprising less than one quarter (23%) of all applications. Orphan designations were quite common (43%), and 34% of the submissions were accelerated approvals. The median review time for all products was 6.0 months (range, 2.4-15.0 months). Analysis by review status revealed that the median review time was 6.0 months (range, 2.4-15.0 months) for the 36 priority reviews and 10.0 months (range, 5.6-13.0 months) for the 11 standard reviews. Median review time was also 6.0 months (range, 2.4-13.0 months) for either the 16 accelerated approvals or the 20 orphan-designated agents. These times were also comparatively analyzed by the pre- and post-OODP periods. Review times were consistent with general Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) guidelines of 6 to 10 months for the NDA or BLA review clock. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0092861512441391">Table 1</xref> summarizes these findings.</p>

            <title>Data Leading to Approvals and Clinical Trial Design</title>
            <p>The numbers of pivotal studies submitted for approval for each NDA or BLA submission ranged from 1 to 4 (median, 1.0). While the FDA generally requires adequate and well-controlled trials for approval of an NME, the majority of these approvals (73%) commonly relied upon a single pivotal study. Although other supportive studies may have been submitted, they were usually not in an identical patient population and were often characterized as smaller studies and/or not well controlled. Randomized trials were most often utilized for solid tumor approvals, while single-arm phase II studies predominated for hematological malignancies. Most trials were designed as open-label studies. Placebo controls (19%) were uncommon, and blinding (24%) was seldom employed. A detailed examination of the trial design in these 50 approvals (47 agents, 3 with 2 approved indications) by solid versus hematological malignancies revealed some interesting patterns.</p>

            <title>Solid Tumors</title>
            <p>There were 29 approvals for solid tumors in 28 agents during this period (sunitinib had 2 approvals). Except for 4 approvals with single-arm phase II studies, all of these regulatory submissions were comprised of randomized phase II (n = 1) or phase III trials (n = 24). Among the randomized trials reviewed, sample sizes ranged from 216 to 1195 (median, 610). The majority of designs were multinational, multicenter, relatively large studies against an established standard of care. The most common randomization scheme was 1-to-1 (or 1-to-1-to-1 for 3 arms), but 7 studies used a 2-to-1 design, and 1 study used a 3-to-1-to-1 design. Placebo was used as a control in 7 trials and best supportive care (BSC) in 1 trial, and others used standard of care (SOC) therapy. For studies where a comparator was used, the most common design was head-to-head (A vs B), add-on (A vs A + B), or 3-arm parallel (A vs B vs A + B).   </p>
            <p>Overall survival (OS), the gold standard among efficacy endpoints in oncology, was used most commonly (n = 10) as the primary endpoint for approval, while progression-free survival (PFS) followed closely in frequency (n = 7).   One other case was for adjuvant use, and relapsed-free survival was used as the coprimary endpoint with OS. Time to progression (TTP) served as the primary endpoint in 6 instances, although in 4 of these cases, overall response rate (ORR) was a coprimary endpoint. ORR was used often together with duration of response (DOR) to define durable response as the primary endpoint. However, most often, response rate (even with TTP) was associated with submissions resulting in accelerated approval. Chemical castrate rate was used as an endpoint for hormonal agents in prostate cancer (n = 3). <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0092861512441391">Table 2</xref> summarizes these findings.</p>

            <title>Hematological Malignancies</title>
            <p>There were 21 approvals in hematological malignancies with 19 agents during this period (both nelarabine and brentuximib-vedotin had 2 approvals, respectively). Unlike the solid tumors, except in a few cases where a randomized phase III trial was utilized, the majority of all other submissions involved clinical data from nonrandomized, single-arm phase II studies as the basis for approval. There were 5 approvals with 6 randomized studies conducted (ie, against SOC [n = 2], BSC [n = 2], and placebo [n = 2]). Except for one trial that employed 2-to-1 randomization, most trials utilized a 1-to-1 design. About half (48%) of these approvals were accelerated, which means that additional large-scale confirmatory studies are required by the FDA prior to full approval. Response rate was the most common criteria for approval except in CML, where major hematological responses and major cytogenetic responses were measured. For AML and ALL, the approved agents employed complete response rate and/or complete response without full hematological recovery as endpoints for regulatory approval. OS, PFS, and TTP were used in one case each (sometimes as an additional endpoint), but the use of survival endpoints was generally rare for hematological malignancies. Of note is that a new approval was in myelofibrosis, where the percentage of patients achieving 35% or more reduction in splenomegaly was used as the primary endpoint. As most of these were single-arm phase II studies with relatively smaller sample sizes, most submissions involved more than one study (median, 2.0; range, 1-4). Sample sizes ranged from 24 to 532 (median, 99). <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0092861512441391">Table 3</xref> summarizes these findings.</p>

            <title>Establishment of the OODP</title>
            <p>The OODP of the FDA was established in July 2005, at a higher agency level (office) than its predecessor (division) to facilitate dedicated review of oncological agents. In our review time frame, there were 19 NME oncology drugs approved before the OODP was established and 28 drugs approved afterward during the equal (6.5) years in each comparative period. Adjusted on an annual basis, first-time NME oncological agent approvals were higher in the period following the creation of the OODP than before (4.3/year vs 2.9/year). About two thirds of the approvals (64%) were for targeted drugs or monoclonal antibodies in the post-OODP period, while the distribution was more balanced in the pre-OODP period with cytotoxics representing 32%.   </p>
            <p>For the pre-OODP period, drugs for solid tumors represented approximately two thirds of all approvals, while hematological malignancies represented roughly one third (63% vs 37%). For the post-OODP period, this was more balanced, although solid tumor approvals were still greater than for hematological malignancies (55% vs 45%). The type of submissions in the pre- versus post-OODP periods varied by fewer orphan designations (53% vs 36%) and accelerated approvals (37% vs 32%), respectively.</p>
            <p>Median review times were numerically slightly shorter in the post-OODP period for standard reviews and orphan drug reviews. As expected, standard review times were generally longer than priority reviews (11.2 vs 6.0 months) in the pre-OODP period, but the difference narrowed (9.8 vs 6.0 months) in the post-OODP period. Orphan-designated agents appeared to have a slightly shorter median review time in the post- versus the pre-OODP period (6.0 vs 6.3 months), although exactly the same numerically for accelerated approvals in both periods (6.0 vs 6.0 months). Due to relatively small sample sizes and large variances, none of these differences were statistically significant (Fisher exact test). However, the annualized numbers of reviews and review times appeared to trend towards improvements in the post-OODP period. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0092861512441391">Table 4</xref> summarizes these findings.</p>

            <p>A high percentage of the approved products (29/47, 62%) were developed by established pharmas, with a few (5/47, 10%) from pharma-biotech collaborations, and less than one third (13/47, 28%) of the approvals were directly from biotechs. Of note is that 3 of the approvals from pharmas were from a late-stage acquisition of a biotech by the pharma when the approved product was either during or right before the execution of the registration trial.</p>
            <p>Among established pharmas, Bristol-Myers Squibb, GlaxoSmithKline, and Novartis all had 4 drugs approved, although 1 approval from each for all 3 companies was in collaboration with a biotech. No dominant biotech was noted.

March (17%) and December (21%) submissions represented the single highest months. There were no NDA/BLA submissions in May throughout the entire 13-year period reviewed. Consequently, FDA approvals occurred most often during the second and fourth quarters of the year (both at 32%), with May (17%) as the single highest month, followed closely by October (15%). The slowest months of the year for approvals were July (none) and January (single approval) throughout the entire 13-year period. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0092861512441391">Figure 2</xref> illustrates these findings.</p>

         <title>Discussion</title>
         <p>Regulatory science is a constantly evolving field that is affected by many factors. In addition to advances in medical science, clinical design, and statistical evaluation, regulators must weigh public interest when critically evaluating breakthrough drugs for treating cancer against standards based on current medical practice and regulatory policy. Public interest often focuses on the concept of “right to access,” sometimes based on publicity surrounding promising new therapies. On the other hand, concerns over general safety and long-term side effects from major drug withdrawals may alarm the public and result in greater demand for more safety data prior to approval. In addition to the merits of the science in the regulatory application itself, these 2 balancing forces also shape the demand for approvals of new drug and biologic products. This article describes how differing strategies have historically impacted the probability of oncological regulatory “success” to better inform drug development scientists.</p>
         <p>The past few decades heralded the breakthrough of molecular target therapeutics, and one might have predicted these new agents to prevail among recent approvals. We found this was true for the majority (55%) of approvals, and more than two thirds of these were targeted agents with slightly less than one third as monoclonal antibodies. Nonetheless, conventional cytotoxics and hormonal agents also accounted for 41% of all approvals. Furthermore, in the 13 years covered by this review, agents approved were not as varied as expected. Among the 18 targeted agents approved, the majority (n = 13) were kinase inhibitors, with the remainder as HDAC inhibitors (n = 2), mTOR inhibitors (n = 2), and a proteasome inhibitor (n = 1). Even among the novel agents, drugs against the same molecular target(s) reached the market quickly after first-in-class product approvals. For example, imatinib and erlotinib are both tyrosine kinase inhibitors against bcr-Abl and EGFR, respectively. Imatinib was quickly followed by dasatinib and nilotinib. Cetuximab and panitumumab are similar antibodies against EGFR. Ofatumumab is very similar to rituximab in targeting the antigen CD-20. Consequently, numerous agents were approved against targets such as EGFR, VGEF, VEGFR, and Her-2.   </p>
         <p>Among our observations, one of the most interesting is the most recent 2011 regulatory approvals of vemurafenib and crizotinib. These pharmaceuticals were approved with a companion diagnostic test (BRAF V-6000 gene mutation for vemurafenib and ALK gene mutation for crizotinib, respectively). In 2009, the FDA also amended the labels for both cetuximab and panitumumab to be indicated only for colorectal cancer patients testing negative for the KRAS gene mutation.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0092861512441391">34</xref>
            </sup> This occurred after several studies showed that patients who underwent treatment with these EGFR antibodies had better responses and survival if they had KRAS wild-type tumors.<sup>

            </sup> This along with the widespread use of estrogen, progesterone, and HER-2 receptor testing in breast cancer therapy highlights a new era of personalized medicine.</p>
         <p>Biomarkers have been incorporated into oncology drug development for quite some time.<sup>

            </sup> It now seems that the FDA is signaling its willingness to work with industry to bring such programs forward. This requires no small effort for either the agency or the applicant because biomarkers are regulated by a different part of the agency (CDRH) than are drug and biologic therapeutics (CDER). In fact, there are now multiple oncology products in development that incorporate critical biomarker(s) with potential companion diagnostics as an integral part of development. Examples include cilengitide, neratinib, BIBW 2992, GSK 2118436, and GSK 1120212.<sup>

            </sup> Meanwhile, industry is working with Congress to update the Genomics and Personalized Medicine Act of 2007, trying to establish a more predictable regulatory path for personalized medicine products and reimbursement.<sup>

            </sup>
         </p>
         <p>With regard to approvals for specific tumor therapies, breast cancer was the most common solid tumor, and lymphoma was the most common hematological malignancy. However, after multiple agents are approved for the same tumor type, additional approvals for the same indication seem to slow, for several reasons: the market becomes crowded with similar agents, unmet needs no longer exist, or companies switch to novel drugs for other cancer indications if a lower market size is projected because they would lag behind a first approval and capture a smaller percentage of the market. Interestingly (also in 2011), there were new approvals for some relatively uncommon tumor types. Among the 7 approvals in 2011, 2 were for melanoma, 1 for myelofibrosis, and 1 for medullary thyroid cancer. All were indications where there was no or minimal existing therapies available. This highlights the shared interest of the FDA and industry to jointly address remaining unmet medical needs for unusual tumor types with few existing options.</p>
         <p>Besides the fact that a novel compound could represent a major advance in therapy, many sponsors also tend to focus their first indication in relapsed/refractory disease, hoping to secure earlier approvals. In fact, 64% of all approvals in this review are for second or later line uses. Such an approach would have the advantage of a priority review and (perhaps) shorter study duration (especially if OS is used as the primary endpoint) along with potentially lower development costs. This strategy is evidenced by the fact that 77% of all approvals were designated as priority review. The median review time of 6 months and the fact that 34% were accelerated approvals support this observation. However, it is possible that as more agents are approved for the same use, similar regulatory review priority designations could diminish for lagging submissions. For example, nilotinib, pazopanib, and romidepsin all received only regular review rather than priority.      </p>
         <p>The Code of Federal Regulations and ICH-E9 Guidelines specify the conditions under which trials are considered adequate and well controlled, confirming a positive benefit-risk ratio sufficient for new drug approval.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0092861512441391">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0092861512441391">43</xref>
            </sup> Most oncology submissions included other supportive data, but a single pivotal trial was usually relied upon even when the special situation of accelerated approval was excluded. Of course, factors such as unmet medical need, magnitude of effect size, and strength of other supportive data ultimately determine a regulatory approval decision.</p>
         <p>Among approvals, randomized trials were more common for solid tumors, while single-arm phase II studies were used most often for hematological malignancies. Most approvals for solid tumors utilized standard multicenter, randomized, 2-arm controlled trial designs. These designs were either a head-to-head (A vs B) or an add-on (A vs A + B) format. In the rare situation when a 3-arm design was used, a simple parallel comparison (A vs B vs A + B) was adopted. For hematological malignancy approvals, response rates are commonly used endpoints. Most of the studies conducted were medium-sized (&lt;100 patients) single-arm studies against a historical control. For solid tumor indications, while ORR/DOR and TTP were used in the earlier period, TTP was gradually replaced by PFS. TTP is defined as the time from randomization to the time of progressive disease, whereas PFS is defined as the time from randomization to objective tumor progression or death due to any cause. This is consistent with an agency statement in 2008: “Compared with TTP, PFS may be a preferred regulatory endpoint because it includes death and may correlate better with OS.”<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0092861512441391">44</xref> 
            </sup>
         </p>
         <p>Interestingly, while OS has long been viewed as the “gold standard” for oncology studies, it was not utilized as often as expected in trials supporting these regulatory approvals. Of the 9 approvals that used OS as primary or coprimary endpoints, the vast majority were not observed until after 2004. However, as more products were approved, the emphasis on OS increased. For example, more than half of approvals in the past 2 years (2010-2011) all employed OS as a primary or coprimary endpoint. OS is preferred by the FDA because “this endpoint is unambiguous and is not subject to investigator interpretation. Survival is a direct clinical benefit to patients, and assessment can be calculated to the day.”<sup>

            </sup> 
         </p>
         <p>Another trend over the past decade is advances in trial design and statistical analyses. Adaptive design is advocated by many people as an alternate approach for oncology studies supporting approval.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0092861512441391">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0092861512441391">47</xref>
            </sup> This interest stems from the belief that a trial can be designed with adaptive features (changes in design or analyses guided by evaluation of accumulated data at a prespecified interim) that may make the trials more efficient (fewer patients or shorter), more likely to demonstrate an effect of the intervention, and/or more informative (broader dose-response data).<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0092861512441391">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0092861512441391">49</xref>
            </sup> Adaptive design has the potential to change the sample size, endpoints, and enrollment pattern or to even drop “failed” arm(s). Critics point to concerns about the potential to increase operational bias and/or an inflated false-positive rate (type I error).<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0092861512441391">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0092861512441391">47</xref>
            </sup> Advocates of adaptive design maintain that it has a potentially higher chance of clinical success, flexibility, and thus possible cost savings for oncology drug development. Although the FDA developed a guidance<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0092861512441391">48</xref>
            </sup> and presented its deliberations at public meetings<sup>

            </sup> in 2010, acceptance of industry proposals for specific product development programs was not yet evidenced in the time frame of the approvals we reviewed. At present, the agency is encouraging sponsors to gain additional experience using these trial designs in an exploratory setting.     </p>
         <p>Most trials were designed for superiority, although for the hormonal agents in breast and prostate cancer, noninferiority designs were utilized in some cases. Randomization is usually 1-to-1 to maximize statistical power, but in 8 instances, a 2-to-1 randomization was used. The common reason for 2-to-1 randomization was to minimize exposure to placebo or control arms or to maximize exposure to the experimental agent, especially if insufficient safety information was available from other sources. However, 2-to-1 randomization results in a 10% to 15% loss of statistical power, and a larger sample size may be needed. Lastly, placebo controls are not commonly seen in oncology because placebo treatment is generally viewed as unethical for cancer patients. In addition, different routes of administration or toxicity profiles of some comparators also make controlling for placebo arms difficult in oncology trials.   </p>
         <p>Meanwhile, although the authors are aware of the increase in percentage of international subjects (especially from developing countries) in registration trials submitted to the FDA for approval in recent years primarily for industry driven considerations of cost-efficiency and speed-to-market, assessing its impact on US approvability proved to be difficult. First, the publications and medical officer reviews that we utilized as our source material generally did not provide a detailed breakdown of the source of study subjects unless enrollments were problematic or results were inconsistent. However, given the evolution of ICH guidelines, unless medical practice is obviously different, there are significant differences in the handling of adverse events, or a racial difference is demonstrated in the ADME of the study drug, FDA does not prohibit using international subjects in a US registration trial.</p>
         <p>While biotechs are generally considered to be more innovative than big pharmas, we noted there were more approvals from pharmas than from biotechs. One explanation is that a biotech may have discovered a novel therapy and licensed it out to a big pharma early during development.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0092861512441391">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0092861512441391">53</xref>
            </sup> However, for either big or small sponsors, innovations may be viewed as less than expected given that many of the agents covered in this review were follow-on products directed against the same molecular target or via a similar molecular mechanism to other first-in-class products.</p>
         <p>This report provides an overview of all therapeutic approvals in oncology over the past 13 years. To maintain focus, except for lenalidomide, subsequent indications, supportive care agents, cancer vaccines, preventive therapy, radioimmunotherapy, and cell therapy were excluded. While this report focuses only on successful approvals, there were undoubtedly many nonapprovals due to trial design deficiencies, safety issues, borderline efficacy, or manufacturing issues. Unfortunately, sufficient data regarding nonapproved drugs are not readily available, and sponsors may withdraw their submissions any time during the approval process. Otherwise, an analysis of such agents could also be informative.</p>
         <p>A 13-year span was chosen for this review because the agency established the OODP in July 2005. Such a review span allows designation of exactly 6.5 years for each half of our review before and after the OODP was established. A logical assumption was that in addition to the improvement in process and provision of consistency, the establishment of the OODP would result in more resources and thus faster and/or more approvals. While it does not reach statistical significance, we did observe positive trending with numerically more approvals (4.3/year vs 2.9/year) and slightly shorter review times in the post-OODP period, especially for standard reviews (9.8 vs 11.2 months). However, we acknowledge that the observed differences in regulatory metrics cannot be attributed totally to FDA changes in process alone. The number of applications awaiting approval during any time period, including the timeframes that we examined in this report, could affect the number of approvals observed. Thus, besides changing regulations and streamlining of FDA processes, factors such as the publically perceived need for novel therapies, the interest and investment industry makes in the development of therapies for cancer, and the completeness of applications which are submitted to FDA for approval could also affect the outcomes observed.</p>
         <p>Interestingly, in the post-OODP period, there were also numerically fewer orphan designations (53% vs 36%) and accelerated approvals (37% vs 32%). Again, these metrics may reflect factors other than FDA improvements, including fewer requests by industry for orphan designations and a lessening need for accelerated approvals when there are existing therapies for a condition. In order to facilitate regulatory review and to get lifesaving therapies to market quickly, there are numerous FDA-defined pathways elucidated in 21 CFR under Subparts E and H, priority reviews established under FDAMA, and the fast-track review process outlined by FDA guidance. We did not, however, attempt in-depth analyses of a specific regulatory mechanism for either solid tumors or hematological malignancies. For example, although it is true that we observed a trend toward fewer accelerated approvals in the post-OODP period than before, we were not privy to FDA's decision making process for each accelerated approval designation or when and whether they reversed earlier negative decisions based upon emerging data.</p>
         <p>One limitation of our review is that our data sources were restricted to information available in the public domain. Additional data and other considerations that we may not have access to may have affected product approval decisions. Specifically, there may have been issues concerning data deficiencies or data quality in some submissions that prevented approval actions or may have affected approval decisions. These issues would be better addressed by FDA scientific regulators. In addition, because approved versus unapproved applications was not central to our analyses, we did not undertake a complete review of the advisory committee records which could shed light upon key factors that may have impacted approvals versus nonapprovals in the time cohorts that we studied. Nevertheless, future examination of ODAC transcripts (both for applications eventually approved and for those which were not) would supplement our analyses, particularly as ODAC discussions may impact the decision making process of FDA oncology reviewers and decision makers.</p>
         <p>Our analyses identified many findings of interest to oncologists, researchers, and regulatory personnel. We believe 4 were of most importance: that is, approval of targeted agents with companion diagnostics, approval of agents for tumor types with limited therapeutic options, (apparently) enhanced efficiency of the FDA regulatory approval process following establishment of the OODP, and lack of utilization of adaptive trial design elements because these designs have not yet been adopted fully by sponsors and/or embraced by the FDA for registration trials.</p>
         <p>One of our most significant observations is the evidence of cooperative effort between the FDA and industry, culminating in the successful approval of targeted pharmaceuticals and companion diagnostics and labeling changes that rely upon biomarker status for existing products. This clearly bolsters the trend over several decades towards personalized medicine in clinical oncology, thereby enhancing responses and reducing side effects for approved therapeutics. Over our review time frame, fewer cytotoxic agents and more targeted agents were approved. Of NME approvals, 55% were for targeted agents or monoclonal antibodies, and 2 approvals in 2011 were accompanied by companion diagnostics. The most important takeaway message for those in oncological pharmaceutical development is that companies have successfully pursued novel targets and integrated biomarker and companion diagnostics in their programs and that the FDA appears to be increasingly supportive of getting these new personalized therapies to market. Because the regulation of these diagnostics and therapeutics is executed in different parts of the agency, the development of companion diagnostics also requires superb coordination by applicants. These same predictive or prognostic biomarkers may be used now or in the future to enable oncologists to follow disease progression and/or recurrence.</p>
         <p>Similarly in 2011, there were new approvals for melanoma, medullary thyroid cancer, and myelofibrosis, highlighting the shared interest between industry and the FDA to address remaining unmet medical needs for less common tumor types with few (or inferior) treatment options. In addition and while not included in our review (due to being line extension indications), there are other examples supporting this view. Besides earlier approvals in RCC, GIST, mesothelioma, and multiple myeloma, there were several approvals in recent years for tumor types requiring improved options. For example, trastuzumab was approved for gastric cancer (2010), bevacizumab for glioblastoma (2010), and everolimus/sunitinib for pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (2011).<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0092861512441391">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0092861512441391">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0092861512441391">32</xref>
            </sup>
         </p>
         <p>Even so, most NME approvals during the time frame we examined involved major tumor types and were not for first-line use. Randomized trials were submitted for most solid tumor approvals, with PFS and OS as the most commonly used primary endpoints. We noted that OS is preferred by the FDA and that after initial agents are approved for an unmet need, OS is most often used in subsequent approvals for that indication. On the other hand, single-arm phase II studies led to most approvals for hematological malignancies, and various forms of response rate were employed, possibly due to the nature of these tumors, high unmet need, and perhaps even a lower prevalence that makes conducting large-scale, randomized phase III studies potentially more difficult. Of note is that single-arm phase II studies are uncommonly accepted by the FDA as sufficient evidence of adequate and well-controlled trials for most therapies in other therapeutic areas.</p>
         <p>While there has been industry interest in adaptive design for oncology studies, it was not fully employed by sponsors or accepted by the FDA for these approvals. The FDA, however, has addressed its concerns with adaptive trial design features by publishing “Guidance for Industry: Adaptive Design Clinical Trials for Drugs and Biologics” in February 2010 and in several public presentations the same year, explaining its expectation for using adaptive design in future pivotal trials. We view this as positive dialogue and believe that industry and the FDA will continue to negotiate a pathway forward for acceptable adaptive trial designs (and/or features) of pivotal studies in the near future.</p>
         <p>Trending is towards fewer accelerated approvals, but the FDA’s formation of an office to provide efficient and consistent reviews should standardize processes and assist regulatory determinations. In the post-OODP era, we observed a greater number of approvals, higher annualized approval rates, and trending towards faster reviews for both standard and orphan-designated products. These improvements in approvals for the OODP were seen in the face of an ongoing workload for all the other therapies we excluded from our review, unapproved products that require the same review process and work effort, and requirements for ongoing monitoring of already approved products (primarily for emerging safety concerns).</p>

         <title>Conclusions</title>
         <p>Recent FDA approvals of NME oncological pharmaceuticals support the long-term trends towards personalized medicine in oncology care. In 2011, 2 targeted agents along with companion diagnostics were approved together for the first time. This cooperative effort between industry and the FDA, assisted by the organizational changes announced by the FDA, has led to more priority approvals and to novel treatments for less common tumors. Greater regulatory efficiencies were observed in trending towards shorter review times for orphan novel therapies as well as for standard reviews. Established pharmas appear to follow through and achieve marketing for a greater number of products than smaller biotechs, although cooperative efforts were sometimes also successful. While there has been interest in adaptive design and some progress in discussions with the FDA, it was not yet successfully utilized for any of the pivotal trials for approvals in our current cohort.</p>
