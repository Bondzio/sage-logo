                    <p>To apply crime-specific models based on differing potential offender pools
                        and opportunity structures to temporary and permanent motor vehicle theft

                    <p>Using 310 U.S. cities with 50,000 or more residents, the current study
                        developed and examined crime-specific multivariate models for temporary and
                        permanent MVT rates. To evaluate the distinctiveness of crime-specific
                        variables’ associations with each MVT type, the study also predicted
                        each MVT rate via measures theoretically specific to the other.</p>
                </sec>
                <sec>
                    <title>Results:</title>
                    <p>Among temporary-specific variables, young male population and the percentage
                        of households without a vehicle were positively associated with temporary
                        MVT. Permanent-specific measures of adult male property offender pool size,
                        percentage of households with high disposable income, unemployment,
                        U.S.-Mexico border proximity, and auto-related businesses were associated
                        with permanent MVT (though in an unexpected direction for disposable
                        income). Some variables were associated with both types of MVT, but
                        young male population was uniquely associated with temporary MVT while
                        unemployment rate, distance to U.S.-Mexico border and number of auto-related
                        businesses were specific to permanent MVT.</p>

                <sec>
                    <title>Conclusions:</title>
                    <p>Findings suggest that specific prevention approaches are needed for each type
                        of MVT. Shortcomings of the research include potential misclassification of
                        temporary and permanent MVT and lack of some potentially important
                        opportunity variables.</p>

            <title>Introduction</title>
            <p>Analysis of a measure that combines different crime types involves, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0022427812453143">Copes
                (1999</xref>) suggests, an implicit assumption of common causes for
                those different crime types. However, opportunity-based theories argue that each
                type of crime has a different opportunity structure, and encourage researchers to
                undertake crime-specific analyses in which different factors are posited to
                influence measures of different crime types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0022427812453143">Felson and Clarke 1998</xref>). Motor
                vehicle theft (MVT) is one specific legal category of crime that has
                been studied through this opportunity-based perspective. Still, opportunity-based
                analysis of MVT may require even greater specificity, because MVT can be categorized
                into two quite different types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0022427812453143">Felson and Clarke 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0022427812453143">Maxfield 2004</xref>).
                Some MVTs are committed for temporary and nonprofit-oriented personal needs,
                including joyriding and short-term transportation. Others are committed for
                permanent retention purposes, including resale, export, or dismantling for spare
                parts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0022427812453143">Clarke and Harris
                    1992a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0022427812453143">1992b</xref>;
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0022427812453143">Copes and Tewksbury
                    2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0022427812453143">Felson and
                    Clarke 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0022427812453143">McCaghy,
                    Giordano, and Henson 1977</xref>). These differences suggest that
                temporary and permanent MVT may have different potential offender pools, targets,
                settings, and opportunity structures. If so, a crime-specific approach may be needed
                to explain the rates of these two types of MVT, with different opportunity-based
                explanations employed for temporary and permanent MVT. But to date researchers have,
                with relatively few exceptions, generally treated MVT as a monolithic crime type,
                using the same set of explanatory factors to explain all kinds of MVT incidents
                (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0022427812453143">Copes
                1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0022427812453143">Potchak, McGloin,
                    and Zgoba 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0022427812453143">Rice
                    and Smith 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0022427812453143">Saville and Murdie 1988</xref>).</p>
            <p>The current study develops and tests crime-specific models for temporary and
                permanent MVT in the United States, using city-level data on rates of recovered and
                unrecovered thefts per 100,000 vehicles constructed from the Uniform Crime
                Reports’ (UCR) “Property Stolen and Recovered”
                file. The current study also explores the distinctiveness of crime-specific
                variables’ associations with each type of MVT. This crime-specific focus is
                especially important when formulating effective and appropriate prevention
                strategies for different types of MVT (Cornish and Clarke 1986).</p>
            <sec id="section2-0022427812453143">
                <title>Opportunity Theories and Crime-Specific Approach</title>
                <p>The crime-specific approach draws on ideas of opportunity structures embedded in
                    immediate situational surroundings that are crucial to opportunity theories
                        (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0022427812453143">Felson and
                        Clarke 1998</xref>). The routine activities approach, one of the
                    most popular opportunity theories, argues that differences in crime rates across
                    time and space result from differences in the supply of likely offenders,
                    suitable targets, and capable guardians. In practice, this approach has
                    emphasized the latter two factors, while simply assuming a constant flow of
                    likely offenders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0022427812453143">Cohen and Felson 1979</xref>). However, other researchers have
                    argued that there is variation in the presence of likely offenders across
                    different times and areas and that this will result in variable risk of crime
                    victimization even when holding constant levels of target attractiveness and
                    guardianship (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0022427812453143">Bennett 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0022427812453143">Miethe and Meier 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0022427812453143">Rice and Smith 2002</xref>). The
                    rational choice perspective, another popular opportunity theory, attempts to
                    explain “how the offender makes crime choices, driven by a particular
                    motive within a specific setting, which offers the opportunities to satisfy that
                    motive” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0022427812453143">Felson and Clarke 1998</xref>:7; see also Cornish and Clarke 1986).
                    Together the routine activities approach and rational-choice perspective seek to
                    explain how macro-level opportunity structure shapes an offender’s
                    decision making and leads to a particular type of crime (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0022427812453143">Felson and Clarke
                    1998</xref>).</p>
                <p>In contrast to traditional theories’ lack of emphasis on the specific
                    forms of crime, opportunity-based theories recognize that different opportunity
                    structures exist for different types of crime, and call for the development of
                    crime-specific models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0022427812453143">Clarke and Felson 2008</xref>).
                    Opportunity theorists further believe that different opportunity structures can
                    apply to incidents falling under the same legal offense definition. According to
                        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0022427812453143">Felson and Clarke
                        (1998</xref>:14), “In general, the opportunity for
                    crime must be evaluated for very specific categories of offense.” As an
                    example, they noted that, from the perspective of opportunity theory, robbery is
                    not one crime but many, depending on the setting and type of victim, and that
                    even finer differentiation will often be required by the theory. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0022427812453143">Felson and Clarke
                        (1998</xref>:14) acknowledged that “some opportunity
                    principles may fit all crimes. But even these need to be applied taking into
                    account the specific crime setting and modus operandi.” Furthermore, a
                    potential offender’s characteristics and life circumstances influence how
                    he or she perceives (and/or responds to) criminal opportunity
                    structure, and hence also influence the particular crime committed by that
                    offender (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0022427812453143">McGloin et
                        al. 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0022427812453143">Wright,
                        Pratt, and DeLisi 2008</xref>). This suggests that different
                    potential offender pools exist for different crimes, even within the same legal
                    offense category (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0022427812453143">Thomas, Dichter, and Matejkowski
                    2011</xref>).</p>
                <p>The concept of different opportunity structures and potential offender pools
                    within a legal crime category is important for understanding MVT. Temporary
                    thefts are intended to satisfy temporary personal needs such as entertainment,
                    short-term transportation, or means to commit other offenses. Permanent thefts
                    are committed for purposes of resale, export, or dismantling for spare parts
                        (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0022427812453143">Clarke and
                        Harris 1992a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0022427812453143">1992b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0022427812453143">Copes and

                    MVT offenders are predominantly male (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0022427812453143">Arizona Criminal Justice Commission

                    commonly available American models, while exotic models such as Porsches were
                    less often stolen by temporary MVT offenders. On the other hand, permanent MVT
                    offenders’ pursuit of financial gain requires that they consider illegal
                    market demand and profit potential when targeting vehicles for theft

                    expensive luxury cars, whose high price helps compensate for the costs and risks
                    associated with a complicated transaction and transportation process involving
                    many parties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0022427812453143">Tremblay et al. 2001</xref>). The <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0022427812453143">Highway Loss Data Institute’s

                    that the average loss per claim was much higher in counties near the U.S.-Mexico
                    border or with major ports (e.g., Miami-Dade), implying that
                    more expensive vehicles are targeted for illegal export. However, very expensive
                    and exotic cars are less desirable in local fencing markets: Affluent local
                    consumers generally do not search the used car market for bargains, and
                    attracting less affluent consumers with large discounts on luxury vehicles might
                    raise suspicion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0022427812453143">Tremblay et al. 2001</xref>). Instead, local fencing and auto parts
                    markets demand middle-range vehicles that are favored by typical consumers in
                    the used car or parts market (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0022427812453143">Tremblay et al. 2001</xref>). In any
                    case, permanent MVT offenders target relatively expensive vehicles, because
                    inexpensive vehicles are less attractive for both local and foreign black
                    markets. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0022427812453143">Clarke and Harris

                    MVT were inexpensive.</p>
                <p>In addition to differences in targets, temporary and permanent MVT stem from
                    different settings and opportunities. Because at least some temporary MVT is
                    committed to satisfy practical transportation needs, temporary MVT should
                    decrease as more juveniles gain access to a household vehicle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0022427812453143">Tremblay et al.

                    and explained that decreasing percentages of households without a vehicle
                    (i.e., increasing access to household vehicles) during 1963 to
                    1988 led to a decrease in temporary MVT.</p>
                <p>In contrast, permanent MVT is facilitated by demand from local and foreign black
                    markets. Poor economic conditions that make consumers, especially the
                    economically disadvantaged, more willing to buy stolen vehicles and parts may in
                    turn encourage local fencing markets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0022427812453143">Tremblay et al. 1994</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0022427812453143">2001</xref>). Also,
                    cars stolen in the United States constitute a substantial proportion of those
                    sold or traded in global black markets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0022427812453143">Miller 1987</xref>). Stolen cars can
                    be driven across international borders, transported in ferries, or shipped out
                    of ports in sealed containers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0022427812453143">Clarke and Brown 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0022427812453143">Miller 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0022427812453143">Resendiz 1998</xref>).

                    the state’s interior. Similarly, San Diego County’s southern
                    sections had a much lower recovery percentage than did its northern sections

                    decreased the likelihood of swift recovery.</p>
                <p>Permanent MVT often involves counterfeiting or dismantling for major parts before
                    sale in local and foreign black markets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0022427812453143">Tremblay et al. 1994</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0022427812453143">2001</xref>), and
                    requires appropriate premises for those activities. Although chopping for major
                    parts sometimes takes place in less formal settings such as residential garages,
                    counterfeiting and dismantling are conducted to a substantial extent in
                    otherwise legitimate auto repair establishments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0022427812453143">Mullins and Cherbonneau 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0022427812453143">Tremblay et al.
                    2001</xref>). Such establishments have the necessary equipment and a
                    continuing supply of legitimate targets for body switching, and it is hard for
                    the police and consumers to detect these illegal activities in the context of
                    legal businesses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0022427812453143">Tremblay et al. 2001</xref>). In a similar way, legitimate auto and
                    parts dealers can easily obscure sales of counterfeited vehicles and chopped
                    parts to unsuspecting consumers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0022427812453143">Brill 1982</xref>). Fierce competition
                    leads a relatively large proportion of legal auto businesses to engage in at
                    least some illegitimate transactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0022427812453143">Brill 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0022427812453143">Clarke and Brown 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0022427812453143">Tracy and Fox 1989</xref>;

            <title>Current Study</title>
            <p>The research findings discussed above suggest that temporary and permanent MVT differ
                in potential offender pools, targets, settings, and opportunities. While MVT
                offenders of all types tend to be male, the potential offender pool for temporary
                MVT includes inexperienced youths, as opposed to the older and experienced criminals
                who are likely offenders for permanent MVT. Temporary MVT offenders seem to steal
                whatever is readily and commonly available around them, whereas permanent MVT
                offenders’ goal of financial gain leads them to target the moderately to very
                expensive vehicles desired by illegal markets. Areas lacking in access to household
                vehicles may experience more temporary MVT, while poor local economic conditions and
                close proximity to foreign black markets provide opportunity for permanent MVT by
                increasing demand for stolen vehicles and parts. The presence of seemingly
                legitimate auto-related businesses may also encourage permanent MVT by supplying
                appropriate settings (and hiding places) for illicit activities.
                These possibilities suggest different explanatory factors for temporary and
                permanent MVT and call for the use of specific models for each MVT type.</p>
            <p>Instead of assuming a unified explanation for all types of MVT, the current study
                attempts to develop and test crime-specific models for temporary and permanent MVT
                in the United States. Most previous multivariate MVT research does not differentiate
                types of MVT, even when situated in opportunity-based theories (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0022427812453143">Copes 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0022427812453143">Potchak et al. 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0022427812453143">Rice and Smith 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0022427812453143">Saville and Murdie

                only permanent MVT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0022427812453143">Clarke and Brown 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0022427812453143">Field, Clarke, and Harris 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0022427812453143">Miller 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0022427812453143">Nunn 1993</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0022427812453143">1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0022427812453143">Plouffe and Sampson 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0022427812453143">Roberts 2012</xref>).</p>

                crime-specificity of these explanatory variables by predicting temporary MVT rates
                via measures that are theoretically specific to permanent MVT, and vice versa. Such
                analysis will indicate whether or not these crime-specific explanatory variables
                affect only the type of MVT with which they are theoretically linked, providing a
                richer understanding of these potential influences on MVT rates.</p>

                    Clearances by Arrest,” and “Arrest by Sex, Age and Race”
                    files, 2007 Law Enforcement Management and Administrative Statistics
                    (LEMAS) data, the 2007 Economic Census, and the 2006 to 2008
                    American Community Survey. To ensure comparability of data from these sources,
                    analysis was restricted to city jurisdictions with populations of 50,000 or more
                    that reported data to UCR for 12 months in 2008. Ten agencies, mostly in North
                    Carolina, reported zero MVT recovery for all 12 months. It is difficult to
                    believe that these cities with more than 50,000 residents and fairly many
                    (78 to 5,266) MVT incidents had no stolen vehicle recoveries for
                    an entire year, so we assume that such data are inaccurate, and therefore
                    excluded those 10 agencies.<sup>

                    reporting a number of <italic>recovered</italic> locally stolen vehicles that
                    exceeded the number of locally stolen vehicles. Reporting more recovered than
                    stolen vehicles might be possible in a single year, for example, if a large
                    number of vehicles were stolen at the end of one year and then recovered in the
                    early part of the next. However, it seems implausible that a jurisdiction could
                    have substantially more recoveries than stolen vehicles for two or more
                    consecutive years, because such a scenario would likely require a pattern of
                    very long recovery times for many stolen vehicles. Such a pattern would be
                    inconsistent with prior recovery research, which has shown that most vehicles
                    are recovered within a week, with recovery after a year almost unheard of

                    heavily on the thief’s purpose, as recovery will be more difficult when a
                    car was stolen for profit-directed permanent retention purposes. Some cars
                    stolen for profit are given a new and seemingly legitimate identity through

                    abandoned quickly and recovered (perhaps with damage).
                    Therefore, the rate of MVT in which the vehicle was not recovered should be a
                    reasonable approximation of the rate of permanent MVT, and a similar rate of MVT
                    with recovery should approximately correspond to the level of temporary MVT.<sup>

                    the reporting jurisdiction and recovered there or elsewhere. That is, in
                    measuring temporary MVT we included stolen vehicles that were recovered outside
                    of, as well as within, the originating jurisdiction. Because cars stolen for
                    temporary use purposes could quickly travel and be dumped in nearby
                    jurisdictions, omitting such incidents from the originating
                    jurisdiction’s temporary theft measure would be misleading. This would be
                    especially problematic in metro areas with many jurisdictions. By recording
                    recovered stolen vehicles for the originating jurisdiction, regardless of the
                    location of recovery, we can appropriately measure temporary theft activity in
                    each jurisdiction. As mentioned earlier, data on recovered and unrecovered
                    stolen vehicles were obtained from UCR’s “Property Stolen and
                    Recovered” file, with data from 2006 and 2008 averaged to adjust for
                    yearly fluctuations. The 2006 to 2008 American Community Survey provided

                        disproportionately young. Thus, the pool of likely offenders for temporary
                        MVT was measured as the percentage of the population that 15- to 17-year-old
                        males comprise. Because temporary MVT offenders tend to steal vehicles
                        commonly available near them, higher vehicle density should increase a
                        jurisdiction’s temporary MVT rate by providing such offenders with
                        more potential targets. Vehicle density was calculated as the number of
                        vehicles per square mile. Both of these measures drew on data from the 2006
                        to 2008 American Community Survey. We also included a measure of household
                        vehicle inaccessibility as another variable that is theoretically specific

                        workload probably means less flexibility to allocate manpower to detecting
                        and apprehending auto thieves, so that a greater workload indicates less
                        arrest risk. Information on police activities and the number of full-time
                        sworn officers were taken from 2007 LEMAS, and the number of index offenses
                        from 2007 UCR’s “Offenses Known and Clearances by
                        Arrest” file. <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-0022427812453143">Appendix A</xref> gives descriptive statistics for all variables.</p>

            <p>For the 310 cities used in the current analysis, mean MVT rates per 100,000 vehicles
                were 595.99 for temporary MVT and 313.96 for permanent MVT. The correlation between
                temporary and permanent MVT rates was .38 (<italic>p</italic> &lt;
                .001); the modest size of this correlation supports the use of
                crime-specific models. For the multivariate analyses, temporary and permanent MVT
                rates were logged to reduce the skewness of their distributions, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0022427812453143">White’s

                heteroscedasticity. Variance inflation factor scores were less than 4 in all models
                and indicated no substantial multicollinearity problems among the independent
                variables for all models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0022427812453143">Menard 1995</xref>). In reporting the
                results, we first discuss separate models specifically developed for temporary and
                permanent MVT. Each of those models includes only the opportunity factors
                theoretically associated with the specific MVT type. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0022427812453143">Table 1</xref> shows these results for temporary-
                (model 1) and permanent- (model 3) specific models.
                Second, we report on models that examined the distinctiveness of crime-specific
                variables’ impacts by applying all explanatory variables theoretically linked
                to <italic>either</italic> type of MVT. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0022427812453143">Table 1</xref> also gives the results for this

                    associated with a substantial increase in the estimated temporary MVT rate. A
                    one-half percent increase in the young male population corresponded to an almost
                    30 percent increase in the predicted temporary MVT rate.<sup>

                    the arrest risk variables, police MVT initiatives and workload had positive
                    effects on temporary MVT rates. Police initiatives appear important: The
                    presence of a specialized auto theft unit was associated with 27 percent higher
                    temporary MVT rates, while the use of stolen vehicle tracking system and license
                    plate reader were associated with 36 percent and 20 percent higher rates,
                    respectively. (The unexpected positive associations between police
                    initiatives and temporary MVT are discussed in the conclusion.) For
                    workload, the temporary MVT rate was estimated to increase by approximately 30
                    percent when the number of index crimes per officer increased by 5.</p>

                    (for permanent MVT, adult male property offenders) was
                    associated with permanent MVT rates in the expected direction. Estimates
                    indicated that as the adult male property offender pool increases by 1 per 1,000

                    establishments was also expected to be positively associated with permanent MVT,
                    due to these establishments’ link with fencing operations, and it appears
                    to be an important factor: Each additional auto/parts dealer or repair
                    establishment per 1,000 vehicles was associated with an estimated 15 percent
                    increase in the permanent MVT rate. The proportion of households with
                    substantial disposable income had an unexpectedly negative effect: A 5 percent
                    addition to the proportion of households with high disposable income contributed

                    MVT in the direction expected by classical deterrence theory. The permanent MVT

                    unemployment, distance to foreign outlets, and auto-related businesses)

                    improvement was statistically significant (<italic>p</italic> &lt;
                    .001). Among the added permanent-specific opportunity variables,
                    measures of adult male property offenders and households with high disposable
                    income were related to temporary MVT rates in the same directions as in the
                    permanent MVT specific model (model 3). An increase of one adult
                    male property offender per 1,000 population was estimated to increase the
                    temporary MVT rate by 8 percent, while a 5 percent increase in the proportion of
                    high disposable income households was associated with an estimated 19 percent
                    reduction in temporary MVT. Unemployment rate, distance to U.S.-Mexico border,
                    and the number of auto-related businesses were associated with permanent but not
                    temporary MVT, suggesting that those factors are indeed specific to permanent
                    MVT. (Note that the auto-related business measure was no longer
                    associated with permanent MVT when temporary-specific variables were introduced
                    in model 4 below.) When permanent-specific variables were included, the
                    hypothesized effects of vehicle density and MVT clearance rate became apparent.
                    The effects of other temporary-specific variables did not change (in
                    terms of statistical significance and sign) from the specific
                    (model 1) to the combined (model 2) model for
                    temporary MVT.</p>
                <p>In the same way, temporary MVT-related variables (males aged 15 to 17,
                    vehicle density, and households with no vehicle) were added to the model
                    for permanent MVT rates. Results of the combined opportunity model for permanent
                    MVT (model 4) are shown in column 4 of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0022427812453143">Table 1</xref>. The increase in<italic>

                    Among the added temporary-specific opportunity variables, only the percentage of
                    households without a car affected permanent MVT rates in the direction expected
                    for temporary MVT. For each additional 1 percent of households without a
                    vehicle, the permanent MVT rate was estimated to increase by 3 percent. Vehicle
                    density, which was intended to measure the presence of attractive temporary MVT
                    targets, also had an effect on permanent MVT, but in the unexpected negative
                    direction. Young male population was positively associated with temporary, but
                    not permanent, MVT rates, so that this variable appears specific to temporary
                    MVT. Note that when including these temporary-specific variables, significance
                    and signs of the permanent-specific variables’ coefficients remained as
                    in model 3, except that effects of the measures of high disposable income

            <p>In our crime-specific models for temporary and permanent MVT in the United States,
                effects of many theoretically crime-specific variables were as expected. The
                positive association between temporary MVT rates and the size of the juvenile male
                population fits with the typical profile of joyriders as young and inexperienced

                1994</xref>). Lack of access to a household vehicle was also positively
                associated with temporary MVT rates. Temporary theft rates were expected to increase
                with greater vehicle density, as offenders who steal readily available vehicles
                would have more potential targets in that case, but the temporary-specific model
                showed no such association. This association became apparent only in the combined
                model that also included permanent-specific variables.</p>
            <p>Consistent with the greater age and experience of professional auto thieves

                2001</xref>), we found a positive association between permanent MVT rates
                and the size of the adult male property offender pool. Unemployment rate, a proxy
                measure for local fencing market activity, was also positively associated with
                permanent MVT. Permanent MVT rates increased with closer distance to the U.
                S.-Mexico, but not the U.S-Canada, border. While this is consistent with accounts of
                stolen vehicle exports from the United States to less-developed countries
                    (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0022427812453143">Clarke and Brown
                    2003</xref>), past research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0022427812453143">Highway Loss Data Institute 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0022427812453143">Roberts 2012</xref>) makes
                the absence of an effect of distance to major international ports on permanent MVT
                surprising. This absence may be due to “port shopping,” in which
                exporters targeting specific vehicle types steal from a larger area and then travel
                to distant ports with minimum security and physical inspection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0022427812453143">Shane 2010</xref>).
                Conversely, vehicles that are transported across land borders may typically be
                stolen near the crossings. The positive association between the number of
                auto-related businesses and permanent MVT is consistent with the involvement of
                legitimate businesses in professional MVT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0022427812453143">Brill 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0022427812453143">Clarke and Brown 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0022427812453143">Tremblay et al. 2001</xref>). Note,
                though, that the auto-related business variable was no longer related to permanent
                MVT when temporary-specific variables were controlled.</p>
            <p>When predicting temporary MVT rates using variables that are theoretically associated
                with permanent MVT, and vice versa, it is interesting that some factors directly
                linked to one type of MVT nonetheless help explain the other. The permanent-specific
                potential offender pool (adult male property offenders) was
                positively associated with temporary MVT rates, perhaps because the presence of many
                older and more experienced offenders creates an opportunity structure that teaches
                younger offenders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0022427812453143">Mullins and Cherbonneau 2011</xref>). The proportion of households with
                no vehicle was positively associated with permanent MVT; cities with more such
                households may have greater demand in illicit markets for vehicles priced below
                conventional market value. Although effects were not seen in all models, the number
                of households with high disposable incomes, a target measure specific to permanent
                MVT, was negatively associated with both types of MVT. This result is further
                discussed below.</p>
            <p>Still, some crime-specific variables were exclusively associated with one MVT type,
                including young male population with temporary MVT and unemployment, distance to the
                U.S.-Mexico border, and number of auto-related businesses with permanent MVT. With
                temporary and permanent MVT rates only modestly correlated, cities with much
                temporary MVT do not necessarily also suffer from permanent MVT problems. A
                city’s efforts to combat MVT therefore may need to focus on one of the
                specific types, and identification of factors specifically associated with each
                helps policymakers respond appropriately. For example, social programs targeting
                juveniles may have no immediate impact on permanent MVT, while policies reducing
                unemployment may affect permanent but not temporary MVT.</p>
            <p>Arrest risk variables were not theoretically crime-specific, but still had
                distinctive effects. Police efforts targeting MVT (measured by presence of
                an MVT special unit, and use of a stolen vehicle tracking system and license plate
                reader) were associated only with temporary MVT, and in fact with
                    <italic>higher</italic> rates of temporary MVT. This unexpected result may arise
                because these police efforts targeting MVT lead to increased recovery, hence
                increasing the apparent temporary MVT rate. In turn, one might expect that because
                greater MVT clearance and lower workloads (more manpower) likely
                also facilitate recovery, they would similarly result in increased temporary MVT
                rates. However, both of those variables’ effects on temporary MVT were
                instead consistent with deterrence. The MVT clearance rate also appeared to have a
                deterrent effect on permanent MVT, but other police variables were not related to
                permanent MVT.</p>
            <p>The positive association between temporary MVT rates and use of a stolen vehicle
                tracking system could be an artifact of increased recovery under such a system, and
                this relationship could also reflect Clarke and Harris’
                (1992a) concern that police agencies using tracking devices will
                disproportionately focus on thefts of expensive vehicles (that are more
                likely to have a tracking transmitter). This focus could make fewer
                resources available to address thefts of the wider range of models targeted by
                temporary MVT offenders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0022427812453143">Clarke and Harris 1992a</xref>), leaving such jurisdictions with higher
                rates of temporary MVT than those not using tracking systems (and therefore
                allocating their theft responses more evenly). Temporary MVT offenders in
                jurisdictions using stolen vehicle tracking systems or license plate readers may
                also tend to abandon stolen vehicles quickly, and compensate for this by stealing
                more often.</p>
            <p>These findings of both type-specific and common effects help paint a rich picture of
                the world of temporary and permanent MVT, but it is important to also note the
                current study’s shortcomings. First, the use of recovery status to construct
                temporary and permanent MVT rates risks misclassification. For example, some
                vehicles stolen by amateurs for parts-stripping can be recovered after their
                profitable parts have been removed and the vehicles abandoned (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0022427812453143">Maxfield 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0022427812453143">Wallace 2004</xref>). In
                our data, these incidents would be labeled as temporary MVT despite the
                profit-oriented nature of the act. If information on the recovered vehicle’s
                condition (e.g., intact or stripped) were available, future research
                could consider three categories of MVT (professional, amateur
                parts-stripping, and temporary use). Misclassification of permanent MVT as
                temporary also occurs when police make recoveries from chop shops or near borders or
                ports, whether by chance or through “pro-active” investigation.<sup>

                </sup> Conversely, while “truly successful burial” of a stolen vehicle
                is unlikely to be carried out by inexperienced temporary MVT offenders

            <p>Second, some important opportunity measures are unavailable at the city level. The
                current analysis used a measure of informal supervision over parked vehicles, but
                manufacturers’ and citizens’ target-hardening practices are also
                important elements of informal guardianship. Better vehicle security can lower MVT
                rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0022427812453143">Brown and Thomas

                vehicle security probably deters temporary MVT offenders more, as they are likely
                less able to defeat new security innovations and less apt to use alternative theft
                methods such as carjacking or obtaining keys through burglary, fraud, or robbery
                (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0022427812453143">Brown 2004</xref>;

Indeed, studies in
                different nations indicate that immobilizers or steering column locks reduce
                temporary more than permanent MVT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0022427812453143">Brown 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0022427812453143">Farrell et al. 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0022427812453143">Potter and Thomas 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0022427812453143">Tremblay et al 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0022427812453143">Webb 1994</xref>). At
                present, no such vehicle security measure is publicly available for U.S. cities.
                However, the negative associations here between the proportion of households with
                high disposable income and both types of MVT may reflect affluent households’
                ability to purchase cars with more effective security features.</p>
            <p>Finally, data on jurisdictions’ mixes of vehicle makes and models are
                unavailable. Composition (by make and model) of the vehicle pool may
                have different effects on temporary and permanent MVT, as different kinds of
                vehicles likely attract different types of thieves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0022427812453143">Tremblay et al. 2001</xref>). For
                instance, joyriders may favor low- and high-performance American models
                    (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0022427812453143">Clarke and Harris
                    1992b</xref>), while makes manufactured in Mexico are frequently
                targeted for illegal export (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0022427812453143">Field et al. 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0022427812453143">Miller 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0022427812453143">Resendiz 1998</xref>). Perhaps, the
                percentage of the models favored by joyriders may better measure the availability of
                attractive targets for temporary MVT than the overall vehicle density measure used
                here. As discussed earlier, vehicle density had the hypothesized positive
                association with temporary MVT only after controlling for permanent-specific
                variables.</p>
            <p>If appropriate data become available, future MVT research should consider the impact
                of these additional variables along with those examined here. Better data on the
                extent and nature of local- and national-level MVT prevention programs could also
                enhance future studies of specific types of MVT. Still, even with the need for
                further work, this study’s exploration of crime-specific models for temporary
                and permanent MVT, and the distinctiveness of crime-specific variables, makes an
                important contribution to current understanding of MVT. The substantial negative
                consequences of MVT for victims, and society as a whole, make continued research
                crucial.</p>
