<abstract>
<p>Assessing and measuring client motivation to change has been of great interest to therapists and researchers in a variety of fields. This article presents the results of an exploratory factor analysis of the University of Rhode Island Change Assessment (URICA), a measure of motivation to change, in a sample of individuals in couple therapy. Four hundred and sixty-nine individuals engaged in couple therapy completed the URICA. Results suggested the presence of five factors, two of which correspond with the originators' conceptualization of the factor structure. These results provide further support for the theoretically derived factors of precontemplation and action and offer interesting new possibilities for a comprehensive understanding of client motivation to change.</p>

<p>Researchers in the field of marital therapy have found that couple therapy is efficacious at reducing a variety of symptoms and assisting individuals in improving their lives and relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1066480711429537">Sprenkle, 2003</xref>). Despite positive outcomes of couple therapy, research on couple therapy continues to report significant drop-out rates, high incidences of early termination from therapy, and limited effect sizes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1066480711429537">Shadish &amp; Baldwin, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1066480711429537">Sprenkle, 2003</xref>). One explanation for these results is the fact that couples often present for therapy reporting unequal levels of readiness for change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1066480711429537">Doss, Atkins, &amp; Chritensen, 2003</xref>). An understanding of, and ability to assess, readiness to change is essential for therapists and researchers who work with couples seeking change.</p>
<sec id="section1-1066480711429537">
<title>Stages of Change</title>
<p>One framework for conceptualizing readiness to change is the transtheoretical model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1066480711429537">Prochaska &amp; DiClemente, 1983</xref>). The transtheoretical model describes client readiness to change as occurring in five stages: precontemplation, contemplation, preparation, action, and maintenance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1066480711429537">Petrocelli, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1066480711429537">Prochaska &amp; DiClemente, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1066480711429537">Prochaska, DiClemente, &amp; Norcross, 1992</xref>). Each stage describes specific thoughts and behaviors individuals may manifest when they are in the respective stages. In the precontemplation stage, people think problems lie within other people, avoid suggestions that they need to make changes in their lives, and if they attend therapy, it is usually at the request of someone else. In the contemplation stage, people may express the desire to change but have made no efforts to change. They acknowledge their role in problematic behaviors but are hesitant to begin the process of making overt changes. People in the preparation stage report an intention to change and have started to make some behavioral changes, yet they may be ambivalent about specific changes or making a firm commitment to change. During the action stage, people make overt efforts to change with clear attempts to disrupt and change problem behaviors. Finally, people in the maintenance stage work to stabilize new behaviors and integrate changes into daily life. Individuals may not progress through stages in a linear fashion and may identify with more than one stage at any given time in the change process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1066480711429537">Littell &amp; Girvin, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1066480711429537">Prochaska &amp; DiClemente, 1983</xref>).</p>
<p>The transtheoretical model has been used to understand, describe, and assess client motivation in a variety of settings with a variety of problem behaviors including smoking cessation (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1066480711429537">Anatchkova, Velicer, &amp; Prochaska, 2005</xref>), weight loss/management (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1066480711429537">Sarkin, Johnson, Prochaska, &amp; Prochaska, 2001</xref>), preventative health behaviors (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1066480711429537">Prochaska, Velicer, &amp; Redding, 2005</xref>), premature termination of therapy (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1066480711429537">Smith, Subich, &amp; Kalodner, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1066480711429537">Tambling &amp; Johnson, 2008</xref>), and spousal abuse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1066480711429537">Levesque, Gelles, &amp; Velicer, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1066480711429537">Scott &amp; Wolfe, 2003</xref>). Although the transtheoretical model and its associated measures are most commonly used in studies of health behaviors and health behavior change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1066480711429537">Greenstein, Franklin, &amp; McGuffin, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1066480711429537">McConnaughy, DiClemente, Prochaska, &amp; Velicer, 1989</xref>), the model offers a promising method for understanding and assessing motivation to change in couple therapy clients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1066480711429537">Tambling &amp; Johnson, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Successful outcomes in couple therapy require clients to make multiple changes across several domains in their lives and may require individuals to make changes in areas that are not their primary focus. Applying the transtheoretical model to couple therapy, and using a measure of motivation to change early in the therapy process will help clinicians understand the differential readiness for change of individuals within a couple and allow clinicians to focus on fostering common goals within the couple relationship to improve treatment engagement and reduce dropouts which will lead to improved outcomes. Thus, a sound measure of readiness to change is essential.</p>

<title>Measuring Readiness to Change</title>
<p>One widely used measure of readiness to change is the University of Rhode Island Change Assessment (URICA; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1066480711429537">McConnaughy, Prochaska, &amp; Velicer, 1983</xref>) developed by the proponents of the transtheoretical model with the specific aim to provide a clinically useful assessment of motivation to change. The URICA captures data on four of the five theoretical stages of change: precontemplation, contemplation, action, and maintenance. The 32-item self-report measure includes eight questions for each of the four stages. The measure can be scored to provide a continuous measure of readiness to change, often referred to as a composite score, or to provide stage profiles through subscale scoring methods. The URICA has been used extensively in studies of behavior change and has undergone several empirical evaluations to suggest that the measure has good theoretical consistency, concurrent, and discriminant validity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1066480711429537">Blanchard, Morgenstern, Morgan, Labouvie, &amp; Bux, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1066480711429537">DiClemente, Doyle, &amp; Donovan, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1066480711429537">Field, Adinoff, Harris, Ball, &amp; Carroll, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1066480711429537">McConnaughy et al., 1989</xref>). Internal consistency reliability estimates have ranged from .78 to .85 in previous studies of behavior change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1066480711429537">Carbonari &amp; DiClemente, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1066480711429537">McConnaughy et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1066480711429537">Project MATCH Research Group, 1997</xref>). There is substantial support for the factor structure of the URICA among clients who seek treatment for primary drug and alcohol problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1066480711429537">Blanchard et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1066480711429537">Field et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1066480711429537">McConnaughy et al., 1989</xref>). Despite some empirical support for the use of the URICA to measure motivation to change and its wide and successful use, there has also been criticism of the measure.</p>
<p>The chief criticisms of the URICA regard inconsistencies in the factor structure, scoring method, and predictive validity of the measure. The inability of the URICA to adequately and consistently assess motivation to change in a meaningful way calls into question its validity as a measure of motivation to change or readiness to change.</p>
<p>Examinations of the predictive validity of the URICA have shown poor or mixed results. Some researchers have found that stage of change is not associated with treatment outcome or with treatment persistence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1066480711429537">Blanchard et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1066480711429537">Callaghan et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1066480711429537">Project MATCH Research Group, 1997</xref>). In psychotherapy, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1066480711429537">Derisley and Reynolds (2000)</xref> found that precontemplation scores did not predict either premature termination from therapy or therapeutic alliance. Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1066480711429537">Tambling and Johnson (2008)</xref> found that stage of change was not directly related to outcomes in couple therapy. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1066480711429537">Dozois, Westra, Collins, Fung, and Garry (2004)</xref> found that higher scores on the action stage predicted treatment engagement, but the URICA subscale scores were not associated with treatment response or outcome in a study of individuals engaged in voluntary treatment. These findings call into the question the factor structure and utility of the scale. If the factor structure of the URICA is different than what the developers originally proposed, the URICA is not accurately assessing motivation to change. It is possible that the proposed structure does not accurately reflect the underlying constructs. This might explain the failure of the URICA to predict outcomes. Additional research further calls into question the factor structure of the URICA.</p>
<p>Callaghan and colleagues (2008) questioned the face validity of the subscales. In their study, participants were voluntary participants in substance abuse treatment, yet almost all of the participants were identified as being in the precontemplation or contemplation stages of change based on total scale and subscale interpretation. It is difficult to believe that so many individuals in the preaction stages of change would voluntarily seek out, actively participate in, and benefit from treatment, yet the majority of the participants did so (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1066480711429537">Callaghan et al., 2008</xref>). The Project MATCH Research Group expressed similar concerns. They found that two thirds of the participants in their 1997 study were in a preaction stage of change, yet all were voluntarily participating in a time-consuming alcohol treatment intervention.</p>
<p>Based on the mixed results related to validity of the instrument, it is clear that additional research is needed. Though the URICA is frequently used, and arguably a theoretically sound measure of readiness to change, uncertainty about the factor structure of the measure prevents its widespread acceptance. Further, there are numerous differences between couple therapy as a treatment context and the settings the URICA has been previously used. Prior to using the URICA with a new population, exploration of the factor structure is required. It is clear that an exploratory factor analysis has the potential to contribute valuable information about the psychometric properties of the URICA and is a necessary first step toward further examination of the utility and predictive validity of the measure. The purpose of this study is to explore the factor structure of the instrument, not to test the predictive validity of the measure. The establishment of a clear factor structure is a necessary precursor to future testing of the predictive validity of the instrument.</p>

<title>Participants</title>
<p>Data for this study came from two university-based marriage and family therapy clinics in the Southeastern United States between 2003 and 2005. Participants were 469 individuals (222 males and 247 females) representing 290 couples who presented for therapy. Participants were predominantly Caucasian (63.6% of the sample). Other ethnicities represented included African American (11.6%), Hispanic/Latino (1.6%), and Asian (.7%). The remaining ethnicities were either reported by participants as âother,â or were not defined. Participants were generally well educated. The majority of participants had completed at least a high school education. Twenty-four percent reported that their highest level of education obtained was a high school degree or general equivalency diploma. Others (21.2%) reported having completed a 4-year degree or (17.1%) education beyond a 4-year degree. Incomes ranged from under $5,000 to over $40,000 per year with an equal dispersion among income categories. On average, participants were 31.26 years old, ranging from 17 to 59 years.</p>

<title>URICA</title>
<p>The URICA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1066480711429537">McConnaughy et al., 1983</xref>) was used to measure client stage of change. The URICA is a 32-item self-report measure on which individuals rate their agreement on a 5-point scale with statements reflecting each stage of change. There are four theoretically derived subscales on the URICA, precontemplation (e.g., <italic>I am not the problem one, it doesnât make sense for me to be here</italic>), contemplation (e.g., <italic>I have a problem and I really think I should work on it</italic>), action (e.g., <italic>I am finally doing some work on my problem</italic>), and maintenance (e.g., <italic>It worries me that I might slip back on a problem I already have, so I am here to seek help</italic>). Scoring methods and validity of the measure were described in detail above. Using the total score method of score computation, the mean for this sample was 103.59 (<italic>SD</italic> = 11.61). The means and standard deviations for subscales were 15.66 (<italic>SD</italic> = 5.10) for precontemplation, 32.74 (<italic>SD</italic> = 4.27) for contemplation, 29.89 (<italic>SD</italic> = 4.54) for action, and 25.54 (<italic>SD</italic> = 5.83) for maintenance. Reliability estimates with this sample were good (Î± = .856).</p>

<sec id="section8-1066480711429537">
<title>Procedures</title>
<p>This study used existing clinic data from two Commission on Accreditation for Marriage and Family Therapy Education (COAMFTE)-accredited marriage and family therapy training program in the Southeastern United States. Individuals, couples, and families with a wide range of presenting problems were treated in the clinics. Therapists were masters or doctoral students in the marriage and family therapy programs. Faculty members in each program provided clinical supervision. Clients phoned the clinics to request services. Clients were normally seen on a weekly basis and paid on a sliding fee scale based on family income and the number of people supported by that income. Clients who consented to participate in research were required to complete assessment packets periodically throughout the course of therapy. Prior to the first-session clients completed an intake assessment packet containing the URICA. In addition to demographic information, the client intake assessment packet includes several self-report measures of distress and psychological adjustment. Data for this study were taken exclusively from the URICA completed prior to the first session of therapy.</p>

<sec id="section9-1066480711429537">
<title>Results</title>
<p>An exploratory factor analysis using principle-axis factor extraction was conducted to explore the factor structure of the URICA. Principle-axis factor extraction techniques are recommended in exploratory and descriptive research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1066480711429537">Tinsely &amp; Tinsely, 1987</xref>). The selection of appropriate rotational methods is based on assumptions made a priori about the expected resulting factor structure. In this case, the resulting factor structure was expected to include intercorrelated factors. As all the items on the URICA are meant to measure some aspect of stage of change, items and factors are likely to correlate with one another; therefore, the oblique Oblimin with Kaiser normalization rotation method was used.</p>
<sec id="section10-1066480711429537">
<title>Factor Identification</title>
<p>Seven factors had eigenvalues greater than one. Given that the rule of eigenvalue greater than one typically results in the identification of too many factors, the scree plot was interpreted to aid in factor retention decision making. Using the scree test, five factors were retained. The factor-loading matrix, which displays the pattern of influence of each of the three factors on the item to factor correlations is presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1066480711429537">Table 1</xref>.</p>

<title>Interpretation of Multivocal Items</title>
<p>Using the common practice of identifying those items that load at or above .30 as highly loading items, a number of multivocal items, items that load on more than on factor, were identified. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1066480711429537">Table 1</xref> identifies the patterns of factor loadings. High loadings (loadings over .30) have been bolded for ease of interpretation. Using a method suggested by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1066480711429537">Gorsuch (1983)</xref>, which suggests that items be examined across factors, factor affiliations were clarified. This method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1066480711429537">Gorsuch, 1983</xref>) suggests that items that load substantially more on one factor than on others be considered as loading on the factor. Using this method, 21 of the 32 items appeared to have clearly high factor loadings on one factor. Two items (Items 13 and 25) loaded ambiguously, and 9 items (Items 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 10, 11, and 12) have low factor loadings across all the factors (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1066480711429537">Table 1</xref>).</p>

<p>Factor 1 accounted for 25.47% of the variance explained, Factor 2 accounted for 13.62%, Factor 3 accounted for 6.82%, Factor 4 accounted for 4.56%, and Factor 5 accounted for 4.23% of the variance explained.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-1066480711429537">
<title>Factor Labels</title>
<p>Factors were assigned labels based on the loading pattern of each factor. Factor 1 contained the items âI wish I had more ideas on how to solve the problemâ; âI have started working on my problems but I would like helpâ; âMaybe this place will be able to help meâ; and âI hope that someone here will have some good advice for me.â These items all suggest an orientation towards the therapist as the provider of ideas and suggestions related to change. Thus, Factor 1 was named Seeking Assistance. Items loading highly on Factor 2 were âI am doing something about the problems that had been bothering meâ; âI guess I have faults, but there's nothing that I really need to changeâ; âI may be part of the problems, but I don't really think I amâ; âAll this talk about psychology is boring. Why can't people just forget about their problems?â; âI have worries but so does the next guy. Why spend time thinking about them?â; and âI would rather cope with my faults than try to change themâ, all items that suggest the respondent is not highly motivated to change. This factor was labeled Ambivalence toward Change. Precontemplation is the original construct that is mostly closely aligned with the items on Factor 2. Factor 3 included the items âI am doing something about the problems that had been bothering meâ (which loaded positively here, and negatively on Factor 2); âI am finally doing some work on my problemâ; âI am really working hard to changeâ; âEven though I'm not always successful in changing, I am at least working on my problemsâ; âAnyone can talk about changing; I'm actually doing something about itâ; and âI am actively working on my problem.â Factor 3 was labeled Action, as the items associated with this factor are closely related to the original action construct. Factor 4 was labeled Maintenance, and included the following items: âIt worries me that I might slip back on a problem I have already changed, so I am here to seek helpâ; âI have been successful in working on my problem but I'm not sure I can keep up the effort on my ownâ; âI'm not following through with what I had already changed as well as I had hoped, and I'm here to prevent a relapse of the problemâ; âI though once I had resolved my problem I would be free of it, but sometimes is still find myself struggling with itâ; âI may need a boost right now to help me maintain the changes I've already madeâ; âI'm here to prevent myself from having a relapse of my problemâ; âIt is frustrating, but I feel I might be having a recurrence of a problem I thought I had resolvedâ; and âAfter all I had done to try to change my problem, every now and again it comes back to haunt me,â all of which loaded negatively. This pattern of loading suggests that this factor is related to a feeling of satisfaction with changes made in the past, a kind of positive maintenance in which the respondent feels stable and secure in the changes made. Finally, Factor 5 included the items âI guess I have faults, but there's nothing that I really need to changeâ (which also loaded on Factor 2); âI have a problem and I really think I should work at itâ; and âAnyone can talk about changing; I'm actually doing something about it.â Factor 5 is not a particularly appealing factor in that the items which loaded on this factor are not easily interpretable. Given that the latter two items loaded negatively and the first positively, this may suggest that this factor is related to a rejection of change attempts, an external locus of control, or an unwillingness to accept a role in the present problems.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study provides information about the factor structure of the URICA with a sample of individuals in couple therapy. Overall, the results included factors that were both consistent and inconsistent with the theoretically derived factor structure. These results provide further support for the factors precontemplation (Ambivalence toward Change) and action. The factors unique to this study (Seeking Assistance and Maintenance) offer additional areas of exploration in the assessment of motivation to change in couple therapy.</p>
<p>First, two factors identified in this analysis were similar to those identified in the original, theoretically derived subscale structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1066480711429537">McConnaughy et al., 1983</xref>). Factor 2, Ambivalence toward Change, and Factor 3, Action, very closely resembled Precontemplation and Action, respectively. Ambivalence toward Change includes 5 of the 8 items originally associated with the precontemplation subscale. The items from the original scale not included on the Ambivalence toward Change factor are items that place blame on another person (i.e., <italic>Being here is pretty much a waste of time for me because the problem doesnât have to do with me</italic>), which may represent a different construct. Since participants in this study were couples in therapy, it is possible that items that reference a third party as the one who holds responsibility for change represent a construct that is thematically different from a general ambivalence toward changing oneself. In this analysis, the Action factor (Factor 3) included 6 of the 8 items originally part of the action subscale. The overlap between the theoretically derived subscales and the factor in this analysis suggest that the action subscale does represent a unique construct that seems to be a fairly stable factor among respondents in this study and previous research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1066480711429537">Anatchkova et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1066480711429537">DiClemente et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1066480711429537">Napper et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1066480711429537">Sarkin et al., 2001</xref>; Smith et al., 2005).</p>
<p>Factor 4 identified in this analysis, maintenance, is identical to the theoretically derived maintenance subscale. Both the factor and the subscale include items that reflect an orientation toward maintaining changes made. This factor may have been particularly meaningful for participants in this study who may have sought couple therapy to receive support in maintaining changes, or who sought premarital couple therapy in the absence of identified problems in their relationship. It seems clear that maintenance is an orientation toward change experienced by couples.</p>
<p>Despite much similarity between the results of this analysis and the theoretically derived subscale structure, some interesting differences in structure were noted. Of these discrepancies, the identification of a new factor, Factor 1 in this analysis, represents an interesting addition to conceptualizations of motivation to change. The first factor, Seeking Assistance, represents a new factor that has not previously been identified in any quantitative research on motivation to change. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1066480711429537">Tambling and Johnson (2010)</xref> have found that clients seeking couple therapy expect their therapist to be helpful to them. This new factor is intuitively appealing, representing an orientation to therapy and the therapist as sources of assistance in making behavioral change. It may also be an artifact of the setting given that the majority of participants in this study sought therapy voluntarily for assistance with their problems. It seems fairly logical that such persons who seek therapy voluntarily might do so because they believe that the process of therapy, and the therapist in particular, might assist them in resolving their problems. The identification of this factor seems to elucidate some of the importance of the role of the therapist in helping couples achieve the changes they desire.</p>
<p>Finally, the fifth factor identified in this analysis seems to be a factor that is not well identified. In addition to multiple loadings, this factor included several items that do not seem to fit well together. However, this factor includes several items related to the placement of blame on a third party. It is possible that this factor is a factor that includes elements of the couple relationship that were not captured by the individually oriented URICA. By indicating agreement with statements about oneâs desire to change oneâs partner, participants are responding to a characteristic of couple therapy. The URICA was originally designed for individuals seeking behavior change. It is possible that the fifth factor emerged as a result of the application of an individually oriented measure in a couple setting. Further development of this factor may help clinicians and researchers to better understand the role of motivation to change in couple therapy.</p>
<sec id="section15-1066480711429537">
<title>Implications</title>
<p>These results support the stability of the action and maintenance subscales for couples in a clinical setting. Those subscales have been consistent in multiple examinations of the factor structure of the URICA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1066480711429537">Blanchard et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1066480711429537">DiClemente et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1066480711429537">Field et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1066480711429537">McConnaughy et al., 1983</xref>). For therapists and researchers, the stability of the action and maintenance stages is encouraging. It is possible to assess readiness to change and obtain useful information about whether or not the individual is in the action stage. This information is useful to clinicians who must plan treatment to meet the needs of clients.</p>
<p>Two other factors, Seeking Assistance and Ambivalence about Change, provide additional information about motivation to change that is not provided by the original subscales. First, the Ambivalence about Change factor is qualitatively different from the precontemplation subscale in that the items that refer to placing blame on a third party did not load on this subscale. In the original precontemplation subscale, several items hinted at a placement of blame on others, or an active avoidance of changing oneself. This new factor, Ambivalence about Change, seems to identify thoughts associated more with recognition that something is wrong, but ambivalence and confusion about what is wrong or how to change. This subscale makes sense in a couple therapy setting. Many people who present for couple therapy present in therapy not knowing what to change or how to go about changing their current situation. They may have tried several strategies to improve their situation but become disillusioned about the change process. They may present for therapy at the request of a partner, yet feel ambivalent about change.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section16-1066480711429537">
<title>Limitations</title>
<p>First, participants in this study were individuals seeking couple therapy as part of a committed dyad. While there is no reason to believe that participants in this study differ greatly from participants in other studies on the URICA, that fact that they are seeking couple therapy may be responsible for the different factor structure. The URICA was originally developed and validated using individuals seeking to make changes through individually oriented models of therapy. Seeking change in couple therapy is different from seeking change through individual therapy. Couple therapy generally requires both partners attend therapy and each is a part of the dialogue and change process. While individual therapy allows people to make changes outside the context of the relationship.</p>
<p>The presence of the fifth, not well-defined factor suggests some limitations. The fifth factor contains several items whose loadings are ambiguous and low. Further, this factorâs representative items do not fit well together in a coherent whole. It is possible that the items associated with this factor load together due to an artifact of the research. As suggested previously, the items on Factor 5 may be irrelevant to couple therapy participants who have sought therapy not to improve themselves but to improve a relationship. The presence of this factor may be artifactual to the application of the URICA, a measure developed for individual clients, to couple therapy. Modifications to the URICA, such as those suggested by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1066480711429537">Bradford (2010)</xref>, may better capture the unique experiences of those clients who seek therapy to improve their couple relationship.</p>
<p>Additionally, couples in the study presented for couple therapy at a university-based outpatient clinic. Certain characteristics of the sample maybe related to their seeking help at a low-cost training clinic. Finally, differences in the services provided at the training clinics, where therapists received regular supervision and observation, were associated with differences in the sample.</p>
<p>Despite these limitations, the current study is important in that it provides information about the factor structure of the URICA in a sample of participants in couple therapy. Additional studies which examine the factor structure of the URICA and other measures of motivation to change are critically needed. Further refinement of the URICA and similar instruments would benefit clinicians and researchers interested in assessing motivation to change. Studies that address motivation to change, the interaction of motivation to change and distress, and the predictive validity of motivation to change measures are needed. In short, a better understanding of how couples' varying levels of motivation and distress affect their ability to change in therapy will assist both clinicians and researchers in increasing the efficiency with which the therapists help their clients.</p>
