<title>Introduction</title>
<p>This analysis of talent development in Peruvian contemporary society aims to contribute to the understanding of the gifted and talented that is developing in multicultural transition countries. Peru is the third-largest country in South America and is a land of contrasts: deserts along the coastal area, high mountains configuring the Andes Mountains, and dense tropical forests shaping the Amazon jungle, that are all in close proximity. Peru, an ethnic–linguistic diverse, and multicultural country, has achieved a high degree of education coverage and gender equity comparing with similar areas of Latin America with heavy indigenous presence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0162353213492925">Bertelsmann Stiftung’s Transformation Index [BTI], 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0162353213492925">World Bank, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Education and training facilities are available in the country, but vary widely in quality. Primary education enrollment rates and completion rates for marginalized urban and rural youth are high, but the quality of public education is still low, constituting a significant barrier to further development in other areas. Per capita expenditures in the primary education system, considering the costs per pupil and teacher wages, are among the lowest in the region. And the expenditure for education in the past 30 years has been around 3% gross domestic product (GDP; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0162353213492925">BTI, 2012</xref>). In 2006, The National Education Project (PEN) was started to establish long-term priorities in education. The first evaluation, which was done in 2011, showed mixed findings: (a) The quality of education had improved, but was still behind international levels; (b) gender equity had improved, but differences between socioeconomic status groups remained; (c) decentralization and social participation needed to be promoted; and (d) the tertiary education system exhibited low quality, with few internationally accredited programs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0162353213492925">BTI, 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>Since 1837, the educational system in Peru has been run using a central system style by the Ministry of Education (<italic>Ministerio de Educación</italic> [MINEDU]; Peruvian Secretary of Education). Education is compulsory from K to 11th grade (end of Secondary level/17 years of age). Academically talented college students coming from poverty usually are awarded fellowships to continue their studies in all public and some private universities. The Secretary of Education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0162353213492925">MINEDU, 1983</xref>) formulates, implements, and supervises the national educational policy of the country.</p>
<p>Talent development through Peruvian history was marked by the convenience of those who ran its destiny along the different historical eras (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0162353213492925">Blumen &amp; Cornejo, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0162353213492925">Pease, 1981</xref>), as seen in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0162353213492925">Table 1</xref>.</p>

<p>Del Busto (personal communication, May 24, 2004) stated that the Inca culture (1414-1532) established a blood-related leading class, known as the <italic>Orejones de Sangre</italic>. Each Chief was selected by the Incans, from the most talented individuals, to achieve a goal. The Chief was severely punished if he could not reach the assigned goal and highly recognized while achieving his duty. The prevailing conception of talent was related to reasoning ability and problem-solving skills. Talent was considered to be a gift from the divinity or from nature, in the form of exceptional cognitive abilities, and appreciated as a resource to be developed for the benefit of the community (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0162353213492925">Blumen, 2008a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0162353213492925">Sánchez, 1981</xref>).</p>
<p>Later, in the 16th century, along the Spanish Viceroyalty, the tendency to hide the talents of those born in the American Colonies began. However, there were exceptions such as Inca Garcilazo de la Vega (1549-1616), a highly talented <italic>mestizo</italic> considered as the greatest writer of the Spanish Colony, who inspired Voltaire and Rousseau (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0162353213492925">Sánchez, 1981</xref>). Then, during the Republican Era, President Castilla (1797-1867), developed the first official proposal to identify the most talented college students, and granted them support to study in England or France. However, the systematic exclusion on the Peruvian aborigines was maintained. Along this period, the <italic>potential to create</italic> was not recognized as such (Guerra, personal communication, May 25, 2004), and the talents related to visual arts and musical abilities were considered as <italic>demonstrations of love</italic> toward the divinity.</p>
<p>From the 19th century until the beginning of the 20th century, giftedness and talent were associated with geniality, an innate quality of an individual that needed to be identified. The conception of giftedness as primarily general intelligence (<italic>g</italic>) still remains in the policies and practices given by the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0162353213492925">MINEDU (1983)</xref>. However, research findings and initiatives coming from scientific settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0162353213492925">Alencar, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0162353213492925">Blumen, 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0162353213492925">2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0162353213492925">Blumen, Mantilla, &amp; Cornejo, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0162353213492925">Colangelo, Assouline, &amp; Gross, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0162353213492925">Mönks, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0162353213492925">Mönks, Ypenburg, &amp; Blumen, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0162353213492925">Robinson, 2006</xref>) revealed that cognitive and conative factors are as significant factors as academic ability, with correlate variables such as access to opportunities and perseverance. Moreover, the development of expertise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0162353213492925">Sternberg, 2000</xref>) involves training and interventions in domain-specific skills, as well as self-regulated thinking to achieve levels of expertise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0162353213492925">Alencar, 2008</xref>), and outstanding performance in adulthood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0162353213492925">Subotnik &amp; Rickoff, 2010</xref>). But, the lack of culturally fitted foundations for establishing provisions for talent development in Peru, as well as the inability to identify who will be the eminent adult in the future, refrain policies related to talent identification services in the community (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0162353213492925">Blumen, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>In Peru, as in other countries, giftedness can be found among people from diverse cultural, ethnic, and socioeconomic groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0162353213492925">Thorne &amp; Blumen, 1996</xref>). However, given that giftedness is a social construct, there is no one-size-fits-all conception of giftedness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0162353213492925">Sternberg, 2007</xref>). From a cultural perspective, giftedness is influenced by cultural beliefs, needs, values, concepts, attitudes, and language (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0162353213492925">Bevan-Brown, 2011</xref>). Considering that Peru is an ethno-linguistically diverse country, with three varieties of Quechua and Aymara language spoken in the Andean region and about 64 vernacular languages spoken in the Amazon region, it is expected that different worldviews will influence perceptions of giftedness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0162353213492925">Phillipson, 2007</xref>). In Peru, provisions for the gifted involve a wide range of possibilities, from upper-middle-class urban gifted children and youths attending International Baccalaureate (IB) private schools to middle-lower-class gifted students competing for a place at the Peruvian Math Olympic competitions.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0162353213492925">Blumen and Cornejo (2006)</xref> outlined Western/native differences in the identification of culturally diverse gifted children. Peruvian natives from the Andes showed more convergence with Mäori components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0162353213492925">Bevan-Brown, 2009</xref>), such as</p>
<list id="list1-0162353213492925" list-type="alpha-lower">
<list-item><p>collective giftedness, referring to the notion that giftedness develops as the result of communal work (e.g., giftedness is perceived as belonging to the group rather than to the individuals);</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>emphasis on the importance of interpersonal and intrapersonal domains, giving priority to love, caring, and sensitivity toward their people, as well as hospitality and humility, moral values, and strength of character;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>service to their community and to others;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>valuing of intuition and spirituality; and</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>the development of leadership ability, understanding those that lead with their example.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>However, the Peruvian Amazon gifted natives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0162353213492925">Blumen &amp; Cornejo, 2006</xref>) tend to exhibit a giftedness view convergent to the four intellectual strengths that typify the Australian Aboriginal, as reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0162353213492925">Gibson and Vialle (2007)</xref>:</p>
<list id="list2-0162353213492925" list-type="alpha-lower">
<list-item><p>linguistic intelligence, as there are 64 vernacular languages spoken in the Peruvian Amazon region, which are mainly oral, without a correlate written language (e.g., Amazon natives easily learn different languages when exposed to them);</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>spatial intelligence, a survival ability needed in the Amazon jungle, which is particularly strengthened through parenting practices since early childhood, and is expressed by the native trackers and Amazon native visual artists of the region;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>interpersonal intelligence due to the egalitarian nature of the Amazon native society and the tribal-style of the communal groups;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>naturalist/spiritual intelligence, as they have a strong connection between the “Pachamama” (motherland in Quechua) and the individual (e.g., daily life is related to the way the individuals honor the land, while living on it).</p></list-item>

<title>Talents Valued in Peru</title>
<p>Talent development is considered a right for highly able girls and boys in Peru. Since the educational reforms of 1972, talent development programs have been organized in an attempt to promote the creative, figural, and verbal performance of the highly able inside regular classrooms. During the 1970s, significant attention was given to provisions related to the Visual and Performing Arts, under the auspices of the former Federal Republic of Germany (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0162353213492925">Cardó, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0162353213492925">CONCYTEC [National Council of Science and Technology], 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0162353213492925">Morales, 1992</xref>).</p>
<p>In 1983, the Ministry of Education in Peru launched an Educational Law that recognized and defined the gifted individual as “the special girl or boy that exhibits high abilities that significantly surpass the normal level of intellectual functioning and needs special programs in different modalities” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0162353213492925">MINEDU, 1983</xref>, D.S. 02-83-ED). The definition was focused on cognitive skills and academic achievement relating to the intellectually gifted child. This new norm (a) promoted advocacy toward the needs of the gifted and talented with gender equity, (b) underlined the importance of identification services and talent development provisions in the educational setting, and (c) established the foundations for teacher training programs and the provisions for the gifted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0162353213492925">Blumen, 1999</xref>). In relation to talent development provisions, the overall picture is complex. It is often common to find an overlap between in-school and out-of-school provisions. However, for all types of activities, collaboration among school, parents, and specialists is a significant aspect of success.</p>
<sec id="section3-0162353213492925">
<title>Talent Development in School Settings</title>
<p>By the end of the 1990s, inclusive policies had gained popularity, which promoted the development of differentiated teaching in regular schools. Therefore, following the inclusive school model, teachers were trained in gifted education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0162353213492925">Blumen, 1999</xref>). Moreover, creative enrichment programs for the highly able children attending public schools were launched in primary public (state-run) schools monitored by the Office of Special Education at the Secretary of Education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0162353213492925">Blumen, 2000</xref>). Another common enrichment provision, especially for Grades 1 to 5 in primary school was clustering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0162353213492925">Costa, 2001</xref>) through ability grouping, providing opportunities for the students to be grouped together with academic peers. Furthermore, special resources, such as universities, research institutions, museums, and other professional organizations, became committed to the support of talent development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0162353213492925">Blumen, 2008a</xref>).</p>
<p>Enrichment activities such as chess club, Model UN debate, drama, music classes, and math and science-related clubs were also available at the highly competitive International Baccalaureate Organization (IBO) schools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0162353213492925">Alencar, Blumen, &amp; Castellanos, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0162353213492925">Blumen, 2009</xref>). Those schools offered IB and Advance Placement (AP) classes, as well as enrichment in science and technology. Most of the IBO schools belong to foreign communities, and the learning process usually considers the mastery of a foreign language such as English, German, French, or Italian, together with their native Spanish. Students also participated in the various talent searches programs sponsored by universities, such as science fairs, inventor’s fairs, math competitions, among others, as well as in international events, building-up an important network among international peers.</p>
<p>For mathematically talented students, the use of talent search testing and associated provisions in preparatory secondary schools has grown rapidly over the past decades to optimize mathematics talent development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0162353213492925">Blumen, 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0162353213492925">2010</xref>). At the beginning of the millennium there was a particular need to provide counseling support to the members of the Peruvian Math Olympic team. They were mathematically talented youths coming from ethnically diverse and poverty contexts, who were exposed to a very intensive training in ability-grouped settings for 10 hr a day, 5 days per week. They were trained using the philosophy that learning can improve intelligence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0162353213492925">Bloom &amp; Sosniak, 1981</xref>). They stayed at school longer and worked harder than their peers while being there. Tailor-fitted counseling programs were developed for the mathematically talented youths who were being trained to compete in the International Math Olympiads (IMO; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0162353213492925">Blumen, 2008a</xref>) and showed improvement as measured by the positions achieved at the IMO competitions. Moreover, the Catholic University of Peru (PUCP) provided grants to cover college expenses in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) careers, and the French government awarded fellowships for postgraduate studies in France.</p>
<p>García’s second-term government (2006-2011) provided generously to deprived but potentially talented children. These students were provided fellowships to attend <italic>Colegio Mayor Presidente de la República</italic>, a residential Academy of Arts and Sciences launched in 2010 to serve the talented youths coming from disadvantage and poverty conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0162353213492925">Blumen, 2011</xref>), under the premise that learning and perseverance might improve their academic talents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0162353213492925">Gladwell, 2008</xref>). Actually, Humala’s government (2011-2016) launched the <italic>Beca 18</italic> program, a fellowship awarded to intellectually talented youths coming from poverty conditions, to continue college studies in either Peruvian universities or abroad.</p>
<p>Provisions for talented college students are beginning to be considered in tertiary education in Peru, and mentoring programs are being developed for talented students attending college (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0162353213492925">Blumen, 2011</xref>). Studies suggest that significant academic relationships between college students and their mentors might constitute a creative and enrichment learning space for students, as well as a regenerative power for professor/mentors from the cultural relational theory, and the relational practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0162353213492925">Blumen, 2012b</xref>). Mentors seem to play an important role in the talent development process with college students, and high achievement is not only the result of their giftedness, but the result of their motivation and the given opportunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0162353213492925">Erwin &amp; Worrell, 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>The literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0162353213492925">Stanley &amp; Benbow, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0162353213492925">VanTassel-Baska, 2001</xref>) related to acceleration states that the gifted who are left among their age-peers may lose their talent, never to regain it. And accordingly, any barriers associated with age-grouping within the educational system must be suppressed. In Peru, until 2011, a form of acceleration was done with grade skipping before entering Primary or Secondary school (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0162353213492925">MINEDU, 2006</xref>). However, it does not constitute a feasible alternative for the gifted and talented anymore, as education officers have banned grade-skipping strategies in the Peruvian system. The new educational norm establishes chronological age as the criteria for grade placement in the schools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0162353213492925">MINEDU, 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>Taking into consideration the low quality of education provided in Peruvian public schools nationwide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0162353213492925">BTI, 2012</xref>), as well as the lack of educational standards, acceleration strategies were the best cost-effective alternatives to provide challenges for the needs of the gifted and talented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0162353213492925">Subotnik, Olszewski-Kubilius, &amp; Worrell, 2011</xref>) in a multicultural country that uses only 3% of public expenditure for education purposes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0162353213492925">BTI, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0162353213492925">World Bank 2007</xref>).</p>

<title>Talents Developed Out of School Setting</title>
<p>The first public afterschool provisions for the gifted and talented were started in 1989, based on the psychological understanding of human abilities that was current in the 1920s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0162353213492925">Alencar &amp; Blumen, 1993</xref>). However, these early influences affected practice, such as in the belief that IQ is the sufficient measure for provision of services. Taking into consideration that Peru has no tradition of standardized testing in Primary or Secondary school (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0162353213492925">BTI, 2012</xref>), the development of other selection criteria such as the IQ, was needed. However, domain-specific academic talents are not valued in modern Peruvian society, and the talent development process needed to reach levels of eminence involves high specialization, opportunities, and chances for developing it. Peru needs to improve its educational standards for the core population. However, efforts to provide a small population with high educational standards, involving specialized teachers or mentors, access to technology, good curriculum, and educational resources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0162353213492925">Galvao, Fleith, &amp; Alencar, 2009</xref>), might be seen as elitist and unpopular. This situation is somehow unreachable for the majority of the population who live under the line of poverty condition.</p>
<p>It is necessary to consider the disadvantaged context in which the majority of children and youth develop to understand the most valued talent in Peruvian society, which is also related to the most valued sport: soccer. Availability of soccer fields for initiating children in this sport is excellent all over the country from the dusty shantytowns surrounding the urban areas, to the small towns high up in the mountains or deep in the Amazon jungle, to the modern soccer field sponsored by a Spanish Soccer team placed in Lima city. And it is the dream of many children to become internationally recognized expert soccer players.</p>
<p>Surfing is another well-recognized talent in sports, as Peru has achieved a world championship, and has high positions in the international rankings. Again, the availability of the Pacific Ocean all along the coastal area, as well as the provisions of many surfing academies for school-age children, has facilitated its practice since early ages. Moreover, having Sofía Mulanovich, a former World Champion Surfer, as a role model close to them, motivates them to persevere in their training (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0162353213492925">Blumen, 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0162353213492925">2011</xref>). Another valued talent is musical talent, and this value is facilitated by having world-recognized tenor Juan Diego Flores as the best representative of musical talent in Peru (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0162353213492925">Blumen, 2008a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0162353213492925">2008b</xref>). He was supported by a group of Peruvian entrepreneurs to continue his studies abroad and now he promotes musical talent in disadvantaged population. Chess is also a valued talent in Peru. There are facilities to practice chess in public areas, such as parks, as well as in many Chess Clubs of public and private institutions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0162353213492925">Alencar &amp; Blumen, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>The Peruvian Olympic Math team has significantly improved its position in the international rankings. There are seldom Peruvian youth winners in Physics and Chemistry international competitions. However, taking into consideration the communal foundations of the Andean-type societies, who praised collective giftedness more than individual success, mathematical, and science-related talent are not valued in Peruvian modern society. These individual achievements are timidly publicized in the media, and are seldom given attention from policy makers. Following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0162353213492925">Csikszentmihalyi (1988)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0162353213492925">Freeman (2005)</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0162353213492925">Sternberg (2005)</xref>, it seems that as mathematical talent is subjectively perceived as an inherent <italic>gift</italic> itself.

<title>The Primary Conception of Giftedness in Peru</title>
<p>Since the beginning of psychology as a science, psychologists have tried to understand why the highly able followed his or her intellectual abilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0162353213492925">Galton, 1869/1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0162353213492925">Terman, 1954</xref>). However, taking into consideration the one-dimensional conception of intelligence that was operant until the beginning of the 20th century has limited psychologists understanding of high ability, similar to the way that the intelligence quotient limited understanding of intelligence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0162353213492925">Blumen, 2001b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0162353213492925">2007</xref>). Later, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0162353213492925">Guilford (1959)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0162353213492925">Cattell (1971)</xref>, among others, stated that intelligence could not be understood from a one-dimensional approach, and a multidimensional conceptualization was considered, that involved abilities, aptitudes, personality characteristics, and environmental conditions. This situation also influenced the conceptualization of high ability as a construct, and was particularly significant in the study and practice of the highly able who were living under diverse ethno-linguistic influences, in which the mastering of the dominant language, gender equity, malnutrition, and the exposure to Western culture might ostensibly bias their performance on psychometric measures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0162353213492925">Blumen &amp; Cornejo, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>In the Peruvian literature, there are important efforts related to the identification of the gifted and talented attending public schools and colleges since 1972. On January 15, 1983, the Rules of Special Education were given by Supreme Decree No. 02.83-ED (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0162353213492925">MINEDU, 1983</xref>), involving two articles that benefited gifted and talented children (a) that the exceptional child, due to outstanding abilities that significantly surpass average intelligence, needs special programs in different modalities and (b) that a student of special education has certain rights. These rights include</p>

</list>
<p>In 1988, the CONCYTEC proposed a talent detection program to secure the scholarships granted to students of low financial resources, and a very ambitious definition was considered: the person with high levels of creativity, good tolerance of frustration, high intelligence, autonomous, with a high level of self-esteem, good sense of humor, and a steady structure of personality. As none of the children fulfilled the initial criteria, the intellectual criterion was the only considered—that IQ was at least 127 according to the Wechsler scales. Several adjustments were done to the screening process, and in 1992, it was relaunched and oriented to identify 5- to 12-year-old talented children attending public schools in Lima City. The goals of the program were (a) to extend the coverage of educational services for very able children, (b) to extend the curriculum according to individual characteristics, (c) to develop training programs for psychologists and teachers to improve the quality and efficiency of educational services, and (d) to broaden screening programs in every public school of Lima City and its jurisdictions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0162353213492925">CONCYTEC, 1989</xref>).</p>
<p>The screening process involved teacher referrals, cognitive and pedagogical measurements, and school achievement. The identification process involved testing with the Wechsler scales, selecting those reaching the Full Scale Intellectual Quotient (FSIQ) Very Superior range. All the programs were led by psychologists. The children who were identified for the enrichment program, were above-average students in their regular school classes, although not the best academic achievers. The main difficulties of the program were related to the financing of the physical infrastructure and the testing materials. However, no information was registered in relation to the 3 to 4 hr the children had to be exposed during the afterschool activity. Children started their school day at 8:00 a.m., and finished at 6:00 p.m. This situation was criticized by parents and teachers, as it seemed that children thought they were being punished with extra work because they were intellectually talented. Later, as advocacy toward the gifted was increasing, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0162353213492925">Ruiz (1991)</xref> did a descriptive study about the personality traits of highly able girls, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0162353213492925">Gonzales (1991)</xref> developed an intervention program for the intellectually talented secondary students of the southern border city of Tacna.</p>
<p>In the beginning of the 1990s, scientific research on the identification of gifted and talented children was consolidated within the Inter-Disciplinary Research Group <italic>Creativity, Technology, and Talent</italic> of the Catholic University of Peru, with the funds of <italic>Mente Futura Foundation</italic>, and the support of the <italic>Center for the Study of Giftedness at Radboud University</italic>, in the framework of a doctoral dissertation on high ability in Lima (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0162353213492925">Blumen, 2000</xref>). Since the beginning of the collaboration in 1991, there was dual work concerning identification processes: On one hand, the establishment of advocacy toward the needs of the gifted and talented with the officers from the Ministry of Education. On the other hand, there was the need to build a scientific body of empirical data in relation to the gifted and talented in Peru.</p>

<title>Beliefs That People Have About Gifted Individuals</title>
<p>In Peru, a country in which Western and native Andean and Amazon cultures and beliefs coexist, native parents withhold their children from participating in gifted screening processes due to two popular dichotomies affecting beliefs and perceptions that people have about gifted individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0162353213492925">Blumen, 1995</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0162353213492925">2001b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0162353213492925">2008a</xref>): first, the belief that all children have the potential to become talented versus the belief that only some children are born with the potential to become talented; second, the belief that gifted children must develop their talents for the well-being of their communities—a perspective from the Western paradigm—versus the belief that gifted children must continue doing their duties as part of the tribe or clan—a perspective from a traditional paradigm. Both dichotomies require differences of approach and interventions with gifted individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0162353213492925">Blumen, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>As found in Western countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0162353213492925">Subotnik et al., 2011</xref>), there are differences in the recognition of gifts in children, and talents in adolescents and adults. While in Peruvian coastal and urban areas, children’s gifts are mostly seen as related to precociousness and hereditary issues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0162353213492925">Blumen, 2001a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0162353213492925">2008a</xref>), talents in adolescents and adults are seen as performance based on perseverance and dedication in domain-specific activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0162353213492925">Blumen, 2012a</xref>). However, as longitudinal findings show, very few gifted children make it to become eminent adults. And very few talented adults were gifted children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0162353213492925">Alencar, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0162353213492925">Blumen, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Moreover, there are still unsolved issues concerning talent development in Peru: from the need of a comprehensive paradigm to more practical issues related to identification and intervention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0162353213492925">Blumen, 2009</xref>). First, the Spanish term mainly used to refer to the gifted is <italic>superdotado</italic>. Although accepted in Spain, in Latin American Spanish-speaking countries, this term invokes a strong elitist connotation, generating antagonism among experts, teachers, and peers, which leads to the rejection of the gifted. In this sense, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0162353213492925">Blumen’s (2007)</xref> results on a study of social representations of the academically talented by a group of schoolteachers and college professors, by teaching level, showed that misconceptions and stereotypes prevailed regarding talented individuals, because traits related to pathology and physical characteristics were still noted.</p>
<p>Second, the legal framework to provide special services for the gifted and talented must be reviewed, particularly in relation to acceleration and early entrance to universities. It is often found in the news that 14-year-olds have passed the entrance examinations of the most prestigious universities in the country, but <italic>need to wait</italic> 2 to 3 years to be accepted as students, which certainly leads to frustration in their willingness to continue college studies. Third, topics about gifted education should be part of any initial teacher training program. Fourth, it is necessary to develop advocacy in the media to support the needs of the gifted and talented, avoiding misconceptions that reinforce misunderstandings and myths about giftedness. Finally, due to the poverty in which most Peruvian gifted children develop, they are vulnerable to being captured by so-called preparatory schools that offer free tuition in return for participating in marketing campaigns. Therefore, it is important to develop foundations based on scientific and ethical criteria that provide support to the talented children and youths in Peru (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0162353213492925">Blumen, 2012b</xref>).</p>

<title>Most Difficult Issues That Need to Be Addressed</title>
<p>According to the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0162353213492925">World Bank (2011)</xref> data, inequalities in education and income were related to problems of social exclusion and marginalization, and still exist in the highlands and the Amazon basin, where most of the indigenous population lives. In addition, Peru lost ground in the 2010 Gender Inequality Index (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0162353213492925">BTI, 2012</xref>), and the percentage of people living in shantytowns is very high in comparison with the Latin American average expected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0162353213492925">Central Intelligence Agency [CIA], 2013</xref>). Moreover, having developed literature based on empirical studies, the main concern is to rank prescribed policies in terms of potential cost-effectiveness, based on research. It is known that there are schools that produce good results even though their clientele is poor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0162353213492925">Chauvin, 2000</xref>). However, there are few credible models of systemic interventions that truly work in driving cognitive development among those living under poverty conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0162353213492925">World Bank, 2007</xref>). The most significant difficulty that remains is related to clear policy agreements on the variables affecting learning, as well as implementing solutions that agree on standards, management, and the spending needed.</p>
<p>In this sense, there is a need for a theoretical framework to identify the gifted and talented in a context shaped with multiculturalism and poverty, taking into consideration that (a) the native population and girls are underrepresented in domain-specific academic talents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0162353213492925">Alencar, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0162353213492925">Blumen et al., 2004</xref>), (b) nutrition and schooling are significant variables in any screening or identification process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0162353213492925">Blumen, 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0162353213492925">2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0162353213492925">Pollit, 2007</xref>), (c) resilience-associated factors must be considered in socially excluded and marginalized communities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0162353213492925">Blumen, 2008a</xref>), (d) the central system style curriculum exhibits low levels of flexibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0162353213492925">Blumen, 2001b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0162353213492925">MINEDU, 1983</xref>), and (e) the definition of giftedness and talent needs to be culturally relevant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0162353213492925">Blumen, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>There is a need to provide incentives for enterprises that promote giftedness in different domain-specific talents nationwide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0162353213492925">Blumen, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0162353213492925">Pereyra, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0162353213492925">PUCP, 2010</xref>). Therefore, it is of utmost importance to familiarize the population with the literature on the gifted and talented, and to expand teacher training workshops on gifted education as well as develop advocacy in the media.</p>

<title>Most Important Contribution to Gifted Education Made in Peru</title>
<p>Studies done with the gifted and talented in Peru emphasized first the relevance of context for talent development. Taking into consideration that the term <italic>gifted</italic> involves comparison, children could be called gifted at very different levels of achievement. While in highly selective private schools some students might be seen as unintelligent by their school peers, they might be considered gifted in another school with lower standards. This particular situation happens every year while some IB schools welcome gifted children from other low-standard schools to their special talent search lateral entrance to fifth grade (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0162353213492925">Alencar &amp; Blumen, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0162353213492925">Blumen, 2001a</xref>).</p>
<p>Second, in ethno-linguistic diverse countries, such as most of the Latin American countries, it is mostly necessary to consider environmental factors in any definition that aims to describe giftedness or talent development. Furthermore, if we take into consideration (a) the importance of nutrition in school achievement and its relation to the development of cognition in the human being, and (b) the relevance of prior schooling—relative to chronological age—especially in poor and disadvantaged areas (rural and shantytowns), and its relation to intelligence test performance. Therefore, nutrition and schooling are factors that might be considered in any paradigm expected to explain giftedness and talent in this area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0162353213492925">Blumen, 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0162353213492925">2012</xref>).</p>
<p>Third, most Latin American talented adults, who became creatively productive in their communities, even though they came from very poor families, also exhibit high levels of resilience. Therefore, it would be important to study the relationship between resilience and giftedness in this region, especially under disadvantaged and poverty conditions. Fourth, although hereditary influence is important, in countries where there are significant gaps between the quality of public and private educational services, giftedness and talent would be more appropriate to be considered as the development of expertise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0162353213492925">Sternberg, 2000</xref>), that is dependent on environmental stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0162353213492925">Blumen, 2002</xref>), as can be seen following the results of the Peruvian Math Olympic Team. Fifth, scientific theory should support any identification process in the different Latin American educational systems, which need to establish goals in terms of the pedagogical demands and the theoretical constructs that support the process. Sixth, it is necessary to state the method that guides the process, as diagnostic decisions should be made on the basis of valid results from standardized testing, and not on the basis of subjective decisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0162353213492925">Blumen, 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0162353213492925">2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Finally, there is still an unsolved issue that is related to the nature of the talented. If talent is considered as the ability to be knowing the answers to questions, then the talented in Latin American countries will be strongly attracted to educational opportunities, which are scarce for the majority of children living under poverty conditions. However, if talent is considered as the ability to know what questions to ask, then schools will become a place for learning to inquire and the development of talent may not necessarily be related to socioeconomic status, but to the efforts of well-trained teachers and supportive parents. However, in the future of education, what will be valued will be the ability to know what questions to ask, as knowledge itself will be readily available (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0162353213492925">Blumen, 2012b</xref>).</p>

<title>Most Important Research Findings</title>
<p>Since 1978, the research carried out in Peru was mainly of the descriptive and comparative types, and the relationships between variables such as the demographic and socioeconomic level and creativity were examined. In the 1980s, various mediating and conditioning processes were incorporated into research. In this period, creativity was defined as a measurable rational function, which developed through constant and voluntary practice. In the middle of the decade, the first research with talented children started (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0162353213492925">CONCYTEC, 1989</xref>) with the aim to detect highly able children and to help them become productive members of society.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the 1990s, research was focused on specific cognitive domains related to creative ability. Proposals and methodological suggestions were made regarding how creativity could be oriented and expressed in different ways, and more practical tendencies emerged in the research. At that point, theoretical and methodological proposals aimed at achieving a complete use of the human resources to improve the development of the country (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0162353213492925">Alencar et al., 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>In an attempt to integrate scientific research with the professional work done at schools, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0162353213492925">Blumen (2000)</xref> developed an experimental study to analyze the effects of a teacher training workshop on creativity, cognition, and school achievement. Results revealed that trained teachers were instrumental in serving the needs of the gifted in the school setting, and that the use of standardized instruments was fundamental in any gifted screening and identification process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0162353213492925">Alencar et al., 2000</xref>). Also the multidimensionality of the talented concept was supported, and assessment elements appropriate to rapid screening based on school achievement were established. The findings imply that school placement criterion should consider multiple indicators, and not be restricted by chronological age, but be flexible in terms of learning abilities. It seems that in Peru, chronological age is interfering in gifted screening processes, as the intellectual quotient (IQ) interfered in human intelligence studies in the past century.</p>
<p>In December 1997, the book <italic>Nuestros niños son talentosos</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0162353213492925">Mönks et al., 1997</xref>) was published as the first book in the country to call advocacy toward the needs of the talented and to promote appropriate educational programs. In January 1999, the European Advanced Diploma in Educating the Gifted, sponsored by the European Council for High Ability was started in Lima (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0162353213492925">Blumen, 2000</xref>). Peruvian candidates came from the religious and nonreligious private (35%) and public (64%) sector. Afterward, the trained teachers worked on a national basis to promote gifted education in Peru (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0162353213492925">Blumen, 2001a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0162353213492925">2002</xref>). From 1997 to 2008, approximately 10,000 elementary public school children, have benefited from having enrichment programs in their regular classrooms of inclusive schools. Among them, approximately 500 talented children, their parents, and their teachers received special attention.</p>
<p>Personality characteristics of the intellectually gifted living under poverty conditions were described on a study with the Rorschach Psychodiagnostic test (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0162353213492925">Blumen &amp; Cornejo, 2006</xref>). Participants were 55 boys and girls (27 intellectual gifted, 28 nongifted), age range 9 to 12, previously selected with the multifactorial model of giftedness for a former study. Results revealed that the intellectually gifted children exhibit the following personality characteristics: (a) tendency to approach situations from personal reflections, (b) sophisticated emotional resources, (c) high levels of initiative and creativity, (d) tendency to perfectionism, (e) need to control situations, (f) unconventionality, (g) high levels of sensibility, (h) oppositeness, as well as (i) insight resources. They also exhibited characteristics expected in poverty contexts such as cautiousness and low level of self-confidence, high levels of stress and alert toward the environment, as well as tendency to depression. Recommendations for intervention purposes were given, as well as the need to develop research lines from a multidisciplinary approach.</p>
<p>The most important research findings about gifted and talented children in Peru were the positive impact of teacher training programs in the development of creativity and talent among student teachers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0162353213492925">Blumen, 2005</xref>) and of students in enrichment programs in school settings. The empirical data provided support for the following: (a) to lobby with officers of the Ministry of Education, and policy makers to improve the provisions available for the gifted and talented nationwide, particularly for the underserved population; (b) to prepare the legal framework for launching the Residential Academy of Arts and Sciences in Lima, serving the academically talented youth who come from poverty; (c) to expand in-service teacher training programs in gifted education; (d) to include gifted education training in teacher preparation programs.</p>

<title>Future Directions on Research and Program Development</title>
<p>Peru has made progress in the field of high ability in the past few decades. However, there are still many recommendations to follow: (a) The promotion of comparative research about the beliefs and conceptions on giftedness between the Peruvian natives and other native groups is desirable; (b) it is imperative to study culture-fitted provisions for the talented students coming from ethno-linguistic diverse societies to offer them advanced placement classes, through a self-selection process monitor by teacher orientation; (c) gifted education contents should be included in the pedagogical formation curricula; (d) acceleration and homeschooling programs need to be developed to provide enrichment to the gifted living on rural areas where multigraded schools still prevailed; and (e) networking among schools using the virtual modality is always a less expensive alternative to establish monthly activities with their talented students, as well as to provide them with advanced virtual modality courses.</p>
<p>Finally, it is of utmost importance to improve our understanding about talent development under ethno-linguistically diverse and poverty contexts. Formal lineaments of talent promotion are needed, with the commitment of civil society, and the policy makers, involving the participation of the enterprises and colleges/universities, supporting talent development with social responsibility.</p>
