<p>When regularly teaching a course called “Social Justice in Film and Literature,” I use Nicole Rafter’s earlier book, <italic>Shots in the Mirror: Crime Films and Society</italic> (2006), which has wide appeal for students with a range of majors and interests. Therefore, I was intrigued by Rafter and Michelle Brown’s new book that connects criminological theories to crime films. Students generally love watching and talking about movies, yet they do not always love reading about theory. Sad but true, as Rafter and Brown state themselves, “students often find theory dry and abstruse, and they discover that it is difficult to relate theory to practice” (p.1). Engaging students by connecting theory to popular culture has the potential to make an often dry subject come to life.</p>
<p>Films about crime vividly contextualize victims and offenders and the community that responds to them in ways that reading about crime theory often fails to do. My first exposure to the power of explaining justice concepts through film was at a Law and Society summer institute in the early 1990s where we saw the Dutch film, “A Question of Silence.” Echoing the conventions of film noir, this movie raised questions and contradictions, defied easy resolutions, and stimulated passionate discussion. Engaging college students with films that convey the complexities of crime and challenge them to explore academic criminology within this context accomplishes the same end.</p>
<p>In each chapter of their book, Rafter and Brown choose a film to discuss a particular theory: rational choice, biological, psychological, social disorganization, strain, social learning, labeling, conflict, feminism, and life course. They present theories in the chronological order of when they were introduced in the canon, yet the chapters can also stand alone. The theme throughout the book is how movies contextualize lifeless “actors” (as we often see them portrayed in theory), so that offenders’ motivations and the consequences of their behavior come alive. Rafter and Brown draw a parallel between films and qualitative research in that both offer “thick description” and rich narrative.</p>
<p>The treatment of criminological theories is solid and avoids excessive academic jargon, thus making the book accessible. The authors have a knack for presenting the central premises of each theory, providing reasons for the theory’s significance, and offering critiques of each theory. Two chapters that feature psychological and biological theories, for example, situate these as paradigms to explain criminality in terms of individual factors, a great grounding that connects later to more social structural theories of social disorganization, strain, and subcultural causation. Their solid handling of the overlap between academics and popular culture is evident throughout the book, allowing students to make connections between crime as performance and crime that evolves from relationships between people and their social environments.</p>
<p>The authors could have situated their discussions more deeply in the historical context in which each theory appeared, however. The lack of such a perspective is evident, especially when they turn to critical perspectives in criminological theory and films (“Capturing the Friedmans,” “City of God,” “Do the Right Thing,” “Thelma and Louise”) that reflected a nation’s fears related to the war on drugs, the sex offender next door, the potential-sometimes-volatile mix of race and violence, and the threat posed by feminism. Some of the authors’ interpretations also seemed far fetched: for example, their attribution of Norman Bates’ murderous impulses in Hitchcock’s “Psycho” to an anal fixation. Seems a stretch, though now I will never think of “Rear Window” in quite the same way.</p>
<p>One could also wonder about Rafter and Brown’s choice of films, particularly given the huge array of possibilities. They privilege the classics (for example, “Psycho” or “Double Indemnity”) while ignoring more recent and more relevant (at least for students) alternatives. The typical college students who might take this course were born in the early 1990s and in my experience, have rarely seen crime and justice classics such as “To Kill a Mockingbird” or “Twelve Angry Men.” Why not showcase “A Simple Plan” or “Set it Off” when discussing rational choice theory?</p>
<p>This is connected to another striking omission; except for one chapter on feminist theory, Rafter and Brown discuss no films with leading female characters or with plots centrally involving women. The gender is male and masculine. Even in the discussion of “Thelma and Louise,” there is little mention of bonds between women and how this stands in contrast to other films/theories about boys/men/masculinity. There are no questions about how viewers might perceive this film and the women’s choices differently based on their socio-economic group or race and how much credibility and assistance they have or have not received from police and other criminal justice professionals. “Set It Off” features a full ensemble cast of African American women and highlights the structural inequalities in their neighborhoods, relationships, and working conditions. In fact, Rafter and Brown discuss gender only in the feminist theory chapter. In doing this, the authors fall into the same trap for which they criticize mainstream and early theorists: making it appear that only men are interesting enough to study. The discussion throughout could benefit from more focus on gender and intersections of gender/race/class and sexuality, perhaps drawing on films like “Boys Don’t Cry” or “Mi Vida Loca.”</p>
<p>This book, in combination with the movies that frame each chapter, though perhaps with updates in some cases (the authors do provide a list of other films that illustrate each theory) would work best in an undergraduate crime theory class that has the ability to view the films, or a popular culture and crime class. It is a welcome addition to the literature.</p>
