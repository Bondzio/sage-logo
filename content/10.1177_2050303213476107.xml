<abstract>
<p>A brief overview of Marx's account of religion is followed by a consideration of a conception of liberation—a notion shared by marxists and adherents of religious traditions alike—that is substantive enough to overcome the marginalization and exploitation of countless numbers of human beings. The final section deals with the possibility of a rapprochement between the marxist and the adherent of a religious tradition.</p>

<p>This article has the following sections: (i) a very brief overview of Marx’s own positions on the subject of “religion”;<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-2050303213476107">1</xref></sup> (ii) a conceptualization of the principles underlying these positions as a possible prolegomenon to a philosophy of liberation; and (iii) a consideration of the possibility of practical alliances between marxists and “religionists” in projects that have liberation as their aim.</p>
<p>Marx’s approach to “religion” can be delineated in terms of three somewhat overlapping and mutually supportive elements: (i) a view of religion as the source of alienation; (ii) an analysis of religion in terms of “false consciousness”; and (iii) a depiction of religion as a compensatory mechanism par excellence, whose rationale is to bring solace or hope to those who find it difficult or impossible to come to terms with life on this earth.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-2050303213476107">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>Marx’s thesis that religion is a manifestation of human alienation has its antecedents in Hegel and Feuerbach (in Feuerbach’s words: “To enrich God, man must become poor; that God may be all, man must be nothing”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-2050303213476107">3</xref></sup>). This Feuerbachian motif is carried through by Marx in his <italic>The Critique of Hegel’s Philosophy of Right</italic> (1844):
<disp-quote>
<p><italic>Man makes religion</italic>, religion does not make man. Religion is, indeed, the self-consciousness and self-esteem of man who has either not yet won through to himself, or has already lost himself again. But man is no abstract being squatting outside the world. Man is the world of man—state, society. This state and this society produce religion, which is an <italic>inverted consciousness of the world</italic>, because they are an <italic>inverted world</italic>. Religion is the general theory of this world, its encyclopaedic compendium, its logic in popular form, its spiritual <italic>point d’honneur</italic>, its enthusiasm, its moral sanction, its solemn complement, and its universal basis of consolation and justification. It is the <italic>fantastic realization</italic> of the human essence since the <italic>human essence</italic> has not acquired any true reality. The struggle against religion is, therefore, indirectly the struggle <italic>against that world</italic> whose spiritual <italic>aroma</italic> is religion.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-2050303213476107">4</xref></sup></p></disp-quote></p>
<p>The notion that human religiosity is the disavowed exteriorization of a world that the human being is alienated from is complemented by Marx’s proposition that religion is a form of false consciousness—in a world of corruption and suffering the function of religion is to join the state in inducing in us a form of consciousness that transmutes the world of suffering and misery into the (chimerical) promise of its blissful opposite.</p>
<p>Religion therefore serves to provide compensation (albeit one based on fantasy) for those who dwell in a heartless world: “<italic>Religious</italic> suffering is, at one and the same time, the <italic>expression</italic> of real suffering and a <italic>protest</italic> against real suffering. Religion is the sigh of the oppressed creature, the heart of a heartless world, and the soul of soulless conditions. It is the <italic>opium</italic> of the people”.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-2050303213476107">5</xref></sup> It is clear from this passage that Marx believed it futile to pursue the outright suppression of religion or to seek a promulgation of atheism by decree: as long as humans continue to live in a heartless world, the ideological formation that is the core of religion would be inexpungible. The crucial need, therefore, is not the abolition of religion by fiat, but the abolition of the heartless world that is the fount and origin of the religious impulse. Whatever happens to this impulse, primacy has to be ceded to the task of emancipation: only an emancipated world will be in a position potentially to dispense with religion.</p>
<p>What, in a form involving some kind of expansion or theoretical efflorescence, can be taken from these Marxian propositions regarding the nature and function of religion? The crux of any attempt at such an amplification has to be the project of emancipation—without this focus on emancipation there can be no real connection with the thought of Marx and his intellectual heirs where religion is concerned. If Marx is centrally concerned with a “grammar” of liberation, then, clearly, so are many religious traditions. Is this seeming affinity merely fortuitous, or can something more be made of it?</p>
<p>Marx (like Max Weber) clearly believes that the fundamental aspiration of the various doctrines and practices associated with religion is to provide a solution (albeit one that is false and ultimately unworkable in the case of religion) to the “problem” of the world, it being the goal of the seeker of salvation or liberation to find a way of resolving the problem of a basic recalcitrance of the world. (Liberation or salvation here being understood typically as liberation <italic>from</italic> some unacceptable state of the world or condition attendant upon one's being in the world. Marx, of course, went much further than this, because it is clear that for him any liberation <italic>from</italic> this unacceptable state of the world is inextricably bound up with the liberation <italic>of</italic> the world, a liberation which has the overcoming of the capitalist system of production and accumulation at its heart.)</p>
<p>Liberation, in whatever way it is expressed or embodied, is more than anything else the name of a desire, in this case the desire to overcome, circumvent, or ameliorate an unacceptable condition of living in the world, whether individual or transindividual or both. It can also be the name of the extinction of that desire—the desire to end desire is also “simply” that—a desire—albeit one of a peculiar kind, as we know from certain schools of Buddhist philosophy. Liberation is thus a <italic>concept</italic> internally related to that desire (including the desire for the cessation of desire itself), and as such has to be approached through an analysis of the conditions and functions of that primordial desire—its names, its situations, its outcomes, and its productions.</p>
<p>The production of our world as world, indeed any world, begins with a primordial desire, as indicated by a remark from Spinoza's <italic>Ethics</italic> that is central to this account of liberation as a concept: “we neither strive for, nor will, nor want, nor desire anything because we judge it to be good; on the contrary, we judge something to be good because we strive for it, will it, want it, and desire it.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-2050303213476107">6</xref></sup> If this is the case, an ethics of liberation depends on a conceptually prior ontology of human constitutive power, because it is this ontology that charts the various trajectories and configurations of our desire, and thus allows an ethics to emerge as a kind of reflection based on this (prior) knowledge of desire (this in a nutshell being Spinoza's own program). This ontology of human constitutive power will delineate what it is that the ensembles of desire that go by the name “human” are capable of, what their antipathies and attractions are, including those that, however troublingly, point to something that seems to be beyond what is now taken to constitute “the human.”</p>
<p>All this is in accordance, at least in principle, with Marx’s notion of “species being” (<italic>Gattungswesen</italic>), a concept preferred by him to the more usual “human nature” (Marx found “human nature” to possess too many residues of a bygone idealist philosophy with its problematic stress on the universality and invariability of the being, the <italic>essential</italic> being, of humanhood, and maintained that even Feuerbach, from whom he takes the term “species being”, succumbed to this idealism in his account of the term).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-2050303213476107">7</xref></sup> “Species being” for Marx designates the manifestation or realization of our being in an always specific and contingent social and historical milieu, even though there is, of course, a biological underpinning to all manifestations of the human. In the <italic>Grundrisse</italic>, Marx defines our nature as a “totality of needs and drives, which exerts a force upon me,” clearly indicating that for him, as with Spinoza, the human species is a highly complex amalgam of plasticity and invariance (the latter owing primarily to our constitution as biological beings).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-2050303213476107">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>It is not, however, being claimed here that it is possible to chart a progression that moves from this (Spinozist-Marxian) ontology to some kind of culminating-point in “religion,” with something like an ethics somehow mediating between the ontology and “religion.” On the contrary, it is inevitably in the nature of the religious traditions to provide for their adherents something very much like this ontology, that is, the framing of a vision of who or what we are, whether in the form of a cosmography (as in a doctrine of creation) or an anthropology, whether descriptive or normative. However, in reflecting on liberation as a <italic>concept</italic>, this ontology has to be accorded priority, if only because a religious tradition is a system of truth effects, and any truth effect (or blend of truth effects) can, depending on historical and social circumstances (these, of course, always being political), be prevented from displaying itself (or themselves). A truth effect does not produce automatically, and hence cannot guarantee, its own mode of actualization; it cannot of itself banish the historical conditions, whatever they may be, that could in principle obviate its realization as a truth effect. (This, of course, is true of any system of thought, including the ontology of constitutive power being canvassed here: as a regime of truth effects it too cannot institute its own modes of existence, and it too can be prevented from realizing its truth effects.)<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-2050303213476107">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>A truth effect, on this account, is the product of desire, often having the force and character of a “project,” in this case a “project” motivated by a particular arrangement of this constitutive desire or striving. For instance, Martin Luther King Jr desiring the freedom of black Americans (and thus the abolition of racially discriminatory laws in the southern United States) is a truth effect because this desire functions as an enabling (though, of course, not a sufficient) condition for launching a project seeking the removal of all that stands in the way of the realization of that desire. We could call this a “truism” of the logic of desire, inasmuch as to desire <italic>x</italic> is to be disposed, no matter how weakly or unevenly, to make true (at least in the mind of the one who harbors this desire) all that conduces to the attainment of <italic>x</italic>.</p>
<p>A question remains with regard to this putatively marxian ontology of our constitutive power: although it may succeed in furnishing the conceptual lineaments for a project of liberation, it can surely be asked whether it does enough to provide a viable foundation for practical alliances between marxists and “religionists” in projects that have liberation as their aim? One thorny issue for such a <italic>rapprochement</italic> at the conceptual level is, of course, Marx’s characterization of religion as a merely ideological formation. Another is the undeniable primacy accorded by marxism to class and class antagonism in any emancipatory struggle.</p>
<p>The characterization of religion as a merely ideological formation is not an insurmountable barrier for those seeking a <italic>rapprochement</italic> between marxists and the followers of a religious tradition. Althusser was right when he maintained that ideology is inexpungible—ideology being for him a “representation of the imaginary relationship of individuals to their real conditions of existence”—and none of us (the most erudite and astute marxists included!) is able entirely to transcend the condition of having to depend on forms of the imaginary we are never in a position to acknowledge.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-2050303213476107">10</xref></sup> The project of liberation, regardless of whether it is pursued by the marxist or the religious adherent, will therefore always be infused with these irremovable and inevitable ideological elements. It is precisely for this reason that Althusser deemed ideology to be “eternal” and “without a history”—it is the “unthought” which makes or thinking possible.</p>
<p>The question posed by the centrality for marxism of class in anti-capitalist struggles, and the equally fundamental position of anti-capitalist struggle in marxist conceptualizations of the project of liberation—whereas neither of these may even figure in the liberation sought by the religious person—is rather more difficult to resolve. However, a resolution becomes available if one acknowledges the absolute primacy of struggle <italic>per se</italic> for any version of the marxist paradigm.</p>
<p>In the beginning was struggle. If there is something like a “postulate of reason” for the fusion of theory and practice that is marxism, it is perhaps this one, however commonplace it may appear. The struggles of countless women, children, and men for a better world have taken place over the ages in hugely diverse settings of theory and practice. This diversity is of such breadth and complexity that it cannot be embraced within a single movement—even one as commanding and comprehensive as marxism. Uncountable numbers have engaged in different and not always necessarily compatible ways in such struggles. These struggles have never owed their “relevance” to marxism. Rather, it is marxism, in whatever form, that has owed its “relevance” to them. As long as someone, somewhere and somehow, struggles for liberation it will be possible for marxism to be, or to continue to be, “relevant,” and, equally, for other forms of struggle having nothing to do with class or capitalism to possess their own rationales and forms of plausibility and legitimation.</p>
<p>Moreover, capitalism exercises its dominance in many modes and at many levels, not all of which give the appearance of being directed by the forces and agents of capitalism, and this in turn makes credible the proposition that specifically anti-capitalist struggles are not the only ones germane for those seeking radical and permanent changes in their ways of life. The marxist paradigm has always possessed two primary strands: an account of the bases of (economic) <italic>exploitation</italic>, but also an account of the modes of <italic>domination</italic>, the latter having to operate in tandem with the mechanisms of exploitation if these are to be effective. As such, struggles for gender and racial equality and campaigns against discrimination based on sexual orientation, which constitute struggles against the modes of domination par excellence, have to be seen as potentially reinforcing and decisive fronts, certainly more than mere adjuncts to class and anti-capitalist struggle which are to be exploited tactically when the time is “ripe” by the right-thinking marxist, when it comes to the pursuit of liberation. When it comes to remembering the forgotten of the earth, common cause can be made.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-2050303213476107">11</xref>.</sup></p>

<fn id="fn1-2050303213476107"><label>1</label><p>It is now customary to acknowledge the irreducibly factitious nature of the term “religion,” that <italic>religion</italic> is very much a post-Enlightenment invention of an Orientalist kind, and that it is therefore an invention with a historically and geographically specific character. A great many societies, including the not so distant predecessors of our so-called “western” culture, have organized and conceived of forms of truly adequate relations between their members, and created overarching systems of meaning, without employing anything approximating to our notion of <italic>religion</italic>. Thus, the Buddhist, say, does not necessarily understand what she or he adheres to as amounting to something that constitutes “religion” or “religiosity,” in the way that, say, Durkheim or Hume employ this term in <italic>The Elementary Forms of the Religious Life</italic> or <italic>Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion</italic>. Nevertheless, “religion” will be used in this essay as a term of art to be understood nominalistically—that is, as <italic>religio</italic>, the Latin term designating the disposition towards reverence and the practices accordant with that reverence, however these are contextualized or embodied.</p></fn>

Ideology is transcended only when the conditions underlying this relation between the imaginary representation and our real conditions of existence are laid bare, but this process of ideological demystification will in turn depend on other representations that are perforce unable to transcend the realm of the imaginary, and so on, <italic>ad infinitum</italic>.</p></fn>
<fn id="fn11-2050303213476107"><label>11</label><p>A fairly obvious example of such an entente between marxism and the religious adherent is provided by liberation theology, however fraught the terms of this engagement between them may be. The persecution of liberation theologians by the Vatican is typified by the condemnation made by the current pope in 1983, when he was head of the Vatican's Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, of the theology of Gustavo Gutierrez. Ratzinger accused Gutierrez of emphasizing “orthopraxis” over orthodoxy, and trying to reinterpret Christian teaching in terms of “the marxist myth” (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-2050303213476107">Ratzinger, 2007</xref>). Another problem for contemporary marxism is posed by the fact that religion has clearly survived the occurrence of several communist revolutions. Responses here have been twofold: (i) it can be argued that the sources of alienation have not yet been overcome, so more work needs to be done to bring about the decisive overcoming of alienation; (ii) it can argued that emphasis has to be placed on education, given our propensity to cling to outmoded ideas. However, neither (i) nor (ii) has really worked, hence the willingness of many marxists to acknowledge the liberating elements of religion, or at least those that give expression to the desire for liberation (this being the main point of this essay). Obviously, much more work needs to be done on this issue, which is not possible in a relatively short article.</p></fn></fn-group>
