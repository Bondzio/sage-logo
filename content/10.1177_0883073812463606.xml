<abstract>
<p>Sturge-Weber syndrome has been found to result in hypothalamic-pituitary dysfunction including central hypothyroidism. Because central hypothyroidism is more prevalent in Sturge-Weber syndrome than in the general population, we routinely evaluated thyroid function. Here we describe 5 children with Sturge-Weber syndrome on anticonvulsants and diagnosed with hypothyroidism based on thyroid function testing. All 5 patients were eventually tested utilizing the more accurate free thyroxine equilibrium dialysis assay. Results indicated that only 2 of the 5 patients, who exhibited the most severe symptoms, had true hypothyroidism. This case series demonstrates the benefits of using the free thyroxine by equilibrium dialysis when testing Sturge-Weber syndrome patients on antiepileptic medications. This testing algorithm is more cost-effective and also improves the quality of care by providing an accurate diagnosis more quickly. In addition, we propose consideration of this testing method in any patient taking anticonvulsants, most notably oxcarbazepine.</p>

<body>
<p>Sturge-Weber syndrome is a rare, congenital, neurocutaneous disorder marked by vascular malformations of the brain, eye, and skin (facial capillary malformation—port wine birthmark).<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0883073812463606">1</xref>
</sup> Sturge-Weber syndrome patients present with a malformed venous drainage system and impaired cerebral blood flow through abnormal hypoplastic cortical vessels, leptomeningeal vessels, and enlarged deep venous draining vessels.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0883073812463606">1</xref>
</sup> This can result in cortical atrophy, calcification, and brain injury. As a result, children with Sturge-Weber syndrome can be affected by seizures, strokelike episodes, developmental delays, cognitive impairments, hemiparesis, and visual-field deficits, particularly during the first few years of life.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0883073812463606">2</xref>

</p>
<p>Recently, we described an increased prevalence of growth hormone deficiency in Sturge-Weber syndrome patients.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0883073812463606">3</xref>
</sup> The deficiency was perhaps greater in Sturge-Weber syndrome patients secondary to the sensitivity of the hypothalamic-pituitary axis to vascular insult, particularly in the growth hormone–secreting somatotrophs, thereby increasing the risk of damage with Sturge-Weber syndrome.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0883073812463606">3</xref>
</sup> Our findings of an increased prevalence of growth hormone deficiency instigated research on other central endocrine abnormalities such as central hypothyroidism, which arises from inadequate release of thyroid-stimulating hormone from the pituitary or from inadequate release of thyrotropin-releasing hormone from the hypothalamus.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0883073812463606">4</xref>
</sup> We previously described a small series of patients with symptoms consistent with hypothyroidism, that is, constipation, sleepiness, dry skin, weight gain, attention problems, and low free thyroxine with low-normal thyroid-stimulating hormone levels.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0883073812463606">5</xref>
</sup> A limitation of this study was the inability to determine conclusively the etiology of the hypothyroidism as a central defect versus an aberrancy secondary to antiepileptic medications.</p>
<p>Although the Sturge-Weber syndrome–hypothalamic-pituitary linkage was demonstrated with the growth hormone study, the effect of additional variables, such as medications, needed to be considered as a possible etiology of the thyroid hormone abnormalities. Many anticonvulsants, oxcarbazepine in particular, can cause significant abnormalities in thyroid function (affecting 29%-100% of patients).<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0883073812463606">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0883073812463606">7</xref>
</sup> Oxcarbazepine can increase hormone metabolism (although not as significantly as carbazepine<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0883073812463606">8</xref>
</sup>) and can also alter the binding protein interactions, resulting in thyroid function tests consistent with hypothyroidism.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0883073812463606">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0883073812463606">8</xref>

</sup> Sturge-Weber syndrome patients are often prescribed oxcarbazepine to treat their epilepsy. As a result, in Sturge-Weber syndrome it is often unclear whether abnormal thyroid function tests are due to a propensity toward hypothalamic-pituitary dysfunction that can be caused by Sturge-Weber syndrome itself, as we have previously described for growth hormone, or are secondary to the oxcarbazepine.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0883073812463606">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0883073812463606">6</xref>
</sup> What adds to the difficulty in discerning the etiology of the abnormal thyroid function tests is that oxcarbazepine itself could possibly interfere with the hypothalamic regulation of thyrotropin-releasing hormone.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0883073812463606">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0883073812463606">8</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>In addition, based on our clinical experience, we determined that the standard measurements of free thyroxine can often incorrectly suggest hypothyroidism in children with Sturge-Weber syndrome. We propose that the use of a more sensitive test, specifically free thyroxine by equilibrium dialysis, is necessary in order to diagnosis central hypothyroidism appropriately in this patient population.</p>
<p>Here we report 5 cases of patients treated at the Hunter Nelson Sturge-Weber Center at the Kennedy Krieger Institute who were diagnosed with central hypothyroidism based on low free thyroxine levels. After performing the free thyroxine by equilibrium dialysis on these patients, it was discovered that only 2 patients had low levels of free thyroxine utilizing this more precise assay. One of these patients had central hypothyroidism with normal thyroid-stimulating hormone levels and 1 had primary hypothyroidism with elevated thyroid-stimulating hormone levels. In addition, these 2 patients with low levels of free thyroxine by equilibrium dialysis were the only ones who revealed the classic symptoms consistent with hypothyroidism such as weight gain, dry skin, constipation, sleepiness, and/or attention problems.</p>
<p>We propose that the free thyroxine by equilibrium dialysis be the first-line test along with the thyroid-stimulating hormone in diagnosing hypothyroidism accurately in patients with Sturge-Weber syndrome. The differential in price between the standard free thyroxine assay and that performed by the more precise dialysis method is variable but not dramatic; in some laboratories, the dialysis method is even less expensive. In addition, in most cases, performing the free thyroxine by equilibrium dialysis as first line without having performed an unnecessary standard free thyroxine is overall much more cost effective and time efficient. Most importantly, the equilibrium dialysis method is more accurate in determining the etiology of the thyroid test abnormalities and also prevents unnecessary testing and anxiety in a population of patients who already undergo a multitude of invasive procedures. Therefore, we propose a new testing algorithm for investigating thyroid disorders that improves the quality of care in patients with Sturge-Weber syndrome.</p>

<title>Subjects and Methods</title>
<p>Medical records obtained for 5 children with suspected hypothyroidism were analyzed in a retrospective chart review. Charts were evaluated for side of brain, eye, and skin involvement; clinical signs and symptoms of hypothyroidism; and results of thyroid stimulating hormone, free thyroxine, and free thyroxine by equilibrium dialysis assays.</p>
<p>Free thyroxine measurements using a standard immunoassay were performed by either the electrochemiluminescence immunoassay or the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in either the Johns Hopkins Hospital clinical laboratory or a nationwide clinical laboratory. Free thyroxine by equilibrium dialysis measurements were performed using a direct dialysis method in nationwide clinical laboratories.</p>

<title>Case Histories</title>
<sec id="section3-0883073812463606">
<title>Subject 1</title>
<p>An 8-year-old girl with bilateral Sturge-Weber syndrome brain and skin involvement and glaucoma of the left eye, intermittent hemiparesis, and seizures beginning at 4 months of age, began reporting behavioral and learning difficulties. Her weight was in the 20th percentile (body mass index 10th percentile, standard score of –1.28). She had a growth velocity of 6 cm/y during the previous year.</p>
<p>She was started on methylphenidate (Concerta) 18 mg/d to combat increasing attentional and hyperactivity issues at school. Her free thyroxine level by the routine immunoassay was low (0.73 ng/dL; normal range: 0.9-1.6) with a normal thyroid-stimulating hormone level. Her antithyroglobulin and antiperoxidase antibody tests were negative. Oxcarbazepine dosage was increased to 1050 mg/d. Two months later, the free thyroxine level was still low by the routine free thyroxine assay (0.79 ng/dL; normal range: 0.9-1.6), despite a normal thyroid-stimulating hormone level. She was started on levothyroxine replacement of 12.5 μg/d after documentation of normal cortisol status.</p>
<p>After 4 months, free thyroxine by the standard immunoassay was measured and again found to be low (0.8 ng/dL; normal range: 0.9-1.6) with a normal thyroid-stimulating hormone level. Levothyroxine was increased to 25 μg/d. Over the next month, the patient reported an increase in irritability and began suffering from outburst of anger. The levothyroxine dose was reduced to alternating between 25 μg/d and 12.5 μg/d. One month later, her free thyroxine level by routine methods was still low (0.7 ng/dL; normal range: 0.9-1.6) and the thyroid-stimulating hormone was normal. After 5 months, her free thyroxine level by routine methods again remained low (0.8 ng/dL; normal range: 0.9-1.6) with a normal thyroid-stimulating hormone level, and she continued to have anger problems.</p>
<p>The patient was weaned off the levothyroxine completely over the course of 6 weeks and had free thyroxine levels measured by equilibrium dialysis instead of the standard immunoassay being performed. These tests were performed twice over a 3-month period and revealed normal levels of 1.5 and 1.1 ng/dL (normal range: 0.9-1.6) with normal thyroid-stimulating hormone levels, thereby verifying that there were no true thyroid hormone abnormalities. Her growth velocity remained constant at approximately 6 cm/y over this period. The patient reported that the outbursts of anger and other behavioral symptoms subsided once the levothyroxine was stopped.</p>

<title>Subject 2</title>
<p>An 8-year-old girl with left-sided Sturge-Weber brain and skin involvement, seizures beginning at 16 months of age, and long-standing learning disabilities began suffering from eczema and an increase in seizure frequency. Her weight was at the 59th percentile (body mass index 76th percentile, standard score of 0.72). She had grown at a rate of 6 cm/y over the past year. She was taking oxcarbazepine 300 mg/d.</p>
<p>Two free thyroxine levels by standard immunoassay methods taken over the course of 3 months were both low: 0.86 and 0.80 ng/dL (normal range: 0.9-1.6 ng/dL), respectively. Her thyroid-stimulating hormone levels were in the normal range. Her antithyroglobulin and antiperoxidase antibodies were negative. Four months later, a free thyroxine test was performed by equilibrium dialysis, revealing a normal level of 1.1 ng/dL (normal range: 1.0-2.4) and a normal thyroid-stimulating hormone level, confirming that she had no true thyroid hormone abnormalities. She remained on oxcarbazepine 300 mg/d, and methylphenidate (Ritalin) was added at 10 mg/d.</p>
<p>At the age of 10, the free thyroxine level was again found to be low (0.72 ng/dL; normal range: 0.93-1.60), but a free thyroxine level performed by equilibrium dialysis was normal (1.1 ng/dL; normal range: 1.0-2.4). Her thyroid-stimulating hormone level remained normal. She had grown at a normal rate of 6.5 cm/y over the last year. Her weight was improved at the 45th percentile (body mass index 65th percentile, standard score of 0.38), and she was doing well overall.</p>

<sec id="section5-0883073812463606">
<title>Subject 3</title>
<p>A 15-year-old girl with left-sided Sturge-Weber syndrome brain and skin involvement, glaucoma of the left eye, with seizures beginning at 21 months, began suffering from weight gain from the 75th to 85th percentile in 1 year and attention problems at school (body mass index 95th percentile, standard score of 1.65 at presentation). She was near her adult height of 151 cm. Free thyroxine levels by the routine immunoassay had decreased from normal (0.9 ng/dL; normal range: 0.7-1.6) to low (0.77 ng/dL; normal range: 0.79-1.49) in the last month. Her thyroid-stimulating hormone levels were consistently normal and antithyroid antibody tests were negative. She was started on amphetamine (Adderall) extended release 20 mg/d and carbamazepine extended release 800 mg/d.</p>
<p>A repeat free thyroxine test by equilibrium dialysis 1 month later revealed a normal level at 0.84 ng/dL (normal range: 0.79-1.49). Her thyroid-stimulating hormone level was also normal. Over the next month, the patient reported an improvement in school performance. The patient continued to improve over the next year and reported excellent progress in school. Her carbamazepine extended release was increased to 1200 mg/d. Over the next year the patient continued to lose weight, decreasing to the 69th percentile. Two months later, a free thyroxine test by routine immunoassay was performed, revealing a level of 0.9 ng/dL (normal range: 0.93-1.60) with a normal thyroid-stimulating hormone level. Her carbamazepine extended release was reduced to 400 mg/d.</p>
<p>Two free thyroxine levels by standard methods performed 1 month later were both low (0.85 and 0.91 ng/dL; normal range: 0.93-1.60) but thyroid-stimulating hormone levels were normal. However, a free thyroxine by equilibrium dialysis revealed a normal level of 1.1 ng/dL (normal range: 0.8-1.7), consistent with no true thyroid hormone abnormalities. Her weight was markedly improved at the 67th percentile, as was the body mass index at 87th percentile (standard score of 1.18) without any treatment.</p>

<sec id="section6-0883073812463606">
<title>Subject 4</title>
<p>A 4-year-old girl with right-sided Sturge-Weber brain and bilateral skin involvement, left-sided hemiparesis, and seizures beginning at 26 months of age began suffering from sleepiness, excessive weight gain (92nd percentile, body mass index 97th percentile, standard score of 1.86 at presentation), and behavioral difficulties. Her height was at the 64th percentile. She had been growing well at a velocity of 7.9 cm/y over the past year. She was taking topiramate 200 mg/d and oxcarbazepine suspension 660 mg/d.</p>
<p>At the age of 5, free thyroxine levels by routine immunoassay were low (0.69 ng/dL; normal range: 0.89-1.76), despite normal thyroid-stimulating hormone levels. A repeat test revealed a minimally decreased level of 0.81 ng/dL (normal range: 0.85-1.75). Her thyroid-stimulating hormone level was again normal. Her antithyroglobulin and antiperoxidase antibodies were negative. Her linear growth had slowed to slightly below 5 cm/y, and her height was now at the 49th percentile. Her weight had increased to the 97th percentile with a concomitant increase in body mass index to greater than the 99th percentile (body mass index standard score of 2.81), and the patient complained of fatigue, hunger, constipation, slightly dry skin, a decrease in energy level, and increasing difficulty with school work. Topiramate was increased to 275 mg/d.</p>
<p>A free thyroxine level measured by equilibrium dialysis soon afterwards was found to be low (0.7 ng/dL; normal range: 1.0-2.4) with a low normal thyroid-stimulating hormone level of 0.85 mIU/L (normal range: 0.50-4.30) consistent with central hypothyroidism. Because central hypothyroidism can be associated with other hormonal deficiencies, cortisol status was documented to be normal before starting the patient on levothyroxine replacement at 12.5 μg/d. A repeat free thyroxine level (by the routine immunoassay) was measured 1 month later by equilibrium dialysis, and revealed a normal level of 1.2 ng/dL (normal range: 1.0-2.4). Of note is that the concomitant free thyroxine level by standard immunoassay, without utilizing equilibrium dialysis, still showed low levels. Her weight at this time was slightly improved at the 97th percentile, as was the standard score of 2.52, and she had grown normally at an annualized rate of 6 cm/y over the past year. Six months later, many of the patient’s symptoms had resolved. She reported feeling more energetic and active, having less fatigue, no constipation, and her mother reported that she had been doing much better overall in school after starting levothyroxine replacement.</p>

<title>Subject 5</title>
<p>An 11-year-old girl with left-sided Sturge-Weber syndrome brain involvement and bilateral skin involvement, glaucoma of the right eye, and seizures beginning at 5 years of age, began suffering from constipation, dry skin, feeling cold, frequent sleepiness including falling asleep during class, excessive weight gain (91st percentile, body mass index 94th percentile [standard score of 1.56] at presentation), and poor school performance. During a recent neuropsychological evaluation, she had been too fatigued to finish the afternoon portion of the test. Her height was at the 64th percentile. The patient had been growing at a normal rate of 6.5 cm/y, although slightly low for a pubertal growth velocity. She was on valproic acid for her seizures at that time.</p>
<p>Her thyroid function tests revealed elevated thyroid-stimulating hormone levels (peak of 10.41 mIU/mL; normal range: 0.53-3.59), and her free thyroxine levels by standard methods were in the low normal range; her antithyroglobulin and antiperoxidase antibodies were negative. She was started on levothyroxine replacement at 12.5 μg/d for primary hypothyroidism. Three months later, free thyroxine levels were found to be low (0.77 ng/dL; normal range: 0.93-1.6), and thyroid-stimulating hormone levels were still elevated, again consistent with primary hypothyroidism. Her levothyroxine replacement was increased. After 4 months, the patient was still suffering from sleepiness and fatigue, although there was some improvement in these symptoms. Her levothyroxine was gradually increased to 62.5 μg/d. Free thyroxine levels after this increase were normal by both standard immunoassay and equilibrium dialysis methods (1.0 ng/dL; normal range: 0.7-1.8, and 1.1 ng/dL; normal range, 1.0-2.4, respectively).</p>
<p>Eight months later, she reported an improvement in symptoms. Her school performance had also improved, and she was no longer falling asleep in class. Her constipation, dry skin, and cold intolerance had also improved, and her thyroid-stimulating hormone had normalized.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Secondary to our prior findings of a series of patients with Sturge-Weber syndrome and evidence of central hypothyroidism based on repeatedly low free thyroxine levels and low normal thyroid-stimulating hormone levels, we further tested patients with Sturge-Weber syndrome for central hypothyroidism. As these cases reveal, a low free thyroxine by routine immunoassay (electrochemiluminescence immunoassay or enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assay) is not always accurate in diagnosing hypothyroidism accurately. Patient 1 demonstrated a low free thyroxine when utilizing the standard methods, and as we increased her levothyroxine dose, the low free thyroxine did not resolve; in fact, she soon afterwards demonstrated symptoms consistent with hyperthyroidism. This led us to utilize the more accurate, but less commonly used, free thyroxine by equilibrium dialysis method to determine that she did not truly have central hypothyroidism. Subsequently, we used this more accurate free thyroxine assay to make the appropriate diagnoses in the other cases presented here. This enabled us to exclude the diagnosis of hypothyroidism in 2 other subjects (patients 2 and 3) and to confirm the diagnosis in the last 2 cases (patients 4 and 5) presented here (1 with central and 1 with primary hypothyroidism). The 2 patients with true hypothyroidism displayed low levels of free thyroxine by equilibrium dialysis and had many of the symptoms associated with hypothyroidism (sleepiness, fatigue, weight gain, constipation, attention problems, and dry skin). The other 3 patients had less clearly defined symptoms such as attention problems, dry skin, and increased seizures.</p>
<p>Sturge-Weber syndrome patients taking oxcarbazepine to treat epilepsy may have a disruption of hypothalamic–pituitary function as a result of the Sturge-Weber syndrome itself, as we have demonstrated previously that there is an increased prevalence of the central hormonal deficiency of growth hormone.<sup>

<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0883073812463606">3</xref>
</sup> affecting the endocrine system, including growth hormone and thyroid hormone.</p>
<p>Patients 4 and 5 suffered from most of the classical symptoms of hypothyroidism including fatigue, lethargy, constipation, school difficulty, weight gain, and increased hunger. Both had low free thyroxine levels by standard immunoassay techniques (electrochemiluminescence immunoassay or enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assay). Patient 4 had a low free thyroxine by equilibrium dialysis and low normal thyroid-stimulating Shormone levels before thyroxine replacement, consistent with central hypothyroidism. She started levothyroxine after documentation of normal cortisol status, and her symptoms were relieved. Patient 5 was started on levothyroxine replacement for primary hypothyroidism. She had elevated thyroid-stimulating hormone levels and low to low normal free thyroxine levels by equilibrium dialysis. Her symptoms gradually improved, and the thyroid function tests normalized as the levothyroxine dosage was increased appropriately. Patients 1, 2, and 3 all had low free thyroxine levels by standard immunoassay methods with normal thyroid-stimulating hormone levels. On further investigation, their levels of free thyroxine by equilibrium dialysis were normal, documenting normal thyroid function and implicating the antiepileptic medications as the cause of the initial free thyroxine abnormalities.</p>
<p>An important finding from our case series is that although the free thyroxine by equilibrium dialysis is not performed routinely as a first-line test as is the free thyroxine by standard immunoassay techniques (electrochemiluminescence immunoassay/enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assay), it is a necessity to screen accurately for hypothyroidism in Sturge-Weber syndrome patients. Low levels of free thyroxine detected by routine methods can be secondary to oxcarbazepine usage producing artifactual abnormalities not reflecting true endocrine dysfunction. Starting the laboratory evaluation with the free thyroxine by equilibrium dialysis saves time and avoids repeated blood draws as well as unwarranted concern for the patients, families, and physicians. In addition, this testing method is often cost-effective, given that fewer tests are necessary if this method is utilized first-line and also given that the free thyroxine by equilibrium dialysis is not necessarily of greater expense than the routine method. Correctly diagnosing and treating hypothyroidism is important in the Sturge-Weber syndrome population because normal thyroid function is vital to normal brain development. Moreover, free thyroxine by equilibrium dialysis may also be the preferred screening test for patients on anticonvulsants such as oxcarbazepine used for other underlying conditions.</p>
<p>In conclusion, if a Sturge-Weber syndrome patient presents with typical symptoms of hypothyroidism, we recommend that he or she be initially screened by free thyroxine by equilibrium dialysis, and treated as appropriate. Because in our experience the standard free thyroxine assay by electrochemiluminescence immunoassay/enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assay is often inaccurate, we suggest testing first with the free thyroxine by equilibrium dialysis, rather than the more commonly used free thyroxine in order to avoid possible misdiagnosis and the need for repeated testing to make or exclude the diagnosis of hypothyroidism. This is not only more cost effective overall but also improves the quality of care and anxiety in these patients by decreasing the number of tests needed and providing an accurate diagnosis more quickly.</p>
