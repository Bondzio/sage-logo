<abstract>
<p>The article deals with different manifestations of localism in Italy. The beginning of research on localism, with the exclusion of older backward community studies, can be dated to the 1980s. It has three main areas of meaning: as the space directly controlled by the senses; as the source of a special economic development; as the desirable level of governance. However, all these perspectives neglect the importance of relations and their spatial form. This is compensated with the assembly of a framework of local places based on the length and symmetry of relations; an operation which yields four types of locale: island, ghetto, periphery and network. The article uses this framework to analyse manifestations of localism in Italy. These are industrial districts, midstream regional federalism, and the rise of the Northern League party. Political mobilisation is considered to be the final and most inclusive dimension of localism. Such mobilisation signals a forward local society no longer based on amoral familism.</p>

<sec id="sec1-0269094212474871" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Localism can be many things; too many, until it comes to mean the opposite. One way not to be overwhelmed by the plethora of references is to consider uses of localism against a specific background consisting of social research on rural Italy after the Second World War. This is the author’s spatial-temporal framework in which to include the analysis of localism. Its ingredients were the predominance of the primary sector (agriculture, cattle raising, forestry), the small scale, and the restricted loyalties. All these ingredients were summed up in the term ‘backwardness’, a sort of initial point of a continuum whose other extreme was full modernity.</p>
<p>The small rural village of southern Italy analysed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0269094212474871">Banfield’s (1958)</xref> famous study, which the title of this article recalls, represents that perspective, even if it bore the hopeful label of ‘community study’. This article takes a different approach in that it centres on the relation, its qualities, and its morphology. By ‘qualities’ are meant the rules of interaction, and by ‘morphology’ the spatial forms where the relation happens, bearing in mind the recursive influence between the relation and the place. Then, after a description of the main meanings of ‘local’, the article illustrates different combinations of space and relations which produce a typology of places. Some Italian cases (industrial district, federalism, and local political party) will be used to exemplify this typology.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-0269094212474871"><title>The many meanings of localism</title>
<p>Among the many meanings of ‘local’, three seem to be important according to the premises stated in the introduction: <italic>local as a specific kind of relation</italic> (short term, face-to-face, intense); <italic>local as a turning point in economic processes</italic> (local development); and <italic>local as an ideal level of governance</italic> (local democracy, subsidiarity). The first meaning can be introduced with the words of Giddens: ‘Place is best conceptualised by means of the idea of locale, which refers to the physical settings of social activity as situated geographically’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0269094212474871">Giddens, 1990</xref>: 18); ‘The importance of localised relations organised in terms of place, where place has not yet become transformed by distanciated time-space relations’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0269094212474871">Giddens, 1990</xref>: 101). Giddens shares the most classic idea among sociologists of the locale: a (small) physical space that sets social relations; if they are traditional, place and space overlap; if they are modern, the space of reference for the relations is wider than the locale and includes absent persons and distant places.</p>
<p>This representation was a way of emptying the notion of territory: if in every phase of a relation a reference can be made to wider or more distant places, then the locale, the <italic>hic et nunc</italic>, does not matter. This is the idea of globalisation, steering relations, de-territorialisation, and so on (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0269094212474871">Meyrowitz, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0269094212474871">Tomlinson, 1999</xref>), but it is a misleading idea because it confuses the cognitive dimension of social relations with their physical base and development. Of course, in modern times, well-educated and socialised people have many links and references to other people throughout the world; but the quality of a relation is profoundly different when it is direct, that is, in a condition of co-presence in both traditional and modern settings. The distinction between acquaintance with other people and the real physical relation <italic>hic et nunc</italic> with them must be maintained. In a local relation, bodies encounter each other in the fullness of their expressions.</p>
<p>A better representation of locale is provided by other authors less concerned to mark a difference between tradition and modernity. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0269094212474871">Goffman (1959)</xref>, for example, gives a definition of <italic>territory</italic> as the portion of space which is without obstacles to the reciprocal view. This is nearer to an original idea of locale. Local settings are those under the control of the senses, in particular, eyesight. Local is then a matter of direct perception with the minimal contribution of devices like glasses or microphones. Classical authors like <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0269094212474871">Merleau-Ponty (2004)</xref><sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0269094212474871">1</xref></sup> or <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0269094212474871">De Certeau (1990)</xref><sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0269094212474871">2</xref></sup> allow one to complete the representation of locale.</p>
<p>This representation makes it possible to conceptualise practices as typically local or situated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0269094212474871">Johnston, 2001</xref>). They are repertoires of actions inextricably linked to a specific place. The same rational action – buying the most convenient good – is deeply intertwined with a local place, so deeply that the result may vary greatly as well (buying or not buying another item, for example). In fact, practice is used to interpret consumerism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0269094212474871">Spaargaren, 2011</xref>). Motivations, values and habits match places where other people possibly are present. The meeting produces a broad range of outcomes.</p>
<p>Not only cognition of space matters. In a precognitive or practical view, the local is the original context of every physical interaction for people independently of how many persons they know, how educated they are, whether they are cosmopolitan or narrow-minded. In this way the traditional dichotomies lose importance. Local settings are everywhere, in the city as in the countryside, in sedentary as well in neo-nomadic groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0269094212474871">Agnew, 2011</xref>). Local becomes the range of direct interactions. To be introduced into this version of local is a further meaning, that of habitus. Frequent interactions in the same places produce automatic behaviours. The local is thus the main space of routines and tacit knowledge, while indirect or long-distance relations are more interpretable in terms of other categories: rational choice, willingness to interact, verbal communication.</p>
<p>Localism acquires another interesting connotation when it is related to economic change. In this case, the watchword is ‘local development’. Put briefly, the main interpretations of social change were for long based on two opposite paradigms: the functionalism of Talcott <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0269094212474871">Parsons (1971)</xref> and the several variants of Marxist analysis (for a review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0269094212474871">Martinelli, 2005</xref>). The two perspectives shared the same emphasis on the <italic>national level</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0269094212474871">Martinelli, 2005</xref>). The local level was not contemplated.</p>
<p>When was the idea of ‘local development’ put forward? If we follow Storper in answering this question, the resurgence of regional economy studies dates to the 1980s. ‘Region is seen as the locus of what economists are beginning to call untraded interdependencies, which take the form of conventions, informal rules and habits that coordinate economic actors in conditions of uncertainty’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0269094212474871">Storper, 1997</xref>: 5). ‘The main schools (that) have participated in the debate (are): those interested in institutions, those focusing on industrial organizations and transactions, and those who concentrate their attention on technological change and learning’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0269094212474871">Storper, 1997</xref>: 4).</p>
<p>This classification specifies certain aspects of localism. Storper includes, in the school of thinking interested in institutions, studies on Third Italy industrial districts and Piore and Sabel’s flexible specialisation. Institutions are conceived as informal rules able to instil loyalty among the different economic actors working in the firm clusters. If local is seen as the chance to meet frequently inside and outside the factory, employers and employees can develop a trustful climate and exchange valued information on innovations and market trends.</p>
<p>The second approach to local development, which Storper calls the ‘California school’, is based on a similar phenomenon but explained in a different way: in order to deal with increasing uncertainty, many firms prefer to disintegrate the vertical organisation of work. That means externalising certain tasks, thus facilitating the proliferation of small firms. This reduces the risk of overproduction and allows better specialisation; but it also increases transaction costs. Then local agglomeration is seen as a way to reduce the increased input-output costs of firms. Being nearby – this is the meaning of local – produces an advantage in terms of knowledge exchange, especially of less codified (tacit) knowledge. A sort of general rule thus ensues: for less vertically organised factories, it is more convenient to be smaller and very close to each other.</p>
<p>Knowledge exchange is at the centre of the third school of thinking as well. In this case, the economic development of a particular area is explained with its capacity to create strong agreements among different actors: firms, universities, local bodies. The emphasis is on the spin-off and spill-over processes. Universities or research institutes create for-profit units in very innovative fields which contaminate other local firms; local authorities provide institutional support for the process and create fringe benefits in order to attract skilled workers. The local dimension seems rather weak in this case. Of course, spill-overs and spin-offs have a spatial dimension; they probably come about in conditions of spatial continuity and accumulation with a sort of path/spatial dependency.</p>
<p>All these declinations of localism are focused on the supply side of the economic system. They underestimate the relationship between producers and consumers or the possible role of their intermediaries (services sector). The local scale is seen as a means to acquire greater efficiency, knowledge, and loyalty to industrial firms. Moreover, the relationship in itself is not codified as a key factor; the quality of relations is rarely thematised. This is probably the main shortcoming of this socio-economic approach to localism; it conveys the idea that closeness suffices to exchange good information and build consensus.</p>
<p>The locale as an ideal level of governance (third meaning) has an institutional framework at front stage (European Union) and some political themes at back stage (local democracy, subsidiarity, devolution, etc.). Since the 1990s the EU has promoted strong action towards individual localities. Its efforts have been directed at three kinds of place: rural settings, areas of industrial decline, and low density/border regions. The evolution made by this supernational body can be summarised in three steps: help to individual firms included in special areas; help to entire regions; and help to self-defined areas with the possible inclusion of cities and their hinterlands. ‘The innovative aspect of this proposal lies in the fact that local development is no longer solely restricted to rural development, thus enabling the establishment of urban or district local development strategies’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0269094212474871">Committee of the Regions 2012</xref>: 11). This statement from the EU Commission’s proposal for cohesion policy gives an indication of the orientations for the European Union’s regional development policy.</p>
<p>The change in the EU’s attention to ‘the local’ was initially mediated by its great interest in agriculture, to which other economic sectors were added. Then a genuine and direct concern for regions was prompted by the consideration that some areas were persisting in their backwardness or were suffering major economic crises because of the obsolescence of their productive systems. Finally, preoccupation about social inequalities in large and affluent cities drove the policies for the inclusion of urban areas.</p>
<p>The EU’s intervention method has been recently marked by an endeavour to combine territorial equity and areas’ competitiveness. As a consequence, the EU has increasingly used the mechanism of public bids for local projects, awarding them to those areas submitting an integrated and co-financed programme of actions. This mechanism helps overcome the dispersion of grants but raises the problem of the weak capacity for self-planning of rural marginal areas. Accordingly, a redefinition of localism is coming about within the EU. Thus ‘locale’ reduces its meaning of geographical and economic marginality to become a spontaneous level of aggregation for policies, a source of political mobilisation.</p>
<p>This introduces a further dimension to localism; the need for grassroots participation. Its rise has also been given an institutionalised label: ‘local democracy’. Again, the European Union has had a role in the process: it has given room to regions vis-à-vis states, collecting a local mobilisation trend diffused in all Europe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0269094212474871">Hooghe and Keating, 1994</xref>). This can be considered the ‘voice’ dimension of participation inspired by the idea that representative democracy and nation states are no longer able to collect the wills and opinions of mature citizens.</p>
<p>But, in participation there is not only the right to have a frequent voice in public matters; there is also the readiness to be effectively involved in such issues, making a personal and voluntary contribution. This attitude can be interpreted in spatial terms as <italic>subsidiarity</italic>; the willingness to cooperate at the minimal spatial level on such vital issues as education, health, and environmental protection. Localism thus acquires further meanings: self-reliance, endogenous development, bottom-up initiative, and so on. Once again, the European Union has a role: it has included subsidiarity in its treaties and publishes an annual report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0269094212474871">European Commission, 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>Subsidiarity, like other administrative processes (devolution, decentralisation, asymmetrical regionalism), gives great value to localism. The locale is considered to be efficient and of the same importance as a level of governance. The idea of governance itself entails more power and more resources for locales as both communities and public bodies. This last distinction is important: the former are usually groups of citizens organised into associations, trusts, foundations, cooperatives; the latter are fully public-right entities like municipalities. There are also mixed forms of public/private partnership which are rather frequent for social services and very frequent for local development projects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0269094212474871">Osborne, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0269094212474871">Powell, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>The foregoing brief history of localism has shown that the term has multiple meanings. A locale is much more than a small-scale area where some human activities take place. There are three main interferences between the small-scale space and organised activities. First, there is the matter of perception: short distance allows reciprocal views and otherwise impossible interactions. There is the matter of tacit knowledge, which is a basic component of social processes like trust, information exchange, and innovation learning. And there is the matter of participation: in small-scale settings it is easier to voice and be involved in common tasks. However, none of these approaches mentions the relational dimension of space, and of small spaces in particular.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec3-0269094212474871"><title>Toward a relational model of localism</title>
<p>In the past, a static idea of locale provoked an improper use of concepts such as segregation or backwardness. Living in a small area was coupled with a negative perception of weak economic dynamism or mental closure. For a long period, locale – identified with the countryside or remote areas or urban ghettos – had a distinct flavour of backwardness. Then the 1980s saw a resurgence of locale. Small industrial districts, often located in rural or mountain areas, were described as innovative and socially advanced. More recently, agriculture or tourism districts have also emerged, again formed of spatially concentrated firms in the respective sectors.</p>
<p>What scholars have emphasised to date are the strengths of internal relationships; these are stable, reciprocal, trustful, economically well-performing. This emphasis is not wrong but it is probably reductive. It refers only to internal dimensions, neglecting the fact that all these districts were, from the beginning of their success stories, in contact with wider settings. In other words, what discriminated between locale and locale was not only internal bonds but also the simultaneous presence of good relations with the outside world.</p>
<p>We can use this notion (the combination of short- and long-distance relations) to construct a framework with which to interpret the different destinies of many (small) places. Local is thus defined in a dichotomy: almost exclusively internal relations and a combination of internal and external relations. Implicit in this reasoning is the existence of a border which divides a territory from the outside world. This is another major <italic>topos</italic> of the territorial literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0269094212474871">Brunet-Jailly, 2005</xref>). Border setting depends on a cognitive and practical convergence between at least two subjects according to a plurality of meanings and perspectives – as previously indicated by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0269094212474871">Merleau-Ponty (2004)</xref> for space.</p>
<p>Furthermore, brief discussion is required of the <italic>quality</italic> of relations. By ‘strong’ relations are meant interactions dominated by a norm of symmetry which assumes a value above the interacting people. The terms are many (links, bonds, ties, etc.), but probably the most technical one is ‘reciprocity’, meaning the three-step duty of giving, receiving, and returning. This is the sequence which identifies gift exchange in the Maussian tradition. Others add solidarity, indicating the group dimension of reciprocity also called indirect or general exchange (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0269094212474871">Molm et al., 2007</xref>: 207).</p>
<p>Justifying the range of relations is easy. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0269094212474871">Castells’ (1996)</xref> ‘space of place’, there are situations where people never cross the borders of their native community, whilst the most common situation is the capacity to overcome pure local relationships, a sort of mix between space of flow with space of place (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0269094212474871">Zook, 2003</xref>). A new road or a tunnel in a remote area opens unthought-of outside opportunities; the traditional contacts with beyond-frontier people because of common ethnic identity – quite typical in the Alps – made it possible to maintain long-distance contacts. The same has been noted in the case of trans-migrants. Their continuous outflows and inflows from and to the community of origin have many beneficial effects.</p>
<p>At this point we have not two antagonist versions of localism, but four. The first concerns isolated communities, with the specification that even internally to these communities relationships are weak and infrequent. This bears out the idea of the deep social marginality of residual communities like Banfield’s Montegrano. Amoral familism then means social atomism. The population is old and has scant mobility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0269094212474871">Osti, 2010</xref>). Even the family is dispersed. So-called unipersonal families consisting of an elderly widow are very frequent in some mountain regions of Italy. The children have emigrated and they very rarely return to their village of origin.</p>
<p>The ghetto type is well known in its abstract features (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0269094212474871">Wacquant, 2004</xref>). Some external pressures and some shared internal values allow the formation of a community in the classical meaning of the term: high internal cohesion, hostility towards the surroundings, good capacity to self-organise vital services, even if at the price of authoritarian relationships. Some bidonville/slum/favela enclaves resemble this ideal type. Very often there is a marked ethnic component; but it can be only social: poor large families from the countryside living on their wits or young mothers without partners. Self-organisation is an ambivalent dimension: in some ways it helps, in others it may be under the control of violent groups.</p>
<p>Peripheral types of locale in many ways resemble the cases described by the theory of <italic>dependencia</italic>. Relationships with the outside world are frequent, but they are highly asymmetrical. Consider the idea of the economic dependence of Latin America countries. This does not mean backwardness, absence of mobility and economic stagnancy. Activities exist but they depend on external capital, technologies and markets. In this case, periphery means that local people have a weak capacity for self-organisation and depend on external forces for the higher-value functions. Periphery requires the existence of a distant centre with which there are privileged but unbalanced relationships. The dependence is not only economic. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0269094212474871">Wallerstein (2006)</xref>, there is also a cultural assimilation to the centre’s goals and values. This is the sort of localism called ‘malsviluppo’ (bad development) by scholars of southern Italy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0269094212474871">Bagnasco, 1977</xref>) who maintained that this part of Italy was not isolated from the more developed north but developed under the control of the richest part of the country. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0269094212474871">Galtung (1971)</xref> used the expression <italic>feudal interaction structure</italic> to describe the tendency of peripheral regions to deal exclusively with the superior level of government with no chance of inter-periphery exchange or alliance.</p>
<p>The fourth type (network) recalls the Italian industrial districts, the two main features of which were the spatial concentration of a <italic>filiere</italic> in which there were some innovative capacities, and a work ethos shared by employers and employees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0269094212474871">Becattini, 2004</xref>). This ethos was able to moderate the competition inevitably present in the district. That gave the district a chance to reduce Olson’s classic problem of <italic>collective action</italic>. Why should some firms cooperate when it is immediately convenient for them to defect? Cooperation among firms enables the district to organise common services (trade fairs, vocational schools, banks, R&amp;D, etc.) crucial for its expansion into markets. Hence, the network type of localism exemplified by the industrial district exhibits good and strong relationships inside and outside a place.</p>
<p>However, the strength of external relations must be specified. In the peripheral type the relations were asymmetrical and a source of political contraposition. In this category, what is the quality of relations? The question raises the issue of solidarity among areas. Localism usually has negative connotations: particularism, restricted vision of issues, closure to outsiders. Contrarily, the network ideal type is conceived as a local area able to maintain not only a certain symmetry with external market forces but also a certain degree of solidarity. Solidarity is an odd word to use in regard to the market. But, if it is plausible what happened inside the district – we said a moderation of competition through the work ethos – should solidarity also be valid for external relations of a community (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0269094212474871">Bieler and Lindberg, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0269094212474871">Johns, 1998</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-0269094212474871"><title>Italian localism: A various and uncertain process</title>
<p>The relationship-based framework will help us move in the complex situation of localism in Italy. As said, local development, mainly through the experience of industrial districts, has been the most important Italian phenomenon – well known also among scholars abroad. Nevertheless, two other processes have received international attention: the different rates of social capital among the Italian regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0269094212474871">Putnam, 1994</xref>) and the rise of a powerful local party: the Northern League (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0269094212474871">Levy, 1996</xref>). Each case is now briefly discussed.</p>
<p>Does the industrial district represent a version of localism quite different from the <italic>bounded civicness</italic> of many industrial clusters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0269094212474871">Bagnasco, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0269094212474871">Huysseune, 2003</xref>)? Do some districts have the capacity to establish <italic>non-profit</italic> external relationships? The questions have a practical implication. In recent years, trade unions, politicians, and observers have claimed that the relocation of district firm branches abroad is a betrayal of local solidarity. The process has probably not been uniform. On examining the quality of external relations, it is possible to distinguish different forms of industrial delocalisation: some cases tend to create ‘suitable partnerships for developing mid- and long-term production and trade policies’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0269094212474871">Prota and Viesti, 2010</xref>); others have been driven only by the low cost of local manpower (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0269094212474871">Cutrini, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>There are then two sub-types of industrial district: one is theoretically similar to the above-mentioned ghetto (high internal solidarity and closure to external forces), the other is close to the pure type of network: strong external relations not dominated by the logic of competition alone.</p>
<p>A possible objection to this argument is that these are no longer manifestations of localism, but rather areas with a very open, universal perspective; they are no longer small places but towns, metropolises, cosmopolitan areas, and spaces of flow. This objection confuses the existence of flows with the existence of borders. It is possible to imagine a well-delimited locality (thick internal relations, high cultural identity, strong economic specialisation) that maintains frequent and symmetrical relations with other localities. Its morphology may vary greatly – a valley, an industrial cluster, a suburb, an entire city – but the crucial criterion is still the quality of internal and external relations.</p>
<p>According to recent national-scale surveys, the economic performances of industrial district firms are not particularly different from non-district ones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0269094212474871">Buccellato and Santoni, 2012</xref>). Moreover, those located in urban areas and in the north record better results, at least in terms of productivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0269094212474871">Di Giacinto et al., 2012</xref>). It seems clear that the original drive of Italian industrial districts has weakened. They are not particularly different from other geo-economic formulas. In fact, the classical economic divides return: the north and south of the country, the better performances of high tech districts, the firms better able to expand compared with those that maintain a small-scale structure.</p>
<p>The most internationalised industrial districts have more easily met the challenges raised first by globalisation and then by the 2008 economic crisis. There is nothing to add in regard to their capacity to combine internal and external relationships: all researchers identify it as a key source of success or survival. It is more difficult to obtain data on the quality of these relations (symmetry, reciprocity, loyalty, and so on). Probably, two factors are crucial: investments in the trade network, and the capacity to recruit skilled workers both in the district and in the delocalised areas. That means also creating successful conditions for firms and places that could possibly become competitors – as happened to the ceramics district of Sassuolo (Emilia-Romagna), when it exported machinery and know-how.</p>
<p>The risk of having stronger competitors at home and abroad is probably offset by the long-term symmetric relationships, even with distant firms, which have produced, on the same temporal scale, exchange of information, availability to merge with other firms, movements of skilled employees. The idea of delocalising – as many districts have done – simply by relocating some production phases to low-wage areas (periphery ideal type) was misleading and sometimes devastating. The quality of delocalisation relationships therefore seems crucial for understanding such variable results from the Italian industrial districts.</p>
<p>The second example concerns regionalism. The Italian regions were formally created in 1970 after being envisaged by the 1948 Constitution. They have broad legislative powers and some competences delegated by the State. The evolution of the Italian regions can be seen as a blocked progress towards a federal state. In the past 20 years, further competences have been devolved to them in different waves, but without a parallel fiscal autonomy. The health system is emblematic. Although it is the main regional competence, it is financed from a fund controlled by the national government. Regions can only levy small amounts of tax to integrate their quotas. The share-out of the fund is the cause of sharp state/region conflicts.</p>
<p>Outright federalism has been blocked, not for ideological reasons but because of the regions’ large differences in the public deficit caused mainly by the regional health system. A federal system in the presence of wide differences in terms of public tax revenues and public spending control may be very dangerous for the financial balance of a highly indebted state like Italy.</p>
<p>This concern has left the federal reform uncompleted, greatly increasing the conflict between state and regions. In technical terms, <italic>concurrent competences</italic><sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0269094212474871">3</xref></sup> between the state and regions are very common. According to our relational framework (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0269094212474871">Figure 1</xref>), there is an evident risk of having ‘peripheral’ regions, that is poor and badly connected to-the-centre areas. Local authorities with many discretionary exchanges with the centre is also a model envisaged by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0269094212474871">Page (1991)</xref>, who compared the clear and relationally limited centre-periphery regimes of Northern Europe with the Mediterranean ones, where the exchanges among administrative levels were many, opaque and particularistic.
<fig id="fig1-0269094212474871" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Types of localities according to the length and the symmetry of relations (Italian examples in brackets).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0269094212474871-fig1.tif"/>
</fig></p>
<p>The problem is even more radical than appears from the blocked federalist reform. It concerns the marked differences that divide northern and southern Italy. Localism in the economy was seen as an antidote to this cleavage: the local development paths are numerous, and also in southern Italy there are original ways to achieve economic success. Unfortunately, this holds only for a small number of areas. In the south the industrial districts are few in number and less internationalised. The geographical divide is reproduced in many fields, especially the public services. In such conditions, the creation of a financial compensation room (a redistributive device of federal states), for the weaker regions is viewed with suspicion, and this impedes any further reform towards federalism or the decentralisation of tax payments.</p>
<p>The third example is the Northern League. This is a typical local party with electoral ups and downs, but still deeply rooted in the northern regions with prominent administrative positions in local bodies (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lega_Nord">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lega_Nord</ext-link>). This party has claimed to defend the small entrepreneurs of northern Italy, but it does so with a backward programme: no European integration, high tariffs on foreign commodities, a halt on immigration, and secession from southern Italy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0269094212474871">Diani, 1996</xref>). Its idea of localism is clearly centred on the <italic>ghetto</italic> ideal type. Curiously, the party has been stronger in Italy’s most internationalised regions and economies like Lombardy. Evidently, the rise of the Northern League is a reaction to the challenge raised by globalisation. But it uses outmoded instruments based on the shortening of relationships.</p>
<p>If the ghetto type well represents the Northern League’s ideology, the success of the party is explained by other causes which concern the ideal types ‘periphery’ and ‘network’. Note that the Northern League has no ethnic or religious base, but instead a territorial one: the regions of northern Italy. In fact, it is more correct to call it a regional party. Its claims have been attractive to a large constituency because they are based on a sort of reversed periphery (the richest part of the country hindered by a centralised state) and on a good capacity to network at different levels of governance, even the national one (the Northern League has been part of the government coalition without problems). This is indicative of a general feature of localism, at least in Italy: it is a flexible, powerful, multifocal political weapon. It is, in other words, a primary source of mobilisation.</p>
<p>The Northern League rise was an explicit signal of territorial cleavage that national parties were not able to combine with other lines of conflict. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0269094212474871">Rokkan (1970)</xref>, territorial cleavage has been one of the main sources of party alignment in Europe. In Italy, that did not happen, with small exceptions (a secessionist party in Sicily after WWII, the South Tyrolean People’s Party, a local party ‘Il Melone’ in Trieste). The political-territorial cleavage exploded in the 1980s, when a new class of small entrepreneurs did not fit the kind of modernisation national elites were preparing. However, political localism confronted with post-Fordist economic development did not produce only the Northern League, but also a new season of economic agreements between centre and periphery as the Territorial Pacts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0269094212474871">Ramella, 2009</xref>). Thus we see how vital and controversial the Italian mobilisation of locale was.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-0269094212474871"><title>Localism, a myth still able to mobilise moral energies</title>
<p>Conclusions are based on three points: the capacity of framework (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0269094212474871">Figure 1</xref>) to discriminate; how the Italian cases enrich the framework; and the question of localism as a myth. First: the typology of places based on length and symmetry of relations worked quite well in the sense that it permits us to discern internal aspects of wide phenomena such as industrial clustering, decentralisation and the rise of local political parties. In the industrial district a crucial theme was so-called <italic>bridging social capital,</italic> that is the reciprocity between areas, the capacity to take care of employees-employer relations established in the area where the district has decentralised phases of production or sells its products.</p>
<p>In the regionalist reform, the relational framework allows us to see the problem of uneven development; when in a country like Italy the geographical inequalities are deep and persistent, regionalism – a <italic>sui generis</italic> form of localism – is unable to operate and risks becoming a political illusion. Probably, when the territorial disparities are so high, a centralised state is more effective and less expensive.</p>
<p>In the case of Northern League – alternatively a party of protest and government – the framework helps us to understand that social movements appealing to ‘local’ can move along the territorial scale quite easily. Sometimes, local movements are really a ghetto, with strong bonding capital but blind toward external worlds. Sometimes, they superbly interpret a <italic>genius loci</italic> in ways able to contaminate other areas. In that sense, localism is not regressive or progressive; it is a flag being used in different contexts for different purposes. This happened, for example, with the environmental movement: one way to move away from an elitist approach was the invention at the Rio de Janeiro 1992 Conference of the <italic>Local Agenda 21</italic>. Another example is the European Union with its constant relationship with regions and border areas, by-passing the national governments. Further signals arrive from usually reluctant countries like the UK and France, where localism has become an instrument with which to mark political positions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0269094212474871">Featherstone et al., 2012</xref>) or a criterion to evaluate all the administrative apparatus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0269094212474871">Thoenig, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>In spite of the typology’s capacity to discriminate, it remains quite a static instrument; it does not codify the evolution of places or their move from one type to the other. The analysis of the three Italian cases of localism can help to correct the stagnant picture, showing an interesting cross-fertilisation between theory and practice (the second point of this article’s conclusion). The historical trend is probably toward an <italic>asymmetric regionalism</italic>, as we usually name the Spanish case (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0269094212474871">Keating, 1997</xref>). In the terms of our framework, it is a hybrid model in between <italic>periphery</italic> and <italic>network</italic>. The diversity of local situations imposes more graduated relations between centre and periphery. Thus, territorial hierarchies do not disappear but become more variable. That is a trend happening in the external relationships of industrial districts; it is less visible in the Italian administrative system, alternating attempts to reduce the levels with the rise of new delimitations. It has to be verified in the case of regional political parties, continuously in between splendid isolation and negotiation. Nevertheless, it is clear at a theoretical level that there is not only polarisation between <italic>dependency</italic> and <italic>interdependency</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0269094212474871">Keohane and Nye, 2001</xref>); intermediate situations are the norm and must be envisaged.</p>
<p>The third point of the conclusion concerns whether the Italian cases contribute to debunk or not the myth of localism. In Italy, localism has a strong narrative; however, it is not only illusory or mystifying. Diversification of areas and their path is real; the local agenda has effectively moved energies, despite the normalisation of industrial districts, the backwardness of the Northern League and the rhapsodies of regional reform. The claim for ‘territory’ is still alive and fruitful. In particular, great interest has been raised by zero-kilometre products, which are ways to combine local qualities with social relationships; in fact, they are based on promotion of the landscape, typical goods, and solidarity among producers and consumers.</p>
<p>Of course, ambivalences remain: even this revival risks being a ‘ghetto’ view of localism, when the local is reduced to territorial marketing, with the presentation of good chances to attract investments, skilled workers, and affluent tourists. The relationship with other areas is reduced to a matter of competition. But there are alternatives; for example <italic>decentralised cooperation</italic>: north-south, east-west activities among local authorities, based on solidarity with the other side’s labourers and the attention to their environment; for example, <italic>fair trade</italic>, a more symmetrical and extra-local exchange. Both are an interesting combination of local actions and international relations. These are the frontiers of a sound localism or the moral bases of a ‘forward’ local society.</p>
