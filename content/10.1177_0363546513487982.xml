<title>Background:</title>
<p>Headache-related symptoms may be predictive of delayed recovery in student athletes after sport-related concussion.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0363546513487982">
<title>Purpose and Hypothesis:</title>
<p>To compare balance performance, cognitive function, and symptom recovery in concussed student athletes with no headache, those with posttraumatic headache, and those with characteristics of posttraumatic migraine following a sport-related concussion. It was hypothesized that those with posttraumatic migraine would take longer to recover on all clinical measures.</p>

<title>Study Design:</title>
<p>Cohort study (prognosis); Level of evidence, 2.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0363546513487982">
<title>Methods:</title>
<p>A total of 296 student athletes who sustained sport-related concussions (migraine, 52; headache, 176; no headache, 68) were evaluated on measures of balance performance, cognition, and symptoms. Patients were categorized into posttraumatic migraine, posttraumatic headache, and no headache groups based on symptoms reported 1 day after injury. Serial testing was conducted with the Balance Error Scoring System, the Standardized Assessment of Concussion, and a graded symptom checklist to evaluate balance performance, cognition, and symptoms, respectively, at baseline, at the time of injury, after the event, and at days 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, and 90.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0363546513487982">
<title>Results:</title>
<p>Student athletes with posttraumatic migraine experienced greater symptom severity scores than did those with posttraumatic headache and no headache at the time of injury, after the event, and through day 7 (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .001 for all). By day 7, symptom severity scores reported by patients with posttraumatic migraine still demonstrated deficits relative to baseline (Δ = 5.6 ± 1.2) compared with patients with headache (Δ = −0.8 ± 0.7) and those with no headache (Δ = −1.4 ± 1.1). Patients with headache experienced greater symptom severity scores than patients with no headache at the time of injury (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .001), after the event (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .001), and at day 1 (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .001), day 2 (<italic>P =</italic> .005), and day 3 (<italic>P</italic> = .038). Much smaller differences were observed between the headache and no headache groups beyond day 3 (<italic>P &gt;</italic> .05). There were no group differences on balance performance (<italic>P</italic> = .439) and cognitive testing (<italic>P</italic> = .200) over time. Female patients were 2.13 times more likely than males to report posttraumatic migraine characteristics after concussion.</p>

<title>Conclusion:</title>
<p>Posttraumatic migraine characteristics are related to prolonged symptom recovery after sport-related concussion.

<body>
<p>Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is considered by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to be a serious public health problem in the United States. It has been estimated that between 1.6 and 3.8 million sport-related TBIs occur each year in the United States.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0363546513487982">25</xref></sup> In addition to representing one of the most difficult clinical conditions to manage in sports medicine, TBI (mild through severe) is responsible for costs of US$60 billion in direct medical and indirect costs,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0363546513487982">12</xref></sup> making TBI among the most expensive conditions to treat in adolescents.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0363546513487982">42</xref></sup> Children younger than 15 years represent as much as 40% of the 1.1 million TBIs—not all specific to sports—that result in emergency department visits each year.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0363546513487982">24</xref></sup></p>
<p>Although much has been published in the area of sport-related concussion in the past 10 years, the current standard of care for those athletes suffering from concussion has remained largely unchanged during this time. However, greater attention is being given to recognizing signs and symptoms of concussion and adhering to recommended parameters for return to participation (eg, the patient must be asymptomatic, exhibit balance and cognitive performance within normal limits, and progress through a graduated exertional protocol). Youth athletes may experience increased symptom severity and prolonged recovery after concussion,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0363546513487982">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0363546513487982">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0363546513487982">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0363546513487982">41</xref></sup> relative to adult athletes. Consensus statements—based on expert opinion rather than strong empirical evidence—recommend that athletes be asymptomatic and free of balance and cognitive deficits before being permitted to begin a graduated return to play. This standard of care provides few to no active treatment options beyond a passive wait-and-see approach for which clinicians have very little evidence-based understanding. In one study it was believed that as many as 13.7% of school-aged children with mild TBI remained symptomatic for as long as 3 months after injury<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0363546513487982">2</xref></sup>; 25% of the injuries in this sample were the result of sport-related mechanisms of injury. When patients begin experiencing persistent symptoms, clinicians are often at an impasse on how to manage these cases, and therefore investigation into acute treatment options designed to limit the risk of protracted symptoms in younger patients is warranted.</p>
<p>Concussion is the most common form of TBI. Headache is the most commonly reported symptom after concussion.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0363546513487982">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0363546513487982">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0363546513487982">45</xref></sup> There is limited literature describing different headache types experienced by young athletes and how these headaches may affect concussion recovery. In a previous analysis, we reported that young athletes suffering from posttraumatic migraine characteristics (ie, headache, nausea, photophobia, phonophobia) experienced greater deficits in neurocognitive testing and symptom evaluation commonly used in concussion assessment, compared with a group of athletes suffering posttraumatic headache and those not experiencing headache after their diagnosed concussion.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0363546513487982">36</xref></sup> More recently, it has been suggested that symptoms consistent with posttraumatic migraine may serve a prognostic purpose in identifying those athletes likely to experience protracted symptom recovery after concussion.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0363546513487982">26</xref></sup> Patient sex may also compound symptom evaluation at baseline and after injury, since female patients typically endorse an increased number of symptoms at baseline than male patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0363546513487982">43</xref></sup> However, sex does not appear to affect recovery time.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0363546513487982">5</xref></sup> As headache is the most common persisting symptom regardless of the patient’s sex, exploring the effect of headache on overall postinjury recovery in a multifaceted evaluation paradigm is warranted.</p>
<p>The primary purpose of this study was to compare balance performance, mental status, and symptom recovery in concussed student athletes with no headache, those with posttraumatic headache, and those with characteristics of posttraumatic migraine after a sport-related concussion. We hypothesized that patients with posttraumatic migraine would have worse balance, cognition, and symptoms after concussion and would take longer to recover on all measures used in our study compared with those athletes experiencing headache and no headache. Our secondary purpose was to explore the associations between the presence of posttraumatic migraine characteristics and the following: (1) concussion history, and (2) sex.</p>

<title>Patient Selection</title>
<p>This study included 344 student athlete patients between the ages of 12 and 25 years who sustained a mild TBI during athletic competition (ie, game, practice, or scrimmage). All patients were clinically evaluated as part of a multisite (95 sites) sport-related concussion assessment program between 2000 and 2003. We excluded patients if they reported a history of learning disability, special education, speech therapy, or attention deficit disorder or if they were being treated pharmacologically after injury. Additionally, patients were excluded if English was not their primary language, as testing was carried out in English. As a result, 296 met the necessary criteria for inclusion in this study (241 males, 55 females; age, 16.7 ± 1.9 years, height, 176.5 ± 9.2 cm; mass, 79.2 ± 18.9 kg). Our patients were injured while participating in the following sports: football (64.9%), soccer (23.7%), lacrosse (10.1%), and ice hockey (1.4%). To remain consistent with previous work in this area,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0363546513487982">36</xref></sup> we separated patients into 3 groups based on symptoms the athletes reported 1 day after injury. Concussed patients were included in the posttraumatic migraine group (n = 52) if they reported the presence of headache, nausea, and either photophobia (sensitivity to light) or phonophobia (sensitivity to noise) during their day 1 postconcussion evaluation, without regard to the severity of these symptoms. Patients who reported headache without the other migraine-like symptoms (nausea, photophobia, or phonophobia) were classified in the headache group (n = 176). Patients not reporting headache were classified in the no headache group (n = 68). We did not observe any significant differences in the number of previous concussions reported by patients across the 3 groups (χ<sup>2</sup> = 1.78; <italic>P</italic> = .411); thus, these cases were not excluded or analyzed separately. Demographic information for our patients including age, height, mass, sex, and concussion history are provided in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0363546513487982">Table 1</xref>. Our university institutional review board approved the study, and all patients signed board-approved consent forms. Additionally, parental assent was obtained for all minors enrolled in the study.</p>

<title>Protocol</title>
<sec id="section10-0363546513487982">
<title>Preseason Baseline Evaluation</title>
<p>Baseline data were collected during the off-season (ie, before preseason contact drills) and, as a result, before any concussions were sustained by the participants in this study. At the preseason baseline session, the following self-reported data were collected: age, height, mass, sex, native language, years of completed education, history of diagnosed learning disability, and history of concussion. A standardized concussion history questionnaire was administered with the supervision of the test administrator. This questionnaire was structured to gather information regarding concussion history and a description of these injuries including presence and length of confusion, loss of consciousness, anterograde amnesia (memory loss after the hit), retrograde amnesia (memory loss before the hit), and results of neuroimaging procedures (if any). The test administrator then administered the Balance Error Scoring System (BESS), Standardized Assessment of Concussion (SAC), and the graded symptom checklist (GSC) described below.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0363546513487982">
<title>Postinjury Evaluation</title>
<p>Injured athletes were identified and enrolled in the study protocol by a team physician or certified athletic trainer present on the sideline during an athletic event (game or practice). Concussion was defined as an injury resulting from a blow to the head causing an alteration in mental status and 1 or more of the following symptoms described by the American Academy of Neurology Guidelines for Management of Sports Concussion: headache, nausea, vomiting, dizziness and balance problems, fatigue, difficulty sleeping, drowsiness, sensitivity to light or noise, blurred vision, memory difficulty, and difficulty concentrating.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0363546513487982">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0363546513487982">23</xref></sup> In addition to completing a standard injury history and on-field evaluation, clinicians completed the BESS, SAC, and GSC at the time of injury, after the event (eg, at the termination of the game/practice in which the athlete was injured), and on days 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, and 90.</p>

<p>The BESS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0363546513487982">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0363546513487982">40</xref></sup> is an objective sideline assessment tool developed to measure postural stability (ie, balance performance) after concussion. It is portable and cost-effective and can be used clinically in a sideline setting in the absence of more permanent, expensive, and sophisticated devices that may be found in a research facility.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0363546513487982">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0363546513487982">19</xref></sup> It is one of the most commonly used concussion assessment tools among athletic trainers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0363546513487982">10</xref></sup> The BESS consists of 3 stances (double-leg, single-leg, and tandem) using 2 surfaces (firm and foam), for a total of six 20-second trials.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0363546513487982">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0363546513487982">19</xref></sup> The foam surface is a piece of medium-density foam, 41.6 × 50.8 × 6.3 cm (Airex Balance Pad, Alcan Airex AG, Switzerland). For balance in the single-leg stance, patients were instructed to stand as still as possible, with hands on iliac crests and eyes closed, while maintaining balance on their nondominant limb with their dominant limb in approximately 20° of hip flexion and 45° of knee flexion. For balance in the tandem stance, patients were instructed to stand heel to toe with their nondominant limb in back, hands on their iliac crests, and eyes closed. Leg dominance was defined as whichever leg the patient would use to kick a soccer ball for maximum distance. If patients moved out of the test position at any point, they were reminded to return to a stable testing position as soon as possible and continued with the trial. The BESS was scored based on the number of errors committed by the patient. Errors included lifting hands off iliac crests, opening eyes, stepping, stumbling or falling, moving the hip into greater than 30° of flexion or abduction, allowing the forefoot or heel to lose contact with the ground, and remaining out of the testing position for more than 5 seconds.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0363546513487982">39</xref></sup> Each stance was demonstrated before data collection. The BESS took about 5 minutes to administer. Errors were recorded for each 20-second trial by clinicians experienced with this test administration. We recorded the BESS total error score (the sum across all 6 trials) as our outcome measure. High intraclass correlation coefficients for intratester reliability (0.74-0.98)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0363546513487982">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0363546513487982">40</xref></sup> have been noted in scoring BESS errors.

<p>The SAC is a brief cognitive screening tool designed for use in the immediate sideline assessment of concussion in athletes.

<p>Clinicians have used a variety of GSCs as a means of quantifying a patient’s symptoms after a concussion.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0363546513487982">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0363546513487982">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0363546513487982">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0363546513487982">38</xref></sup> We used a 20-item GSC. Patients ranked each symptom using a 7-point Likert scale from 0 to 6 (0, not experiencing; 1 or 2, mild; 3 or 4, moderate; 5 or 6, severe). Since the purpose of obtaining a preinjury baseline symptom report is to determine how a participant feels on a regular basis, participants were asked to grade their symptoms at baseline only if they experienced them greater than 3 times per week. For symptom inventories evaluated at the time of injury, after the event, and throughout their recovery, patients were asked to grade the symptoms they were experiencing at the time of evaluation. Higher GSC scores are interpreted to mean an overall increase in symptom severity. Only 3 of our patients endorsed migraine characteristics at baseline; this was insufficient for us to perform any meaningful analyses linking baseline endorsement of migraine characteristics with increased likelihood of suffering from posttraumatic migraine characteristics. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0363546513487982">Table 2</xref> includes the symptoms we evaluated in our GSC. We used the total symptom severity score for all symptoms in our statistical analyses.</p>

<title>Data Analysis</title>
<p>Our main outcome, differences in score (Δ = postinjury – baseline), was computed for each time point for the BESS total error score, the SAC total score, and the GSC total severity score. Each main outcome was analyzed with a random intercepts general mixed linear model. Patient group (posttraumatic migraine, headache, and no headache) and time (baseline, time of injury, after the event, and days 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, and 90) were the independent variables. Post hoc analyses included a comparison of least squares means. Graded symptom checklist total symptom severity score was adjusted for the patient’s headache score, since this was the primary factor in postinjury symptom-reporting differences. To assess our secondary purpose, we performed chi-square tests of independence to assess the associations between the presence of posttraumatic migraine characteristics and the following: (1) concussion history, and (2) sex.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>We observed differences in recovery of symptom severity among our patient groups (<italic>F</italic><sub>2,238</sub> = 13.45; <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001). Specifically, patients with posttraumatic migraine experienced greater symptom severity scores than headache patients and no headache patients at the time of injury, after the event, and through day 7 (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .001 for all). By day 7, symptom severity scores reported by patients with posttraumatic migraine still demonstrated deficits relative to baseline (Δ = 5.6 ± 1.2) compared with headache patients (Δ = −0.8 ± 0.7) and no headache patients (Δ = −1.4 ± 1.1). Patients with headache experienced greater symptom severity scores than no headache patients at time of injury (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .001), after the event (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .001), and on day 1 (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .001), day 2 (<italic>P</italic> = .005), and day 3 (<italic>P</italic> = .038). No differences between the headache and no headache groups were observed beyond day 3 (<italic>P</italic> &gt; .05). There were no group differences in BESS scores (<italic>F</italic><sub>2,129</sub> = 0.83; <italic>P</italic> = .439) and SAC scores (<italic>F</italic><sub>2,141</sub> = 1.63; <italic>P</italic> = .200) over time. However, when the 3 groups were combined, we observed a time effect for both the BESS and the SAC. Concussed athletes in general experienced decreased balance performance as measured by the BESS through day 1 (<italic>P</italic> = .001), and cognitive deficits were identified with the SAC through the postevent period (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .001). The recovery curves for each outcome (BESS, SAC, and GSC) by group over time are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0363546513487982">Figure 1</xref>. We did not observe an association between prestudy history of concussion and patient group (χ<sup>2</sup><sub>2</sub> = 0.89, <italic>P</italic> = .642). However, we did observe an association between sex and the presence of posttraumatic migraine characteristics in our sample (χ<sup>2</sup><sub>1</sub> = 8.30, <italic>P</italic> = .004), with female patients being 2.13 times more likely than males to report posttraumatic migraine characteristics after concussion (95% confidence interval, 1.29-3.51). Baseline headache was endorsed by 38.9% of female and 27.5% of male patients (χ<sup>2</sup><sub>1</sub> = 2.22, <italic>P</italic> = .136). Baseline migraine characteristics were only endorsed by 1% (n = 3) of our patient sample.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Student athletes suffering from characteristic symptoms of posttraumatic migraine after sport-related concussion take longer to recover in terms of overall symptom severity—including cognitive, neurobehavioral, and somatic symptoms—than those experiencing posttraumatic headache and those not reporting headache after injury. Our data strongly support the clinical need to allow the full course of symptom recovery to take place with all patients, particularly those with migraine-like symptoms. A comprehensive evaluation of symptoms at the time of injury or within the first 24 to 48 hours of injury may identify athletes suffering from migraine-like symptoms and may help inform the necessary interventions required to maximize recovery. Although group differences were not observed in BESS and SAC scores, it is evident that balance performance and cognitive impairments result after concussion and can be identified in all concussed athletes regardless of group (posttraumatic migraine, headache, or no headache) during the time most important for clinicians to diagnose an athlete and remove him or her promptly from participation for further medical evaluation. Therefore, we recommend that any athlete sustaining a concussion be followed up not only for symptoms but also for cognitive impairments, as symptoms may also resolve before neurocognition.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0363546513487982">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0363546513487982">37</xref></sup></p>
<p>Seventy-seven percent of our patient sample reported headache after their concussion. Posttraumatic headache has been reported in as many as 86% of athletes who have sustained concussion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0363546513487982">18</xref></sup> and represents the most common symptom seen in patients after concussion.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0363546513487982">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0363546513487982">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0363546513487982">45</xref></sup> The type of headache may vary and may include tension-type or migraine-like headaches. The mechanism by which concussion catalyzes headache, particularly posttraumatic migraine, remains unknown. We are unable to identify whether the traumatic event is the sole factor for developing posttraumatic migraine or whether the 52 participants with migraine-like headaches in our study possessed other undocumented predisposing characteristics that increased their susceptibility to migraine after head trauma.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0363546513487982">44</xref></sup> Individuals in the posttraumatic migraine group demonstrated elevated overall postinjury symptom severity compared with the other groups. There were no symptom total differences between the 3 patient groups at baseline. These findings suggest that individuals with headache, particularly those with migraine-like characteristics after concussion, are likely to exhibit more pronounced symptoms of all types. These data are in agreement with previous work documenting significantly different symptom total scores between patients with posttraumatic migraine-like headache, posttraumatic headache, and no headache after sport-related concussion during their initial postinjury evaluation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0363546513487982">36</xref></sup> The Mihalik et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0363546513487982">36</xref></sup> study, however, did not report any findings beyond the initial postinjury evaluation, so direct comparisons with the current work in this regard are difficult to make. According to our data, 42.2% of patients in our posttraumatic migraine group continued to endorse migraine-like symptoms at day 2, 37.2% at day 3, 13.6% at day 5, and 8.9% at day 7. Only 1 patient continued to experience these symptoms at day 90. Because posttraumatic migraine is not very well understood, its diagnosis is difficult and posttraumatic migraine is rarely reported.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0363546513487982">28</xref></sup> The diagnosis for posttraumatic migraine is usually one of exclusion after anatomic, metabolic, and physiological causes of headache are ruled out.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0363546513487982">29</xref></sup> The link between trauma, headache, and the resulting clinical management of these patients warrants further study.</p>
<p>In the context of treatments, the standard of care for patients suffering from concussion has long been a wait-and-see approach while athletes adhere to physical and cognitive rest. There may be the potential for pharmacological interventions during the acute recovery phase in athletes suffering from concussion. Although the medications may not treat the concussion itself, they may decrease symptoms and improve sleep, and therefore aid in the recovery process. Migraine is often treated by amitriptyline with accepted efficacy, and tricyclic antidepressants (including amitriptyline) are effective in treating tension-type headache and migraine.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0363546513487982">20</xref></sup> One study showed that amitriptyline was more effective in those suffering from chronic daily headache.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0363546513487982">9</xref></sup> None of our patients were treated pharmacologically; however, it is possible that some of our patients used over-the-counter analgesics. As such, there is no way for us to empirically quantify the added benefit of pharmacological interventions on improving recovery in our posttraumatic migraine group and, to a lesser extent, our headache group. Future studies should explore the clinical utility of accelerating symptom recovery in young athletes to permit an earlier return to activities of daily living (eg, returning to school, reintegrating into social networks, etc).</p>
<p>A multifaceted clinical paradigm consisting of symptom evaluation, neurocognitive evaluation, and balance performance has long been recommended for evaluation and management of athletic concussion.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0363546513487982">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0363546513487982">35</xref></sup> Although we observed overall declines in cognitive function (as measured by the SAC) and balance performance (as measured by the BESS), we did not identify any group differences. This suggests that concussion may functionally affect the brain in a global fashion, resulting in deficits in mental status and balance evaluations that likely are not affected by the specific symptoms used to categorize the athletes in our study.</p>
<sec id="section19-0363546513487982">
<title>Limitations</title>
<p>We caution that the athletes in our study were not diagnosed with migraine but rather exhibited migraine-like symptoms that led to their classification into the posttraumatic migraine group. We lack the data necessary to evaluate any associations between personal and family preinjury history of migraine with onset of posttraumatic migraine after concussion. This information would have been helpful in identifying those athletes who may be at risk of suffering from posttraumatic migraine after concussion and, subsequently, might identify those athletes at risk for prolonged symptom recovery. We did not capture any symptom data between days 7 and 90. This information might have allowed us to further explore the association between posttraumatic migraine characteristics and the likelihood of experiencing prolonged symptoms (ie, postconcussion syndrome). We also lack data on diminished quality of life after concussion. This would be an important metric to include in future studies. Last, incorporating more sophisticated measures of concussion including computerized neurocognitive testing as was done by Mihalik et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0363546513487982">36</xref></sup> and more extensive laboratory-based balance assessments may provide further insights into how migraine-like symptoms affect concussion recovery.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Posttraumatic migraine characteristics are related to prolonged symptom recovery after sport-related concussion. Although headache reporting at baseline did not differ between the sexes, female patients were more likely to report characteristics of posttraumatic migraine after concussion than were males. Clinicians should exercise caution in making decisions about return to participation for athletes with posttraumatic migraine given the increased short-term impairments and delayed symptom recovery we observed in our patients.</p>
