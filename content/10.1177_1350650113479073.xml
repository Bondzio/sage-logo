<abstract>
<p>Single <italic>α</italic>-phase and duplex (<italic>α</italic>+<italic>β</italic>′) phase aluminum bronze (CuAl) coatings were deposited on 1Cr18Ni9Ti stainless steels by atmosphere plasma spray. The fretting wear behaviors of the two types of coatings were investigated in relation to their phase composition. The damage mechanisms of the coatings were identified by analysing their worn surfaces using scanning electron microscopy and three-dimensional non-contact surface profiler. A discussion about the identified fretting damage mechanisms was carried out. Results show that duplex CuAl coating has higher hardness than the single α-phase CuAl coating but the former has poorer resistance against fretting wear than the latter in mixed stick-slip regime and gross slip regime. The toughness reduction due to the dendritic distribution of the <italic>β</italic>′ phase in duplex CuAl coating could explain the low fretting wear resistance observed in the duplex coating. In stick regime, single α-phase CuAl coating has a lower friction coefficient but it has a higher wear rate than the duplex coating, which is attributed to the lower hardness and hence more severe plastic deformation.</p>

<sec id="sec1-1350650113479073" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Fretting wear widely exists at the interfaces of connections subjected to small amplitude vibration and it can cause adhesion and abrasion wear of contact components.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1350650113479073">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1350650113479073">2</xref></sup> Besides, fretting wear often accelerates the formation and propagation of the fatigue cracks, thereby reducing the fatigue life of the connections.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1350650113479073">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1350650113479073">4</xref></sup> It has been reported that nearly 90% of the structural failures in aircraft are related to fretting damage,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1350650113479073">5</xref></sup> which implies that acquiring insights into the mechanisms and palliatives of fretting damage is significant to engine manufactures.</p>
<p>The dovetail joint, widely used in the disk-blade attachment in the gas turbine of aircrafts, is a area where severe fretting wear and fatigue are observed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1350650113479073">6</xref></sup> To seek countermeasures against fretting damage in the dovetail joints of gas turbine engines, a soft CuAl alloy coating prepared by atmosphere plasma spraying (APS) has been used as a palliative for the reason that as-sprayed CuAl alloy coating could act as a solid lubricant by lowering friction at the contact surface and then alleviate fretting fatigue.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1350650113479073">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1350650113479073">8</xref></sup> During spraying, CuAl alloy powder is injected into the ionized gas and intensely heated to form molten or semi-molten droplets that are accelerated and crashed onto a preheated coarsened surface generating lamellar structure during the spread and solidification of droplets. Benefiting from the ultrahigh cooling rate of molten droplets in APS technology, which can reach up to 10<sup>6 </sup> K/s,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1350650113479073">9</xref></sup> the brittle <italic>γ″</italic> phase can be avoided, which is often inevitable in other processes (such as cast or wrought) due to limited cooling rate.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1350650113479073">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1350650113479073">11</xref></sup> CuAl alloy coatings used in engineering are often duplex coatings containing <italic>α</italic>+<italic>β</italic>′ phase.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1350650113479073">12</xref></sup> The <italic>α</italic>-phase is solid solution of copper containing less than 9% Al (mass percentage) and it has good ductility but low hardness and yield strength. The <italic>β</italic>′-phase is the solid solution of Cu<sub>3</sub>Al and it has higher hardness but poorer toughness compared with the <italic>α</italic>-phase.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1350650113479073">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1350650113479073">14</xref></sup> In sliding contact, the duplex CuAl coating has better mechanical properties and wear resistance than single <italic>α-</italic>phase coating. However, under fretting condition, wear mechanism of materials is more complex and fewer reports are currently available about the fretting wear behavior of single <italic>α-</italic>phase CuAl coating. Therefore, in this research, CuAl alloy coatings with single <italic>α-</italic>phase phase and duplex (<italic>α</italic>+<italic>β</italic>′) phase were prepared by APS and the fretting wear behaviors of the coatings in relation to their phase composition were investigated.</p>

<p>Commercial powder Metco 51F-NS with a composition of 89.5% Cu (mass percentage), 9.5% Al and 1% Fe and a specific size range of 10–53 µm were used for spraying. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1350650113479073">Figure 1</xref> shows the morphology of the CuAl alloy powder using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). It can be seen that the CuAl alloy powder has excellent sphericity, which is the primary guarantee for acquiring good quality thermally sprayed coating. Prior to spraying, the powder was mechanically shaken to avoid particle size segregation. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1350650113479073">Table 1</xref> shows the parameters for APS for the two types of CuAl coatings (coating 1 refers to single <italic>α-</italic>phase CuAl coating and coating 2 refers to the duplex phase CuAl coating).

<p>Austenitic stainless steel (1Cr18Ni9Ti) discs with dimension of Φ24 × 8 mm were used as substrates. The substrates were blasted and cleaned in an acetone bath before spraying. The coatings were deposited using an APS 2000 atmosphere plasma spray system equipped with a PQ-1S plasma gun (made by Beijing Institute of Aeronautical Manufacturing Technology, Beijing, China).</p>

<sec id="sec4-1350650113479073"><title>Characterization of coatings</title>
<p>The etched cross-sections of the coatings were observed by SEM (JSM-5600 L, JEOL corporation, Japan). The etchant consists of 5 g FeCl<sub>3</sub>, 10 ml HCl (37% mass fraction) and 100 ml deionized water and the etching duration is 30 s.</p>
<p>The phase compositions of to-be-sprayed powder and as-sprayed coatings were analyzed with an X-ray diffractometer (XRD; D/max 2400, Cu-Kα radiation, Rigaku, Japan). The XRD patterns were recorded in the scan range of 20° ≤ 2<italic>θ</italic> ≤ 90° with a step size of 0.02°.</p>
<p>Hardness measurements were carried out with a microhardness (MH-5VM) tester at an applied load of 200 g and a dwell time of 10 s. At least 10 indentations were observed to calculate the average values of Vickers hardness.</p>
<p>The surface roughness values (Sa, area roughness parameters) were measured with a non-contact surface profiler (Micro XAM, ADE Corporation, Massachusetts, USA). Density measurements were carried out with a Pycnometer (AccuPyc 1330, Micromeritics Instrument Corporation, USA). The coatings for density tests were deposited on a mirror-polished and degreased substrate so that they were easily stripped from the substrates. Measurements of the surface roughness and the density were repeated thrice and the average values are reported in this article.</p>

<sec id="sec5-1350650113479073"><title>Fretting wear tests</title>
<p>Fretting tests in a ball-on-disk contact configuration were carried out with an Optimol SRV-IV friction and wear tester (Optimol Lubrication, German). The upper specimens were commercial Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> ball (Vickers Hardness ∼ 1700) with diameter of 9.525 mm. Before the fretting tests, the counterpart coatings were ground with 2000 grits silicon carbide abrasive paper and polished with 0.5 µm diamond pastes and at last cleaned in an acetone bath. Fretting tests were run at an oscillation frequency of 100 Hz, a relative humidity of 20 ± 2% and a room temperature of 293 K for a total of 10<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1350650113479073">5</xref></sup> fretting cycles. Three groups of applied loads and oscillation amplitude, i.e. (a) 30 N and 10 µm (stick regime), (b) 10 N and 10 µm (mixed stick-slip regime) and (c) 30 N and 30 µm (gross slip regime) were chosen in order to study the fretting behaviors of the two kinds of CuAl coatings in different fretting regimes. After fretting tests, the wear volume losses of coatings were measured with the Micro XAM three-dimensional (3D) surface mapping profiler. Three repeated tests were conducted for each set of test parameters and the averaged values are given in this article. Besides, the fretting scars of the coatings were analyzed with SEM and 3D surface mapping profiler.</p>

<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1350650113479073">Figure 2</xref> shows the XRD patterns of to-be-sprayed CuAl alloy powder and as-sprayed CuAl coatings. It can be identified that coating 1 consists of single <italic>α-</italic>phase, while both the sprayed powder and coating 2 consist of duplex <italic>α</italic>+<italic>β</italic>′ phase. Besides, the relative intensity of diffraction peaks of <italic>α-</italic>phase in coating 2 is obviously stronger than that of sprayed CuAl powder. APS process plays a significant role in the phase composition and proportion. During plasma spraying, the flame temperature in powder heating region ranges from 6000 to 15,000℃, significantly above the melting point of CuAl alloy (about 1040℃).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1350650113479073">15</xref></sup> Under such a high temperature, the sprayed powder, at least from the surface to some depth inside, is molten into liquid namely, single phase. Besides, the ultrahigh cooling rate is beneficial to forming metastable supersaturated solid solution in coating. As for coating 2, the higher primary gas flow rate not only contributes to reduce the retention time of sprayed powder in the heating region but also decreases the energy density; therefore, the sprayed powder is partially molten and <italic>β</italic>′ phase remains in as-sprayed coating. As for coating 1, the lower flow rate of primary gas and shorter spray distance contributes to higher energy density and cooling rate<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1350650113479073">16</xref></sup> and hence the sprayed powder could be fully molten and quenched to form single <italic>α-</italic>phase.

<p>The surface roughness, microhardness and densities of the two types of as-sprayed CuAl coatings are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1350650113479073">Table 2</xref>. Coating 1 consisting of single <italic>α-</italic>phase has a much lower microhardness than coating 2 consisting of duplex phase because <italic>β</italic>′ phase has hardening effect.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1350650113479073">17</xref></sup> The surface roughness of the as-sprayed coating reflects the degree of melting and spread of the sprayed powder during deposition and poor melting or spread of the powder usually causes high values of surface roughness of the coating.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1350650113479073">18</xref></sup> Although the two types of CuAl coatings are deposited at different parameters, they have similar surface roughness with relative small values. Besides, coating 2 has a higher density than coating 1 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1350650113479073">Figure 3</xref>). This is because coating 2 is deposited at a higher flow rate of primary gas, which makes it feasible for the sprayed powder to be impacted more tightly by higher kinetic energy, thereby enhancing the cohesion between splats.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1350650113479073">19</xref></sup> In the meantime, the higher flow rate of inert primary gas Ar has a better protective effect on limiting the direct contact of the sprayed powder with the surrounding atmosphere, which also favors the acquisition of a denser coating.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1350650113479073">20</xref></sup>

<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1350650113479073">Figure 3</xref> shows the SEM images of etched cross-sections of the two types of CuAl coatings in back-scattered mode. Both coatings have typical lamellar structures of thermally sprayed coatings.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1350650113479073">21</xref></sup> Coating 2 has a denser structure with a lower content of oxide strings as well as a small amount of unmelted large particles, which should be attributed to the higher flow rate of primary gas, leading to shorten retention time of powder particles in the heating region, while in coating 1, sprayed powder is fully molten and scarcely any unmelted particles exist. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1350650113479073">Figure 4</xref> shows the higher magnified SEM image of the unmelted particles in coating 2.

<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1350650113479073">Figure 6</xref> shows the variation of friction coefficients of the two types of coatings versus fretting cycles under the three fretting regimes. It can be seen that the friction coefficients of the two types of as-sprayed coatings assume significant difference in different fretting regimes, while their friction coefficients vary with fretting cycles in a similar manner. Namely, both coatings have the lowest friction coefficients in stick regime and obviously higher friction coefficients in mixed stick-slip and gross slip regimes and their friction coefficients in the mixed stick-slip regime are dominated by noticeable fluctuation after running-in periods. In the stick regime, both coatings underwent a running-in period of about 1 × 10<sup>4</sup> fretting cycles during which the friction coefficients monotonically rise with increasing fretting cycles until they remain stable after the running-in periods. And the average friction coefficients of coatings 1 and 2 during the stable period are 0.32 and 0.41, respectively. In the mixed stick-slip regime, the running-in period was about 2 × 10<sup>4</sup> fretting cycles and the friction coefficients also monotonically increase until the average friction coefficients of 0.90 and 0.77 are reached during the stable period for coatings 1 and 2. Besides, obvious fluctuations of friction coefficients were observed in coating 2 during stable periods. In the gross slip regime, the friction coefficients of the two types of as-sprayed CuAl coatings vary in the same manner, namely the stable friction coefficients are reached after a monotonic increase of 1 × 10<sup>4</sup> fretting cycles and a slight decrease of another 1 × 10<sup>4</sup> fretting cycles. During stable period, both coatings have the same steady friction coefficient of 0.8.

In the stick regime (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-1350650113479073">Figure 7(a) and (b)</xref>), coating 1 shows hardly any damage in the contact region but coating 2 undergoes mild abrasion in the contact region, indicating slight abrasive wear. The fretting damage is alleviated through plastic deformation and flow; so the friction coefficients and the fluctuations are the lowest for both coatings among the three regimes. In mixed stick-slip regime (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-1350650113479073">Figure 7(c) and (d)</xref>), obvious fracture crackings are observed at the periphery of the wear scars for both coatings, which should account for the higher and fluctuant friction coefficients. Besides, the fracture crackings are more severe in coating 2. This is understandable because as stress concentrated areas, boundaries between stick and slip zones make it conducive for surface fatigue to occur<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1350650113479073">22</xref></sup> and dendritically distributed <italic>β</italic>′ phase in coating 2 reduces its toughness and causes more serious brittle fracture associated with surface fatigue. In gross slip regime (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-1350650113479073">Figure 7(e) and (f)</xref>), splats delamination and oxidation are both observed inside the wear scars of the two types of coatings (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-1350650113479073">Figure 8(a)</xref>) and scratches occur at the border of the contact regions (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-1350650113479073">Figure 8(b)</xref>). Because of the larger displacement that occurs between the pairs in contact that characterizes this regime (gross slip), the fretting damage of the coatings is the most severe among the three evaluated regimes. On one hand, brittle fracture happens in the joints between the splats because of weak cohesion. At the same time, because the contact region is extremely small and the friction heat cannot be dissipated immediately, oxides are unavoidably formed and are conducive to spall owning to their weak adhesion with the alloy matrix. On the other hand, the spalled splats and oxides become third body, separating the rubbing surface of the contact pairs; so the friction coefficients descend slightly and keep smooth after running-in period in gross slip regime. Besides, the third body also causes abrasion wear to the coatings.

<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-1350650113479073">Figure 9</xref> shows the specific wear rates of the two coatings in three fretting regimes. The wear rate <italic>K</italic> (µm<sup>3</sup>/(N·C)) is calculated as below
<disp-formula id="disp-formula1-1350650113479073"><mml:math xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline" id="math1-1350650113479073"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>K</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>V</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>W</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>L</mml:mi><mml:mo>·</mml:mo><mml:mi>C</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow></mml:math><graphic alternate-form-of="disp-formula1-1350650113479073" xlink:href="10.1177_1350650113479073-eq1.tif"/></disp-formula>
where <italic>V<sub>W</sub></italic> is the wear volume (µm<sup>3</sup>), <italic>L</italic> is the load (N) and <italic>C</italic> is the fretting cycles. The wear rate of coating 1 in the stick regime is nearly four times as much as that of coating 2. However, in mixed and gross slip regimes, coating 1 has better resistance against fretting damage, of which the wear rate is reduced by over 30% as compared with that of coating 2. Although coating 2 has less defects (porosity and oxide strings), the surface transformation under fretting, which is closely related to the phase composition of the coating, has a more significant influence on the fretting wear behaviors of the CuAl alloy coating.

<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-1350650113479073">Figure 10</xref> shows the profiles at the widest places of the fretting wear scars of the coatings. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1350650113479073">Table 3</xref> shows the width and depth of the wear scars in the three regimes. It can be seen that coating 2 has a smaller wear scar compared with coating 1 in the stick regime but the former has a larger wear scar than the latter in mixed stick-slip and gross slip regime. In the stick regime, sharp upheavals appear at the edges of the wear scars in both coatings (see curve a in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-1350650113479073">Figure 10</xref>), corresponding to plastic deformation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1350650113479073">23</xref></sup> Coating 1 has lower hardness, which means poorer resistance against deformation. So the volume loss attributed to severe plastic deformation accounts for the higher wear rate (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-1350650113479073">Figure 9</xref>) of coating 1 in the absence of visual damage inside the contact region (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-1350650113479073">Figure 7(a)</xref>). In the mixed stick-slip regime, obvious sharp pits are observed in the profiles of the wear scars of both coatings (see curve b in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-1350650113479073">Figure 10</xref>). These closely relate to the propagation of surface fatigue cracks in the vertical direction instead of the horizontal direction in mixed stick and slip regime.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1350650113479073">24</xref></sup> The single α-phase composition and higher content of oxides strings in coating 1 might partly benefit in restraining the propagation of cracks beneath the coating surface; so coating 1 has a much shallower wear scar in mixed regime. In gross slip regime, both coatings have the biggest wear scars but the wear scars are relatively smooth and show almost no furrows and sharp pits (see curve c in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-1350650113479073">Figure 8</xref>). Thus, it can be concluded that splats delamination and oxidation are dominant in gross slip regime and coating 2 containing dendritically distributed <italic>β</italic>′ phase possesses reduced toughness and hence higher wear rate in gross slip regime.

<p>Single <italic>α-</italic>phase and duplex (<italic>α</italic>+<italic>β</italic>′) phase CuAl coatings have been deposited on 1Cr18Ni9Ti stainless steel by atmosphere plasma spray and their fretting wear behaviors in the three fretting regimes have been investigated. The main conclusions are drawn as listed below.
<list id="list1-1350650113479073" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Spraying parameters have a significant effect on the phase composition of as-sprayed CuAl alloy coatings. Lower flow rate of primary gas and smaller spray distance favor the formation of single <italic>α-</italic>phase CuAl coating, while higher flow rate of primary gas and longer spray distance favor the formation of the duplex CuAl coating with <italic>β</italic>′ phase dendritically distributed in the matrix.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>In the stick regime, single α-phase coating suffers more severe plastic deformation compared with the duplex CuAl coating but the former has a lower friction coefficient and hardly shows any other damage in the contact region, while slight abrasion is observed in the duplex CuAl coating during this regime.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>In the mixed stick and slip regime, both coatings undergo fracture cracking, while single <italic>α-</italic>phase CuAl coating has better resistance against this damage with the absence of dendritically distributed <italic>β</italic>′ phase.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>In gross slip regime, fretting-induced damage of the coatings is dominated by splats delamination and oxidation and both coatings have the highest wear rates among the three regime. The dendritically distributed <italic>β</italic>′ phase in duplex CuAl coating results in reduced toughness and hence higher wear rate than that of single <italic>α-</italic>phase CuAl coating.</p></list-item>
