<disp-quote><p>It was the schoolmaster coming slowly down, leaning on a stick, for his hip was troublesome.</p>

<p>I had reached a dead end. Every reasonable conservative treatment modality had been exhausted. The most sophisticated imaging available failed to reveal a cause for the young athlete’s disabling pain, yet all signs seemed to implicate his right hip as the locus of the problem. In any other joint, the next logical step would have been to perform a diagnostic arthroscopy. At the time, however, hip arthroscopy barely existed. Across the United States, only a few adventurous individuals were performing the procedure, whose indications seemed few and far between.</p>
<p>Luckily for me and my patient, one of those pioneers was located in the geographic area we fondly call Chicagoland. A phone call to Howard Sweeney was enough to start the process in motion. On the scheduled date of surgery, I trekked up to Evanston to see the master perform his magic. Dr Sweeney, a leading figure in the practice and teaching of arthroscopic techniques, did not disappoint. However, even in the hands of such an accomplished surgeon, hip arthroscopy seemed a rather arduous task. Just setting up the necessary traction and fluoroscopic guidance system was a major undertaking. I decided that it was not worth my personal effort to acquire the skills for a procedure that was so rarely needed.</p>
<p>That was years ago. Since the turn of the century, many megawatts of intellectual energy have been directed at delineating the possible causes of pain and disability about the hip joint and developing surgical treatments for those disorders. At the 2010 Annual Meeting of the AOSSM in Providence, Rhode Island, a concurrent session on hip arthroscopy played host to a standing-room-only crowd. Witnessing the passionate enthusiasm of the audience, I was happy that the <italic>AJSM</italic> was planning a supplement focused on hip arthroscopy for 2011. Since then, the interest of orthopaedic sports medicine specialists in hip arthroscopy has only intensified. Technical capabilities have progressed beyond simple debridement to include repair and reconstruction of damaged joint components and even extra-articular structures.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0363546513488357">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0363546513488357">22</xref></sup></p>
<p>A paper published last year documented the dramatic growth in the practice of hip arthroscopy among young U.S. orthopaedic surgeons.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0363546513488357">2</xref></sup> Between 1999 and 2009, the number of hip arthroscopy procedures performed by applicants for board certification skyrocketed 18-fold. A corresponding asymptotic increase in the teaching of hip arthroscopy techniques also occurred. A survey of fellowship directors in 2010 revealed that 78% of sports medicine fellowships offering training in hip arthroscopy had only begun doing so in the previous 6 years. Although arthroscopic hip surgery straddles the border between sports medicine and joint reconstruction, the survey revealed that it was being taught in a larger proportion of sports medicine fellowships than joint reconstruction programs. A greater percentage of individuals who had completed sports medicine fellowships were performing hip arthroscopy than other board certification candidates.</p>
<p>As a profession, we are still in an intense learning mode when it comes to the diagnosis and treatment of disorders about the hip joint. Contemporary imaging techniques yield so much data that it will take some time to sort out the importance of all the information. In a study published recently in <italic>AJSM</italic>, Register and colleagues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0363546513488357">16</xref></sup> performed unilateral 3-tesla MRI scans on the hips of 45 asymptomatic volunteers who averaged 37.8 years old. Even though all the participants were ostensibly symptom free, findings usually considered pathological were common, with labral tears identified in 69% of individuals and chondral defects in 24%. The prevalence of two findings, chondral defects and subchondral cysts, increased sharply in those older than 35. An analogous study of collegiate and professional ice hockey players, published in 2011, had similar results.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0363546513488357">19</xref></sup></p>
<p>Since these studies were cross-sectional in design, the meaning of their findings is unclear. Are the imaging abnormalities the harbinger of future disability, anatomic variants, or age-related changes that are likely to remain silent? Until the study participants are followed longitudinally, there is no way to know if or when the imaging abnormalities will become clinically important. Adding further to the uncertainty is a variable amount of disagreement among physicians charged with interpreting the images.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0363546513488357">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0363546513488357">19</xref></sup> As we learn more about the natural history of asymptomatic imaging abnormalities in the hip, we may need to reassess our definitions of abnormal.</p>
<p>Of all the structures in and around the hip joint, the acetabular labrum has been one of the most intensely studied for its possible role in producing pain and disability. Functions attributed to the labrum include increasing the depth and congruity of the acetabulum<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0363546513488357">21</xref></sup> and adding stability to the hip at the extremes of motion.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0363546513488357">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0363546513488357">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0363546513488357">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0363546513488357">20</xref></sup> The ability of the labrum to act as a fluid seal has received particular attention. By facilitating the retention of synovial fluid within the acetabular socket, the labrum is thought to decrease joint contact stress and surface friction, thus protecting the health of the articular cartilage.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0363546513488357">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0363546513488357">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>Although labral injury has been found in hips without evidence of bony dysmorphism,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0363546513488357">8</xref></sup> it occurs most commonly in conjunction with the osseous changes of femoroacetabular impingement (FAI).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0363546513488357">4</xref></sup> Surgical recommendations have therefore progressed from focusing purely on the labral damage to addressing both osseous and labral components simultaneously.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0363546513488357">13</xref></sup> In view of the importance assigned to the labrum in the maintenance of joint health, surgical treatment of labral injury has evolved from simple debridement to emphasize preservation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0363546513488357">9</xref></sup> and even restoration of labral tissue.</p>
<p>Initial clinical studies to support this trend have focused on the comparison of labral debridement and repair. Surgeons’ conviction that labral repair is preferable to debridement have hampered the direct comparison of the two alternatives in lesions amenable to both techniques, so the supporting evidence has been somewhat indirect. Studies of the surgical treatment of FAI that have compared the results of the refixation of repairable labral injuries to the debridement of irreparable lesions have declared better outcomes in the cases of repair.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0363546513488357">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0363546513488357">18</xref></sup> To circumvent the problem inherent in comparing debridement and repair performed to treat different pathologies, Larson and colleagues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0363546513488357">9</xref></sup> compared the results of FAI decompression and labral repair with similar cases treated with labral debridement in the years before the development of contemporary repair techniques. At the time of their most recent follow-up 3½ years postoperatively, both groups were improved from their preoperative condition but the patients treated with labral repair had superior subjective outcomes.</p>
<p>If labral repair produces better results than debridement, surgeons have begun to wonder whether labral reconstruction can improve outcomes in cases in which tissue loss makes simple repair unfeasible. Reconstruction techniques have been proposed that utilize the ligamentum teres,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0363546513488357">23</xref></sup> reflected head of the rectus femoris,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0363546513488357">17</xref></sup> a tubularized strip of iliotibial band,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0363546513488357">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0363546513488357">14</xref></sup> or autogenous hamstring tendons.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0363546513488357">10</xref></sup> Although a recent laboratory investigation was unable to demonstrate the ability of such a reconstruction to re-establish the fluid seal function of the missing labrum,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0363546513488357">1</xref></sup> admittedly a cadaveric fluid flow study cannot account for the effects of healing and remodeling that might occur in a biological environment or the possible biomechanical benefits of reconstruction.</p>
<p>Case series have been published that document substantial improvement in symptoms following several labral reconstruction techniques.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0363546513488357">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0363546513488357">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0363546513488357">23</xref></sup> Since the procedure is usually performed in conjunction with osteoplasty or other adjunctive procedures, it can be difficult to determine how much the labral reconstruction contributes to the functional outcome. Ideally, this problem would be overcome in a clinical trial that randomly assigned labral deficient patients to treatment by osteoplasty alone or osteoplasty plus labral reconstruction.</p>
<p>In this month’s <italic>AJSM</italic>, Matsuda and Burchette<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0363546513488357">10</xref></sup> report their 2-year results following reconstruction of the labrum using a strip of autogenous gracilis tendon in 8 patients. With the goal of distinguishing the effect of the labral procedure from that of the concomitant osteoplasty, they compare the outcomes of the patients who had reconstruction with those of a larger group of patients who underwent a similar osteoplasty in combination with labral refixation during the same time period. Using the nonarthritic hip score (NAHS) as their primary outcome measure, they found that both groups improved significantly after surgery. The reconstruction patients had lower scores preoperatively but experienced a greater improvement than their refixation counterparts. When the authors matched a subgroup of the refixation patients as closely as possible by age, BMI, and preoperative NAHS to the reconstruction patients, however, they failed to find a significant difference in the amount of postoperative improvement.</p>
<p>Matsuda and Burchette should be praised for their efforts to introduce a comparative element to their study, although the comparison group differed somewhat in their underlying pathologic lesions. The authors thought that they could not ethically withhold reconstruction from patients with irreparable labral deficiency. This dilemma is not unusual in orthopaedic surgery, especially in a field that is progressing as rapidly as hip arthroscopy. In order to perform a comparative clinical trial, ethics dictate that the investigator should have a reasonable doubt as to the superiority of the treatment technique being evaluated.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0363546513488357">24</xref></sup> Surgical innovators usually believe so strongly in the benefit of their innovations that they find it difficult to doubt their efficacy sufficiently to conduct such a trial, and thus an experimental treatment may quickly become standard practice. In some cases, the benefit of a treatment is indeed so dramatic and incontestable that it is reasonable to adopt it without further clinical experimentation. Otherwise, clinical investigators who did not originate the new treatment often emerge as the ones with enough reasonable doubt to conduct the comparative clinical trials needed to establish its efficacy irrefutably.</p>
<p>Looking back over the evolution of hip arthroscopy since my visit to Dr Sweeney, I am reminded of the favorite saying of my mentor Chitranjan Ranawat, “The eye sees what the mind knows.” In recent years, I seem to be seeing a lot more troublesome hips among the athletes in my care. This causes me to wonder how many similar cases escaped my vision before my mind knew about them. Arthroscopic surgery of the hip is in an exciting but still-early stage of development. We must further refine our knowledge of the natural history and treatment outcomes of disorders about the hip joint to allow our vision to become sharper and more discriminating. Doing so will require more longitudinal studies with adequate length of follow-up and, whenever possible, comparative designs.</p>
