<p>The importance and significance of music in terms of the state and society were discovered and redefined at particular junctures in the history of the Ottoman Empire and modern Turkey. This history is simultaneously Turkey’s history of modernization and westernization, extending back to the institutional reforms of the late Ottoman era and epitomized by the establishment of a secular nation-state in 1923. The musical values of the people and their popular experiences were simply ignored by the Kemalist reform of music and this caused a great deal of unrest and discussion. Given the definition by Bourdieu, who extended Weber’s definition of state, it might be argued that music reform is a paradigm example of ‘symbolic violence’ operated by the state. This article provides a historical analysis of the Turkish state’s music policies with the aim of examining their changing meanings within the general context of the history of modernization in Turkey.</p>

<title>Controlling national ıdentity and reshaping public taste</title>
<p>As soon as one begins to reflect on musical change, one has to take into account an obvious fact: first, that musical culture is what is permanent; second, that it is what is invented. This dialectic of permanence and change in musical cultures proceeds in part from the relationship that every society is bound to have with its environment. However, musical change is often drastic when powerful groups in society – particularly the state – make decisions affecting music based on non-musical values: ‘The authorities do not only manipulate the changes, they skillfully appropriate the cultural heritage, turn it into an instrument of power and use to their own advantage’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1367549411424947">During, 2005</xref>: 144). Power has always interested itself in music and its effect on the psyche, its potential to seduce, communicate and unify. Thus, music has always been under the close supervision of the political elite. As Attali pointed out:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>[M]usic localizes and specifies power, because it marks and regiments the rare noises that cultures in their normalization of behavior, see fit to authorize. Thus, it heralds the subversion of both the existing code and power in the making, well before the latter is in place. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1367549411424947">2003</xref>: 20)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>And as Stokes noted:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Music is intensely involved in the propagation of dominant classifications and has been a tool in the hands of the new states in the developing world or rather, of those classes which have the highest stake in these new social formations. This control is principally enacted through state control or influence over universities, conservatories and archives and is disseminated through its media systems. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1367549411424947">Stokes, 1997</xref>: 10)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>However, the use of music in pragmatic ways varies according to the political and social circumstances within the state itself. It is filtered through ever-changing political and social circumstances and consequently understood, used and reinterpreted in a multitude of ways. The importance and significance of music in terms of the state and society were discovered and redefined at particular junctures in the history of the Ottoman Empire and modern Turkey. This history is simultaneously Turkey’s history of modernization and westernization, extending back to the institutional reforms of the late Ottoman era, and epitomized by the establishment of a secular nation-state in 1923. In order to understand this relationship it is necessary to look at Turkey’s history of modernization in parallel with the construction of its state-endorsed music policy.</p>
<p>The Ottoman Empire (1299–1922) was a multinational, multicultural union, while the Republic of Turkey was built as a nation-state in 1923. Most scholars of the Turkish case agree that there was continuity between Ottoman modernizers and the founders of the Turkish state. Although there had been a change in the legitimating discourse of state authority in the transition from empire to nation-state, the new Turkish state was built on a structural basis inherited from the Ottoman past. This is a patrimonial state structure based on centre–periphery opposition. Accordingly, as a country that joined the global modernization process quite late, Turkey was incapable of developing a civil society beyond the centre–periphery distinction, the latter cutting across the whole of society. In other words, having been dominant in the period of the Turkish Republic as well as in the Ottoman past, this patrimonial state structure was what prevented Turkey from developing its democracy.</p>
<p>Some liberal scholars distinguish between modernization from above and modernization as a self-generating social process. In the case of modernization from above, the modernizers wield state power and act in their own interests. In this, they argue that it is necessary to make a distinction between modernity as a potentially liberating historical condition and its instrumentalization for a political project of domination:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Of all the words derivative of the ‘modern’, that which applies most readily to the Turkish experience is ‘modernization’ – defined as a project. The agency behind the project was the modernizing elite and what they sought to achieve was the imposition of institutions, beliefs and behavior consonant with their understanding of modernity on the chosen object: the people of Turkey. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1367549411424947">Keyder, 1997</xref>: 31)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The terms ‘westernization’ and ‘Europeanization’, which were widely used by 19th and 20th-century reformers, overtly express the willing participation that underlies the borrowing of institutions, ideas and manners from the West:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>The Republican project of westernization was executed ‘from above’ in a rather authoritarian way, without giving consideration to any social resistance. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1367549411424947">Tekelioğlu, 2001</xref>: 106)</p>
<p>The Turkish mode of modernization is an unusual example of how indigenous ruling elites have imposed their notions of a western cultural model, resulting in conversion almost on a civilizational scale. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1367549411424947">Göle, 1997</xref>: 70)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Such liberal definitions of modernity make the building of national identity strategies potentially totalitarian. Basically, ‘modernization does not consist of an endogenous and universal evolution from the “traditional” to the “modern”, but instead involves regional or international emulation’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1367549411424947">Bayart, 2005</xref>: 67). Within this context, ‘modernization is a historical process of discursive formation constituted (simultaneously) at global and local levels and consisting of ongoing social struggle’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1367549411424947">Yarar, 2008</xref>: 41). Ultimately, the invention of political modernity by inventing tradition combines with a number of political strategies. In the case of the Republic of Turkey, where the invention of a national culture is directly tied to the invention of the state, the political elites attempted to combine progressive reformism (in terms of anti-imperialism, secularity and individual liberty from the old traditions) and statist corporatism (in terms of disciplining and controlling society through a central power mechanism) with the goal of building an independent nation-state.</p>
<p>‘Kemalism is the name given to the official doctrine guiding the Turkish political establishment in its secular, republican era, particularly during the 1920s and 1930s, following the collapse of the Ottoman Empire’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1367549411424947">Mateescu, 2006</xref>: 225). ‘The essence of the Kemalist project was the attempt to defeat western imperialism by adopting westernization’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1367549411424947">Gülalp, 1997</xref>: 50). ‘In this sense political nationalism in Turkey differs from Russian (internationalist), German (imperialist), Asian and Arab (anti-colonialist or anti-imperialist) nationalisms’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1367549411424947">Yarar, 2008</xref>: 47). For the ruling Kemalist elites, the unity of society achieved through ‘progress’ of a western sort is the ultimate goal. Thus, throughout republican history, all kinds of differentiation – ethnic, ideological, religious and economic – have been viewed not as natural components of a pluralistic democracy, but as sources of instability and threats to unity and progress. Scholars usually tend to associate Kemalism with populism, nationalism, secularism or statism, and portray it as centred on a rather authoritarian image of Atatürk. It is hardly possible to compare the repression of Kemalist policy to the mass destruction of fascism or communism, even though it might be argued, on behalf of Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, that the authoritarianism was a necessary means rather than an ideal end. Despite the fact that official ideology was based on an authoritarianism that contradicted their ubiquitous libertarian discourse, this does not mean that all regimes pursuing a politics of invented tradition are necessarily totalitarian. The case of Turkey seems to be totalitarian, but its realization hardly got beyond the stage of authoritarianism.</p>

<title>Universalization of official ideology: ‘to reach the level of contemporary civilization’</title>
<p>The Turkish anti-imperialist movement against invasion by western troops was the main local–global context. Hence:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>[T]he nation-building project was realized within the context of the modernization process as the main force contributing to the country’s independence and to the new level of civilization that was ironically signified by the western model of modernization (as a global design) itself. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1367549411424947">Yarar, 2008</xref>: 46)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The intention of the reforms was to bring about a radical and thorough revolution, from macrocosmic structural change to far from insignificant details:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Within a short space of time, the religious apparatus of the Ottoman state had been dismantled and the new government had endorsed the Gregorian calendar, the employment of metric weights and measures, the compulsory adoption of surnames, reforms of dress codes, language and every expression of cultural identity. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1367549411424947">Stokes, 1992</xref>: 24)</p>
<p>The <italic>monopoly of the universal</italic> can only be obtained at the cost of a submission (if only in appearance) to the universal and of a universal recognition of the universalist representation of domination presented as legitimate and disinterested. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1367549411424947">Bourdieu, 1998</xref>: 59; emphasis in original)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Kemalism in Turkey was a paradigm example of developing country nationalism in that it perceived and defined westernization as the attainment of ‘universal’ civilization. As Mustafa Kemal Atatürk repeatedly stated, the main objective of reforms was to ‘reach the level of contemporary civilization’ (<italic>muassır medeniyet seviyesine erişmek</italic>): that is, of western civilization. In this framework, westernization is embraced in the name of ‘universalism’. Technology, rules of conduct, worldview and everything else that makes the West distinctive and sets it apart from more ‘primitive’ societies impart to western civilization a superiority that lends a presumption of universality to its cultural model.</p>
<p>Ottoman Turkish was not palatable for the westernizing, nationalist elite, who wanted to create a nation-state for the Turks and to burn the bridges connecting the nascent republic to its Islamic oriental predecessor. As part of Atatürk’s reform movement, first ‘the alphabet was romanized in 1928. The establishment of the Turkish Language Institute (Türk Dil Kurumu) followed in 1932’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1367549411424947">Aytürk, 2004</xref>: 10). The culmination of all reforms was in 1929 with the introduction of the National Schools intended to instil the new nationalistic and pro-western identity:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>The reforms were implemented quite rapidly and the literacy level rose from around 8 percent in 1928 to over 20 percent in 1935. In addition to National Schools, the People’s House (<italic>Halkevleri</italic>) provided free education to adults. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1367549411424947">Tekelioğlu, 2001</xref>: 94)</p>
<p>Kemalist reformers’ efforts went far beyond modernizing the state apparatus as the country changed from a multiethnic Ottoman empire to a secular republican nation-state; they also attempted to penetrate into the lifestyles, manners, behavior and daily customs of the people. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1367549411424947">Göle, 1997</xref>: 69)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>As Şerif Mardin argued:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Altogether, then. Institutionalized Islam was an important component of the old system before its gradual demise during the republican era, when secular reforms abolished the caliphate, established a state monopoly over education, disestablished the institution of the ulema (doctors of Islamic law), rejected Islamic law and adopted a modified version of the Swiss Civil Code, latinized the alphabet and in 1928, struck out the sentence in the Constitution of 1924 which stated that Turks were of the Islamic faith. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1367549411424947">Mardin, 1997</xref>: 59)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>It is in the realm of symbolic production that the grip of the state is felt most powerfully (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1367549411424947">Bourdieu, 1998</xref>):</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>The paradigm example of Atatürk’s exquisite understanding of the power of the manipulation of symbols was the Hat Law, enacted in 1925. This replaced that emblem of Ottomanism, the fez, with a ‘civilized’ western-style peaked or brimmed hat. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1367549411424947">Stokes, 1992</xref>: 25)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>To sum up: in order to be a modern society Turks had to free themselves from this burden and make a clean start by cutting their ties to their recent (i.e. Ottoman) history. The old establishment was associated with corruption, while the new was portrayed as the right one for the nation. Atatürk’s ideal was to build up a ‘nation’ from the ashes of the empire. The state tried to construct an official (westernized) culture which underestimated the cultural needs of the Turkish people. Of the cultural and artistic policies carried out by the state, music took first place.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1367549411424947">
<title>Music reform as ‘symbolic violence’</title>
<p>Political agents attempt to monopolize the legitimate means of manipulating the social world. They compete for the ‘monopoly of legitimate symbolic violence’, a phrase Bourdieu borrowed from Weber’s discussion of the priesthood having the monopoly over legitimate manipulation of the means of salvation and the state’s monopoly over legitimate violence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1367549411424947">Kauppi, 2003</xref>). Bourdieu develops his political sociology using three by-now well-known concepts: field, capital and habitus. ‘Following Weber’s analysis of spheres of life, Bourdieu analyzes politics like any other area of social activity, such as the economy, religion or education’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1367549411424947">Kauppi, 2003</xref>: 777). Bourdieu’s concept of field refers to a relative autonomous sector of social activity. By capital, Bourdieu means social resource: each field has its specific capital. ‘Political capital is what agents accumulate and fight for in the political field. It involves specific social skills, the capacity to mobilize individuals around a common goal to formulate collective policies’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1367549411424947">Kauppi, 2003</xref>: 778). According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1367549411424947">Bourdieu (1998)</xref>, the state is the culmination of a process of concentration of different species of capital: physical force or instruments of coercion (army, police), economic, cultural or informational capital and symbolic capital. It is this concentration as such which constitutes the state as the holder of a sort of metacapital granting power over other species of capital and their holders. In fact:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>[T]he genesis of the state is inseparable from the process of unification of the different social, economic, cultural (or educational) and political fields which goes hand in hand with the progressive constitution of the state monopoly of legitimate physical and symbolic violence. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1367549411424947">Bourdieu, 1998</xref>: 33)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The state moulds mental structures and imposes common principles of vision and division, forms of thinking. From the Marxist models, which tend to treat the state as a mere organ of coercion to Max Weber’s classical definition, or from Norbert Elias’s to Charles Tilly’s formulations, most models of the genesis of the state have privileged the concentration of the capital of physical force. Using a variation of Weber’s famous formula, Bourdieu defines the state as</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>an X, which successfully claims the monopoly of legitimate use of physical and <italic>symbolic</italic> violence over a definite territory and over the totality of the corresponding population. If the state is able to exert symbolic violence, it is because it incarnates itself simultaneously in objectivity in the form of specific organizational structures and mechanisms and in subjectivity in the form of mental structures and categories of perception and thought. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1367549411424947">Bourdieu, 1998</xref>: 46; emphasis in original)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>For Atatürk, the revolution had to be an all-encompassing undertaking affecting every aspect of life in Turkey. Thus all kinds of reforms implemented by the state were perceived as a revolution. There is no doubt that music had an important place within the reforms that Atatürk wanted to realise. Music reform was an example of the most important symbolic violence aimed at imposing a particular vision of the state. As with other reforms, the main objective of this reform was to ‘reach the level of contemporary civilization’. In this framework, western music was embraced in the name of ‘universalism’: in other words, by accepting the historical superiority of the West as the producer of modernity, the political elite eagerly embraced European classical music.</p>
<p>All the reforms in the field of music during the establishment of the nation-state and national identity originated from the nationalism of Ziya Gökalp, a sociologist who was considerably influenced by Durkheim, the main ideologist of the time. Gökalp believed that only one music could exist as the true, national music of Turkey, and this was to be achieved through a synthesis of Turkish folk music and the musical techniques of western civilization. In his book, <italic>The Principles of Turkism</italic> (<italic>Türkçülüğün Esasları</italic>), first published in 1923, he summarized his propositions on the issue of national music:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>[T]here are today three musical genres in our country: Eastern music, Western music and folk music. Which one of them is national for us? We have seen that Eastern music is morbid and non-national. Since folk music represents culture and Western music is the music of our new civilization, neither should be foreign to us. Therefore our national music will be born out of the welding of folk and Western music. Our folk music provides us with a rich treasury of melodies. If we collect and rearrange them in accordance with the Western musical style, we shall have one both national and European. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1367549411424947">1970[1923]</xref>: 147; author’s translation)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The first reaction to Gökalp’s views was by Rauf Yekta Bey (1871–1935), a theorist and composer of traditional Turkish art music, during the early republican period. His articles often appeared in <italic>Tiyatro ve Musiki</italic> (<italic>Journal of Theatre and Music</italic>) in 1928 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1367549411424947">Üstel, 1994</xref>). For Rauf Yekta Bey, <italic>alaturka</italic> and <italic>alafranga</italic> were two independent systems that could not be galvanized into a modern synthesis for ideological purposes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1367549411424947">O’Connell, 2000</xref>). Basically, Rauf Yekta Bey was a lonely man on the debate concerning <italic>alaturka</italic>/<italic>alafranga</italic>, so his writings were restrained and moderate. In this respect, exponents of the <italic>alaturka</italic> camp were less uniform in their rhetorical positions. While Rauf Yekta Bey sought to promote the value of <italic>alaturka</italic> in theory and practice, a number of his colleagues were more circumspect in their defence of traditional Turkish art music:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>The same was essentially true of Yekta’s follower Dr. Subhi Ezgi (1869–1962) who continued Yekta’s work of collection and publication. It is only with Sadettin Arel (1880-1955) that classical Turkish music found a polemicist equal to the task of taking on the ideas of Gökalp. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1367549411424947">Feldman, 1990–1</xref>: 100)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Gökalp’s views have chiefly been discussed from the 1970s to the present day from both insider and outsider perspectives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1367549411424947">Behar, 1987</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1367549411424947">2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1367549411424947">Behar et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1367549411424947">Belge, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1367549411424947">Belge et al., 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1367549411424947">Feldman, 1990–1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1367549411424947">Karahasanoğlu and Skoog, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1367549411424947">Markoff, 1990–1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1367549411424947">1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1367549411424947">O’Connell, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1367549411424947">Özbek, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1367549411424947">Signell, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1367549411424947">Stokes, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1367549411424947">Tekelioğlu, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1367549411424947">Üstel, 1994</xref>). ‘In describing “Eastern” music as morbid, Gökalp is clearly speaking the language of the western orientalist’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1367549411424947">Stokes, 1992</xref>: 34). At this point, it might be useful to indicate the relationship between Occidentalism and Orientalism, since it is common in scholarship on the subject to speak of Occidentalism and Orientalism as the same phenomenon.</p>
<p>Arguing that Occidentalism and Orientalism are fantasies that nourish each other, Ahıska conceives Occidentalism as a discourse through which those in power struggle to consolidate their hegemony. She remarks: ‘Occidentalism is neither simply a desire to become western nor a hostility against the West, but a much more complex power discourse and fantasy’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1367549411424947">2005</xref>: 307). As Ahıska argues:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Occidentalism can be best understood as describing the set of practices and arrangements justified in and against the imagined idea of ‘the West’, [so] a study of Occidentalism means being receptive to the problems on the very boundary of the East–West divide. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1367549411424947">2003</xref>: 353)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>As Ahıska reminds us, ‘the national elite constituted their identity through a projection of the West in affirming their construction of a modern society’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1367549411424947">2003</xref>: 366). Thus, for the sake of purifying and creating modern Turkish music, they reproduce an authoritarian musical language which constantly underlines the need for change in mentalities in a western manner. Therefore, both the new musical language invented by the state and Gökalp’s language should be considered in this context.</p>
<p>The new state’s cultural project of modernization, as formulated by Gökalp, depended on the distinction between culture and civilization. In this way, societies have both cultures and civilizations, but the two are quite different things. From this perspective, the culture of modern Turkey had to be based on the Turkish peasants of Anatolia looking at Central Asia for their roots, since the Turkish state was looking toward Central Asia and finding it in the image of the Anatolian peasant. For the Turkish nation, ‘real’ musical heritage should have been the music of Anatolian people in rural areas. Thus, folk music was reinvented by the intelligentsia of the new state because it has a pre-İslamic cultural origin. Since civilization was synonymous with ‘progress’, the outdated Arab civilization representing resistance to the possibility of change should have been abandoned and western civilization, having progressed with philosophy, science, technology and art, should have been adopted as the new preference of civilization for Turkish nation. There was no contradiction involved in the adaptation of western music because of the artefact of western civilization. Gökalp was in favour of the technique of synthesizing monophonic folk music and polyphonic western music. The latter represents ‘civilization’ while the first belongs to ‘culture’. From this viewpoint, western music was seen in technicist terms, as was the Latin alphabet. In order to create a national music culture, the state began to collect folk songs from Anatolia.</p>
<p>Thus the idea that Turkish folk music represents the true music of the Turkish nation came into being with the founding of the Turkish Republic as a modern nation-state in 1923. The political elites of the Republic of Turkey who invented Turkish folk music often unquestioningly assumed either that the composers of folk music were unknown, or that instead of being composed, the music developed as a result of a group process. This preference is based on the homogenization of different musical cultures living in Anatolia in order to create a national culture. Of course, this is also a policy of constructing and controlling the representations of ethnic identities. Turkish folk music is seen in terms of regional not ethnic divisions, since the state divided Anatolia into seven regions on the basis of geography rather than ethnicity.</p>
<p>‘The construction of the state monopoly over physical and symbolic violence is inseparable from the construction of the field of struggles for the monopoly over the advantages attached to this monopoly’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1367549411424947">Bourdieu, 1998</xref>: 58–59). One of the most far-reaching social structuring apparatuses, the state broadcasting monopoly as a construction of the state monopoly over symbolic violence, was perceived by Atatürk and his colleagues as a means of promoting modernization and nationalism. In Turkey, the first state-sponsored and controlled radio station began its activities in 1927. In 1964, the state established the Turkish Radio and Television Corporation (TRT) to expand radio facilities and develop public television, and its monopoly continued until 1990 by banning free media. As the official institutional agent of state music policy, TRT tried to mould public taste. Thus, the state-endorsed ‘authentic’ performance of music and its media policy became tightly interconnected: ‘It was not until 1948, with the formation of Muzaffer Sarısözen’s famous “Voices from the Homeland Chorus” (<italic>Yurttan Sesler Korosu</italic>), that a new folk music was “reinvented” on the basis of what had been collected’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1367549411424947">Stokes, 2000</xref>: 221). In the hands of nationalist musicologists and musicians such as Mahmut Ragip Gazimihal, Halil Bedi Yönetken and Sarısözen, a reconstructed folk music provided the basis for a national music. ‘This was adumbrated through state funded research projects, conference reports, new musicological journals and the results were subsequently much promoted by the Turkish radio and later television’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1367549411424947">Stokes, 1996</xref>: 9). When TRT executives were confronted with the problem that peasant culture had changed (‘become decadent’ in the words of Sarısözen, one of the most important collectors who was a <italic>bağlama</italic> player and a TRT artist), and that their song repertoire consisted of new and old pieces, they formulated a set of criteria for the authentic folk song: it must be old and anonymous, it must exist in oral tradition, have variant forms and come from uneducated rural people. In fact, Sarısözen has used folk music archives collected by state institutions as material for his teaching and performing repertory at the state radio in Ankara since the 1930s. Also, it is important to note that although Sarısözen and his colleagues attempted to conserve ‘authentic folk music’, they stripped folk songs of their local nuances and those characteristics that signify regional variations in order to realize a ‘standard’.</p>
<p>As a matter of ideological principle, the aim of the music reforms was the creation of a national cultural identity. Turkish pupils went to Europe in order to learn western music. Upon returning to Turkey they began to construct ‘Contemporary Turkish art music’ as a kind of ‘musical syncretism’, combining folk music and western musical techniques. So, rural melodies ‘invented’ by the state as Turkish folk music were used by western music-educated musicians in order to create a completely new national musical culture. However, the musical revolution in Turkey came at a time when European composers were experimenting with forms of musical style that no longer relied on the system of key relationships that had guided western music for three centuries. Although Turkish composers tried not to stray from the prescribed criteria, most of their works were based on ‘modern’ composition techniques: that is, their compositional styles were based on the music of the particular European style that they had learned. The new generation of national composers included prominent musicians such as Adnan Saygun, Ulvi Cemal Erkin, Cemal Resit Rey, Necil Kazim Akses and Hasan Ferid Alnar. They were called as the ‘Turkish Five’ as a version of the ‘Russian Five’, a group of composers in Russia of the 19th century. In addition, the state invited European music specialists to Turkey. In 1936, Bela Bartok travelled at the invitation of the Ankara People’s House (<italic>Halkevi</italic>) to İstanbul, Ankara and Adana in order to conduct field research in Turkey. Saygun accompanied Bartok during his trip in Turkey. Paul Hindemith was invited by the Turkish government in order to supervise the foundation of the Ankara State Conservatory in 1935, even though the state founded a music teachers’ school (<italic>Musiki Muallim Mektebi</italic>) in Ankara in 1924.</p>
<p>Atatürk was a charismatic and ambitious leader and there were so many passions to be managed. For him, what was important was action. In his interview with a journalist for <italic>Vossicce Zeitung</italic>, Emile Ludwig, Atatürk asked in 1930: ‘How long has it taken you to reach the current status of western music?’ Atatürk himself immediately replied, ‘It has been some one hundred years. We don’t have time to wait this long’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1367549411424947">Oransay, 1985</xref>: 33; author’s translation). As Atatürk repeatedly declared, his intention was ‘to realize great issues within a short space of time’ (‘<italic>az zamanda büyük işler başarmak</italic>’). The national anthem for the new Republic, ‘<italic>Istiklal Marşı</italic>’ (‘The Independence March’), was introduced in 1924. Atatürk commissioned a special opera from Saygun for the 1934 visit of the Iranian president, Shah Riza Pehlevi. The content of the opera, <italic>The Özsoy</italic>, based on the brotherhood between Turkish and Iranian people, was determined by Atatürk himself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1367549411424947">Saygun, 1987</xref>). Atatürk’s aim was also to show that among Eastern countries, the Turkish government was the most sophisticated nation that appreciated and absorbed western culture and art. As Bourdieu argued:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>[T]he state could not have succeeded in progressively establishing its monopoly over violence without dispossessing its domestic competitors of instruments of physical violence and of the right to use them, thereby contributing to the emergence of one of the most essential dimensions of the ‘civilizing process’. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1367549411424947">1998</xref>: 42)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This syllogism is applicable to the symbolic violence operated by the Turkish state. It is obvious that the Turkish state tried to succeed in progressively establishing its monopoly over symbolic violence by dispossessing its domestic competitors of instruments of expressive culture and the right to use them. According to the political elite, traditional Turkish art music symbolized the backwardness of the old Ottoman Empire and was not a suitable national symbol, since it was ‘alien’ to the ‘innate character’ of the Turks. Many types of music, particularly traditional Turkish art music and Sufi music, were condemned as decadent Ottoman heritage. In order to prevent this outcome, they imposed restrictions and outright bans on Turkish art music and its organizations, and labelled the art music of the previous state as ‘remnants’ of an old order: ‘When the Ottoman dervish lodges were closed by the state in 1925 during secularization, the second most vital arena for the production of traditional music, after the Ottoman court itself, was eliminated’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1367549411424947">Özbek, 1997</xref>: 223). With the Republic of Turkey, the Ottoman Court Orchestra became the presidential orchestra of the Turkish Republic in 1924, and ‘Eastern music’ branches of the conservatories were closed down in 1926. Education in Turkish art music was not realized within state conservatories in Turkey until 1976. Incidentally, it would be useful to say that the title of traditional Turkish art music (<italic>geleneksel Türk sanat müziği</italic>) sometimes appears in Turkish as classical Turkish music (<italic>klasik Türk müziği</italic>), Turkish art music (<italic>Türk Sanat Müziği</italic>), Turkish music (<italic>Türk müziği</italic>) or Fasıl music (<italic>Fasıl müziği</italic>). In fact, each of these serves as an authenticity marker of a hierarchical discursive formation in terms of their musicians’ and audience’s discursive and practical consciousness, because of the validating criterion of musical value.</p>

<title>Official legitimation of western music</title>
<p>As mentioned previously, one of the most important goals of music reform was to enable the Turkish Republic to break away from the cultural domination of the Ottoman period. The political elite not only forbade traditional Turkish art music practices but also declared themselves against these practices. This approach means that traditional Turkish art music was not legitimized by the political elite. The concept of legitimacy does not necessarily mean that certain kinds of activity are forbidden, but simply that some forms of expression are valued more highly than others. In relation to music, legitimacy means that some musical activities will be considered very important and others hardly recognized:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Legitimacy is basically the result of processes involving the gradual acceptance of particular types of music by various groups in a society. When the leaders in a society adopt a music complex or a musical style to enhance their prestige or strengthen their position, legitimacy usually follows their influence. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1367549411424947">Kaemmer, 1993</xref>: 65)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Traditional Turkish art music that was not legitimized by the Turkish political elites might still have been found to contain intrinsic qualities that are highly valued by many people including Atatürk and his friends. In fact, Atatürk’s musical tastes were well known. It was common knowledge that he loved to listen to traditional Turkish art music. Basically he just distinguished between the emotional and the rational because for him, unlike eastern music, western music was logical and rational.</p>
<p>Since the Ottoman elite, for its part, identified with an Ottoman culture that was open to Byzantine, Arabic, Persian, Jewish and Armenian influences, which was out of step with the demotic culture of the countryside, Atatürk stated to the journalist Ludwig in 1930, by declaring against Eastern music: ‘these are residues from the Byzantines. Our real music can only be heard among Anatolian people’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1367549411424947">Oransay, 1985</xref>: 33, author’s translation). Atatürk’s most important statements on music were raised to a higher level by his speech in parliament of 1 November 1934:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>The index of the change undergone by a nation is its capacity to absorb and perceive change in music. The music that they would dare to have us listen to today does not belong to us. Thus this music is far from something to take pride in. We have to know this well. It is necessary to collect the high sentiments and statements belonging to our nation expressing fine emotions and ideas and to operate on them within the contemporary rules of music. Only in this way can Turkish national music evolve and take its place within the universal music. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1367549411424947">Oransay, 1985</xref>: 27; author’s translation)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>A short time after Atatürk’s speech, traditional Turkish art music – although not folk music – was banned from the radio stations in 1934 for 15 months: ‘The existence of discourse is one criterion of determining legitimacy; skill in a legitimate musical idiom also provides coveted recognition, whereas skill in non-legitimate music tends to go unnoticed’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1367549411424947">Kaemmer, 1993</xref>: 68). In 1928, Atatürk made his first public assessment against Eastern music. He attended a concert held in the park casino in Sarayburnu. Istanbul, where groups – one performing Turkish music and the other western – played in succession. After the concert he said:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Muniret-ul Mehdiye Hanım, a prominent singer of Egypt, would be successful during her performance as an artist. This unsophisticated music, however, cannot feed the needs of the creative Turkish soul. We have just heard music of the civilized world and the people, who gave a rather anemic reaction to the murmurings known as Eastern music, immediately came to life … Turks are indeed, naturally vivacious and high-spirited and if these admirable characteristics were for a time not perceived, it was not their fault. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1367549411424947">Oransay, 1985</xref>: 27; author’s translation)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>That is to say, to be successful in western music was considered more prestigious than success in Turkish music. This is what Ahıska calls ‘Occidentalist fantasy’. For her, ‘the Occidentalist fantasy evoked a “lack” in the “people” upon which it organised the “desire” to fill it’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1367549411424947">2003</xref>: 365). In other words, this fantasy shed light on how the Turkish elite, in their attempt to defend a genuine Turkish identity between the East and the West, created their own musical ‘Others’.</p>
<p>The changing patterns of legitimacy in the Republic of Turkey following the reform of music in the 1920s and 1930s show how legitimacy operates. Before the Republic, traditional Turkish art music artists worked at the Ottoman court, in the <italic>Mevlevi</italic> dervish lodges (<italic>Mevlevihane</italic>) and the conservatories, receiving their support from those institutions. The sultan had the power to control the performance of music. The newly-established pattern of legitimacy radically altered the status of traditional Turkish art music in terms of the new state. This change meant that the kinds of music that had been encouraged under the sultans, such as traditional Turkish art music and Sufi music, were no longer permitted; instead ‘European classical music’ was encouraged as long as it supported the state’s cultural project of modernization. Yet despite some scholars’ claims (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1367549411424947">Behar et al., 1994</xref>), the history of the tension between western and eastern music in Turkey did not originally begin with the policies of the Turkish Republic.</p>

<title>On the tension between <italic>alaturka</italic> and <italic>alafranga</italic> and the arabesk debate</title>
<p>Understanding the <italic>alaturka–alafranga</italic> tension and the arabesk debate in Turkey is crucial to comprehending the contradictions and ambivalences of the project and process of Turkish modernity. From a sociopolitical perspective, arabesk is considered to be a peripheral reaction to the heavy-handed centrist reforms implemented at the beginning of the republican era. It has filled the gap between the insensitivity of political elites and the musical needs of the Turkish people:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>The tension between alaturka and alafranka music has had a long history and lies at the heart of an ongoing debate over the crafting of the Turkish national identity - an identity into which the tension between the traditional and the modern has easily been integrated. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1367549411424947">Özbek, 1997</xref>: 226)</p>

<p>In his article ‘In the time of Alaturka: Identifying difference in musical discourse’, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1367549411424947">O’Connell (2005)</xref> examines the ways in which an Orientalist conception of Turkish style (Italian: <italic>alla turca</italic>) was appropriated in Turkey during the 19th century to define a native musical tradition (Turkish: <italic>alaturka</italic>) and to differentiate it from western musical practice (Turkish: <italic>alafranga</italic>).</p>
<p>As far as the history of tension between <italic>alaturka</italic> and <italic>alafranga</italic> at the Ottoman court is concerned, the origin of the debate goes back to the closing of the traditional military music band of the Janissary Army, the <italic>Mehterhane</italic>, which was abolished by Sultan Mahmut II in 1826. Thus, the Ottoman state provided bands based on the European model for the first time in 1826. The central authority provided for the inclusion of western music in the educational system. Thereafter, traditional musicians were obliged to share their power arena with the musicians performing western music in the Ottoman court. Thus many prominent musicians, including Ismail Dede Efendi, spoke out against the policy of the Ottoman sultans, who had appreciated and embraced western music since the early 19th century. Having lived through the periods of the three Ottoman sultans, Selim III, Mahmut II and Abdülmecid I, respectively:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Hammamizade İsmail Dede Efendi (1778–1846), a great composer in traditional Turkish art music and a Sufi (<italic>Mevlevi</italic>) musician, repeatedly stated his dissatisfaction with the policy of western music even though Dede Efendi’s music was always well appreciated and his personality well respected by the Sultans. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1367549411424947">Erol, 1998</xref>: 204)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Although there was conflict between western music and the traditional musical practices of the Ottoman court, the interaction between them should not be underestimated. ‘By the mid-19th century, there were a lot of popular music styles which closely resembled contemporary Turkish popular music including arabesk, although it was not referred to as such’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1367549411424947">Erol, 2004</xref>: 192).</p>
<p>The briefest etymology of the more general term ‘arabesk’, like the term ‘popular’, reveals both the plurality of its inflection and some of its historical movements. The rise of arabesk depended on a broader social change in 1960s Turkey, but it is just associated with the term <italic>arabesk</italic>. Yet the musical and social history of arabesk has a very long background. Arabesk is a historical formation of popular culture, constructed and experienced through the process of spatial and symbolic migration on the Turkish path toward modernity. However, more specifically it was the spontaneous popular response that simultaneously opposed and affirmed the modernizing practices which gave arabesk its hybrid form and its original, potent energy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1367549411424947">Özbek, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1367549411424947">Tekelioğlu, 1996</xref>). Since the late 1970s, various attempts have been made to explain the rise of arabesk culture and its social significance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1367549411424947">Belge, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1367549411424947">Markoff, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1367549411424947">Özbek, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1367549411424947">Stokes, 1992</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1367549411424947">2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1367549411424947">Tekelioğlu, 1996</xref>). There is consensus among political elites, artists even (ironically), extreme political Rightists and Leftists concerning what arabesk is: a culture of degeneration and appealing most to those whose tastes are ‘degenerated’. It is, in this sense, no more than ‘opium for the masses’.</p>
<p>Definitions, critiques and histories of arabesk are intertwined and often clearly and explicitly politicized. Although ‘arabesk is seen by some commentators in Turkey as the domain of morbid emotion and sensitivity, a domain entirely separable from that of culture’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1367549411424947">Stokes, 1992</xref>: 12), ‘no single, all-embracing definition is possible, since arabesk is and means, a lot of different things. Turkish definitions and explanations can be roughly divided into two basic categories: those in which the idea of Arab-influenced hybridity are significant (a position taken by intellectual commentators) and those in which it is not – a position taken mainly by musicians and fans’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1367549411424947">Stokes, 2000</xref>: 217). Arabesk does not have a ‘pure’ sound. It is a synthesis which incorporates many musical tastes. What I want to stress here is that it is more often than not simply a national blend of many indigenous and foreign styles. The <italic>makam</italic> (mode) and instruments of traditional Turkish art music and the <italic>ayak</italic> (scale) and musical instruments of Turkish folk music are the most important indigenous components of the arabesk sound. The foreign musical components of arabesk are western musical materials and near-eastern musical traditions, which bear some resemblance to the Turkish musical heritage: ‘Arabesk combines these indigenous materials with western musical and technological elements such as electrified instruments, harmonies and the possibilities of the modern recording studio’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1367549411424947">Erol, 2004</xref>: 193). If arabesk is accepted as a ‘hybrid’, ‘mixed’ or ‘syncretic’ musical genre, it might be argued that arabesk music in Turkey began long prior to the coinage of its term, because many musicians have freely performed and composed arabesk-style music by incorporating new musical tastes in their compositions since the 19th century. Indeed, ‘musicians and composers of traditional Turkish art music, even those serving in the Ottoman Courts, have produced new music with new musical tastes since the 18th century’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1367549411424947">Erol, 2004</xref>: 192). Moreover, this trend was not restricted to the blending of western and Eastern music. In this context, Yalçın Tura, a contemporary composer in traditional Turkish art music, argued that Tanburi Mustafa Çavuş (1700–1770), an important composer in the 18th century, ‘was an earlier pop musician who had successfully combined Turkish folk music and traditional Turkish art music idioms with his elegant style’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1367549411424947">Tura, 1988</xref>: 25).</p>
<p>Because the main centres for producing traditional Turkish art music were closed down, there was no officially sanctioned arena for education. When the Ottoman dervish lodges were closed by the state in 1925 during secularization, the second most vital arena for the production of traditional music, after the Ottoman court itself, was eliminated: ‘This left many talented musicians including Sufi musicians without a livelihood. After the 1930s in Istanbul and other cities, some of them began to commercialize their work to earn a living’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1367549411424947">Tekelioğlu, 2001</xref>: 95). The main reaction against both the music reform operated by the state and the commercialization of traditional Turkish art music came from composers and performers who did not want to commercialize their work. In this way, some of these musicians began to establish their own ‘non-profit’ organizations. From the beginning of the republic to the 1970s, hundreds of traditional Turkish art music associations were established in Turkish cities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1367549411424947">Oransay, 1973</xref>). With this, traditional Turkish art music found its own way of reproducing itself, despite the state’s inhibiting measures.</p>
<p>From the end of the 1930s, it could be argued that on the one hand, both private recording studios and entertainment venues where live music was essential, and on the other, state radio, became <italic>de facto</italic> music schools in the absence of other public institutions. During the Second World War and into the 1950s, Egyptian and Indian films became immensely popular in Turkey. It was not only Egyptian and Arabic films, but also Indian and American popular cinematic traditions which influenced Turkish filmmakers and directors, ‘but soon, Turkish film directors and musicians began to develop their own style’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1367549411424947">Stokes, 1992</xref>: 95). This coincided with the expansion of a new entertainment culture by private entrepreneurs in places where live music is essential. In the 1950s, one of the most important entertainment venues was the <italic>gazino</italic>, which ‘replaced several forms of public entertainment in the nineteenth century and juxtaposed some of their elements as part of one experience’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1367549411424947">Beken, 1998</xref>: 50).</p>
<p>Obviously, arabesk has evolved within its own traditions as an important symbol of modernization, reflecting multicultural influences and the creativity of individuals and social movements. Therefore, arabesk singers were banned from the TRT which, as with other public institutions, was deeply attached to Kemalist principles. Yet despite all the measures and criticisms of the state authorities and educated elites, it quickly reached a high level of popularity, particularly among the popular classes. The official ban on arabesk was gradually withdrawn in the 1980s, with the transition to the liberal and free market policies of the New Right headed by Turgut Özal, the leader of the Motherland Party and prime minister from 1983 to 1989. On the one hand, from the 1980s onwards, arabesk stars such as Orhan Gencebay, Müslüm Gürses and İbrahim Tatlıses have gained acceptance at the highest levels of government, sometimes being invited to presidential receptions; on the other hand, they have begun to be appreciated by middle- and upper-class audiences, including intellectuals and the new rock bands who cover their most popular songs.</p>
<p>It is also possible to say that the growing popularity of arabesk in the 1980s was mostly due to a change in the structure of this music, which attenuated the heavy eastern elements and replaced them with more western (pop) elements. Over the last two decades, in fact, it should be argued that while arabesk gradually began to become ‘pop-like’ (<italic>poplaşma</italic>), ‘Turkish pop’ music, one of the two mainstream forms of Turkish popular music, began to become ‘arabesk-like’ (<italic>arabeskleşme</italic>). Although arabesk remained a hybrid musical genre into the 2000s, its form, content, production, reception patterns and social significance have changed markedly since the mid-1960s. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1367549411424947">Martin Stokes (2010)</xref> examines how the three national popular icons in different eras of the history of Turkish popular music have dominated mass media in Turkey since the early 1950s.</p>
<p>Today, with its special mode of synthesizing various old historical and contemporary musical genres, arabesk is still an important component of the music market in Turkey. Consequently, arabesk is a sociocultural phenemenon that expresses both old and new cultural and musical identities and, like other forms of popular music in the 20th century, it is a cultural artefact of urbanization and modernization which expresses the contradictions and complexities of modern life.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The Kemalist reform of music was an important part of the state’s cultural project of modernization and a building block to be used in the reconstruction of Turkish society. Music during the reforms was used not only to symbolize ideological differences, but also to help perpetuate them. The aim of the music reform was to build a national music culture. According to Atatürk, the requirement to communicate the goals of nationalism in music was much more difficult to implement than it was in literature, theatre and art, because the latter could represent verbal or visual images and the former could not. Thus ‘the most difficult one was music reform’. Having ignored traditional Turkish art music because of its Ottoman heritage, the political elite of the Republic of Turkey approved of folk music, struggled to legitimate European classical music to create a national musical culture and strictly limited the institutions and instruction of traditional art music by delegitimating it.</p>

The musical values of the people and their popular experiences were simply ignored by the Kemalist reform of music, and this caused a great deal of unrest and discussion. Given the definition made by Bourdieu, who extended Weber’s definition of state, it might be argued that the reform of music is a paradigm example of ‘symbolic violence’ operated by the state. Why should music be worth this trouble to the modernizing state? There are a number of answers to this question, but it is obvious that music always has been an ideological tool in the hands of new states in the developing world; this is not particular to Turkey. Moreover, it shows that a modernist political elite in non-western countries sharing a supposedly similar sociopolitical history believes in the supremacy of western art and therefore in the supremacy of its civilization or mentality. Were they insensitive or fanciful to the point of thinking that people who had just carried out one of the most astonishing independence struggles in history would let themselves be led in such crude and rigid ways? I do not think so. The political elite just imagined that once Turkish musical life was altered through the institution, individuals’ musical behaviour could be easily moulded and made to fit the requirements of the newly-created circumstances. They believed that rather than just being the expression of a culture buried in the depths of society, the new musical practices were not only the future of a new society, but something a little more as well.</p>
<p>During the early decades of the 20th century, the Anatolian people were enthusiastic in supporting the national leader in his determination to remake the Turkish state. However, even those who supported and appreciated the Kemalist reforms consider these to have contributed to the shaping of the very divisions between the emotional and the rational and the inner self, popular cultural practices and high culture. After a short time, the situation had changed completely. Instead of making further sacrifices for a future that kept eluding them, the Turkish people were starting to enquire about the histories, institutions, beliefs, identities and cultures from which they had been forcefully separated. Tendencies toward the deconstruction of symbolic hierarchies have occurred.</p>
<p>For example arabesk, like many other popular music practices, emerged as a product of a sociocultural and musical conjuncture: ‘Arabesk managed to articulate all musical traditions within its own structure and established itself as opposed to a rigid and exclusive definition of official art or pop music’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1367549411424947">Yarar, 2008</xref>: 70). Now, people publicly debate and criticize the Kemalist doctrine as a patriarchal and anti-democratic imposition from above which has negated the historical and cultural experience of the people in Turkey. The tendency towards centralization that accompanied the nation-state formation process, in which attempts were made to eliminate differences in order to create a unified integrating culture for the nation, has given way to decentralization and the acknowledgement of popular experiences. The Turkish state has adopted an increasingly open attitude towards polyculturalism and a pluralistic stance towards the variability of taste over the last two decades. Although this acknowledgement of polyculturalism might be linked to a change in the social role of intellectuals in Turkey, the fact that today’s Turkish state, like many states, needs legitimation to reproduce its own structure of domination and legitimacy, should not be underestimated.</p>
