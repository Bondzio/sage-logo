<abstract>
<p>How well can non-native length contrasts for vowels and for consonants be perceived and is one type more difficult than the other? Three listener groups (native Italian and German as well as advanced German learners of Italian) performed a speeded same–different task involving vocalic and consonantal length contrasts as well as segmental contrasts as controls. Phonologically, Italian, but not German, has a consonantal length contrast, while German, but not Italian, has a vocalic length contrast. Analysis of responses yielded a clear asymmetry: A non-native vowel length contrast was perceived just as well as the native consonantal length contrast. A non-native consonantal length contrast, however, was perceived poorly compared to the native vocalic length contrast: Italians showed higher sensitivity for consonantal length than German learners of Italian, who in turn were better than German non-learners. Reaction time analyses indicated that, despite displaying higher accuracy, the decision was just as difficult for learners as for non-learners, suggesting different types of difficulty for listeners with and without experience with a consonantal length contrast.</p>

<title>I Introduction</title>
<p>In the course of adult second language (L2) acquisition, the L2 sound system remains a big challenge for the vast majority of learners even after other grammatical (e.g. morphosyntactic) facets of the target language have been mastered. This usually results in a distinct and discernible non-native accent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0267658312456544">Ioup, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-0267658312456544">Munro and Derwing, 1995</xref>), which has been shown to slow down speech comprehension in native listeners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0267658312456544">Braun et al., 2011a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0267658312456544">2011b</xref>) and may even lead to lexical confusion. Dutch listeners of English, for instance, find it very hard to distinguish between English <italic>cattle</italic> and <italic>kettle</italic>, as the Dutch phoneme inventory only contains one half-open front vowel /ε/, instead of two as in English: /ε/ and /æ/ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0267658312456544">Escudero et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr108-0267658312456544">Weber and Cutler, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>In order to address such persistent L2 learner problems, the focus of research in the area of second language acquisition since the 1980s has developed from broad pedagogical or theoretical models, which were usually based on morphosyntactic learner productions (e.g. for Monitor Model including the Input Hypothesis, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0267658312456544">Krashen, 1985</xref>; or analyses couched in UG framework, for which see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr109-0267658312456544">White, 1989</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr110-0267658312456544">2003</xref>), towards research aiming at more specific investigation of the different linguistic subfields. One subfield that has yielded a large body of psycholinguistic studies is segmental interlanguage phonology (for an overview, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0267658312456544">Altmann and Kabak, 2011</xref>). This, in turn, led to the development of a number of L2 speech perception theories, which may be phonetically (e.g. Perceptual Assimilation Model, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0267658312456544">Best, 1995</xref>; Speech Learning Model, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0267658312456544">Flege, 1995</xref>; Native Language Magnet, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0267658312456544">Kuhl, 1993</xref>) or phonologically oriented (e.g. Phonological Interference Model, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0267658312456544">Brown, 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0267658312456544">2000</xref>; Ontogeny–Phylogeny Model, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0267658312456544">Major, 2002</xref>). Furthermore, mainly over the last decade, there has been increasing experimental interest in the perception and production of suprasegmentals such as stress (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0267658312456544">Altmann, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0267658312456544">Dupoux et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0267658312456544">Kijak, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr102-0267658312456544">Tremblay, 2008</xref>), tone (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0267658312456544">Chiao et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0267658312456544">Gandour, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr107-0267658312456544">Wang et al., 2003</xref>), and segmental length (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0267658312456544">Hayes-Harb, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0267658312456544">Hisagi et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0267658312456544">McAllister et al., 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>The current article reports results from a study comparing the perception of segmental length contrasts that are phonemic in the non-native language (L2) but not in the native language (L1) to the perception of L1 length contrasts. In order to provide a holistic picture, the perception of both vowel and consonant length is investigated here with identical participant groups. This procedure allows for a reliable cross-linguistic comparison of the ability to perceive non-native length contrasts for different types of segments. In addition, possible effects of experience with the L2 (as reported in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0267658312456544">Heeren and Schouten, 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0267658312456544">2010</xref>) are traced by comparing naïve L1 speakers with no experience with the target language (non-learners, as a baseline) to advanced learners of that L2.</p>
<p>In the following, we will first give an overview of the notion of segmental length as well as consonantal and vocalic length in L2 acquisition, followed by a review of studies suggesting improvement in the ability to perceive L2 length contrasts over time. We will then compare segmental length in Italian and German, our target languages tested, before we present the experimental procedure and results.</p>

<title>II Background</title>
<sec id="section3-0267658312456544">
<title>1 Segmental length contrasts vs. allophonic variation</title>
<p>Length is a suprasegmental feature that is associated with consonants as well as with vowels in the world’s languages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0267658312456544">Ladefoged and Maddieson, 1996</xref>). Segmental length is often unpredictable and signals lexical contrasts (e.g. the distinction between /fato/ ‘fate’ vs. /fatːo/ ‘fact’ in Italian or between /∫tat/ ‘city’ vs. /∫taːt/ ‘state’ in German). Consonantal length contrasts are found in Italian, Japanese, Arabic, Finnish, and Swiss German, among others, vocalic length contrasts in Japanese, Swedish, Standard German, and Finnish.</p>
<p>Phonetically, contrastive length features as segment duration. Psychoacoustic studies have shown that participants’ sensitivity to general durational differences increases as the duration of the stimuli increases (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0267658312456544">Abel, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0267658312456544">Creelman, 1962</xref>). For a stimulus duration of 100 ms, for instance, the minimal detectable duration difference is 15 ms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0267658312456544">Abel, 1972</xref>). This indicates a high perceptual sensitivity for durational contrasts in non-linguistic auditory input. Such unbiased high sensitivity for stimulus duration is, however, not upheld in language contexts. When processing linguistic stimuli, the perception of duration is influenced by the native phonological system, an effect that emerges early in development (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr93-0267658312456544">Pohl and Grijzenhout, 2010</xref>, for differential discrimination of geminate and singleton stops by 10-12 month-old infants acquiring Swiss German and Standard German).</p>
<p>In languages that employ length contrasts, prelexical and lexical representations need to be tuned to durational contrasts so that they can activate the appropriate lexical candidates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0267658312456544">McQueen, 2005</xref>). On the contrary, when length distinctions in the L1 are absent, perceptual sensitivity to duration is reduced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0267658312456544">Gottfried and Beddor, 1988</xref>). It should be stressed, however, that perceptual sensitivity to duration is needed in all languages as segment durations do not only signal lexical contrasts but may also convey information about prosodic structure.</p>
<p>Segments may however also appear predictably lengthened or shortened based on their position in the word or utterance, over and above durational variation due to differences in speech rate. On a local level, vowel duration for instance is dependent on the vowel in question (high vowels being intrinsically shorter than low vowels, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0267658312456544">House and Fairbanks, 1953</xref>) and also on the immediate segmental context (e.g. longer before voiced consonants than before voiceless ones, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-0267658312456544">Peterson and Lehiste, 1960</xref>, and longer before fricatives than before plosives or affricates, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0267658312456544">Delattre, 1966</xref>).</p>
<p>More globally, phonemes are lengthened in phrase-initial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0267658312456544">Cho and McQueen, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0267658312456544">Fougeron and Keating, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr113-0267658312456544">Wightman et al.,1992</xref>) and phrase-final position (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr103-0267658312456544">Turk &amp; Shattuck-Hufnagel, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr113-0267658312456544">Wightman et al., 1992</xref>). A further reliable effect is polysyllabic shortening, i.e. the longer a word, the shorter its syllables and segments (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0267658312456544">Braun and Geiselmann, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0267658312456544">Lehiste, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr94-0267658312456544">Port 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr111-0267658312456544">White and Turk, 2010</xref>). Duration is further influenced by word stress and sentence accent: vowels are lengthened in stressed syllables but shortened in unstressed syllables (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0267658312456544">Baumann et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0267658312456544">Braun et al., 2011b</xref>). Such allophonic changes in duration are also found for consonants. For instance, when the same phoneme occurs at the end of one word or morpheme and again at the onset of the next word or morpheme (as in German <italic>mit Tim</italic> ‘with Tim’ or <italic>mitteilen</italic> ‘to convey’), a ‘quasi geminate’ is produced, which is longer than an otherwise identical single consonant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0267658312456544">Mikuteit, 2007</xref>). Consonant duration is also increased at the start of prosodic phrases (phrase-initial strengthening, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0267658312456544">Fougeron and Keating, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0267658312456544">Cho and McQueen, 2005</xref>). It is well-documented that such non-phonemic durational variation is used in online speech comprehension (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr98-0267658312456544">Salverda et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr100-0267658312456544">Tagliapietra and McQueen, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Ultimately, it is only the combination of lexical and prosodic information that allows us to decode the utterance interpretation efficiently.</p>

<sec id="section4-0267658312456544">
<title>2 Length in L2 acquisition</title>
<p>Non-target-like productions of L2 length for different classes of segments are well documented in the literature, even by advanced L2 learners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0267658312456544">Han, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0267658312456544">Kabak et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0267658312456544">Mah and Archibald, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0267658312456544">McAllister et al., 2002</xref>). One explanation for such production problems may lie in non-target-like perception of length information in the L2 input, which is the main focus of the current article.</p>
<p>There have been a number of studies on the perception of vowel length distinctions for L2 learners whose L1 lacks such a contrast, employing both behavioral (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0267658312456544">Cebrian, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0267658312456544">Flege et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0267658312456544">McAllister et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr114-0267658312456544">Ylinen et al., 2005</xref>) as well as electrophysiological methods (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0267658312456544">Hisagi et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-0267658312456544">Nenonen et al., 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-0267658312456544">2005</xref>). On the other hand, substantially less work has been done on the L2 perception of geminate vs. singleton consonants (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0267658312456544">Hardison and Saigo, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0267658312456544">Hayes, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0267658312456544">Hayes-Harb, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0267658312456544">Hayes-Harb and Masuda, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0267658312456544">Heeren and Schouten, 2008</xref>). The following section gives a more detailed overview of the perception of studies concerned with the L2 acquisition of segmental length.</p>
<sec id="section5-0267658312456544">
<title>a Vocalic length</title>
<p>The cross-linguistic perception of vocalic length supposedly poses few problems irrespective of the use of vocalic length contrasts in one’s native language (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0267658312456544">Bohn, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0267658312456544">Cebrian, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0267658312456544">Flege et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0267658312456544">García Lecumberri and Cenoz Inagui, 1997</xref>). Turkish late learners, for example, discriminated German long and short vowels just as well as German native controls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-0267658312456544">Nimz, 2011</xref>). In addition, it has been found that L2 learners whose L1 does not contrast vowel length may still use duration to distinguish vowel pairs in the second language, even in cases where native listeners of that language themselves make more use of spectral differences (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0267658312456544">Bohn, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0267658312456544">Cebrian, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0267658312456544">Flege et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0267658312456544">Kondaurova and Francis, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr106-0267658312456544">Wang and Munro, 1999</xref>). For instance, Spanish and Mandarin learners of English relied more on the temporal cues present in the signal for the English /i/–/ɪ/ contrast, while L1 controls relied more on spectral information. Based on such results, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0267658312456544">Bohn (1995)</xref> argued for a ‘general speech perception strategy’ (p. 300), which claims that listeners utilize durational cues whenever spectral segmental information is difficult to process. The explanation for such ‘inappropriate’ use of vowel duration is that durational cues are more salient and hence easier to perceive. Additional experimental evidence in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0267658312456544">Jacquemot et al. (2003)</xref> indicates that beginning learners may not process novel vowel duration contrasts on a phonological basis but rather as purely auditory stimuli on an acoustic basis.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, there have also been empirical findings relativizing this general positive view of durational cues for vowel perception. In summary, they report significantly better results for listeners whose L1 contains both long and short vowels compared to listeners with no length contrasts in their L1. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0267658312456544">McAllister et al. (2002)</xref> conducted a cross-linguistic identification task with English, Estonian and Spanish learners of Swedish as well as Swedish controls. Their results showed that Spanish learners of Swedish (no L1 length contrast) yielded significantly lower correctness scores in identifying Swedish long and short vowels than Estonian learners (with an L1 length contrast) or Swedish natives. However, English learners of Swedish performed significantly better than the Spanish participants (yet still lower than Swedish or Estonian groups), which was taken as potential evidence for some durational sensitivity in the English participants due to their L1 experience with allophonic vowel duration differences. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-0267658312456544">Nenonen et al. (2003)</xref> conducted an electrophysiological mismatch negativity study (MMN) and compared the perception of length contrasts for early Russian L2 learners of Finnish compared to Finnish L1 listeners. They were tested on vowels that could be mapped onto Russian phonemes and those that were too different to be mapped. The Russian learners of Finnish, whose L1 does not contrast vowel length, showed a lower mismatch negativity (decreased detection of the change) than Finnish natives, but only in those sounds that could be mapped onto Russian vowels. For vowels that could not be categorized in the L1 system, sensitivity to length contrasts was not different from that of Finnish native listeners. These findings suggest that, on the one hand, the effect of the L1 phonological system may be positive, in that allophonic experience with vocalic length in the L1 may provide some advantage in L2 speech perception. On the other hand, the L1 phonological system may affect L2 perception of vowel length negatively, in that the possibility of mapping non-native sounds onto close L1 categories blocks the application of more general temporal discrimination strategies.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0267658312456544">
<title>b Consonantal length</title>
<p>Regarding the non-native perception of consonantal length, comparatively less research has been reported and most of it focuses on English learners of Japanese. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0267658312456544">Hayes (2002)</xref>, for instance, tested the perception of the Japanese singletons /k/, /t/ and /s/ and their corresponding geminates by different groups of English learners of Japanese as well as by Japanese natives in a same–different task.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0267658312456544">1</xref></sup> Participants had to determine whether two non-words that only differed in the length of the medial consonant were the same or different. Not surprisingly, her results showed that accuracy improved with proficiency but did not reach native-like performance. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0267658312456544">Hayes-Harb (2005)</xref> reports an identification task requiring participants to choose between ‘single’ or ‘double’ consonant, in which identical consonants were manipulated in 13 durational steps. Native Japanese speakers showed categorical perception with a clear perceptual boundary (as evidenced by a sigmoid response function) while the responses of English participants with no exposure to Japanese (and thus no experience with consonantal length contrasts) yielded a near linear response function starting at only around 80% singleton judgments for the shortest duration and ending with still as much as approximately 20% singleton responses for the longest duration.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0267658312456544">2</xref></sup> Results from English learners of Japanese were found to fall in-between the naïve English and the native Japanese groups. Compared to the naïve English group, their judgments started at a higher proportion of singleton responses (around 90%) for the shortest stimuli and approximated a lower proportion of singleton judgments (around 10%). Hence, consonantal length appears to be difficult to identify, even after prolonged exposure.</p>
<p>In sum, there is experimental evidence indicating that the native phonological system interferes with the perception of segmental length. While durational cues may potentially be universally available to all listeners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0267658312456544">Bohn 1995</xref>), L1 properties have been argued to affect the perception of vowel length, both in the positive (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0267658312456544">McAllister et al., 2002</xref>) and in the negative sense (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-0267658312456544">Nenonen et al., 2003</xref>). Regarding the perception of L2 consonantal length, there is no diversity of cross-linguistic studies (or of a larger variety of segments) available. However, the existing literature at this point suggests that it is difficult to perceive an L2 singleton-geminate contrast if it is absent in the L1.</p>

<title>3 Perceptual improvement with increased exposure</title>
<p>In most of the studies mentioned above, even when advanced learners did not reach target-like scores, they still outperformed non-learners and/or lower-level L2 learners from the same L1 background (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0267658312456544">Hardison and Saigo, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0267658312456544">Hayes, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0267658312456544">Hayes-Harb, 2005</xref>). From an acquisitional point of view this is very positive news as it indicates that the perception of an originally unfamiliar non-native length contrast is indeed learnable (see also supporting results of training studies for Dutch learners of Finnish; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0267658312456544">Heeren and Schouten, 2008</xref> for adults and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0267658312456544">Heeren and Schouten, 2010</xref>, for children), at least to a certain extent. Furthermore, increased exposure to the L2, especially also to increased variation in the input, improves listeners’ sensitivity (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr97-0267658312456544">Sadakata and McQueen, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Importantly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-0267658312456544">Morrison (2002)</xref> showed that learners may readjust their perceptual strategies with increased exposure to the target language: While Spanish beginning learners of English did not show a preferential use of mainly durational or of mainly spectral cues to distinguish between English /i/ vs. /ɪ/, the same learners shifted towards relying on either spectral or durational cues after a month’s stay in Canada. This suggests that even in cases where learners’ performance (as measured by discrimination or categorization results) approaches that of native speakers of the target language, the perceptual strategies of the two groups may still differ.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0267658312456544">3</xref></sup> Such a readjustment of interlanguage phonological systems can not only be observed through improved perceptual performance on L2 contrasts, but also finds expression in longer reaction times compared to target language speakers (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-0267658312456544">Minagawa-Kawai et al., 2005</xref>, for categorical perception of short vs. long vowels, as well as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0267658312456544">Dijkstra, 2005</xref>, for lexical decision times). This indicates that the processing cost for L2 learners is higher than for native speakers even when their behavioral data shows (near) target-like performance. The current study aims to investigate these aspects for both consonantal and vocalic length with Italian and German participants within one coherent study, which not only adds a new cross-linguistic dimension but also yields comparable results for consonants and vowels for the same participant groups, which are so far non-existent.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0267658312456544">
<title>4 Italian and German length contrasts</title>
<p>Standard German and Italian are both sensitive to quantity, although for different types of segments: German, but not Italian (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0267658312456544">Krämer, 2009</xref>),<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0267658312456544">4</xref></sup> employs a phonemic vocalic length contrast, e.g. [ban] ‘ban’ vs. [baːn] ‘train’, and Italian, but not German, distinguishes between geminate and singleton consonants, e.g. [fato] ‘fate’ vs. [fatːo] ‘fact’. Thus, German and Italian are ideal languages for testing the perceptual sensitivity to length contrasts in a different class of segments, vowels vs. consonants.</p>
<p>The German vowel inventory distinguishes not only between tense and lax vowels, but also between long and short ones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr112-0267658312456544">Wiese, 2000</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0267658312456544">5</xref></sup> Tense vowels, which are produced with more peripheral articulatory settings, on the one hand, appear long in stressed position and short in unstressed position. Lax vowels, the articulatorily more central counterparts, on the other hand, are mostly short. There are, however, two pairs of lax vowels for which only length is contrastive: /ε/ vs. /εː/<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0267658312456544">6</xref></sup> and /a/ vs. /aː/ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr112-0267658312456544">Wiese, 2000</xref>). For these two vowel pairs, length is the only distinguishing feature and is independent of stress placement or vowel quality. Ramers’ (1988) duration measurements yielded a ratio between short and long vowels from 1.65 to 2.58 (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0267658312456544">Bohn and Flege, 1990</xref>). With respect to spectral quality, there is no difference between long and short /a/, while the short front-mid vowel /ε/ may be somewhat more centralized compared to its long counterpart (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0267658312456544">Jørgensen, 1969</xref>) for Standard Northern German. Others, however, have shown that this length pair only differs in duration but not in formant frequencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0267658312456544">Bohn and Flege, 1990</xref>). Perceptually, German native listeners have been shown to purely rely on durational cues, at least for /a/ vs. /aː/ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr99-0267658312456544">Sendelmeier, 1981</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0267658312456544">7</xref></sup> Thus, segmental length is clearly important for German native speakers in their vocalic system.</p>
<p>The Italian consonantal system contains numerous distinct phonemes that can occur both as singletons and geminates, namely /p/, /b/, /t/, /d/, /k/, /g/, /f/, /v/, /s/, /tʃ/, /ʤ/, /m/, /n/, /l/ and /r/ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0267658312456544">Muljačić, 1972</xref>). They are contrastive almost exclusively in intervocalic position, but some geminates may also occur before liquids or glides (e.g. [pːr], [pːl], [pːj] or [bːw]). As for the remaining consonants in the inventory, /j, w, z, ʒ/ are always short and /ʃ, ɳ, ʎ, ʦ, ʥ/ are ‘intrinsically long’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-0267658312456544">Passino, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Acoustic studies investigating the phonetic properties of the singleton/geminate contrast for different consonant types in Italian revealed that duration is the main property underlying the consonantal contrast (stops: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0267658312456544">Esposito and Di Benedetto, 1999</xref>; fricatives: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0267658312456544">Giovanardi and Di Benedetto, 1998</xref>; nasals: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0267658312456544">Mattei and Di Benedetto, 2000</xref>; affricates: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0267658312456544">Faluschi and Di Benedetto, 2001</xref>). The measurements of intervocalic singleton and geminate consonants from eight Italian native speakers in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0267658312456544">Kabak et al. (2011)</xref> indicate an average duration of 84.5 ms for singletons and of 196 ms for geminates, resulting in a ratio of 2.3. However, the duration of the vowel preceding the geminate or singleton consonant co-varies to some degree: it is longer before a singleton and shorter before a geminate consonant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0267658312456544">Esposito and Di Benedetto, 1999</xref>). According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0267658312456544">Kingston et al. (2009)</xref>, the allophonic variation in preceding vowel duration is comparatively small (allophonic vowel duration ratio of 1.3–1.5). Perceptually, geminate–singleton discrimination in Italian depends less on the actual length of the consonant than on the ratio between the consonant and the preceding vowel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-0267658312456544">Pickett et al. 1999</xref>). When the consonant is longer than the preceding vowel, it is perceived as a geminate; if it is shorter than the preceding vowel it is perceived as a singleton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0267658312456544">Giovanardi and Di Benedetto, 1998</xref>). Any following segment has no influence.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0267658312456544">8</xref></sup> However, vowel duration is not itself a cue for consonantal length independent of consonant duration (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0267658312456544">Esposito and Di Benedetto, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-0267658312456544">Pickett et al., 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>In sum, since Italian and German exploit length contrastively in one class of segments but not in the other, this pair of languages is ideally suited for the investigation of native and non-native length perception for vowels and consonants within one study. Our experiment will provide cross-linguistic data, supplemented by reaction times to compare processing difficulty, which allows us to infer underlying processing mechanisms.</p>

<sec id="section9-0267658312456544">
<title>III Experiment</title>
<p>The research questions under investigation in the current study are the following:</p>
<list id="list1-0267658312456544" list-type="simple"><list-item><p>(1) Can listeners with a length contrast in one class of segments (e.g. vowels) employ durational cues for the discrimination of a length contrast in another class of segments (e.g. consonants)?</p></list-item><list-item><p>(2) Does the ability to perceive consonantal length improve with increased exposure to a language with such a contrast? Does the perception of consonantal length contrasts become native-like?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>(3) Is it equally difficult to perceive native and non-native vocalic and consonantal length (as estimated by reaction times)?</p></list-item></list>
<p>Given that both kinds of length contrast are signaled by segment durations and given that the non-native durational differences between short and long segments lie well beyond the just noticeable difference for duration (and also beyond the differences found for L1 allophonic variation), one might predict that there are no differences in the non-native perception of consonantal and vocalic length contrasts. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0267658312456544">Bohn (1995)</xref> posited the Desensitization Hypothesis, which claims that in the absence of sufficient spectral information listeners will use durational cues to perceive non-native sounds. Although this hypothesis was based on studies on vowel perception, listeners’ sensitivity for durational information predicts that both kinds of non-native length contrasts are perceived equally well. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0267658312456544">Escudero’s (2005)</xref> L2 Linguistic Perception model (L2LP), naïve listeners without experience with a length contrast would be expected to process the respective stimuli initially on a non-linguistic basis, since this model refutes the existence of any native category (i.e. neither a short nor a long category) for vowel or consonant duration in such a case. This scenario thus predicts successful discrimination for both types of segments by naïve listeners as well. It must be noted, however, that Escudero’s model is dynamic and purely non-linguistic processing only applies to listeners with very little or no L2 experience: in more advanced learners, new categories will have been formed and their boundaries are constantly being adjusted. Thus, after successful (non-linguistic) discrimination at the beginning stage, learners will start processing non-native length contrasts linguistically. This initial stage of linguistic processing may lead to temporarily lower success rates compared to the stage of purely non-linguistic processing. Eventually, the PL2P predicts succinctly improving success rates with increasing L2 exposure, which gradually results in more target-like fine-tuning of the initially quite rough and inaccurate new category boundaries.</p>

<title>IV Method</title>
<sec id="section11-0267658312456544">
<title>1 Participants</title>
<p>Three groups of participants participated voluntarily in the experiment: 10 speakers of Standard German with no training in Italian (henceforth non-learners), 10 native Germans who were proficient learners of Italian (henceforth German–Italian learners), and 10 native speakers of Italian with no knowledge of German. None of the participants had any self-reported speech or hearing deficits.</p>
<p>The non-learners consisted of seven female and three male participants, aged between 21 and 28 (mean age: 23.3). None of them had learned Italian or another language with a phonemic consonantal length contrast.</p>
<p>The learners included nine female and one male participant, aged between 20 and 35 (mean age 23.1). They had all studied Italian at the university level for at least 11 months. Except for two, they had all lived in Italy for at least four months after the age of 15. Detailed information regarding the learners’ demographics is provided in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0267658312456544">Appendix 1</xref>.</p>
<p>The Italian group was comprised of six female and four male participants, aged between 19 and 29 (mean age 24.1). None of them had learned German or stayed in Germany for a longer period, but all except for one had learned English as an L2 (after the age of 10).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0267658312456544">
<title>2 Materials</title>
<p>The stimulus material consisted of 41 monosyllabic or disyllabic non-words taken from the Italian GEMMA project (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0267658312456544">Di Benedetto, 2000</xref>), which are phonotactically legal in German and Italian. All singleton consonants and short vowels are phonemic in both languages. Four experimental conditions involving segmental and length contrasts, both in vowels and consonants, were created (for details, see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0267658312456544">Table 1</xref>). Five additional non-words were created for the practice pairs ([ulu, ulːu, dap, daːp, iri]).</p>
<list id="list2-0267658312456544" list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>For the consonantal length condition, we used VCV and VCːV minimal pairs with an intervocalic contrast between geminates and singletons.

<list-item><p>In the vowel segment condition, we used CVC minimal pairs with only the short instances of /a/ and /ε/.

<p>Experimental and practice stimuli were read in isolation and recorded twice by a female simultaneous bilingual speaker of German and Italian who had grown up in southern Germany and was exposed to both languages from birth. We used a single speaker for all the stimuli to avoid the issue that listener judgments could be influenced by voice characteristics. Recordings took place in a sound-attenuated studio at the University of Konstanz. Data were directly digitized using a DAT recorder with a sampling rate of 44.1 kHz and a resolution of 16 Bit.</p>
<p>To verify the durational differences of the stimuli in the length conditions, the respective long and short consonants and vowels were annotated using Praat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0267658312456544">Boersma and Weenink, 2009</xref>), following standard segmentation criteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr104-0267658312456544">Turk et al., 2006</xref>). More specifically, for plosives, we annotated closure duration (starting from a clear drop in the amplitude of the waveform and a drop in higher frequency energy, especially F2, in the spectrogram) up to the release burst and for fricatives the duration of friction (as determined by the presence of aperiodic noise in the waveform). For nasals, measurement started when the amplitude in the waveform dropped and the waveform showed less high frequency components (drop in high frequency energy in spectrogram). Results of an acoustic analysis showed that, on average, long vowels were 2.3 times longer than short vowels (<italic>t</italic>(11) = 79.9, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001), while geminates were on average 1.9 times longer than singleton consonants (<italic>t</italic>(11) = 13.3, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001); for details, see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0267658312456544">Table 2</xref>. These duration measurements ensured that the acoustic criteria for the length distinction in vowels and consonants were met. Furthermore, the average duration ratios for the critical stimulus segments in the L2 were at least as large as ones reported for allophonic differences in the respective L1s (ratio for German quasi-geminates to singletons was 1.8; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0267658312456544">Mikuteit, 2007</xref>.

<p>To compare the spectral quality for long and short vowels, the first and second formants at the midpoint of the vowel were automatically extracted. Results of a paired <italic>t</italic>-test showed a significantly higher F2-value for short /a/ compared to long /aː/ (1435.6 Hz vs. 1322.1 Hz, <italic>t</italic>(5) = 4.4, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01) but no difference in F1 (on average 956 Hz, <italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.4). For /ε/, F1 and F2 did not differ for long and short vowels (<italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.05). Average F1 was 624 Hz; average F2 was 2,209 Hz.</p>
<p>To exclude the possibility that listeners could make the critical consonantal length judgment based on the allophonic duration of the vowel preceding the consonant, this vowel was held constant. To this end, for each vowel /a, i, u/ we chose a token that was always shorter in duration than any geminate consonant and longer than any singleton consonant. Using Praat, the selected instances of /a/, /i/ and /u/ were spliced out (at positive zero-crossings), and every vowel preceding a (singleton or geminate) consonant was then replaced by the respective vowel splice. This ensured that the first vowel of every non-word was always constant across all trials in the consonantal length condition.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-0267658312456544">
<title>3 Procedure</title>
<p>Since every word was recorded twice, there were eight versions of every word pair: For pairs without a contrast (i.e. different tokens of the same type), there were four possible combinations (e.g. afa1-afa2, afa2-afa1, afːa1-afːa2, afːa2-afːa1)<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0267658312456544">10</xref></sup>; for pairs with a contrast there were eight possible combinations (e.g. afa1-afːa1, afːa1-afa1, afa1-afːa2, afːa2-afa1, afa2-afːa1, afːa1-afa2, afa2-afːa2, afːa2-afa2).</p>
<p>We created two experimental lists, each containing all four versions of the pairs without a contrast and four of the eight versions of the pairs with a contrast. The order of presentation in the pairs with a contrast was counterbalanced across lists (e.g. afa1-afːa1 in list 1 and afːa1-afa1 in list 2). Each list hence contained 192 trials, 24 word pairs × 8 versions (4 with and 4 without a contrast). We created four blocks, containing 48 stimuli each. The experiment started with a training block, consisting of the three practice pairs, two with a length contrast (one vocalic, one consonantal) and one without a contrast. There was no feedback, either during the practice block or during the main experimental part. Participants were randomly assigned to one of the lists (five participants per language group for each list).</p>
<p>German participants (non-learners and learners) were tested on the same–different task at the University of Konstanz, either alone or in groups of two to three. The experiment was programmed in C (timing accuracy 1 ms) using a microcontroller (80C32, 11.059 MHz). Stimuli were presented via headphones (Sony MDR-CD570) by means of an external player (M-audio microtrack II). Three beeps (1 kHz, 300 ms) signaled the beginning of a block, and participants could take breaks between blocks. Each trial started with a 300 ms, 1 kHz sinusoid beep and 500 ms of silence, followed by the first stimulus. The two members of each pair were separated by a silence of 1,600 ms. This long inter-stimulus interval was chosen in order to prevent purely acoustic discrimination. Participants were then given a maximum of 1,600 ms before timeout. Reaction times were measured relative to the offset of the second stimulus; no visual aids were provided. All answers and reaction times were recorded using a button box. Participants used their dominant hand for a ‘same’ response and their non-dominant hand for a ‘different’ response.</p>
<p>The Italian participants were tested in Rome. Due to shipping problems with the experimental hardware, the Italian same–different task had to be reprogrammed using Presentation (Neurobehavioral Systems), and the experimental procedure accidentally differed in one aspect from the one for the German participants: Immediately after the second stimulus, Italian participants saw the text <italic>clicca ora</italic> ‘click now’ on the screen until the end of the trial (1,600 ms). The timing was otherwise identical and reaction times were in both procedures measured relative to the end of the second stimulus.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0267658312456544">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>We used a speeded same–different discrimination task in which participants decided as quickly as possible (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0267658312456544">Babel and Johnson, 2010</xref>). Same–different tasks are ideally suited for non-native listener populations since they do not demand lexical knowledge of the language in question and can hence be performed by learners and non-learners alike. Reaction times have been shown to reveal processing difficulties. For instance, longer reaction times have been found for discriminating pairs that were independently judged to be very similar (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0267658312456544">Babel and Johnson, 2007</xref>). Further support for associating longer reaction times with increased task difficulty is provided by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr101-0267658312456544">Tomaschek et al. (2011)</xref> or <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0267658312456544">Borràs-Comes et al (2010)</xref>. In these studies, the response-time peak coincided with the measured category boundary. Tomaschek et al.’s study is particularly relevant as it showed the highest reaction times at the smallest noticeable difference in an experimental investigation of the perception of long vs. short /a/ by German native speakers. Hence reaction times also provide a window into the perceived similarity of stimulus pairs and thus into the relative level of difficulty for participants.</p>

<title>V Results</title>
<p>In total, 5,760 data points were recorded (30 participants × 192 trials). Of these, 75 data points had to be excluded because participants pressed the button before the end of the stimulus (6 for non-learners, 69 for learners, none for Italians). Further 218 data points were excluded due to timeout (40 for non-learners, 129 for German–Italian learners, 49 for Italians).

<p>A general linear model with <italic>d</italic>′ scores as dependent measure and <italic>participant group, segment class</italic> (C or V) and <italic>type of contrast</italic> (length or segment) as fixed factors showed a significant three-way interaction (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0267658312456544">12</xref></sup> To investigate the nature of this interaction, the data were split by segment class. In the vocalic conditions, there were no effects of <italic>participant group</italic> or <italic>type of contrast</italic> and also no interactions (all <italic>p</italic>-values &gt; 0.05). The average <italic>d</italic>′ score was 3.14.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0267658312456544">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>In the consonantal conditions, there were main effects of <italic>type of contrast</italic> (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001) and <italic>participant group</italic> (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.005), and an interaction between the two factors (<italic>p</italic> &lt;0.05); see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0267658312456544">Figure 1</xref>. More specifically, for consonantal length contrasts, d′ scores for German non-learners (d′ = 1.31) were significantly lower than those for learners (d′ = 1.95, ß = −0.64, SE = 0.3, t = −2.1, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05), which in turn were considerably lower than those for Italians (d′ = 3.04, ß = −1.1, SE = 0.3, t = − 3.6, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.005). For consonantal segment contrasts, learners (d′ = 3.26) did not differ from German non-learners (d′ = 3.30, <italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.5); the difference between learners and Italians (d′ = 3.44) was significant (ß = 0.18, SE=0.08, <italic>t</italic> = 2.3, p &lt; 0.05).

Similar to the case of vocalic segment contrasts, all three participant groups’ <italic>d</italic>′ scores were close to ceiling (between 3.26 and 3.44).</p>

<p>To test whether the lower <italic>d</italic>′ scores for German non-learners and learners in the consonantal length contrast were caused by difficulties with ‘same’ or ‘different’ trials, we also analysed the accuracy scores in this condition. To this end, we calculated a binomial logistic regression model with <italic>accuracy</italic> as categorical dependent variable and <italic>participant group</italic> and <italic>trial type</italic> (‘same’ or ‘different’) as fixed factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0267658312456544">Jaeger, 2008</xref>). The results showed main effects of <italic>participant group</italic> (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) and <italic>trial type</italic> (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) and a significant interaction between these two factors (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05). To investigate the nature of the interaction between <italic>participant group</italic> and <italic>trial type</italic>, we looked more closely at the reactions to ‘same’ and ‘different’ trials, respectively (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0267658312456544">Figure 2</xref>). For ‘same’ trials, i.e. for trials without a contrast, there were no significant differences across participant groups (all <italic>p</italic>-values &gt; 0.05). For ‘different’ trials, however, results showed significant differences across all three groups: Accuracy was higher for the German learners of Italian than for the German non-learners (<italic>z</italic> = 2.0, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) and higher for the Italians than for the German learners (<italic>z</italic> = 3.9, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001). Thus, the difference in <italic>d</italic>′ scores for consonantal length contrasts between participant groups can be accounted for by their differential performance on ‘different’ trials.</p>

<title>VI General discussion</title>
<p>Analyses of participants’ responses in this same–different task clearly showed an asymmetry in the ability to perceive length contrasts that are not phonemic in one’s L1. Vowel length contrasts, on the one hand, appeared to pose little problems, even when vowel length was not phonemic in ones’ native language: they were perceived as successfully as segmental contrasts. The perception of consonantal length contrasts, on the other hand, proved to be difficult for non-native listeners whose L1 does not distinguish consonantal length. This difficulty still persisted in the advanced group (German learners of Italian). Despite a considerable superiority compared to the group without exposure to a language with consonantal length contrasts, their perception was (still) clearly different from that of native Italian listeners.</p>
<p>We will first focus on the improvement in consonantal length perception, a finding that is in line with recent reports by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0267658312456544">Heeren and Schouten (2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0267658312456544">2010</xref>). The learners in the current study have had ample experience with Italian (most of them had lived in Italy for at least several months), which is most probably the source for their superior sensitivity to consonantal length contrasts compared to the non-learners. In terms of theories of speech perception, there are two possible explanations that can account for the results of the perception of non-native consonantal length contrasts: The learners’ phonological system might have been restructured in a way to create new categories<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0267658312456544">17</xref></sup> for each such individual segment observed in the target language. More specifically, upon encountering enough instances of a geminate /tː/ or /kː/ as being different from /t/ or /k/, respectively, learners establish new categories, and this takes place for each single segment.<sup>18</sup> This can be considered a case of input-driven cue-based learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0267658312456544">Dresher and Kaye, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0267658312456544">Harrington and Dennis, 2002</xref>), which is triggered once a certain frequency threshold of occurrence for each individual consonant has been reached. From an inductive learning perspective, however, it would be more efficient to establish a more general concept of <italic>geminate</italic>, which applies to the whole class of consonants and can thus, once in place, be easily transferred to any new consonant. In order to form a more general concept of <italic>geminate</italic>, learners have to adapt their prelexical processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0267658312456544">McQueen, 2005</xref>); only then can this (for them) new type of contrast be processed and integrated into the L2 system. Since the materials were not designed to adjudicate between these two hypotheses, further studies with familiar and novel length contrasts would be needed to resolve this issue.</p>
<p>The findings for improved sensitivity for consonantal length contrasts with increased exposure are not easy to explain by current theoretical L2 models, as only few go beyond the beginning learners’ initial state. A notable exception is <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0267658312456544">Escudero’s (2005)</xref> L2LP, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0267658312456544">Flege’s (1995)</xref> speech learning model (SLM) would have been likewise if it had not been restricted to segmental features). The SLM implies readjustment of native categories and the formation of new categories in the course of the learning process: in our case the development of a new suprasegmental contrast (length) for a new class of segments (consonants). L2LP also accommodates learning in that newly formed categories are adjusted more and more towards optimal L2 perception.</p>
<p>German speakers with no exposure to a consonantal length contrast obviously do not associate the durational differences in consonants with different phonological categories, as indicated by their low discrimination scores. Thus, they map the consonants – irrespective of their duration – onto one and the same category, the only one they have available in their L1 inventory. This could be interpreted as a native language magnet effect in terms of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0267658312456544">Kuhl and Iverson (1995)</xref>, as single category perceptual assimilation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0267658312456544">Best, 1995</xref>) or equivalence classification in the SLM. The hypothesized merging of a non-native contrast onto a single category is strengthened by the fact that naïve German listeners mostly misclassified trials with a consonantal length contrast as ‘same’ and not vice versa (i.e. the obviously different tokens of the same length as ‘different’). For this phenomenon, L2LP cannot offer a reasonable explanation to the single category mapping account since this model posits that there is no length category available in the initial stage of this learning process. Consequently, naïve German listeners would be expected to process long and short consonants non-linguistically, which should have led to very good discrimination. Obviously this was not the case for our German non-learners.</p>
<p>Although the German learner group displayed significantly more correct ‘different’ responses and also a higher sensitivity to the consonantal length contrast (as measured by <italic>d</italic>′) than the naïve German group, the learners’ reaction times for such pairs were significantly longer than the reaction times for the native vowel length contrast. What is more, learners’ RTs for correctly classified items with a consonantal length contrast were as long as those of non-learners. This suggests that the ‘same’–‘different’ decision (1) was equally difficult for learners as it was for non-learners and (2) has not yet reached the ease with which native vowel length contrasts are processed. Apparently, the learners, who are able to perceive the consonantal length contrast better than the non-learners, do not perceive it reliably as a phonemic contrast, which the long inter-stimulus interval in the current study required. Despite their extended exposure to consonantal length contrasts in the target language, they still display some level of indecisiveness as illustrated by long RTs in the consonantal length condition and also by the high number of timeouts (more than in both other groups). This indecisiveness suggests that (at least some of) the learners already had some access to a newly forming category and thus needed to decide between two possible mapping representations (i.e. /C/ vs. /Cː/). The fact that the naïve German group also displayed quite high RTs (but fewer timeouts) may be explained by a difference in ‘category goodness’ (in terms of Best’s Perceptual Assimilation Model; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0267658312456544">Best, 1995</xref>) of one of the consonants in question, which also makes discrimination more difficult. However, the underlying mechanisms for non-learners and learners need further attention in future experiments.</p>
<p>As for the perception of the vocalic length contrast, all participant groups achieved a high level of accuracy in the current study, regardless of the native language. As illustrated by the <italic>d</italic>′ and accuracy scores, the non-native length contrast in vowels did not pose any problems for the Italian listeners whose native language system does not include a vowel length contrast. These findings corroborate previous accounts in the literature that the existence of L1 vowel length contrasts is not a necessary condition for the perception of L2 vowel length contrast (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0267658312456544">Bohn, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0267658312456544">Cebrian, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0267658312456544">Flege et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0267658312456544">García Lecumberri and Cenoz Inagui, 1997</xref>). Nevertheless it is striking that Italians with no exposure to German behaved in a native-like manner in discrimination of vocalic length. We see a number of possible explanations for this high sensitivity to vocalic length, which are not necessarily related to the L1 phonological system though. First, the long /a/ was always more fronted than the short /a/, as evidenced by higher F2 values in the acoustic analysis. Therefore, Italian listeners might have theoretically relied on spectral information instead of vowel duration. This explanation is rather weak for several reasons: (1) Previous studies have shown that L2 learners weigh duration more than spectral information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0267658312456544">Bohn 1995</xref>) and that naïve listeners are highly successful for non-native durational contrasts along that dimension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0267658312456544">Escudero and Boersma, 2004</xref>). (2) The spectral differences are minimal and probably mapped onto the available Italian segmental L1 category (disregarding durational differences) and (3) the spectral difference was only present in one of the two vowels tested. Synthetic stimuli would be needed, however, to entirely refute this confounding factor.</p>
<p>Second, the Italian participants all had some learning experience with English, a language that also involves long and short vowels (in combination with spectral differences). Unfortunately, it is impossible to find a group of Italians that is (1) comparable in age and education to the German learners of Italian and (2) has no experience with English. Italian late learners’ pronunciation problems with such English vowel contrasts (e.g. <italic>pitch</italic> vs. <italic>peach</italic>) are, however, well documented in the literature, both temporally and spectrally (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0267658312456544">Flege et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-0267658312456544">Munro et al., 1996</xref>) and successful acquisition of this vowel contrast is mostly limited to Italian speakers who had arrived at an early age (&lt; 10 years) in an English-speaking environment (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0267658312456544">Flege et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-0267658312456544">Munro et al., 1996</xref>). Since the Italian participants in the current study all lived in Italy and started learning English in a formal foreign-language setting, i.e. in the Italian school system after the age of 10, a strong positive influence of English on German vowel length perception is doubtful. Third, one might argue that the sensitivity of the Italian group to the non-native vowel length contrasts could also be attributed to their experience with allophonic vowel duration: In Italian, stressed open syllables especially in penultimate position are considerably lengthened (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0267658312456544">Bertinetto, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0267658312456544">Braun and Geiselmann, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0267658312456544">Krämer, 2009</xref>). If experience with allophonic vowel duration were the main predictor for the ability to perceive length contrasts, however, then German listeners would be expected to perform as well as Italian listeners since they also have experience with allophonic consonant length. As already mentioned earlier, the ratio between German quasi-geminates and singletons is comparable to the geminate–singleton ratio in the current stimuli. On the other hand, allophonic consonant duration in German occurs much less frequently than allophonic vowel duration in Italian and – as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0267658312456544">Kondaurova and Francis (2008)</xref> have shown – the frequency of occurrence of allophonic durational differences is a predictor for how strongly listeners rely on duration in a non-native categorization task. In future studies it will be interesting to investigate more closely under which conditions allophonic durational differences are processed efficiently in the native language (for example, if there is a frequency threshold) and whether this reliably predicts success in length distinctions in a second language. Fourth, the observed asymmetry in sensitivity to length contrasts could be also due to the different duration ratios for consonantal and vocalic length contrasts. As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0267658312456544">Table 2</xref>, vocalic length contrasts had a larger duration ratio than consonantal length contrasts (2.3 for vowels and 1.9 for consonants). However, both consonantal and vocalic length contrasts lie within the range of L1 allophonic duration variation observed in the two classes of sounds (vowels and consonants) and therefore should not advantage one particular language group. Finally, vowels carry a high informational load. For instance, rhythm and intonation are mainly implemented by suprasegmental features (duration, amplitude, f0) which are realized on vowels. Not least deserving of attention in this context is word stress, which is contrastive in Italian and for which duration is the most reliable cue (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0267658312456544">Bertinetto, 1980</xref>). Furthermore, vowels also contain cues to neighboring segments (e.g. formant transitions) and may convey speaker identity. Therefore, vowels might just be processed more efficiently than consonants in general; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0267658312456544">Cutler and Mehler’s (1993)</xref> ‘periodicity bias’ for infants. Weighing these alternative interpretations, we consider the nature of the acoustic signal and its functional load for different lexical and pragmatic purposes to be one of the most convincing reasons for the successful discrimination of vocalic length in the Italian group.</p>
<p>An additional argument for asymmetric processing rests on the observation that novel consonantal length contrasts are not only less successful but also more difficult to perceive in an L2 compared to novel vocalic length contrasts. To be precise, the reaction times for the Italians in the vowel length condition were not longer than their reaction times on the native consonantal length contrast, which suggests that both contrasts were equally easy or difficult to respond to. On the other hand, for all German participants (learners and non-learners alike), the non-native consonantal length condition induced longer reaction times compared to the native vocalic length condition. This asymmetry in reaction times is a strong indicator that the two types of non-native length contrast were not equally easy to process.</p>
<p>We thus see a learning development that manifests itself only in terms of accuracy but not (yet) in terms of processing speed. This points to the following asymmetric scenario: (1) Novel length contrasts for consonants are difficult to process but can be improved with increasing L2 experience. Nevertheless, they remain more difficult to process than native vowel length contrasts. (2) Novel vowel length contrasts do not pose a problem even in the absence of experience, neither regarding accuracy nor processing speed.</p>

<title>VII Conclusions</title>
<p>Listeners’ durational sensitivity to non-native vowel length contrasts seems to be high even when vowel length is not contrastive in one’s native language. Further psychophonetic experiments are necessary to delimit the bounds of this perceptual ability. On the contrary, consonantal length contrasts remain a challenge even after prolonged exposure to (and increased proficiency in) a language that employs such contrasts. It remains unclear how important (the frequency of occurrence of) allophonic experience with durational contrasts for a given class of segments – either consonants or vowels – in the L1 may be. Conceivably, the observed cross-linguistic asymmetry in the ability to perceive non-native vowel and consonantal length contrasts may have its roots in the different informational value carried by vowels and consonants, respectively.</p>

<p>For an insightful discussion of similar differential auditory cue weighting for /i/ vs. /ɪ/ in the interlanguage development of Spanish learners of two varieties of English, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0267658312456544">Escudero and Boersma (2004)</xref>. It should be noted that ‘Italian’ for our purposes is intended to mean Standard Italian. We are aware that certain northern Italian dialects – e.g. Friulian (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0267658312456544">Baroni and Vanelli, 2000</xref>) or Milanese (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr95-0267658312456544">Prieto, 2000</xref>) – may contrast short and long vowels.</p></fn>

<label>4.</label>
<p>There are a number of mostly articulatory studies that argue that the tense–lax distinction in German reflects a difference in the ‘Silbenschnitt’ and is hence structural rather than purely durational (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0267658312456544">Hoole and Mooshammer, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0267658312456544">Kroos et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr105-0267658312456544">Vennemann, 1991</xref>). Irrespective of the underlying theory, the acoustic difference that the listener has to process for /a:/ vs. /a/ in German manifests itself only in durational terms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0267658312456544">Jørgensen, 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-0267658312456544">Pätzold and Simpson, 1997</xref>).</p></fn>

<p>We would like to mention that the long front mid-open vowel /εː/ is not consistently produced across German dialects. For example, in an empirical study of radio and television news samples, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr96-0267658312456544">Ramers (1988)</xref> found it to be commonly substituted by [eː] by northern German speakers, while it was present in other varieties. Since our German participants all came from the very south of Germany, they were from a dialect area where there is still an active distinction between [eː] and [εː].</p></fn>

<label>7.</label>
<p>It should be added that words with geminate consonants also differ in other dimensions apart from duration. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-0267658312456544">Payne (2006)</xref>, for instance, reported that length contrasts in coronal sounds (/l/, /n/, /t/, /d/, /s/) also correlate with the exact place of articulation. Specifically, geminate consonants were produced with a more palatalized tongue position, while the tongue was more fronted in singleton consonants.</p></fn>

<p>In Standard Italian, /ε/ only occurs in stressed syllables (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0267658312456544">Bertinetto and Loporcaro, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0267658312456544">Krämer, 2009</xref>). While this is unproblematic for our monosyllabic V length and V segment items, it motivates why this vowel could not be employed for the C length or C segment items, which are disyllabic and thus necessarily contain one unstressed syllable.</p></fn>

<p>We expect the Italian procedure to result in slightly longer reaction times in all conditions due to the visual prompt. We will address this issue in more detail in Section V.</p></fn>

<p>Due to the limited number of items for each segment in this study, any test for more fine-grained differences in consonants (e.g. plosive, fricatives, nasals) would suffer from lacking statistical power.</p></fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn12-0267658312456544">
<label>12.</label>
<p>One anonymous reviewer raised the concern that the two vowel length contrasts (/ε/–/ε:/ and /a/–/a:/) occurred more frequently than the different kinds of consonantal length contrasts (fricatives, nasals, plosives), which might have influenced participants’ sensitivity to the vowel length contrasts. To exclude the possibility that the high sensitivity to the vowel length contrasts across participant groups was simply due to such a frequency effect, we calculated the <italic>d</italic>′ scores for only those vowel conditions that occurred in the first third of the experiment (matching the number of trials of the different kinds of consonantal length contrasts). In this subset, Italians showed the same sensitivity to the vowel length contrasts as the two German participant groups (<italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.05); likewise, there was no effect of type of contrast (<italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.05).</p></fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn13-0267658312456544">
<label>13.</label>
<p>For trials without a length contrast, task difficulty cannot be unambiguously attributed to length.</p></fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn14-0267658312456544">
<label>14.</label>
<p>Note that reaction times for segment conditions did not differ as a function of <italic>participant group</italic> or <italic>segment class</italic> (all <italic>p</italic>-values &gt; 0.2). This suggests that the difference in protocols between German and Italian participants had no effect on reaction times in general.</p></fn>

<p>Since the data were aggregated, we calculated a general linear model instead of a linear mixed effect regression model as done before.</p></fn>

<label>16.</label>
<p>According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0267658312456544">Escudero (2005)</xref>, two new categories for length (short vs. long) have to be created; following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0267658312456544">Best (1995)</xref> it would be one new category.</p></fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn17-0267658312456544">
<label>17.</label>
<p>We assume that this new category formation happens in the sequential order of singleton first – geminate next since short segments are typologically less marked than long ones (Blevins, 20005), i.e. the existence of geminate consonants entails at the very least the existence of their corresponding singletons in a given language inventory, and geminates often originated through historical language change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0267658312456544">Blevins 2005</xref>) from singletons. The actual phonetic duration, of course, may differ between languages.</p></fn>
