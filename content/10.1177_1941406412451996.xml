<abstract>
<p>Cardiovascular risk factors in childhood are known to be a predictor of morbidity. The objective here was to determine the feasibility of a school-based intervention of providing fruit daily in the classroom and its effects on risk factors of cardiovascular disease and dietary behavior. The authors designed a pilot study (23 children, 9-11 years old) for a randomized controlled trial with fruit served daily in the classroom over a period of 5 weeks as a readily available healthy dietary alternative and follow-up over 16 weeks. The main outcome included acceptability and impact on class time in addition to BMI, waist to hip ratio, body fat percentage, bench test, blood pressure, blood glucose and cholesterol levels, food habits, and attitudes toward dietary fruit intake. The pilot study showed that the intervention (a) was well received by children, parents, and teachers; (b) created minimal disruption to daily activity; and (c) may have the potential to influence physiological parameters and attitudes toward dietary intake in children. Improvements were seen in physiological measures such as body fat percentage and cardiovascular endurance tests, with improvements also seen in blood high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Questionnaire data suggested that both dietary choices and canteen choices of the children improved over the intervention period. This pilot study provides the proof of concept for conducting a randomized controlled trial of daily provision of fruit within the school environment to evaluate the impact on cardiovascular risk factors at an early age.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Cardiovascular risk factors in childhood are known to be predictors of negative health outcomes in later life.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1941406412451996">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1941406412451996">2</xref></sup> For example, the Bogalusa Heart Study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1941406412451996">3</xref></sup> reported that obesity in childhood was associated with increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in adult life. Among the most common consequences of primary childhood obesity are hypertension, dyslipidemia, and psychosocial problems, predisposing children to cardiovascular disease,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1941406412451996">4</xref></sup> stroke, and type 2 diabetes mellitus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1941406412451996">5</xref></sup> in early adulthood.</p>
<p>In recent years, the increased prevalence of obesity among children has reached epidemic proportions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1941406412451996">6</xref></sup> Studies of obesity prevalence over time show a 2.3- to 3.3-fold increase over about 25 years in the United States and of 2.0- to 2.8-fold increase over 10 years in the United Kingdom.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1941406412451996">7</xref></sup> Current estimates in Australian children indicate that 20% to 25% are overweight or obese; the 1995 National Nutrition Survey found that 4.9% of boys and 5.4% of girls aged 2 to 18 years were obese, and 2 other studies in 1997 (the New South Wales Schools Fitness and Physical Activity Survey and the Health of Young Victorians Study), involving children aged 7 to 15 years, reported similar results.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1941406412451996">8</xref></sup> There is also evidence that between 1985 and 1995, the incidence of overweight among children in Australia has doubled and that of obesity has trebled.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1941406412451996">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>Childhood diet is a significant determinant of adult diet,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1941406412451996">10</xref></sup> and higher fruit and vegetable consumption in childhood is associated with decreased risk of adult chronic disease.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1941406412451996">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1941406412451996">12</xref></sup> Despite these benefits, a high proportion of children have inadequate fruit and vegetable intake.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1941406412451996">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1941406412451996">14</xref></sup> The school food environment can have a significant effect on adolescents’ food choices because a large proportion of total daily energy is consumed at school.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1941406412451996">15</xref></sup> In this context, multicomponent school interventions have proved to be effective in increasing fruit intake. Components of intervention have included behavioral curricula in classrooms, parental involvement, peer support, school food service changes, and food industry support.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1941406412451996">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1941406412451996"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1941406412451996">18</xref></sup></p>
<p>The Tooty Fruity Vegie project in New South Wales<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1941406412451996">19</xref></sup> and a London-based primary school intervention<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1941406412451996">20</xref></sup> were both aimed at preventing the large decline in fruit and vegetable intake that typically starts during primary school. Results indicated that primary schools can be supported to establish, implement, and sustain highly acceptable and effective fruit- and vegetable-promoting programs, with intervention and follow-up periods over as little as 4 months. School-based environmental interventions to increase the availability and promotion of lower-fat foods were also shown to increase the purchase of these foods among adolescents.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1941406412451996">21</xref></sup></p>
<p>The aim of the study was to determine the feasibility in terms of impact on class time and acceptability of providing a daily serving of fruit in the classroom.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1941406412451996">22</xref></sup> With acceptable levels of feasibility, we would develop a randomized controlled trial of this simple intervention strategy for future large-sample multischool studies. The secondary aims of the pilot program were to assess physiological measures (BMI, waist and hip circumference, body fat percentage, cardiovascular endurance, blood pressure, and blood glucose and cholesterol levels) and child attitudes and food habits. Initially, the feasibility of this approach<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1941406412451996">23</xref></sup> needed to be established prior to embarking on a multischool intervention project.</p>

<title>Materials and Methods</title>
<sec id="section3-1941406412451996">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>The pilot study population consisted of 1 year 5 class of 23 children of Wesley College Melbourne. Children and their guardians gave written informed consent for the project, which was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Alfred Healthcare Group and carried out in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki (2000).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1941406412451996">
<title>Fruit Provision</title>
<p>Local markets and grocers were approached for sponsorship of fruit to be used in the intervention. A major local market (South Melbourne Markets) agreed to sponsor 5 types of fruit to be delivered twice a week, over 5 weeks, providing 1 serving of fruit to all participants daily. This included red apples, green apples, pears, mandarins, oranges, and bananas, depending on availability that week. In return, the 5 fruiterers involved were given a certificate of appreciation and market and stall promotion in school newsletters that school semester.</p>

<sec id="section6-1941406412451996">
<title>Physiological Measures</title>
<sec id="section7-1941406412451996">
<title>Growth measures</title>
<p>Height and weight were measured after participants removed heavy clothing and shoes, using a height meter (Tollot Pty Ltd) and a calibrated scale (Salter Bathroom Scale 150 kg × 500 g, model 9985), respectively. BMI was calculated as weight in kilograms divided by the square of height in meters. Waist and hip circumference were recorded using a measuring tape, with measurements at the level of the umbilicus and at the point of maximal girth, respectively. Body fat percentage was determined by a body fat monitor (Omron, Body Logic, Body Fat Monitor HBF-302W, OMRON HEALTHCARE). The participant’s personal data were keyed in, and the Body Fat Monitor was held at a 90° angle to the standing posture and at chest level. The monitor then derived a prompt measurement of the body fat percentage.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1941406412451996">
<title>Bench test (cardiovascular endurance)</title>
<p>Participants were required to step on a 30 cm bench in time to a metronome (Samick Metronome, Model SMM88), which was set at a rhythm of 96 bpm (24 steps per minute) for 3 minutes. Immediately after the test, participants sat down, and cardiovascular endurance was assessed by their heart rate (HR) measured continuously for 1 minute from the pulse of the right carotid artery. The first pulse counted as 0.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1941406412451996">
<title>Blood pressure</title>
<p>Resting supine systolic blood pressure (SBP) and standing diastolic blood pressure (DBP) were measured using an automated oscillometric blood pressure monitor (Dinamap Vital Signs Monitor 1846 SX, Critikon, FL). Participants rested for 5 minutes after which SBP, DBP, and HR were measured at 3-minute intervals. The mean of the 3 SBP, DBP, and HR measurements was calculated.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1941406412451996">
<title>Blood lipids and glucose profile</title>
<p>Plasma total and low-and high-density lipoprotein (LDL and HDL) cholesterol, triglycerides, and glucose levels were determined from a finger-prick blood sample (&lt;1 mL) taken from the middle finger of the left hand, using a single-use lancet (Unistik 2 Normal, AT 0700, Owen Mumford). The finger was then squeezed to obtain a large drop of blood, which was discarded. The finger was then squeezed again very gently until a second large drop formed. A capillary tube was used to collect the second drop collected without touching the skin and placed immediately into the sample well of the bench-top analyzer (Cholestech LDX System, Cholestech Corporation, Hayward, California) for analysis. Results were measured in millimoles per liter.</p>

<sec id="section11-1941406412451996">
<title>Dietary Measures</title>
<sec id="section12-1941406412451996">
<title>Dietary information</title>
<p>This was assessed by both food frequency questionnaires (FFQs) and 3-day weighed-food diaries. The 15-item FFQ comprised a checklist in which possible foods for each of the meals eaten during the past week were listed and analyzed for frequency of consumption of foods high in fat, foods and drinks high in sugars, fruits and vegetables, and foods from the school canteen. The questionnaire was administered in class. It was developed and adapted from the validated Anti Cancer Council of Victoria Food Frequency Questionnaire.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1941406412451996">24</xref></sup></p>
<p>Scores were assigned to responses to the FFQ on dietary choice based on consumption of the following foods: bread, sugar, milk, eggs, take-away food, meat, salt, biscuits, fried food, and soft drinks. Scores were also assigned to responses to the FFQ on vegetable intake, fruit intake, canteen food consumption frequency, and fruit preference rating based on the following choices: banana, apple, mandarin, orange, and pear (seasonal fruits provided in the classroom during the intervention). The cumulative scores for the category dietary choice were then categorized as high, medium, and low, with a high score reflecting poor dietary choices. The cumulative scores for vegetable intake were categorized as good and poor, and fruit intake as optimum intake and not optimum intake, based on recommended Australian Dietary Guidelines for this age group.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1941406412451996">25</xref></sup> The cumulative scores for canteen food consumption frequency were categorized as seldom or often, and fruit preference rating as dislike and like categories. This scoring was applied at baseline, postintervention, and follow-up.</p>
<p>The weighed-food diary was free form and was given to children to take home to their parents to be completed together. It had 3 pages, one for each day, with columns for the date of record, the meal at which the food was consumed (breakfast, lunch, snack, dinner, or supper), number of servings, and/or the weighed quantity in grams and a column for any further details. The caloric content of the food diary was evaluated and analyzed using Foodworks Version 2.0 (Xyris Software Australia Pty Ltd).</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-1941406412451996">
<title>Subjective Measures</title>
<p>Family lifestyle and interaction information was assessed by a questionnaire measuring family and peer influence on the child’s fruit consumption, previously developed and pilot tested with a year 5 group.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1941406412451996">26</xref></sup> It comprised 65 questions, of which 21 were for the child, 22 for the father/male guardian, and 22 for the mother/female guardian. Participant exercise scores were categorized as poor, fair, and good. Activity at home was categorized as low and high for weekdays and weekends, respectively. Health awareness, family interaction with participant, and family fruit intake cumulative scores were categorized as poor, fair, and good. Additional paternal and maternal information was collected and scored based on the Australian Standard Classification of Occupation: country of origin (local/migrant), race/ethnicity (Caucasian/non-Caucasian), occupation (professional/non-professional), and highest level of education (low = stopped at primary school, secondary school, technical and further education; high = completed university, postgraduate, etc).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-1941406412451996">
<title>Statistical Analysis of Data</title>
<p>All analyses were performed using SPSS (version 12.0 SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL). Results for baseline characteristics are expressed as mean ± standard deviation. Analysis of variance (ANCOVA), adjusting for baseline parameter values, was undertaken to determine treatment effects. The level of statistical significance used was <italic>P</italic> ≤ .05. As this is a pilot study with no comparison control group, these analyses are undertaken to inform on the design considerations for the main trial and will not be considered for determination of a treatment effect in this pilot study.</p>

<title>Fruit Provision</title>
<p>South Melbourne Market had a collection point of fruit twice a week, assembled by the 5 fruiterer stalls involved. The fruit was picked up in boxes and delivered to the school and kept in the classroom for a maximum of 3 days before the next delivery. Extra serves were provided by the market to ensure availability of variety. Excess fruit at the end of each week was consumed by staff of the school.

<p>There was little impact on class time, with fruit serves given out and eaten just before the morning break. The class teacher encouraged and noted that a serving of fruit was consumed by participants before they left class and that most children chose different fruits through the week. All participants consistently took a serving of fruit daily during the 5-week intervention.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This pilot study explored the feasibility of a simple intervention to improve dietary habits of year 5 children. The baseline physiological characteristics of the study population were within healthy ranges as defined by the National Nutrition Survey.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1941406412451996">27</xref></sup> Participation rates reflected eagerness and enthusiasm on the part of the school, students, and parents to be involved in the intervention, and there was also a high compliance—above 95%—with the classroom-based questionnaire at baseline and follow-up points. The questionnaires were developed specifically for the project as no Australian validated questionnaires for dietary and, specifically, fruit intake exist for this age group.</p>
<p>Completion rates for the take-home lifestyle questionnaires were more than 85% at baseline but considerably poorer at follow-up. Hence data could not be used other than for baseline descriptive purposes. Baseline results from the lifestyle questionnaire suggest that these parents/guardians had healthy eating habits and good interaction with their children in improving their dietary habits. However, they were mostly Caucasian professionals with good education (refer to <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1941406412451996">Table 3</xref>). Further investigation in a sample representing different socioeconomic and ethnic backgrounds is warranted. It would also be worth improving the compliance and participation for this take-home lifestyle questionnaire for the main study because it has been demonstrated that treatment of childhood obesity with the parents as the exclusive agent of change induces more behavioral changes and greater weight loss than the conventional approach in which children are responsible for their own weight loss.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1941406412451996">28</xref></sup> Modification of parental diet could be a key strategy for interventions targeting children’s eating habits.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1941406412451996">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1941406412451996">30</xref></sup></p>
<p>It was also noted that completion rates for the 3-day food diary were poor, and these food diaries were deemed not feasible to be repeated for a larger trial study. Participation rates dropped significantly toward the end of the intervention, probably because of the demands of the diary, which had to be taken home and completed with a parent or guardian. However, the FFQ (classroom-based questionnaire) that was filled out by the participant, regarding dietary behavior at baseline and at the 2 follow-ups, was deemed sufficient to study possible associations between diet and physiological measure changes. Although blood samples taken were not fasting blood samples, special care was taken to ensure that measures were taken at the same time of the day at baseline and follow-ups and that the “Cholestech” sample reader was calibrated prior to each use. One of the other limitations identified in this study was the lack of a stronger measure of physical activity of participants over the study period because physical activity could account for the increase in cardiovascular endurance observed as well as increased blood HDL levels.</p>
<p>Given the small sample size and the lack of a control group, these pilot results cannot be used to quantify changes. However, a significant decrease in body fat percentage was observed, and results from the FFQ reflected possible improvements in dietary choices and vegetable intake over the intervention period, with less canteen food consumption frequency. The daily provision of fruit free of charge in the classroom through this study intervention was aimed to be an effective alternative to otherwise unhealthy foods from other sources, but with the observed increase in blood glucose, triglycerides, and waist circumference over the intervention, it is plausible that instead of choosing fruit as a healthy alternative, it was instead eaten together in addition to the normal diet. This, however, could not be confirmed because the FFQ outcome of dietary choice changes observed were not significant and appeared to be improving rather than being poor. A trial with a larger sample is required to determine whether these measures might prove significant in terms of change caused by the intervention. Another possible explanation is the nature of growth of this age group, where BMI and body girth are increasing regardless of dietary behavior because of natural growth.</p>
<p>Overall, providing and eating fruit as a group activity in the classroom ensured that students took a serving each, bringing them closer to meeting the National Guidelines for number of servings of fruit per day for this age group. Better fruit availability has been identified as a significant determinant of fruit intake among grade 5 and 6 children both at home and at school.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1941406412451996">31</xref></sup> The significant increase in HDL levels from baseline to 16 weeks postintervention may also reflect the overall increase in consumption of fruit over the study period. Eating enough fruit is one of the clearest evidence-based dietary health promotion messages, with inadequate intake consistently and strongly associated with increased incidence of many cancers and cardiovascular and coronary heart disease.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1941406412451996">32</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1941406412451996"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1941406412451996"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1941406412451996">35</xref></sup></p>
<p>Most school-based nutrition programs focus on classroom curriculum, but efforts to change the food environment at school in terms of availability of healthy food have been promising.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1941406412451996">36</xref></sup> A school community intervention model contributed to the feasibility of the pilot study in this age group. These overall results suggest that it is feasible to further investigate the approach in a larger, randomized study, giving merit to the simple provision of fruit in the classroom daily and including the physiological measures and the in-class FFQ as suitable outcome measures. The lifestyle questionnaire for parents would need a better pitch for compliance to be a useful reference for possible correlations. Including a stronger measure of physical activity would also be important in the main study design. With a larger sample, we would hope that the outcome observed would be a measurable improvement in cardiovascular risk resulting from the simple fruit intervention, and we hope to capture the choice of fruit as a healthy alternative to otherwise unhealthy food choices in the FFQ outcome.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The feasibility of conducting a school-based intervention to improve dietary choices and thereby reduce risk factors for obesity and cardiovascular disease in children was demonstrated in this pilot study. There was a high level of participation in most components of the study from the school, staff, parents, and pupils. In addition, the results suggest that a large, randomized controlled study is feasible to further investigate this promising model for a successful intervention.</p>
