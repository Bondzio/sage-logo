<abstract>
<p>Environmental advertising can create opportunities for a hospitality company to maximize messages and sponsorships. This research explores the independent and interactive influences of environmental claims and the emotional benefits on consumer response to hotels’ environmental advertising. This study further analyzes whether there are differences in responses to green advertisements between high-involved and low-involved consumers. The results indicate that a substantive claim would elicit much more positive responses from consumers than an associative claim, and a self-expressive benefit is generally more successful than a nature-related benefit in fostering positive responses. At the same time, a substantive claim was more persuasive when it was coupled with a self-expressive benefit, while an associative claim led to more positive reactions after exposure to a nature-related benefit. Finally, there is a difference in responses to hotels’ environmental ads between high- and low-involvement consumers. This article provides empirical information for hotel marketers contemplating the development and presentation of environmental advertising to improve their environmental brand image and increase consumer purchase intent.</p>

<title>The Effectiveness of Environmental Advertising in the Hotel Industry</title>
<p>As society has become more concerned with environmental issues, hotels have expanded their efforts to address sustainability issues and to modify their behavior in an attempt to address those concerns. For example, some hotels have been quick to accept concepts like environmental management systems and waste minimization and have integrated environmental issues into all organizational activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1938965511433293">Chan 2009</xref>). In addition, as of 2005, ninety-four facilities have been certified to be in compliance with the Nordic eco-label for hotel businesses in Sweden (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1938965511433293">Ecolabelling of Compost Bins 2005</xref>), and environmental guides for the hotel sector (published by trade associations and hotel chains) have gained new attention by the hotel industry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1938965511433293">Chan and Lam 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>Studies support the idea that sustainable resource practices are of great interest to consumers. According to Information Resources Inc. of Chicago, 50 percent of consumers consider at least one of four features in their product purchase choices: eco-friendly packaging, organic status, eco-friendly status, or fair-treatment status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1938965511433293">Half of U.S. Consumers Consider Sustainability 2008</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1938965511433293">Hu, Parsa, and Self (2010)</xref> reported that more than 50 percent of consumers are willing to pay 2 to 6 percent more to patronize a green restaurant. These studies show that environment-related issues are gaining importance within the hospitality industry.</p>
<p>One outcome of this increase in environmental consciousness is the use of environmental advertising as a logical extension of hotels’ sustainability activities. Environmental advertising seeks to share information on a business’s pro-environmental aspects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1938965511433293">Ahmad, Shah, and Ahmad 2010</xref>). A study conducted by Wossen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1938965511433293">Kassaye (2001)</xref> found that even ten years ago many of the leading U.S. companies, including McDonald’s, Wal-Mart, Coca-Cola, Campbell Soup, and Sears, were doing green marketing to varying degrees. Hoteliers have also been producing environmental advertisements to establish their sustainability credentials, and this is the topic of the investigation presented in this article. The sidebar shows environmental statements by Hilton and Hyatt, for instance.</p>
<p>Two persuasion models lead to the formation of brand attitudes: elaboration likelihood model (ELM), which examines the cognitive evaluation of functional brand attributes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1938965511433293">Petty and Cacioppo 1983</xref>) and the affect–reason–involvement model (ARI), which considers the emotional reaction to emotional brand benefits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1938965511433293">Buck et al. 2004</xref>). Green brands built through a combination of functional and emotional elements may enhance buying processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1938965511433293">Zambardino and Goodfellow 2007</xref>). Attitude formation most probably takes place through an intensive interaction of cognitive and emotional processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1938965511433293">Hartmann and Apaolaza-Ibañez 2005</xref>). Regarding the issue of green brand advertising, environmental claims are considered as functional elements, while emotional benefits are regarded as emotional elements. Environmental claims and emotional benefits might motivate consumers to make purchases based on their beliefs regarding green operations, and the interactions of claims and benefits might enhance green consumption processes.</p>
<p>Although hotel brands have invested in environmental advertising, I have seen little empirical research specifically directed toward exploring consumers’ response to hotels’ environmental advertising. Given the resulting lack of empirical guidance, this research explores the independent and interactive influence of the environmental claims described in the advertising and the emotional benefits that consumers hold as a result of exposure to advertising designed to influence consumers’ responses to hotels’ environmental activity. This study further analyzes whether there are differences in responses to green advertisements between consumers with high environmental involvement and those with low involvement.</p>

<sec id="section2-1938965511433293">
<title>Environmental Claims</title>
<p>The most powerful tool of environmental marketing is green communication, in which environmental messages are transmitted to consumers—usually through environmental claims in advertisements. Environmental claims are considered as the most visible signs of environmental marketing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1938965511433293">Nair and Menon 2008</xref>). The environmental claims a company makes about itself, its products, or its services are basically advertisements and can take on any form attributable to a media source, such as statements, symbols, product or package labels, product or service collateral, or advertising (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1938965511433293">Environmental Claims: A Guide for Industry and Advertisers 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>In an effort to reach environmentally conscious consumers, marketers use specific types of claims (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1938965511433293">Gibson 2008</xref>). Such claims can be classified into five categories of information—product orientation, process orientation, image orientation, environmental fact, and combinations of those four categories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1938965511433293">Carlson, Grove, and Kangun 1993</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1938965511433293">Ottman (1993)</xref> further categorizes product and process orientation information as substantive claims that present concrete and specific information about the environmentally responsible efforts of an organization. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1938965511433293">Carlson et al. (1996)</xref> suggest that the product and process orientations demonstrate organizational interventions in the marketplace that have a positive, or at least benign, effect on the environment. On the other hand, the image orientation and environmental fact information may help an organization to establish an environmentally friendly façade by implying connections between the advertiser and positive, environmentally related information, rather than directly mentioning how it actually contributes to ecological well-being (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1938965511433293">Chan 2000</xref>). Therefore, image orientation and environmental fact were considered as associative claims that are less tangible than substantive claims. A number of studies appear to argue that consumer response may vary according to the type of environmental claim. In <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1938965511433293">Davis’s (1993)</xref> study, specific environmental claims that provide detailed, relevant, understandable, and supportable information on green products’ environmental benefits were found to be better received by consumers than claims that lack these characteristics. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1938965511433293">Chan (1999)</xref> suggests that consumers would prefer to have concrete (rather than vague) information about the eco-friendly attributes of green products. The findings in Chan, Leung, and Wong’s study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1938965511433293">2006</xref>) show that substantive environmental claims, because of their informational and more concrete nature, will generate more favorable consumer responses than will their associative environmental counterparts.</p>
<p>The matter of making substantive claims is particularly a challenge to service advertisers, who, of course, are dealing with an intangible product (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1938965511433293">Mittal 1999</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1938965511433293">Legg and Baker (1987)</xref> suggest that the use of vivid advertisements that employ tangible cues, concrete language, or dramatization may help the customer’s assessment in this regard. For hotel services, the effectiveness of substantive environmental claims should be more apparent than that of associative environmental claims. Since consumers would rely more heavily on claims that could provide them with concrete information and substantiated evidence to make their evaluation, the following is proposed:</p>
<list id="list1-1938965511433293" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 1</italic>: Substantive environmental claims in hotel advertisements would generate more favorable consumer responses than associative environmental claims.</p></list-item>
</list>

<sec id="section3-1938965511433293">
<title>Emotional Benefits</title>
<p>Emotional benefit information connects affect-laden experiences associated with a brand, or “how you feel when you buy, use, or simply own the product” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1938965511433293">Haley 1985</xref>). This type of information is important because consumers’ emotional response toward a product or brand may be a decisive factor in the purchase decision. Given the connection between emotions and purchase decisions, product differentiation can benefit from an understanding of how products evoke emotions and an assessment of emotion-sensitive software tools for use in marketing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1938965511433293">Barrena and Sanchez 2009</xref>). Moreover, creating beliefs about a brand’s emotional benefits may, in a sense, successfully substitute for an advertiser’s ability to evoke emotions at the point of contact with advertising (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1938965511433293">Ruth 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>Two kinds of emotional consumption experiences related to environmental products have been identified and defined: nature-related benefits and self-expressive benefits. Nature-related benefits, which stem from sensations and feelings normally experienced through contact with nature, are identified as a motivational basis to protect natural environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1938965511433293">Hartmann, Apaolaza-Ibáñez, and Forcada Sáinz 2005</xref>). These are the result of a sensation of “emotional affinity towards nature” (e.g., “loving nature” or “feeling one with nature”; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1938965511433293">Kals, Schumacher, and Montada 1999</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1938965511433293">Kaplan and Kaplan (1989)</xref> suggest that representing nature in environmental advertising may lead to emotional experiences during product consumption that are analogous to those experienced in real nature. For this reason, green brands use natural images in advertising to evoke emotional experiences like an “affinity towards nature” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1938965511433293">Hartmann et al. 2008</xref>). A further emotional benefit of green consumption may be based on the social factor of being seen as environmentally conscious in purchases. Self-expressive benefits can be evoked through the socially visible consumption of environmentally friendly products (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1938965511433293">Belz and Dyllik 1996</xref>).</p>
<p>One possible explanation for how references to emotional benefits affect persuasion is that the emotions themselves are elicited during the advertising. The idea here is that exposure stimulates consumers’ affective responses to the advertisement, which in turn influence brand attitudes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1938965511433293">Holbrook and Batra 1987</xref>).</p>
<p>Advertising can also influence mental or cognitive consideration of the emotional consequences of one’s actions, which in turn may influence evaluations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1938965511433293">Ruth 2001</xref>). Substantial evidence suggests that an emotional positioning strategy can drive a brand’s green positioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1938965511433293">Hartmann et al. 2005</xref>). The findings in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1938965511433293">Hartmann et al. (2008)</xref> also suggest that emotional consumption benefits related to the environmental performance of the analyzed brands significantly improved the consumer’s attitude toward the brands. Different benefits exert different influences. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1938965511433293">Carroll and Ahuvia (2006)</xref> report that self-expressive benefits offered by the brand seem to offer the greatest potential for encouraging desirable consumption behavior. The benefits desired by consumers in a brand have been found to play a role in this choice because they add to the self-expressive and symbolic value of the brand for the buyer. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1938965511433293">Mannetti, Pierro, and Livi (2004)</xref> also conclude that self-expressive benefits can be a useful addition to environmental behaviors such as recycling. Based on the above studies, the following hypothesis is suggested:</p>
<list id="list2-1938965511433293" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 2</italic>: Consumers’ experiences regarding self-expressive benefits are expected to wield more favorable consumer responses than nature-related benefits in hotel environmental advertisements.</p></list-item>
</list>
<sec id="section4-1938965511433293">
<title>Involvement</title>
<p>The final critical element in the purchase decision that I examine here is involvement, which can be thought of as the degree of personal relevance of a product in terms of one’s needs, values, or interests (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1938965511433293">Zaichkowsky 1985</xref>). It is generally accepted that involvement reflects a strong motivation in the form of highly perceived personal relevance to products or services in a particular context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1938965511433293">Flynn and Goldsmith 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1938965511433293">Gotlieb, Schlacter, and St. Louis 1992</xref>). Depending on the perceived linkage between an individual’s motivating influences and the benefits offered by a product, involvement can vary from low to high. The level of consumer involvement with a product (i.e., low or high) has been used to explain the variation in the degree of effort a consumer is willing to devote to consumption-related activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1938965511433293">Zaichkowsky 1985</xref>).</p>
<p>According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1938965511433293">Blackwell et al. (2001)</xref>, the degree of involvement tends to be high when consumers perceive the decision to purchase as having direct personal implications. If consumers consider environmental problems as serious issues, they may be highly involved in cognitive analysis of the related advertising messages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1938965511433293">Chan and Lau 2004</xref>). More specifically, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1938965511433293">D’Souza’s (2005)</xref> study is structured to investigate whether highly involved or active green consumers (i.e., those whose purchase behavior is greatly influenced by environmental concerns), and low-involved or passive green consumers (i.e., those whose purchase behavior is minimally influenced by environmental concerns) differ in their perceptions of green claims.</p>
<p>A study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1938965511433293">Schuhwerk and Lefkoff-Hagius (1995)</xref> that tested this notion found that highly involved consumers’ cognitive evaluation was that green ads were “believable” and “favorable,” and their affective evaluation was that green ads were “good.” In contrast, low-involved consumers generally disagreed that green advertisements were “good,” “believable,” or “favorable.” The study further finds evidence to suggest that only the low-involved groups gave poor ratings to advertising by green brands, showing that those consumers that are highly involved with the environment are intrinsically motivated to be alert to environmental attributes of products. Building on that study, the following hypotheses is proposed:</p>
<list id="list3-1938965511433293" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 3</italic>: The effects of environmental claims and emotional benefits on consumers’ responses to environmental advertising are expected to be stronger for high-involvement consumers than low-involvement consumers.</p></list-item>

<title>Methodology</title>
<sec id="section6-1938965511433293">
<title>Experimental Design</title>
<p>To explore the effectiveness of environmental claims and emotional benefits on consumers’ brand perceptions and whether that effectiveness may be differentiated by consumer’s involvement, a 2 × 2 × 2 between-subjects study design was conducted. The factors in this experiment included two types of environmental claims (substantive claim and associative claim), two types of emotional benefits (nature-related benefit and self-expressive benefit), and two levels of consumer involvement (high and low). Below, I specify the two levels of each factor.</p>
<sec id="section7-1938965511433293">
<title>Environmental claims, substantive versus associative</title>
<p>The substantive claim provides concrete and specific information about how the hotel firm contributes to environmental protection (<italic>e.g., Our hotel uses energy-saving light bulbs and keycards, and sensor-activated taps to save water, and has adopted a policy to purchase environmentally sensitive products, especially items that are recyclable or made from recycled materials</italic>). The associative claim provides the image orientation and environmental fact information without directly mentioning how it actually contributes to ecological well-being (<italic>e.g., up to 12 percent of the Arctic ice pack has melted in the past 30 years, and the world’s rain forests will be gone within 100 years if the world continues at the current rate of deforestation</italic>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1938965511433293">
<title>Emotional benefits, nature versus self-expression</title>
<p>The emotional benefits were manipulated with imagery. The nature-related benefit was evoked through the use of pleasant nature imagery such as mountain scenery and waterfalls, while the self-expressive benefit was evoked using the images of a group of people in a nature scene such as couples, families, or friends.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1938965511433293">
<title>Involvement levels</title>
<p>For involvement, the study used the measures for high or low involvement from four 7-point Likert-type scales adopted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1938965511433293">Schuhwerk and Lefkoff-Hagius (1995)</xref>. Based on a median score split of the results, the respondents were divided into a high environmental involvement group and a low environmental involvement group.</p>
<p>The test used four print advertisements for a fictitious hotel (with no connection to an actual brand). Respondents were selected by convenience sampling and quota according to age and gender and were randomly assigned to one of four treatment groups. Each group of participants was exposed to one of the four print advertisements, each of which contained a different “green” claim, based on the tests of different levels of emotional benefits and environmental claims. Participants were instructed to read the ads as they normally would at their own speed. Each respondent also received a short booklet that contained the instructions and survey questions for the assigned print advertisements. All booklets looked exactly the same, and subjects were unaware of manipulations of key information in the advertisements. After the viewing, they were requested to express their responses relevant to the investigation.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1938965511433293">
<title>Measures and Participants</title>
<p>Three main dependent measures were used to evaluate a subject’s perception of the advertisements: (1) attitude toward the advertisement (AA), (2) brand attitude (BA), and (3) purchase intention (PI). These measures were recorded by using a 7-point semantic differential scale. The scales for measuring respondents’ attitudes toward the advertisement used statements such as “good/bad,” “positive/negative,” “irritating/not irritating,” and “favorable/unfavorable” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1938965511433293">Stevenson, Bruner, and Kumar 2000</xref>). To measure brand attitude, participants were asked to rate their overall impression of the brand discussed in the articles that they had read on the scales anchored by “unfavorable/favorable,” “bad/good,” “poor quality/good quality,” and “negative/positive” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1938965511433293">Lafferty and Goldsmith 1999</xref>). Finally, purchase intentions were measured by “very unlikely/very likely,” “improbable/probable,” and “impossible/possible” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1938965511433293">Bailey 2005</xref>). The reliability of measures was assessed with Cronbach’s alpha, and all the measures showed a satisfactory level of reliability. Cronbach’s alphas for attitude toward the advertisement, brand attitude, and purchase intention were .92, .90, and .91.</p>
<p>The data were collected at a busy retail shopping center in Taiwan over a four-week period. Participants were randomly approached and invited to participate in this study. This procedure resulted in the collection of data from 320 individuals. Incomplete and peculiar responses were removed from the analysis, yielding a sample size of 300, a 93 percent usable response rate. In this sample, 56 percent of the participants were female, and 44 percent were married. The dominant age group of the respondents was 30 to 39 years (43.7%), followed by 20 to 29 years (28.7%) and 40 to 49 years (17.3%). A majority of the participants (74.3%) had a college degree. Self-reported household income by categories were as follows: 8.3 percent were in the less than $20,000 category, 46.7 percent were in the $20,000 to $40,000 category, 33.7 percent were in the $40,001 to $60,000 category, 7.3 percent were in the $60,001 to $80,000 category, and 4 percent were in the $80,001 and higher category.</p>

<title>Results and Discussions</title>
<sec id="section12-1938965511433293">
<title>Manipulation Check</title>
<p>To ensure that the manipulations were reliable and effective, I included a number of manipulation checks in the questionnaire, as described below. The manipulation of environmental claims was examined by asking a participant’s level of agreement with two statements gauging whether the stimulus advertisement contained a substantive claim or an associative claim. The participants were able to correctly identify the environmental claim presented in their particular advertisement: <italic>t</italic><sub>(298)</sub> = 2.91, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05, on the first statement and <italic>t</italic><sub>(298)</sub> = 2.76, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05, on the second statement. The manipulation relating to nonverbal content of emotional benefits was checked by mean responses to several 7-point Likert-type items anchored by “strongly agree” and “strongly disagree,” developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1938965511433293">Hartmann (2008)</xref>, which analyzed the capacity of visuals to evoke emotional benefits. These items captured agreement with statements regarding subjects’ feelings and emotions evoked by the image represented and the feelings and emotions they experienced with respect to the advertisement. Again, the participants correctly identified the type of emotional benefit presented in the imagery: <italic>t</italic><sub>(298)</sub> = 2.95, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05, on the pleasant nature imagery and <italic>t</italic><sub>(298)</sub> = 2.10, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05 on the images of a group of people). Therefore, I concluded that the manipulation of both environmental claims and emotional benefits was effective.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-1938965511433293">
<title>Hypotheses Testing</title>
<p>To examine the three hypotheses, multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) was first used to test whether the three dimensions (attitude toward the advertisement [AA], brand attitude [BA], and purchase intention [PI]) differed across the four combinations of environmental claims and emotional benefits. The three dependent variables were submitted to MANOVA with environmental claims (substantive claim/associative claim) and emotional benefits (nature-related benefit/self-expressive benefit) as the independent variables. As demonstrated in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1938965511433293">Exhibit 1</xref>, results indicated significant main effects for environmental claims (Wilks’s λ: <italic>F</italic> = 2.68, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05), emotional benefits (Wilks’s λ: <italic>F</italic> = 3.56, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05), and a significant interaction effect (Wilks’s λ: <italic>F</italic> = 29.59, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01).</p>

<p>Given those significant differences, I continued with a univariate analysis of variance (ANOVA) to further identify the source of the differences. Those univariate analyses indicated a significant main effect of environmental claims on two of the three dependent measures; attitude toward the advertisement (<italic>F</italic><sub>1, 296</sub> = 7.63, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01) and brand attitude (<italic>F</italic><sub>1, 296</sub> = 4.87, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05), for which means of participants who received the substantive claim were higher than means of those receiving the associative claim (3.69 vs. 3.46 and 3.89 vs. 3.73). As seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1938965511433293">Exhibit 2</xref>, ratings for attitudes toward the advertisement, brand attitude, and purchase intention were consistently more positive when the substantive claim was presented in the advertisement, supporting hypothesis 1. I conclude that there exists a significant main effect of environmental claims, in which consumers receiving a hotel advertisement with the substantive claim are likely to generate higher favorable attitudes toward both the advertisement and the brand than consumers receiving an advertisement with the associative claim.</p>

<p>The directional effect of emotional benefits can be seen in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1938965511433293">Exhibit 3</xref>. An examination of the mean level of response for the two types of emotional benefits indicates that the self-expressive benefit is generally more successful than the nature-related benefit in fostering positive response. Attitude toward advertisement (<italic>F</italic><sub>1, 296</sub> = 3.24, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01), brand attitude (<italic>F</italic><sub>1, 296</sub> = 6.66, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01), and purchase intention (<italic>F</italic><sub>1, 296</sub> = 8.03, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01) all were significantly more positive after exposure to the self-expressive benefit than to the nature-related benefit. These results support hypothesis 2, demonstrating a significant main effect of emotional benefits on consumers’ responses.</p>

<p>I found it interesting that the interaction between environmental claims and emotional benefits was statistically significant for all three measures (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .01, see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1938965511433293">Exhibit 3</xref>). These results indicate that the type of environmental claim in the advertising affects the influence on consumers’ response to a nature-related benefit as compared to a self-expressive benefit. This finding is similar to a study completed by CMI in December 2009, showing that effective messaging links specific data-driven claims with the appropriate emotional benefits to create a more powerful statement for a brand. In addition, these types of messages allow for better targeting of customer segments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1938965511433293">Mabey 2010</xref>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1938965511433293">Exhibit 4</xref> presents the mean level of response for the four cells in the experimental design. The results indicate that the most persuasive advertisement coupled a substantive claim with a self-expressive benefit. The substantive claim relating to how an organization’s products affect the natural environment is intended to indicate the organization’s willingness to behave in an environmentally appropriate fashion. Along the same line, organizations using this approach can, through their advertisements, provide consumers with information that would enable them also to behave in an environmentally responsible fashion. By appealing to consumers’ self-expressive benefits in this way, the advertising also amplifies the organization’s message of environmental stewardship.</p>

<p>Conversely, when the associative claim was presented, reactions were most positive after exposure to the nature-related benefit (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1938965511433293">Exhibit 5</xref>). The associative claim, with its simple presentation of facts, is less tangible in its approach, but by invoking nature-related benefits, the advertisement that combines both the associative claim and the nature-related benefit might appeal to customers who love nature. It therefore may generate positive reactions toward the hotel advertisement.</p>

<title>Involvement</title>
<p>To examine the moderating effect of involvement, the results of multivariate analysis indicated significant main effects for environmental claims (Wilks’s λ: <italic>F</italic> = 2.71, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05), emotional benefits (Wilks’s λ: <italic>F</italic> = 3.08, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05), and involvement (Wilks’ λ: <italic>F</italic> = 19.34, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01). The MANOVA results also revealed that there exists a significant interaction effect for environment claims and involvement (Wilks’s λ: <italic>F</italic> = 3.68, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05), but not for emotional benefits and involvement, or for environment claims, emotional benefits, and involvement (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1938965511433293">Exhibit 6</xref>). I then conducted separate analyses to examine the effects of environmental claims and emotional benefits for high- and low-involvement subjects (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-1938965511433293">Exhibit 7</xref>). As indicated in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-1938965511433293">Exhibit 8</xref>, multivariate analysis yielded a main effect for environmental claims (<italic>F</italic><sub>1, 182</sub> = 2.98, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01) and a significant interaction effect (<italic>F</italic><sub>1, 182</sub> = 17.65, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01) for the high-involvement condition. For the low-involvement condition, results indicated a significant interaction effect (<italic>F</italic><sub>1, 110</sub> = 9.69, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01); however, no significant main effects on any dependent measures were supported.</p>

Again, attitude toward advertisement, brand attitude, and purchase intention all were higher for the substantive claim than for the associative claim (3.76 vs. 3.47, 4.02 vs. 3.78, 4.06 vs. 3.98). On the other hand, the main effect of emotional benefits was statistically significant only on purchase intention (<italic>F</italic><sub>1, 182</sub> = 4.46, <italic>p</italic> &gt; .05) but not on the attitude toward the advertisement (<italic>F</italic><sub>1, 182</sub> = 2.03, <italic>p</italic> &gt; .05) or brand attitude (<italic>F</italic><sub>1, 182</sub> = 2.27, <italic>p</italic> &gt; .05). These results suggest that information regarding environmental claims could reinforce advertisement attitude and brand attitude for customers with high involvement.</p>
<p>The analysis showed a significant interaction effect between environmental claims and emotional benefits on the attitude toward advertisement (<italic>F</italic><sub>1, 182</sub> = 46.10, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05), brand attitude (<italic>F</italic><sub>1, 182</sub> = 14.68, <italic>p</italic> &lt;.05), and purchase intention (<italic>F</italic><sub>1, 182</sub> = 13.94, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05). The attitudes regarding advertisement, brand attitude, and purchase intention were significantly different between environmental claims and emotional benefits. In this regard, making a substantive claim in conjunction with a self-expressive benefit would be better than asserting a nature-related benefit in that context. At the same time, making an associative claim with a nature-related benefit would be better than proposing a self-expressive benefit in that connection.</p>
<p>The results for low-involvement respondents show that the main effect of environmental claims was not statistically significant for any of the three dependent variables (all <italic>F</italic> values <italic>p</italic> &gt; .05), nor was there a significant effect of emotional benefits for any of those variables (all <italic>F</italic> values <italic>p</italic> &gt; .05). Overall, though, there was a significant interaction effect between environmental claims and emotional benefits on the attitude toward advertisement (<italic>F</italic><sub>1, 182</sub> = 29.13, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01), brand attitude (<italic>F</italic><sub>1, 182</sub> = 16.48, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01), and purchase intention (<italic>F</italic><sub>1, 182</sub> = 6.91, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01). Respondents’ attitudes toward the advertisement and the brand, as well as their purchase intention, were significantly different depending on the types of environmental claims and emotional benefits.</p>

<title>Conclusions and Implications</title>
<p>This article provides empirical direction for hotel marketers contemplating the development and presentation of environmental advertising to improve their environmental brand image and increase consumer purchase intent. The results of this study support the notion that it is indeed possible to enhance the communication effectiveness of an advertisement, by creating an appropriate message context. These findings indicate that substantive claims that provide detailed and concrete information about the hotel’s contribution to environmental protection will elicit more positive responses from consumers than will their associative counterparts. Undoubtedly, this finding provides useful insights for hotel marketers that a substantive environmental claim would be a wise choice when promoting green hotel services. Moreover, this study shows the significant and pronounced positive influences of the self-expressive benefit on consumers’ responses to hotel advertising. Consumption experiences analogous to emotions experienced in nature along with advertisements that include the images of a group of people may satisfy the hypothetical generalized human need or desire for customers to communicate their self-images. Consequently, green hotel consumption may be stimulated by adding emotional experiences of the “self-expressive” kind to increase the benefit perception of hotel services.</p>
<p>Finally, this study’s main contribution is to show how a hotel’s environmental claims interact with the emotional benefit communicated in the advertising. The advertisement with substantive claims was more persuasive when it was coupled with self-expressive benefits, rather than nature-related benefits. Conversely, when associative claims are presented, reactions are most positive after exposure to the nature-related benefit. In addition, there is evidence to suggest that substantial differences in responses to green advertisements by consumers with high and low environmental involvement. The highly involved customers appear to have stronger responses for the hotel advertising with substantive claims rather than associative claims. However, the low-involved consumers did not find hotel advertising with environmental claims and emotional benefits convincing enough. The challenge for hotel marketers is to determine consumers’ environmental involvement and to position advertising strategies differently for the two groups. If highly involved consumers represent a potential future market for green hotel brands, then marketing strategies should be aimed at creating more detailed and concrete information about how the hotel contributes to environmental protection to change the attitudes of these highly involved consumers.</p>
<p>As the hotel industry seeks to share its support of environmental issues, the intangibility of hotel services was regarded as the principal source of challenge for effective ecological advertising messages. This study indicates that the real challenge is one of choosing a message strategy based on the interaction of message and affect. The results here indicate that the most effective strategy would be environmental advertising centered on the creation of emotional benefits that are sustained by environmental claims.</p>
<p>Having said that, this study has a number of limitations. First, I examine only the effects of environmental claims and emotional benefits in this study. Future studies may investigate how other factors affect consumers’ responses to environmental advertising. Second, this study is essentially of an exploratory nature and focused only on hotels. The findings may need to be confirmed for other hospitality and service industry segments such as restaurants. Third, the present study was conducted in Taiwan and some of the results could be unique to that nation. Future research should be conducted from other countries, given the potential differences in values and cultures from one nation to the next.</p>

<title>Marriott—Greening Our Supply Chain</title>
<p>Each year, Marriott International and its owners spend about $10 billion annually buying products and services for its more than 3,300 hotels around the world. Recognizing this purchasing power, we’ve teamed up with our vendors to introduce these “greener” solutions at no extra cost:</p>
<p><italic>Greener key cards</italic>: Marriott has “unlocked” the door to a greener hotel stay by purchasing twenty-four million key cards made of 50 percent recycled material, saving 66 tons of plastic from being dumped in the landfill.</p>
<p><italic>Eco-pillows</italic>: Guests can sleep easy knowing that their pillows are “fighting” to save the planet. Marriott will begin replacing the 100,000 synthetic pillows that it purchases with those filled with material made from recycled bottles.</p>
<p><italic>Earth-friendly towels</italic>: Thanks to a unique manufacturing process, the one million towels Marriott purchases in North America don’t need to be prewashed, saving six million gallons of water.</p>
<p><italic>Recycled pens</italic>: The forty-seven million pens that Marriott purchases for its guests and meeting rooms in the United States and Canada are made of 75 percent recycled material.</p>
<p><italic>Low-VOC paint</italic>: Marriott buys nearly one million gallons of paint that are low in volatile organic compounds (VOCs), which are safer and less polluting.</p>
<p><italic>Biodegradable laundry bags</italic>: In the Middle East and Europe, more than hundred hotels purchase 43 tons of biodegradable plastic bags that disintegrate in two to five years, if not recycled and reused first.</p> <p><italic>Laundry detergent</italic>: At our hotels in Central Europe, we use a laundry detergent that cuts the amount of phosphates released into wastewater by approximately 100,000 kg (220,000 lbs).</p>
