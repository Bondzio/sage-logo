<p>The recent global recession has provided a ripe opportunity for social scientists and policy analysts to take stock of what happened, who was most damaged, who needs the most help right now, and what can be done to prevent further long-term economic damage to American working families. This edited volume by Robert Plotnick, Marcia Meyers, Jennifer Romich, and Steven Smith provides a strong analysis and roadmap for moving ahead that highlights many of the long-term vulnerabilities faced by the “99 percenters” (as the Occupy Wall Street Movement calls them) and (more directly) the “60 percenters,” those hovering around the median of the family income distribution (currently around $62,000), and those below them.</p>
<p>The authors of the chapters in this volume were assembled in 2008 for a conference at the West Coast Poverty Center at the University of Washington. All of them were charged with examining the changing economic and social realities confronting working families since the passage of the Social Security Act in 1935. All of the authors were committed to the idea that the world the Social Security Act was meant for (single-earner households with male breadwinners in steady jobs with rising wages, women providing unpaid care work in households full of children, and a small elderly population in dire economic circumstances) is not the world confronting working families now, and that social insurance and safety net policies have not kept up with these new realities and are totally unprepared to deal with them. But claiming that our current system does not work is not the same as saying there is a ready and easy solution to the fragmented, post-modern world policymakers face. The authors in this volume all commit themselves to answering the question, “What’s next?”</p>
<p>There are eight chapters overall in this volume, with Chapters One and Two (by the editors and Jacob Hacker) serving as a concise and hard-hitting overview outlining the world the Social Security Act was supposed to deal with, and the brave new post-1980 world the SSA and other social insurance programs are dealing with now. The linchpins that held the old system together were good, steady jobs with health insurance coverage paid for by employers, one-earner households with unpaid domestic labor provided by women, wages and earnings that rose with productivity, and (a relatively short) retirement paid for with private pensions and social security benefits accrued over a lifetime. Once these pillars of the old system started to erode, the entire social safety net was in trouble, and the 2008—2009 recession simply exposed the raw underbelly of vulnerability that debt-laden consumption and rising housing values was covering up.</p>
<p>The remaining chapters discuss alternative social policies for dealing with all this insecurity, focusing on different parts of the income distribution and different parts of the social policy/social service system. The policy proposals are innovatively and imaginatively discussed and include:</p>

<p>I have four relatively minor quibbles with what is otherwise an engaging exercise. First, the authors can not decide if they are trying to help the middle class or the poor (working or not). This is a bit troublesome policy-wise because there would be widespread support for policies to help working families viewed as “middle class” and quite a bit less for those helping the “working poor,” especially in an economic climate that is harming the conventional middle class. Second, the authors implicitly assume that the industrial-era social policy regarding the working poor was supposed to “work” at some level. As Piven and Cloward and others have suggested, this is a dubious assumption. For many politicians and other policy makers social welfare policy is not supposed to “work”—it is supposed to humiliate, shame and confuse—that is the intended outcome. Third, with the exception of better enforcement of existing labor laws, the authors do not really provide a set of remedies for the hundreds of thousands of dead-end lousy jobs at lousy wages our economy seems to create with total impunity. Low-wage work exists in the United States because (a) it is permitted, and (b) it is encouraged. Attempts to increase the skill levels of job seekers will only, at best, create a more highly skilled army of working poor. Finally, the authors do not pay very much attention to the role that race and culture play in the decline of the social safety net and the policy paralysis that exists with regard to replacing it. The working poor are not simply viewed as “people like us who are down on their luck…,” they are viewed as “other,” racially and culturally inferior to white middle-class America. Policies that appear to benefit non-majority groups have an uphill battle to gain traction in these nativist times, and the ability of at least one of our political parties to paint a new social safety net as demographically “un-American” will be a major political challenge.</p>
<p>If the reader keeps these caveats in mind, they will find an impressive display of imaginative policy analysis that is practical, fact-based, value-laden, and thoughtful. This book is a must-read for sociologists interested in the evolution of new social policies and interested publics who are concerned that too many Americans are facing economic and social catastrophe.</p>
