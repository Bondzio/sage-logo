<abstract>
<p>This article reports 10 findings from five experiments, with 124 participants and 96 environments, on how atmospheric permeability mediates perceived enclosure. Enclosure is important because it influences safety, and safety may be dependent on atmospheric permeability. Atmospheric permeability was expressed as clear air or fog. Overall, fog made places seem more open. Numerical guidance is provided to assist future work in this line of inquiry.</p>

<p>The primary question addressed in this article is “How does atmospheric permeability influence perceived enclosure?” The motivation for investigating this question is theoretical. The theory in question is permeability theory, which, in a nutshell, proposes that</p>

<list-item><p>Therefore, data regarding how environments can mitigate either sensing through or moving through those environments is needed.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>A substantial database on permeability theory has been previously reported. The database currently includes 348 studies from other researchers and 57 original experiments, 1,397 participants, 17,750 stimuli, and 92 properties of the physical environment that have been demonstrated to influence responses of safety, enclosure, spaciousness, or pleasure. There are seven series of data in permeability theory. The first series is called “Conspecifics” because it deals with relationships between animals (in this case, people) of the same species. Key sources included <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0013916510393277">Hall (1966)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0013916510393277">Goffman (1971)</xref>. So far, the data from this series contain eight studies on how threat is conveyed by nonverbal cues such as eye contact, facial expression, sex, and posture over distances ranging from 1 m to 90 m (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0013916510393277">Stamps, 2011</xref>). The next series “Prospect and Refuge” was motivated by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0013916510393277">Appleton’s <italic>Experience of Landscape</italic> (1975)</xref> and consisted of eight more studies on environmental properties such as distance in view; presence of a permeable boundary in front of the observer; direction of light; special transitions such as low or high, light or dark, or large or small; and venue (natural or built). The latest article in this series, which references the previous work, is given in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0013916510393277">Stamps (2008)</xref>. The third series (“Information Theory”) was based on the seminal work done by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0013916510393277">Berlyne (1960)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0013916510393277">Kaplan and Kaplan (1989)</xref>. Responses studied include complexity, mystery, uncertainty, preference, and exploration; environmental factors studied include number of vertexes in silhouettes, amount of detail, light, occlusion, and a mathematical model of uncertainty called “entropy.” The latest article in that series is by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0013916510393277">Stamps (2010b</xref>). The fourth research series (“Enclosure, Spaciousness, and Permeability”) currently includes 27 experiments on responses such as safety, enclosure, and spaciousness and environmental properties such as boundary properties (permeability with respect to locomotion or vision, height, depth, and location with respect to observer [above or below, front or back, and sides]), properties within boundaries (area, concavity, and elongation), and other variables such as light, color, and material (natural or built). The latest summary of this series is given in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0013916510393277">Stamps (2011)</xref>.</p>
<p>The relationship of this article to the theory is that the present work fills a major data gap. An environment can facilitate or hinder either locomotive or visual permeability, resulting in four classifications: (a) neither type of permeability is possible, (b) both types of permeability are possible, (c) visual permeability is possible but not locomotive permeability, and (d) locomotive permeability is possible but not visual permeability. The theory most relevant to this condition is Gibson’s <italic>Ecological Psychology</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0013916510393277">Gibson, 1979</xref>). In the ecological theory of visual perception, three major categories are used to describe environments: (a) substances, (b) surfaces, and (c) medium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0013916510393277">Gibson, 1979</xref>). A substance is a portion of an environment that blocks both locomotion and vision. Neither body nor perception can pass through a typical substance. The second category is a surface, which is the separation between a medium and a substance. One example would be the ground. Ground is a very important surface for humans and other animals that move about on foot because a ground affords locomotion. A medium is something through which a solid body can move, so it affords locomotion. A medium may or may not afford visual permeability, depending on translucency. Thus, these key components of permeability theory can also be expressed under the concepts of <italic>Ecological Psychology</italic>. In addition, if the translucency of air can be manipulated, then possible effects of medium can be investigated. As the quintessential example of impaired visual permeability is fog, and as local conditions afford ample samples of same, this article focuses on how fog changes perceived enclosure.</p>

<title>Selection of Variables</title>
<sec id="section2-0013916510393277">
<title>Dependent variable</title>
<p>The dependent variable was perceived <italic>enclosure</italic>. Perceived enclosure is a function of how easily one thinks that one could see or move through a boundary. Enclosure is often confounded with spaciousness, but they appear to be different concepts. In this article, spaciousness is taken to be the range of movement within a boundary. Thus, a large room with solid walls such as a gymnasium would be spacious but enclosed, whereas a small conservatory, with walls and ceilings made of glass, would be open but not spacious. This article focuses on enclosure.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0013916510393277">
<title>Independent variables</title>
<p>The primary independent variable is fog. To find out whether the effects of fog generalize over different conditions, five experiments were done in different venues (both natural and built) and with different secondary variables.</p>

<title>Summary of Introduction</title>
<p>This introduction suggests the following points: (a) safety is important, (b) safety is conditioned by visual and locomotive permeability, (c) locomotive permeability is limited by enclosure, (d) there is substantial data already in the record for environmental properties that change perceived enclosure but little or no data on how clarity of the atmosphere changes perceived enclosure, and (e) the present work fills that gap.</p>

<title>Experiment 1 (Lake Merced)</title>
<p>This experiment addressed the effect of atmospheric permeability on perceived enclosure in landscapes. The factor of atmospheric permeability was expressed by the levels of clear air and fog. The title of the experiment was taken from the lake around which the photographs were taken.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<sec id="section7-0013916510393277">
<title>General protocols</title>
<p>The general methodological protocols used in this work are based on extensive previous data (277 experiments; 41,000 participants; and 12,000 stimuli; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0013916510393277">Stamps, 2000</xref>). It is asserted that the following claims have been established beyond impeachment by empirical data: (a) Estimates of affective responses obtained on site correlate highly with affective responses obtained from static color images, (b) different scaling models produce virtually identical results, and (c) results are highly reproducible over presentation orders, researchers, and venues. By 2000, static color simulations had been shown to represent actual environments better than did 16 other media, but there was no data on the efficacy of dynamic media. Over the past decade, additional relevant data have become available. The latest review, reported in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0013916510393277">Stamps (2010c</xref>) and covering 84 articles, 6,323 participants, and 967 scenes, found that the current collective correlation between responses obtained from static color images and actual environments is <italic>r</italic> = .86 (.05 CI (Confidence Interval) = [.82, .89]), the correlation between dynamic simulations and actual environments is <italic>r</italic> = .83 (.05 ci = [.79, .87]), and the correlation between static color and dynamic simulations is <italic>r</italic> = .82 (.05 ci = [.76, .86]). In plain English, it appears that for investigating effects of static stimuli (such as buildings or landscapes), static and dynamic simulations generate findings that are statistically indistinguishable and so choice of simulation medium becomes a question of cost rather than validity.</p>

<title>Experimental design and stimuli</title>
<p>The experimental design was a repeated-measures design with one within-participant factor of fog. The stimuli were photographs of a local park. Three protocols were used to control for possible selection effects. First, the locations at which the photographs were taken were selected by measuring the total length of a trail through the park and then setting the locations at uniform intervals along that trail. Second, the azimuth at which the photograph was taken was obtained by a random number between 1 and 360. Third, if it happened that, in the field, the sun were in the picture, the angle was reversed by adding 180 mod 360 to the original angle. Thus, the actual field conditions had no influence on either location or angle of view of the photograph. A total of 10 locations were photographed on sunny days. The global positioning system (GPS) coordinates of each location were also recorded. Subsequently, when the local weather predictions said there would be a dense fog, the GPS coordinates and angle of view were used to replicate the photographs in the foggy condition. There were 10 locations for each level of atmospheric permeability, for a total of 20 stimuli. Black and white copies of four images are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0013916510393277">Figure 1</xref>.</p>

<title>Sample size and participants</title>
<p>We anticipated a small effect for fog. Accordingly, the target effect size was set to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0013916510393277">Cohen’s (1988)</xref> value for a small effect size (2% of variance). For an overall α = .05, β = .20, <italic>dfh</italic> = 1, and a repeated-measures experimental design with 20 stimuli, at least 22 participants were required. A total of 24 participants were recruited by a professional survey research firm from the adult population of a major city in the United States. The participant sample was balanced for sex and political affiliation, with 12 males, 12 females, and 6 each of liberal, moderate, or conservative political affiliation. Political affiliation was controlled because (a) a literature review of 19,000 participants from 21 countries on demographic effects in environmental preference generated a finding that responses from special interest groups belonging to liberal or conservative organizations differed from responses from the general public (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0013916510393277">Stamps, 1999</xref>) and (b) a study of local preferences for residential designs indicated a very strong demographic effect that also split on the political spectrum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0013916510393277">Stamps, 1991</xref>). In view of these findings, it seemed prudent to control for political affiliation. Ages ranged from 22 to 72 years with a mean of 45.1 years and a standard deviation of 13.5 years. Occupations ranged from ballet instructor to technology analyst.</p>

<title>Procedure</title>
<p>Images were shown on a laptop computer using a custom computer program. The screen measured 337 mm by 208 mm. Luminosity was 150 lux. Participants sat approximately 400 mm from the screen in a room with an ambient light level of 150 lux. The computer program had two parts. The first part was a demonstration that showed the participants how to use the controls. After completing the demonstration, participants viewed the main part. In this part, the first screen stated what judgment was requested (“Please rate the following pictures on the criterion of how open [1] or enclosed [8] they appear”), along with two images showing the extreme conditions in the experimental design. Then each stimulus was shown with a row of buttons on the bottom. The buttons were numbered from 1 to 8. When a button was pressed, an “OK” button appeared. When the “OK” button was pressed, the next stimulus was shown. Participants could change their minds and press other numbered buttons until they pressed the “OK” button. Participants were allowed to take as much time as they needed.</p>

<title>Results and Discussion</title>
<p>General summaries of the data were done with repeated-measures analyses of variance. In this experiment, the sources of variance, their Sum of Squares (SSs), and their <italic>df</italic>s were as follows: between participants SS = 348.89 on <italic>df</italic> = 23; subtotal for within participants was 1,495.00 on <italic>df</italic> = 456; subtotal for stimuli was 201.61 on <italic>df</italic> = 19; for fog, 10.21 on <italic>df</italic> = 1; residual within stimuli, 191.41 on <italic>df</italic> = 18; Residual within participants × Stimuli, 1,283.38 on <italic>df</italic> = 437; pooled residual, 1,474.79 on <italic>df</italic> = 455; and total, 1,833.96 on <italic>df</italic> = 479.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0013916510393277">3</xref></sup> Bottom line: fog accounted for 1% of the variance for perceived enclosure, <italic>F</italic>(1, 455) = 3.15, <italic>p</italic> &gt; .05. The correlation between perceived enclosure and the presence of fog was (F01) <italic>r</italic> = −.25 on <italic>n</italic> = 20 stimuli. Foggy scenes were perceived as being more open than the scenes with clear light (<italic>M</italic> = 4.12 and 4.41, respectively). For readers who wish to convert the means into standardized mean differences (<italic>d</italic>), the estimate of population standard deviation, based on the variance of the stimulus means, was σ = .648. The lack of significance in the ANOVA occurred because, despite the sizing of the experiment to detect a small effect (2% of variance), the actual effect was even smaller. The implication is that more data would be needed. Hence, Experiment 2 was conducted.</p>

<title>Experiment 2 (Tower)</title>
<p>In this experiment, we obtained more data regarding the effect of fog on impressions of environmental enclosure and also expanded the range of venues to include built environments. The factor of interest was still visual permeability (levels of clear air and fog), but the scenes were of residential streets rather than paths in a park. The name of this experiment came from the iconic market (Tower Market) that has symbolized the neighborhood since 1942 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0013916510393277">Proctor, 2006</xref>).</p>

<title>Experimental design and stimuli</title>
<p>The experimental design was a one-factor, repeated-measures design with one within-participant factor of fog. The stimuli were photographs of street scenes from a local residential neighborhood. Several protocols were used to control for possible selection effects. In the laboratory, the locations at which the photographs were taken were selected by obtaining <italic>x</italic> and <italic>y</italic> coordinates using random numbers, selecting, on a map, the street nearest to the random coordinate and using random numbers to select angles of view. In the field, the angle of view was reversed if the sun were in the image, and the image was taken across the street. A total of 10 locations were photographed on sunny days. The GPS coordinates of each location were also recorded. Subsequently, when the local weather predictions said there would be dense fog, the GPS coordinates and angle of view were used to replicate the photographs in the foggy condition. There were 10 locations for each level of the medium factor, for a total of 20 stimuli.

<title>Sample size and participants</title>
<p>An initial estimate of the required sample size, based on the previous finding of η<sup>2</sup> = .01, indicated that, for a single experiment with 20 stimuli, the minimum number of participants would be 40. Participants were undergraduate engineering students at local university. There were 39 participants, of whom 29 were male. The mean and standard deviation of the participants’ ages were 21.0 and 3.9 years, respectively.</p>

<p>Stimuli were presented in a Power Point presentation during a class. Informed consent was obtained and two unscaled images were shown to assist participants in calibrating their judgments.

<title>Results and Discussion</title>
<p>Data for the repeated-measures analysis of variance were as follows: between participants SS = 619.98 on <italic>df</italic> = 38; within participants, 3,042.65 on <italic>df</italic> = 741; subtotal for stimuli, 113.96 on <italic>df</italic> = 19; for fog, 12.56 on <italic>df</italic> = 1; residual within stimuli, 101.40 on <italic>df</italic> = (18); Residual within participants × Stimulus, 2,928.69 on <italic>df</italic> = 722; pooled residual, 3,030.09 on <italic>df</italic> = 740; and total, 3,662.63 on <italic>df</italic> = 779. Main finding: fog accounted for less than 0.0% of the variance for perceived enclosure, <italic>F</italic>(1, 740) = 3.07, <italic>p</italic> &gt; .05. The correlation between perceived enclosure and the presence of fog was (F02) <italic>r</italic> = −.33 on <italic>n</italic> = 20 stimuli. Foggy scenes were perceived as being slightly more open than the scenes with clear light (Mean Square (MS) of 4.32 for fog and 4.57 for clear air). For readers who wish to convert the means into standardized mean differences (<italic>d</italic>), the estimate of population standard deviation, based on the variance of the stimulus means, was σ = .382. When findings F01 and F02 are combined, the resulting collective correlation is <italic>r</italic> = −.27 on <italic>n</italic> = 40 and with a collective .05 ci of [−.51, −.001]. Because this ci does not include 0.0, the relationship of fog to perceived enclosure has now met the <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05 criterion.</p>

<title>Experiment 3 (Monet in Venice)</title>
<p>The next experiment was designed to ascertain whether the fog effect could be replicated in environments in which the factor of locomotive permeability was added to the factor of visual permeability. Locomotive permeability was expressed as horizontal support (ground, yes; water, no). Visual permeability was again expressed by fog. The title of this article came from one scene in which warmly colored Italian houses and deep blues of water and sky that were reflected in the water produced a dazzling spectrum of colors that conveyed an impression of Monet’s little known visit to Venice.</p>

<p>Because the effect of fog in Experiments 1 and 2 was small, the target effect size for fog was set to the de minimis value of 2% of variance.

This time, fog accounted for 7.0% of the variance for perceived enclosure, <italic>F</italic>(1, 250) = 28.46, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001. Horizontal support accounted for 3%, <italic>F</italic>(1, 250) = 11.60, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001. Style accounted for the most variance (19%), <italic>F</italic>(3, 250) = 90.19, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001. In terms of correlations, the relevant findings were (F03) fog: <italic>r</italic> = −.39 and (F04) support: <italic>r</italic> = −.25. In terms of means, foggy scenes were perceived as being more open that the scenes with clear air (MS of 3.96 vs. 4.48). Scenes with solid ground were perceived as being more open than scenes with water (MS of 3.84 vs. 4.60). The estimate of population standard deviation, based on the variance of stimulus means, was σ = 1.54. Thus, this experiment replicated the findings for fog in a different venue, with a different participant sample, and in a different medium.</p>

<title>Experiment 4 (Dock of the Bay)</title>
<p>In this experiment, the factors of fog and horizontal support were augmented with the factor of light. Light was chosen because previous research indicates that it influences perception of enclosure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0013916510393277">Stamps, 2010a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0013916510393277">Stamps &amp; Smith, 2002</xref>). The title came from all those hours we spent in an architectural office in San Francisco’s Ferry Building, where the favorite activity was looking out the window, whiling the time away.</p>
<sec id="section25-0013916510393277">
<title>Experimental design and stimuli</title>
<p>In the previous experiment, the factor of familiar architectural style was important. To control the effects due to familiarity, we created random environments. There are many ways to do this. The method used in this article was to create scenes with randomized colonnades. Parameters that were randomized for each colonnade were length, angle, location, diameter of poles, height, number of columns, and color. Sites measured 64 m × 64 m. The observer location was set to the middle of the site. The factor of horizontal support was expressed by using either turf or water under the observer. Light was expressed as midday or dusk, and with or without fog. Factors were horizontal support (2), amount of light (2), presence of fog (2), and within cell (2). There were 16 stimuli. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0013916510393277">Figure 4</xref> shows black and white versions of eight stimuli.</p>

The population standard deviation, based on the variance of the stimulus means, was σ = 1.10. Inspection of the means clearly shows that fog made the spaces appear to be more open, whereas solid support and amount of light made the spaces appear more enclosed (MS of 3.36 for fog vs. 4.05 for clear air, 4.00 for ground vs. 3.36 for water, and 3.47 for dusk vs. 3.90 for midday).</p>

<title>Experiment 5 (Foggy Adobe)</title>
<p>In this last experiment, the factor of atmospheric permeability was refined by creating fogs of different densities. Also, two other factors were added: (a) width of street and (b) depth of recesses in building facades. These factors were included for reasons given in the introduction as follows: the most important function an environment can provide is safety, and safety depends on range of perception or locomotion. Street width limits lateral locomotion, whereas depths of recesses create hiding places that inhibit visibility of possible danger. The name of this experiment came from an excursion to Santa Fe made during recess from a meeting of the Environmental Design Research Association in Albuquerque a few years ago.</p>
<sec id="section30-0013916510393277">
<title>Method</title>
<sec id="section31-0013916510393277">
<title>Experimental design and stimuli</title>
<p>The venue for this experiment consisted of views of a pedestrian street. The primary factor in this experiment was visual permeability that was expressed with the levels of clear air, light fog, and thick fog. To create the fog, it was necessary to specify fog density. This was done in terms of the coefficient of extinction, which is the amount of light that is absorbed per unit of distance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0013916510393277">Kaufman &amp; Christensen, 1984</xref>). Values for none, light, and thick fog were 0.000, 0.003, and 0.015, respectively, for amount of light lost per meter. The values for light and thick fog can also be expressed in terms of the maximum distance at which a large black object can be seen against a clear sky. For light fog, this is about 1,000 m; for thick fog, it is about 200 m. Levels for street width were 3, 6, 9, and 12 m. Levels of facade recess were 0.3 and 2.0 m. The experimental design was, accordingly, fog (3) by street width (4) by facade recess (2), for a total of 24 stimuli. Black and white versions of eight stimuli are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0013916510393277">Figure 5</xref>.</p>

<title>Results and Discussion</title>
<p>The repeated-measures analysis of variance is given in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0013916510393277">Table 3</xref>. Fog was a no-show (0.0% of variance), <italic>F</italic>(1, 388) = 0.49, <italic>p</italic> &gt; .05. What really made the difference in perceived enclosure was street width (28.8%), <italic>F</italic>(1, 388) = 196.64, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001. Facade recess also had a detectable effect on perceived enclosure (2.6% of variance), <italic>F</italic>(1, 388) = 18.23, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001. The correlations with perceived enclosure, calculated over <italic>n</italic> = 24 stimuli, were (F08) fog: <italic>r</italic> = −.04, (F09) street width: <italic>r</italic> = −.90, and (F10) facade recess: <italic>r</italic> = −.27. Perceived enclosure was most strongly influenced by street width and depth of facade recesses (MS of 2.76 for width = 3 m vs. 5.82 for width = 12 m and 4.39 for recess = 2.0 m vs. 4.39 for recess = 0.3 m). The effects of the solid surfaces on perceived enclosure were far greater than the effects attributable to atmospheric permeability (0.415 for thick fog and 4.18 for light fog). The estimate of population standard deviation for differences between means, based on the variance of stimulus means, was σ = 1.21.</p>

<p>Results for the secondary factors varied. The factor with the strongest effect on perceived enclosure was street width. The effect was <italic>r</italic> = −.90, indicating that wider streets were perceived as being more open. This is, of course, in keeping with permeability theory because wider streets imply greater freedom of lateral locomotion, and as freedom of locomotion is hypothesized to indicate safety, wider streets should be perceived as being safer. There was not sufficient data for the other factors to make any claims based on the data given in this article. The question of whether these claims can be established when combined with data from other articles will have to be postponed until a comprehensive meta-analytic literature review can be done.</p>

<title>Relationships to Theory</title>
<p>The relationships to theory are fairly simple. Before the current experiments were done, the empirical database for permeability theory covered 405 studies and 92 environmental properties. The work in this article adds five more studies and one new environmental property (atmospheric permeability) to the database. In general terms, the findings support Gibson’s hypotheses that substances and surfaces influence perceived enclosure more than atmospheric permeability does.</p>

<title>Summary and Conclusions</title>
<p>Environmental enclosure is important because it influences safety. Perceived enclosure depends on locomotive and visual permeability. There are many studies on how both types of permeability influence enclosure, but there appeared to be no previous data on the condition where locomotive permeability is possible but visual permeability is compromised. This article reports five relevant experiments. Visual permeability was expressed by fog. The main finding was that fog makes spaces appear to be more open. Guidance is provided to assist future work.</p>

<p>This theory is concerned only with the effects due to some properties of the physical environment that limit either perception or locomotion. It does not claim to encompass all sources of potential danger, such as the possibility that there might be a vehicle on a road.</p>

<p>The reason for reporting this rather convoluted description of the ANOVA is that there are several different choices regarding how to analyze the data. The numbers given in this article permit readers to reanalyze the data using the assumptions of their choice.</p>
