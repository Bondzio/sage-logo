<abstract>
<p>This article uses crash data, highway classification, and traffic statistics to estimate the crash cost per truck vehicle mile traveled (VMT) from 2002 to 2006 for trucks that diverted from the Ohio Turnpike to avoid paying higher toll rates imposed by the Ohio Turnpike Authority. The data show that the truck crash cost per VMT is lowest for rural interstates such as the Turnpike and highest for the roads to which truck traffic diverted. Using the elasticity of demand for truck use of toll roads, we then estimate that the crash cost of trucks diverted from the Ohio Turnpike to other roads during 2004 at more than US$38 million, which far exceeds the revenue benefit. The article discusses implications of these results for road infrastructure pricing.</p>

<p>Recent deals to privatize highways have brought increased tolls for users (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1087724X12461143">Baxandall, Wohlschlegel, &amp; Dutzik, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1087724X12461143">Enright, 2006</xref>). Higher tolls can cause diversion of trucks to other roads (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1087724X12461143">Bryan et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1087724X12461143">Gronau, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1087724X12461143">Swan &amp; Belzer, 2010</xref>). This diversion of trucks from Interstate highways to nonlimited access roads is linked to a greater risk of crashes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1087724X12461143">Proctor &amp; Morckel, 2004</xref>), in part because the roadways to which trucks divert have characteristics associated with higher crash probability, frequency, and severity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1087724X12461143">Caliendo, Guida, &amp; Parisi, 2007</xref>). It would be useful for policy makers who are considering deals to privatize or otherwise raise tolls on rural Interstates to know whether benefits from such diversions exceed the costs. If the cost associated with the increased crashes exceeds the benefits associated with increase tolls levied either by quasi-public toll authorities or private roadway lessees, then benefit–cost analysis should lead policy makers to reject this approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1087724X12461143">Adler &amp; Posner, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1087724X12461143">Committee for Study of Public Policy for Surface Freight Transportation, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1087724X12461143">Gramlich, 1997</xref>). No systematic study of the expected (or actual) cost associated with toll road diversion has been undertaken to date. Although several costs are associated with diversion of traffic from toll roads, public safety, and the cost of vehicle crashes is a major public policy concern. If crashes are responsible for a significant portion of the costs associated with diversion, policy makers need to know whether policies designed to raise revenue for highways actually create substantial costs that might offset the revenue raised. This article is an attempt to estimate these crash costs using historical data.</p>
<sec id="section1-1087724X12461143">
<title>Literature Review</title>
<p>Determining the possible safety effects of toll road diversions requires four calculations. First, researchers must determine the amount of truck traffic prior to diversion for the road in question at the level of toll charged. Second, diversion can be estimated by demand modeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1087724X12461143">Bryan et al., 2004</xref>), empirical analysis of historical data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1087724X12461143">Swan &amp; Belzer, 2010</xref>), or survey (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1087724X12461143">Adelakun &amp; Cherry, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1087724X12461143">Short, 2007</xref>). Third, researchers must estimate crashes associated with diverted trucks based on actual crash rates or road types for diversion roads. Finally, an estimate of crash cost must be applied to the increased number of crashes to develop a crash cost related to diversions.</p>
<p>With regard to diversion, the lack of data makes diversion estimates particularly difficult. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1087724X12461143">Bryan et al. (2004)</xref> estimated diversions from Interstate 81 based on different levels of toll and found that while diversion was lumpy due to heterogeneity among truckers, diversions continued to increase with rising toll levels until all trucks diverted. As long as the incremental cost to the highway operator for carrying a truck is zero, a profit-maximizing toll operator would increase rates for trucks until the elasticity of demand was equal to one (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1087724X12461143">Gronau, 1999</xref>, further increase lowers revenue). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1087724X12461143">Swan and Belzer (2010)</xref> demonstrated that actual toll rates for a profit maximizing toll road operator likely would be higher because trucks generate significant marginal cost and maximum profit would come where marginal revenue equals marginal cost.</p>
<p>Third, the effect of road choice on safety must be estimated. The effect of road type on truck crashes is well known and relatively well researched. In one of the first and most detailed studies of truck crashes, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1087724X12461143">Blower, Lyles, Campbell, &amp; Stamatiadis (1990)</xref> found that the crash rate for trucks on limited-access highways was roughly one-half that for major arterials (U.S. routes and State routes) without limited access. The crash rate for all other nonlimited-access roads was five to six times that for limited access highways.</p>
<p>Several reasons explain this difference in crash rates. Intersections with other roads are primary determinants of truck crashes on major arterials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1087724X12461143">Caliendo et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1087724X12461143">Greibe, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1087724X12461143">Vogt &amp; Bared, 1998</xref>) with crash risk dependent on the traffic levels of both roads. Other factors that appear to influence crashes (or crash risk) are the number of lanes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1087724X12461143">Caliendo et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1087724X12461143">Greibe, 2003</xref>), variance in hourly traffic flow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1087724X12461143">Hiselius, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1087724X12461143">Mensah &amp; Hauer, 1998</xref>), flow density (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1087724X12461143">Lord, Manar, &amp; Vizioli, 2005</xref>), average annual daily traffic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1087724X12461143">Caliendo et al., 2007</xref>), speed limit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1087724X12461143">Greibe, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1087724X12461143">Qin, Ivan, &amp; Ravishanker, 2004</xref>), lane, shoulder, and road width (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1087724X12461143">Greibe, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1087724X12461143">Qin et al., 2004</xref>), land use and parking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1087724X12461143">Greibe, 2003</xref>), local versus urban roads (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1087724X12461143">Lord et al., 2005</xref>), time of day (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1087724X12461143">Blower et al., 1990</xref>), the length and extent of roadway curvature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1087724X12461143">Caliendo et al., 2007</xref>), and sight distance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1087724X12461143">Caliendo et al., 2007</xref>). Our data do not provide as much precision as the foregoing studies require but the Ohio crash data classifies each crash according to the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) functional road classification system. The FHWA uses many of the variables associated with these studies to classify road types. We report crash results by road type and find that Ohio crash patterns are consistent with expected risk levels according to highway categoy.</p>
<p>Finally, the differential crash risk and resulting expected cost must be attributed to trucks that divert from Interstate highways to other roads. A benefit–cost analysis that weighs the marginal revenues to state authorities against the marginal cost to state and local governments, as well as to pedestrians, bicyclists, horse-and-buggy drivers<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1087724X12461143">i</xref></sup>, and the motoring public, must begin with an estimate of the cost of motor vehicle crashes. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1087724X12461143">Zaloshnja and Miller (2004)</xref> estimated the cost of truck crashes at US$59,153 per crash for trucks larger than 10,000 pounds (in 2000 dollars). They estimate the cost of the average tractor-trailer crash (the primary type of truck diverted from toll roads to secondary roads) at US$72,459 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1087724X12461143">Zaloshnja &amp; Miller, 2004</xref>, p. 806). They include in this estimate the present value of crash over the expected lifespan of the victims, including the costs of medical treatment, emergency services, property damage, lost productivity, and monetized damages due to pain and suffering as well as lost quality of life.</p>
<p>Although a benefit–cost analysis assesses the efficiency of a considered toll rate change, economic theory can explain those results. There are several markets that help determine the effect of toll rate changes on commercial freight movements: The highway infrastructure market, the commercial freight movement market, and the truck driver labor market. For each to be economically efficient, the costs of use should be captured in the price so that the market price reflects the true cost. However, while toll roads often compete with other roads that provide reasonable substitutes, shippers consider toll expenses to be operational decisions for trucking firms and generally will not pay extra for use of toll roads by truckers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1087724X12461143">Wood, 2011</xref>). Because most drivers are paid a fixed amount per trip, shorter travel times on toll roads do not reduce labor cost and carriers often do not reimburse drivers for toll road use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1087724X12461143">Wood, 2011</xref>). All of this demonstrates that many markets involved with freight movements may not be “economically efficient.”</p>
<p>Furthermore, crash costs in particular may not be reflected in costs that shippers, carriers, and drivers pay. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1087724X12461143">Miller, Levy, Spicer, &amp; Lestina (1998)</xref> found that many costs related to truck crashes can be external to the market and not paid by the operator and/or carrier, or the consumer. Costs may not be compensated either due to uninsured or underinsured motorists, or problems in monetizing costs. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1087724X12461143">Litman and Doherty (2009)</xref> show that several crash costs typically remain uncompensated, including crash victims’ pain and suffering; crash victims’ lost quality of life; uncompensated grief and lost companionship to crash victims’ family and friends; as well as reduced nonmotorized travel due to crash danger.</p>
<p>In an effort to quantify the number of increased crashes caused from trucks diverting from the Ohio Turnpike to other roads, the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1087724X12461143">Ohio State Patrol (2007)</xref> completed a study counting crashes by highway both before and after Turnpike tolls were lowered in January 1, 2005. While the study showed a substantial decrease in crashes on other (diversion) roads, commercial vehicle crashes on the Turnpike increased more than expected. The study had two major flaws as an experiment. First, the treatment was unequal with a speed limit increase on the Turnpike enacted almost concurrently with the toll reduction. Second, the vehicle miles traveled (VMTs) were not measured for diversion roads, making a comparison of the crash rates impossible.</p>

<title>Data and Method</title>
<p>Estimating the increased crash costs associated with diverting trucks from a limited access highway depends on safety levels of both the first-best (generally fastest and safest) road and the roads to which traffic diverts. The results will vary greatly from place to place due to differences in the roads from one location to another. However, with detailed enough information, researchers may make a reasonable estimate for particular roads. To estimate increased cost from a particular diversion, we need three estimates or facts: (a) The amount of the diversion and some idea regarding the roads to which traffic diverts; (b) the risk of crash either by road or by road type; (c) an estimate of the cost per crash.</p>
<p>Diversion data come from the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1087724X12461143">Swan and Belzer (2010)</xref>, which estimates diversions from the Ohio Turnpike that took place between 1996 and 2004 due to increased tolls levied by the Ohio Turnpike to help to finance new construction. We use the estimated diversions to particular types of roads during 2004 as a traffic base for this study.</p>
<p>The Ohio Department of Transportation (Ohio DOT) uses the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) functional classification of roads (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1087724X12461143">Federal Highway Administration, 1989</xref>) and each road segment in Ohio has received a FHWA functional classification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1087724X12461143">Ohio Department of Transportation, 2011b</xref>). We use this classification to define road types as rural Interstate, urban Interstate, major urban arterial, and eight other types.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1087724X12461143">ii</xref></sup> One difference between FHWA functional road classifications and our study is that functional Type 2 (rural major arterials) is split into 2F (freeways) and 2 (other). Rural freeways are roads classified as rural major arterials that have four or more lanes and a speed limit greater than 55 miles per hour (mph).</p>
<p>To estimate the crash risk and expected crash cost by road type, we use statistical averages. A negative binomial model of crashes would be useful for determining how changes in particular variables affect crash rates, but we only need the overall crash risk to determine average crash risk for a class of roads. To determine crash rates by type of road, we link actual Ohio truck crashes from 2002 through 2006 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1087724X12461143">Ohio Department of Public Safety, 2008</xref>) to particular road segments. We use 5 years of data in our analysis to control for annual variation.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1087724X12461143">iii</xref></sup> The road segments used match those used by Ohio DOT for average annual daily commercial truck traffic (AADT) reports that Ohio DOT generates on a triennial basis. We estimate missing data (the two years or less between AADT recordings) by calculating the average ratio of truck AADT each year to county daily vehicle miles traveled (DVMT; from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1087724X12461143">Ohio Department of Transportation, 2010</xref>) for the particular FHWA road classification for the known years and multiplying this average ratio by the county DVMT for the same FHWA road classification. This provides an AADT count for commercial trucks on every road segment for every year.</p>
<p>The <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1087724X12461143">Ohio Department of Transportation (2011a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1087724X12461143">Wilbur Smith Associates, 2007</xref>) defines crashes involving commercial trucks as crashes in which at least one of the up to three vehicles recorded was a truck with more than four tires (not a van, panel truck, or pickup; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1087724X12461143">Federal Highway Administration, 1989</xref>). The commercial truck AADT numbers do include both buses and six-wheel pickup trucks. Technically, six-wheel pickup trucks also are included in crash numbers (assuming correct police coding). Although buses make up a small portion of VMT (between three and 7%, depending on functional road type; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1087724X12461143">Federal Highway Administration, 2011</xref>), we have no cost data on bus crashes.</p>
<p>We assign each commercial truck crash in Ohio between 2002 and 2006 to a particular road segment based on location information in the crash database and road inventory information obtained from Ohio DOT’s website (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1087724X12461143">Ohio Department of Transportation, 2008a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1087724X12461143">2008b</xref>), combining segments when the data identify two intersections with the same road on two different segments (i.e., OH-18 West and OH-18 East). Where combined segments contained multiple FHWA functional classifications, we use the functional classification with the greatest number of miles for the entire combined segment.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1087724X12461143">iv</xref></sup> Many urban segments were combined because it was difficult and unreliable to determine the exact location of a crash by street number, and we excluded US-30, which was under construction into a rural freeway during the study period and therefore subject to bias due to localized hazards. Finally, we excluded crash data for segments for which we had no traffic information (mostly business routes) and segments for which it was impossible to tell whether crashes occurred on the numbered road or its business route. We used segment lengths and AADT segment truck counts to provide exposure data (annual VMTs). We summed annual VMT for all combined segments by FHWA functional classification type, as reported by Ohio DOT, to compare with crash counts and costs.</p>
<p>We estimated the cost of each truck crash based on the largest truck involved, the number and type of injuries, and the FHWA road functional classification. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1087724X12461143">Zaloshnja and Miller (2007)</xref>, in a study for the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration, developed a model with which they estimated the average cost (in 2005 dollars) of medium and heavy truck crashes based on the type of truck involved. They break down costs into property damage costs per crash by truck type, injury costs per victim based on truck type, and the reported classification of each injury. Using these costs per crash and per victim, we summed crash costs by FHWA functional type. Finally, we divided total cost by total VMTs for each FHWA functional classification type to determine crash cost per truck VMT for each FHWA functional classification.</p>
<p>Although the Ohio Crash Database includes data from other roads, we limit the study to Interstate highways, U.S. routes, and Ohio numbered routes. This is partly because Ohio AADT data are not available for other roads and partly because these are the roads most often used by commercial trucks. During the years 2002 to 2006, more than 1.8 million crashes were recorded in Ohio and of these, 7% (122,489) involved some type of commercial truck. Although crashes involving commercial trucks in Ohio resulted in only 5% of total injuries, they did result in 14% of all fatalities (927 deaths) in Ohio from 2002 through 2006. Most of these crashes (53%) occurred on main roads defined as Interstates, U.S. routes and numbered Ohio routes. Truck crashes on main roads accounted for 63% of injury accidents and 79% of fatalities involving trucks. Nationally, all commercial trucks, heavy trucks, and semitrucks make up 13.1%, 7.5%, and 4.8% of VMTs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1087724X12461143">Burks, Belzer, Kwan, Pratt, &amp; Shackelford, 2010</xref>).</p>

<p>Although Ohio records show 67,398 crashes occurring on the roads we studied, our analysis included only 66,229 of these; the other 1,169 either could not be located or occurred on segments not included for reasons stated above. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1087724X12461143">Table 1</xref> shows the summary statistics by functional class for Ohio highways included in this study.

Rural Interstates carry the second largest percentage of Ohio truck VMTs and have the best safety performance compared with all other functional road classes. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1087724X12461143">Table 3</xref> shows the crash rate for each class of road divided by the crash rate for rural Interstates. Rural and urban Interstates carry much of the Ohio truck traffic (31% and 35% of VMTs, respectively), but differ substantially in average volume-to-capacity (V/C) ratio (47% and 82%, respectively) and crash rates. Rural Interstates, in comparison with urban Interstates, have much lower rates for crashes (52.4 compared with 126.1), injury crashes (11.7 compared with 38.0), injuries (13.8 compared with 38.9), fatal crashes (0.3 compared with 0.6), and fatalities (0.4 compared with 0.7) per 100 million VMTs. Urban freeways (limited access divided highways that have not received designation as part of the Dwight D. Eisenhower National System of Interstate and Defense Highways) have slightly lower rates for crashes, injury crashes, injuries, fatal crashes, and fatalities than urban Interstates, but are nevertheless about twice as risky as rural Interstates in all categories. Urban freeways probably fall somewhere in between rural and urban Interstates because they are less congested (V/C = 38%) and have slightly slower speeds (average of 61 mph compared to 65 mph). Crash and injury-crash rates for rural Interstates and rural freeways are very similar, but fatal crash rates for rural freeways are almost triple those of rural Interstates.</p>

<p>Other rural principal arterials have much higher crash rates in comparison to rural Interstates (2.5 times as high), higher injury crash rates (3.8 times as high), and higher fatal crash rates (9.6 times as high) compared to rural Interstates. Rural minor arterials have crash, injury crash, and fatal crash rates that are roughly 50% higher than those for other rural principal arterials. Rural collectors have similar rates for crashes, injury crashes and fatal crashes compared to rural minor arterials. Urban roads have higher crash rates and injury crash rates than their rural counterparts with the exception of rural Interstates, which are the safest of all FHWA classification types. However, fatal crash rates for most urban road types are lower than those for their rural counterparts with the exception of interstates and collectors (possibly due to slower speeds).</p>
<p>One can draw a general conclusion that freeways—limited access divided highways—are much safer than other roads. The risk of a truck crash (and the risk of an injury crash) is between two and six times greater on other roads. Rural Interstates also have many fewer fatal truck crashes per million VMTs (0.3) compared with urban Interstates (0.8), rural freeways (1.0), urban freeways (0.8), and all other road types, which range from 6 to 13 times as many fatal crashes per 100 million VMTs compared to rural Interstates. Without a doubt, these data confirm that the Interstate highway is the safest road to drive intercity.</p>

<p>The data show a notable difference in average crash cost per VMT between functional road type: Four cents per VMT for rural Interstates, which have the lowest crash cost per truck VMT, compared with 41 cents per VMT for urban collectors with the highest crash cost per truck VMT. Rural Interstates carried 31% of truck VMTs for studied roads, but rural Interstate crashes totaled only 10% of crash cost for all road types. The average annual truck crash cost in Ohio for studies roads exceeded US$1.3 billion during the study years.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1087724X12461143">Swan and Belzer (2010)</xref> estimated diversions from the Ohio Turnpike based on increases in toll rates for trucks from 1995 thru 2006. Using AADT numbers for suspected diversion roads and a time-series model of truck demand elasticity, they estimated the number of trucks diverting daily on several roads. They reported that the elasticity of demand for the toll road to be −0.045 at a nominal toll rate of US$0.09 per mile and it rose to −0.09 at a nominal toll rate of US$0.17 per mile, with a profit-maximizing toll rate considerably higher, with accompanying increased diversion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1087724X12461143">Swan &amp; Belzer, 2010</xref>, p. 360). Given that rural Interstates like the Ohio Turnpike have lower crash, injury crash, and fatal crash rates than all other types of roads, we would expect trucks diverted due to toll rates to be associated with a greater number of crashes and higher costs from more injuries and fatalities than they would have if they were traveling on the Ohio Turnpike.</p>
<p>In order to estimate the crash cost of trucks diverting from the Ohio Turnpike to other roads, we use estimated trucks diverted in 2004 from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1087724X12461143">Swan and Belzer (2010)</xref> to calculate truck VMTs diverted from the Ohio Turnpike to other roads. Using the estimated diversions and the crash cost based on functional road type, we estimate crash costs caused by the diversions from the Ohio Turnpike to other roads during 2004 in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-1087724X12461143">Table 5</xref>. The estimated annual crash cost for diverted trucks is US$51 million for 2004. These same diverted trucks would have had an estimated annual crash cost of roughly US$11 million assuming that they had traveled an equal distance (to studied diversion routes) on the Ohio Turnpike bases on the estimated crash cost of US$0.04 per VMT (or US$43,008 per million VMTs). We therefore roughly estimate that the additional crash cost resulting from diversion of commercial trucks from the Ohio Turnpike in 2004 is more than US$39 million. Although US$39 million is only 3% of the average annual crash cost for the State, it represents a substantial increase for the affected roads. Comparing the estimated crash cost from diverted trucks to base traffic levels (from AADT) for the same roads, the US$39 million of additional crash cost represents a 346% increase as a direct result of diversion.</p>

<p>The estimated crash cost for diverted trucks is an expected value based on the extent of diversion estimated by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1087724X12461143">Swan and Belzer (2010)</xref> and Zaloshnja and Miller’s cost estimates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1087724X12461143">2007</xref>). The real number is unknown and several factors may reduce the accuracy of this estimate. First, the annual total mileage includes bus VMTs, but we exclude buses because we do not know crash costs for buses. Additionally, during 2004 Interstates had less bus traffic as a percent of commercial VMTs than other road types (3% for Interstates compared with 4% to 7% for other road classes; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1087724X12461143">Federal Highway Administration, 2011</xref>). This should result in an overestimation of truck VMTs for roads other than Interstates, thus resulting in an underestimation of crash risk and cost per VMT. Second, we assume that trucks diverted from the Turnpike to avoid the cost of tolls would have traveled an equal distance on the Ohio Turnpike, but experience suggests that the distance would be shorter without the diversion; the resulting crash exposure on the Turnpike overestimates the crash cost of staying on the Turnpike, so the estimated US$11 million offset is very conservative. Third, this methodology assumes that some crashes for the crashes used in the study, and their crash cost, would not have occurred or would have cost less if the truck were traveling on the Interstate highway, because the probability of such crashes is much less than the probability of crash on secondary roads. On the other hand, the involvement of a truck is likely to increase the risk of death and injury greatly. Furthermore, some costs associated with crashes are not included, such as cargo damage and the cost of delay resulting from the accident (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1087724X12461143">Savage, 2011</xref>, p. 251). Finally, the paper by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1087724X12461143">Swan and Belzer (2010)</xref> studied only selected road segments and excluded urban areas, which have higher crash rates, thus missing a significant portion of truck traffic diverted from the Ohio Turnpike, and the cost of the average tractor-trailer crash is about 80% greater than the average automobile-only crash. Based on all of this, the real additional crash cost attributable to diverted trucks probably would be higher. Although the data are not exact, they clearly show that diversion of trucks from rural Interstates to other roads can be expected to result in a large increase in crash costs.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study is unique because it uses actual crash data, including type of truck involved and estimated injury cost for each crash, based on categories of injuries reported and the type of highway involved with each crash. Two findings from this analysis merit close attention because they clearly demonstrate the existence of externalities with regard to tolls and road use. First, the estimated total additional crash cost of US$39 million resulting from trucks diverting off the Ohio Turnpike is more than 50% greater than the US$24 million reduction in toll collections that the Ohio Turnpike suffered because it lowered tolls for semitrucks to bring them back onto the Turnpike in 2005 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1087724X12461143">Proctor &amp; Morckel, 2004</xref>). The increased social cost of crashes is not borne by the Turnpike Commission and therefore represents an externality. The policy of increasing tolls reduced economic welfare, with costs exceeding benefits by more than 50%, based on increased crash costs alone. Since the additional congestion, construction, and maintenance costs of truck diversion are not included in this calculation, this conclusion is extremely conservative.</p>
<p>Indeed, Ohio public safety officials had become alarmed at the sharp increase in truck-related highway crashes during the period in which Turnpike toll increases caused Turnpike traffic to divert to secondary roads. Consistent with the comments made by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1087724X12461143">Savage (2011</xref>, p. 251), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1087724X12461143">Proctor and Morckel (2004)</xref> found several other external costs borne by Ohio that increased with diversion of trucks from the Turnpike. These costs included damage from overweight trucks to other roads due to the lack of weigh stations, increased wear-and-tear from heavy truck traffic on roads not designed to carry large volumes of heavy trucks, increased law enforcement costs on other roads, and increased congestion on other roads. Proctor and Morckel have not quantified these costs, but they are substantial and would suggest that our estimates are conservative.</p>
<p>Second, the fact that truck drivers and carriers made the decision to divert even in the face of increased risk of crash and increased expected crash cost suggests that either the truck operators involved in crashes do not bear all the crash costs or they made seemingly irrational route choices. As we have shown, crash costs per truck VMT vary widely among different types of roads but neither motor carriers nor drivers have this information when they make these choices and might not be able to act to limit their risk if they did, as it is unclear whether motor carriers’ business plans can integrate this risk into rate-setting processes without simply losing the freight to lower price bidders. Rural Interstates in Ohio have an estimated crash cost of US$0.04 per VMT while we estimate the crash cost per mile for alternative roads between US$0.08 and US$0.41—between two and ten times as high. “Rural principle arterials—other,” which probably constitutes the biggest diversion category, have an expected crash cost that is nearly six times as high as rural Interstates (24 cents per VMT versus 4 cents per VMT), as shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1087724X12461143">Table 4</xref>. Given that the toll for the Ohio Turnpike was US$0.176 per mile for fully loaded semitrucks in 2004, it is clear that for diversion routes other than freeways and Interstates, the crash cost resulting from diversion would exceed the savings in tolls. This would be a rational choice if the expected crash costs for the trucks did not exceed the toll avoided and if drivers could be required to pay for their highway choices, but because insurance policies do not specify highway used and neither employee drivers nor owner drivers earn enough to pay the tolls, carriers, and drivers that divert to more risky roads do not pay a risk premium for that choice; the cost is external to the market, creating a moral hazard problem. While insurance cost may vary crudely by carrier according to crash risk, other insured motorists or society bear the additional crash costs as externalities.</p>
<p>Driver pay is also important when drivers are responsible for deciding whether to use toll roads or not. Owner operators and drivers for small firms often are required to pay for their own tolls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1087724X12461143">Wood, 2011</xref>). Given an effective toll rate of over US$10 per hour (assuming a speed of 60 mph), it is easy to see why drivers paid an effective hourly rate between US$6.18 per hour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1087724X12461143">Belzer, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1087724X12461143">Belzer &amp; Swan, 2011</xref>, p. 13) and a nominal median gross hourly wage of US$10.46 (1997) to US$17.56 (2004; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1087724X12461143">U.S. Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics, 1997</xref> and 2004)<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1087724X12461143">v</xref></sup>would not elect to use toll roads under any circumstances.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1087724X12461143">Savage (2011)</xref> suggests that these additional crash costs not paid by truckers are substantial. Furthermore, truckers making routing decisions experience information asymmetry because they may not be completely aware of differential crash risks. This situation leads to truckers making routing decisions that lead to higher costs for society and deadweight economic loss. If problems with moral hazard, externalities, and information asymmetries were resolved, then truckers can be depended upon to make good routing decisions. Absent such resolution, however, government might increase social welfare by providing incentives for truckers to avoid roads with higher crash costs by not introducing or raising tolls on safer, rural Interstates, and freeways.</p>
<p>Indeed, behavioral economics has shown in recent years that people regularly make economically inefficient decisions due to a lack of information, information asymmetry, and opportunistic bias; they are willing to take that risk because they don’t believe the probabilities apply to them (for example, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1087724X12461143">Ariely, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>From a public policy perspective, the fact that the Turnpike Authority benefitted from those tolls and was able to use them to widen the highway does not mean that the benefits outweighed the costs. Admittedly, part of the problem with the diversion of trucks to other roads is that the Turnpike is self-financing while other roads may be inadequately financed. If users were forced to pay the true cost of all roads, diversion created by toll rates would be much less of a problem. Truckers pay twice when they take the toll road: once in fuel taxes and licensing fees and a second time when they pay the toll, increasing the incentive to divert; while fuel taxes are mandatory, no trucker is required to take the toll road and will avoid tolls regularly. Furthermore, it could be argued that a reasonable person could make an informed decision on which road to use based on all factors including the crash risk cost, but it may be an unreasonable assumption that such knowledge would be available to everyone.</p>

<title>Policy Implications</title>
<p>These findings point to a clear market failure in road pricing policy. Because truck demand for Interstate highways is elastic with toll rates, establishing or increasing toll rates may result in higher social costs (and lower social welfare) in the form of truck crashes, and much of these higher costs will be borne by local government and the motoring public. Admittedly, part of the problem with the pricing of toll roads is that user charges for nontolled roads are insufficient for adequate maintenance. In an efficient market this would not happen, but the markets for road infrastructure and trucking safety clearly are not efficient. It is incorrect to assume that truck drivers and motor carriers usually will pay higher toll rates in exchange for quicker transit times.</p>
<p>The experience of Ohio clearly shows that toll rate increases can result in lower social welfare. As a result, governments should carefully consider the safety (and social welfare) effects before implementing toll rate changes. The experience also points to externalities and/or moral hazard problems in motor carrier insurance, although resolving this problem is beyond the scope of this paper. Likewise, resolving problems with externalities in the markets for motor freight and motor carrier labor are beyond the scope of this article.</p>
<p>Federal highway user fees—fuel tax rates—have been frozen in nominal terms for about two decades and have declined by about half in real terms. With U.S. policy makers paralyzed and unable to raise taxes to cover highway use, they have had to resort to balancing the highway budget by drawing from general tax revenues, which is the most inefficient road use tax mechanism. This study shows that the cost of tolling trucks on Interstate highways far exceeds the benefits, making the tolling mechanism and highway privatization an expedient but inefficient policy choice.</p>
<p>In sum, rural Interstate highways are the safest roads for vehicular traffic and public policy should unambiguously encourage use of these roadways, especially by trucks.</p>
