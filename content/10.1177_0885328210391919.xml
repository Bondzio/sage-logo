<abstract>
<p>To evaluate α-calcium sulfate hemihydrate (α-CSH)/β-tricalcium phosphate (β-TCP) combined artificial bone graft (COB) in an animal model of posterolateral spinal fusion, α-CSH and β-TCP were combined in a 3 : 7 weight ratio. A rabbit model of posterolateral spinal fusion was produced (<italic>N</italic> = 36); one side was implanted with the COB, and the other with local autogenous bone. Rabbits were killed on the 4th, 8th, or 12th week after surgery and fusion, COB degradation, mineralization, and new bone formation were evaluated. Scanning electron microscopy revealed that the COB retained the porous spatial structure of β-TCP and α-CSH crystals were adhered to the surface and pores of β-TCP. At the 12th week after surgery, the fusion rate was 75.0% on the 12th week after the operation, which was higher than the fusion rate of 54.4% the autogenous bone side (<italic>p</italic> = 0.073). Bone volume fraction of the COB was 0.49 ± 0.08 for the 4th week and 0.16 ± 0.05 for the 12th week after surgery. The mineralization rate of the new bone was greater on the side implanted with autogenous bone than on the side implanted with COB at all the three time points after surgery. At each time point after surgery, the difference in mineralization rate between the autogenous bone side and the COB side was statistically significant (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001); α-CSH/β-TCP in a 3 : 7 weight ratio was as effective as local autogenous bone in producing spinal fusion in a rabbit model. Used in this ratio, the speed of material degradation and new bone formation are relatively equivalent, and the rate of new bone mineralization is similar to that of autogenous bone graft.</p>

<p>Over 700,000 spinal fusion procedures requiring bone graft material are performed each year in the United States alone.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0885328210391919">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0885328210391919">2</xref></sup> At present, the gold standard for bone grafting is utilizing the patient's own bone; however, the supply of autogenous bone graft is limited and donor site complications include pain and infection.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0885328210391919">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0885328210391919">8</xref></sup> An ideal bone graft substitute should have all the following characteristics: (1) osteoconductive matrix or scaffolds which allow bone ingrowth; (2) osteoinductive factors which can induce bone regeneration and repair by accumulating and stimulating host stromal cells; (3) osteoblasts possessing differentiation potentials that can survive implantation; and (4) structural integrity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0885328210391919">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0885328210391919">10</xref></sup> At present, bone graft substitutes used in clinical practice include allograft, xenograft, demineralized bone matrix, bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs), and synthetic bone graft substitutes and each has its own benefits and limitations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0885328210391919">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0885328210391919">12</xref></sup> Synthetic bone graft substitutes include materials such as hydroxyapatite (HA), corraline HA, which is formed from the hydrothermal conversion of coral, and β-tricalcium phosphate (β-TCP), a calcium sulfate composite.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0885328210391919">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0885328210391919">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0885328210391919">16</xref></sup> These materials are abundant, offer advantages such as convenient storage, easy usage, and good biocompatibility, are not associated with disease transmission, and are frequently used in combination with BMPs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0885328210391919">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0885328210391919">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0885328210391919">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>HA has the same mineral composition as bone and excellent osteoconductive properties; however, it does not remodel or degrade readily.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0885328210391919">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0885328210391919">16</xref></sup> To address these problems, Constantz et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0885328210391919">17</xref></sup> developed carbonated hydroxyapatite (CHA), which has a self-solidifying property that allows remodeling. However, CHA cement has a dense, non-porous structure which inhibits the growth of blood vessels and slows degradation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0885328210391919">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0885328210391919">16</xref></sup> The degradation of β-TCP is the most rapid one among the calcium phosphate-based artificial bone materials, and various production procedures can alter its porous structure to achieve satisfactory vessel ingrowth and degradation rate.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0885328210391919">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0885328210391919">16</xref></sup> Also, α-calcium sulfate hemihydrate (α-CSH), when prepared under specific temperature and pressure conditions, is self-solidifying and degrades rapidly.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0885328210391919">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0885328210391919">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0885328210391919">18</xref></sup> Mao et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0885328210391919">19</xref></sup> produced an α-CSH/β-TCP combined artificial bone graft (COB). In this material, the macropore/micropore structure and excellent degradation properties of β-TCP complement the self-solidification property of α-CSH, and the combined material has been shown to produce a higher rate of fusion than when either material alone was used for the restoration of a femoral condyle defect in a rabbit model.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0885328210391919">19</xref></sup> However, that study only explored the effects of α-CSH and β-TCP combined in a 1 : 1 ratio. Various clinical indications have different requirements with respect to self-solidification, mechanical strength, and degradation of the material.</p>
<p>Based on the concept mentioned above, this study investigated the effects on spinal fusion and osteogenic properties of a COB composed of α-CSH and β-TCP in a 3 : 7 weight ratio in an animal model of posterolateral spinal fusion.</p>

<sec id="sec4-0885328210391919"><title>Preparation of α-CSH</title>
<p>In this study, α-CSH was prepared under high temperature and high pressure. In brief, 20 mL of distilled water and 200 g calcium sulfate dehydrate were mixed together well and placed in a clean cloth bag. The bag was placed into a GSHA-2 high pressure reaction tank (vapor pressure: 0.13 MPa; Weihai Xintai Chemical Machinery Co, Ltd, Shandong, China) and the temperature was maintained at 123°C for 7 h (the speed of temperature increase was 5°/min). The material was then dried in an aeration cabinet (120°C) for 4–5 h, removed and cooled to room temperature naturally, then ground by hand, passed through a 180-mesh sieve (pore size 0.05 mm), and reserved.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-0885328210391919"><title>Preparation of β-TCP bone particles</title>
<p>This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of our institution, and all animals were cared for according to the Guidelines for Ethical Conduct in the Care and Use of Animals in Research. Bovine femur was harvested from a healthy adult cow. The superficial soft tissues were removed and the cancellous bone from the femoral head and distal femur was cut into rectangular 2 × 2 × 1 cm<sup>3</sup> pieces using an electric saw. Organic matter was removed from the bone after boiling and soaking in a solution of sodium hydroxide and hydrogen peroxide. The bone fragments were then washed for 3 h in running water, rinsed clean with distilled water, boiled for 10 h in distilled water (with several water changes), washed for 3 h in running water, rinsed with deionized water twice, dehydrated in a graded series of alcohols, and dried in an oven for 4 days at 50°C.</p>
<p>Next, the material was placed in a high-temperature (800°C) calcination furnace for 3 h (the temperature was increased 10°/min until the desired temperature was reached). After calcination, the material was soaked in a 1 M (NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub> solution for 24 h, and then dried in a 50°C oven for 4 days. The dried material was again placed in a high-temperature (1100°C) calcination furnace for 1 h in which the temperature was increased 5°/min until the desired temperature was reached. The material was allowed to cool to room temperature, washed for 3 h in running water, rinsed with deionized water twice, and dried in an oven for 4 days at 50°C. It was then crushed by hand into granules, and then passed through sieves with diameters of 2 mm and 0.85 mm. Calcined bone particles 0.85–2 mm in diameter were selected for later usage. The X-ray diffraction pattern of the β-TCP bone particles is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0885328210391919">Figure 1</xref>.

</sec>
<sec id="sec6-0885328210391919"><title>Preparation of α-CSH/β-TCP combined bone graft</title>
<p>In this study, α-CSH powder was added to anhydrous alcohol in a ratio of 1 g to 2 mL, and then shaken to evenly disperse the α-CSH powder to create a suspension; α-CSH powder and β-TCP bone particles were combined in a 3 : 7 ratio of powder weight, placed in the suspension, and shaken for 30 min to make the α-CSH crystal grains adhere to the surface and pores of the TCP particles. The suspension was placed in an aeration cabinet (65°C) to naturally evaporate the alcohol and dried to a constant weight. The resulting product, combined α-CSH/β-TCP bone particles 0.85–2 mm in diameter with a α-CSH:β-TCP weight ratio of 3 : 7 (combined bone graft; COB), was stored in a sealed container for later use. The morphological structure of the material was observed with a scanning electron microscope (SEM).</p>

<sec id="sec7-0885328210391919"><title>Preparation of an animal model of multisegment posterolateral fusion in the thoracic spine</title>
<p>Healthy New Zealand male rabbits (<italic>N</italic> = 36), weighing 2.5–3.0 kg were provided by the Experimental Animal Center of PLA General Hospital (certificate number SCXK 2007-0003). After anesthesia, the rabbits were placed in a prone position, their limbs were fixed, and sterile towels were placed after iodophor skin preparation. A skin incision was made in the midline of the back at the level of T4 to T8 and soft tissue dissection was performed to expose the laminae and transverse processes. The spinous processes were removed with a rongeur and preserved for later use. The cortex of the laminae and transverse processes and facet joints were removed with a drill. COB, 3 g for each rabbit, was implanted on the laminae and between the spinous processes on the right side. The cortical bone of the laminae and that of the spinous processes were implanted on the left side to serve as a control. Twelve rabbits were sacrificed with CO<sub>2</sub> at the 4th, 8th, and 12th weeks after surgery. En bloc resection of the thoracic spine was performed, soft tissue was removed, and the morphology of the spine and tissue changes around the bone grafts and size of fusion mass on both sides were observed.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec8-0885328210391919"><title>Measurement of fusion rate</title>
<p>Two examiners carried out palpation of the fusion mass on both sides of the fusion segment and the results of palpation were recorded as stable or unstable. Fusion was defined when both examiners found the fusion mass to be stable by palpation. The number of fused segments on each side was recorded. Anteroposterior radiographs were taken of specimens on the day of sampling. The specimen was placed directly on the film box, the distance of projection was 110 cm, and the projection conditions were 55 kV, 20 mA, and 0.4 s. Two examiners evaluated the fusion status of each side in the radiographs. Fusion was defined as the presence of continuous bone trabeculae between the transverse processes, and the presence of fusion was determined by agreement of the two observers.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec9-0885328210391919"><title>Analysis of material degradation and new bone growth with micro computed tomography</title>
<p>At each time point, four spine fusion specimens were selected, fixed with 40% ethanol, and scanned with a GE eXplore Locus SP Micro CT scanner (GE Healthcare, Waukesha, WI). Microview V2.1.2 software (GE Medical Systems, London, Ontario, Canada) was used for three-dimensional reconstruction and ABA specific bone analysis (GE Healthcare, Waukesha, WI) was used for the analysis. Scan agreement: largetube_14 um_150 min_ss. Scan parameters were: scanning resolution of 14 µm; rotation angle, 360°; increase of rotation angle, 0.4; voltage, 80 kV; current, 80 µA; time of exposure, 2960 ms; frame average, 4; pixel binning, 1 × 1. Black-and-white scanning correction was used, and Hounsfield scale correction was standardized correction of stripe reconstruction. Four 3 mm<sup>3</sup> cube-shaped regions of interest (ROIs) were selected randomly from the area of bone grafting on the COB side of each of the four specimens. The value of object segmentation was 2800 Hu. Bone mineral content (BMC), total mineral content (TMC), and bone volume fraction (BVF) were recorded.</p>

<sec id="sec10-0885328210391919"><title>Comparison of mineralization rate of new bone between COB and autogenous graft with tetracycline fluorescence labeling</title>
<p>On the 13th and 3rd days before killing the rabbits at each time point, tetracycline (30 mg/kg) was injected through the marginal ear vein for the fluorescence labeling. A GE molybdenum-target X-ray tube was used to expose (25 kV, 86 mAs, 115 ms) the non-decalcified bone specimens 200 µm in depth for observation of the restoration of the bone defect. One specimen at each time point was selected, three serial sections were made, and three visual fields were randomly chosen from each section. A set of data were randomly selected from each visual field, the double-layer mineralization zone was observed under a fluorescence microscope, images were collected with a digital image acquisition system, and the vertical distance between two mineralization zones at the front margin was measured. The deposition rate of new bone mineralization was calculated according to Parffit's method,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0885328210391919">20</xref></sup>

<sec id="sec12-0885328210391919" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title>
<p>Scanning electron microscopy revealed that the COB retained the porous spatial structure of the β-TCP bone particles and that the α-CSH crystals were adhered to the surface and pores of β-TCP bone particles to form a composite structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0885328210391919">Figure 2</xref>). The pore size of the β-TCP (determined before combining with α-CSH) ranged from 50 to 400 µm, with surrounding micropores of 1 µm. In the combined β-TCP/α-CSH artificial bone graft, the β-TCP is covered by α-CSH, which has no regular pore structure; thus, the micropore structure cannot be measured. Among 36 rabbits in this study, 4 died accidentally (1 of anesthetic overdosage, 2 of spinal cord injury during surgery, and 1 of wound infection). Thus, 10 rabbits were killed at 4 weeks after surgery, 11 at 8 weeks, and 11 at 12 weeks. No complications occurred in the surviving animals, and wound healing occurred by 2 weeks after surgery.

<sec id="sec13-0885328210391919"><title>Morphologic examination</title>
<p>At 4 weeks after surgery, no inflammatory reactions such as redness, swelling, or congestion were noted. The implant material of both sides was surrounded by fibrous tissue, and was easily identified and could be dissected easily from the grafted area. No remarkable fusion mass was present on either side and flexibility of the fusion segments and intervertebral motion was still present. At 8 weeks after surgery, marked proliferation of fibrous tissue around the COB was present. New bone formation was present around the material, and the COB could only be seen in limited areas. Dissection of the material from the graft bed was relatively difficult. Fusion mass formation was present in both sides of the grafted area, and was larger on the COB side. Fusion segments had decreased flexibility, no intervertebral motion was present in most segments, and deformed fusion protruding from the COB side was seen in some specimens. At 12 weeks after surgery, large amounts of new bone formation were present on the COB side and the majority of the material was covered with bone. Dissection of the COB from the graft bed was difficult. Significant fusion mass was present on both sides of the graft area, but was larger on the COB side. Moreover, the fusion mass on the side implanted with COB expanded to the surrounding area and tended to integrate into the side implanted with autogenous bone. Fusion segments on each side in most specimens were rigid and intervertebral motion was not present. Similar to the specimens from 8 weeks, deformed fusion protruding from the side implanted with COB was seen in some specimens.</p>

<sec id="sec14-0885328210391919"><title>Comparison of fusion rates at different time points</title>
<p>A comparison of the fusion rates at the different time points is given in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0885328210391919">Table 1</xref>, and a representative radiograph is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0885328210391919">Figure 3</xref>. At 4 weeks after surgery, though the results of palpation indicated that fusion was achieved in a few segments on both sides, X-ray examination indicated that there was no fusion in all 40 motion segments examined; therefore, no calculation and comparison were performed. At 8 weeks after surgery, results of palpation indicated that fusion was achieved in 23 of 44 motion segments on the side implanted with autogenous bone (fusion rate, 52.2%), and in 34 on the COB side (fusion rate, 77.3%), and the difference was statistically significant (<italic>p</italic> = 0.014). X-ray examination showed that fusion was achieved in 20 segments implanted with autogenous bone (fusion rate, 45.4%) and 32 implanted with COB (fusion rate, 72.7%), and the difference was statistically significant (<italic>p</italic> = 0.017).

<p>This study investigated the effects on spinal fusion and osteogenic properties of a COB composed of α-CSH and β-TCP in a 3 : 7 weight ratio in an animal model of posterolateral spinal fusion. The results indicated that the fusion rate of the side implanted with COB was higher than that of the side implanted with the local autogenous bone, and the speed of COB degradation and new bone growth were relatively equivalent.</p>
<p>As no single material has been found to be a completely adequate substitute for autogenous bone graft, an important direction in materials science has been to produce combined materials that make up for the other's deficiencies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0885328210391919">9</xref></sup> A few of the many combined materials investigated include biphasic calcium sulfate dehydrate/iron-modified α -TCP,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0885328210391919">21</xref></sup> β-TCP combined with recombinant human BMP-2,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0885328210391919">13</xref></sup> HA and β-TCP mixed with bone marrow aspirate,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0885328210391919">14</xref></sup> strontium–calcium compounds,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0885328210391919">22</xref></sup> and calcium sulfate–HA compounds.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0885328210391919">15</xref></sup> In this study, we combined α-CSH, which degrades relatively quickly, is self-solidifying, and has a relatively high strength, with β-TCP, which has a speed of degradation similar to that of new bone formation, has relatively weak mechanical strength, and is not self-solidifying.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0885328210391919">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0885328210391919">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0885328210391919">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0885328210391919">23</xref></sup> By adjusting the ratio of the two components, we were able to modulate the solidification, strength, and speed of degradation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0885328210391919">19</xref></sup> of the combined material. (Data regarding the solidification and strength of the COB are unpublished, and they are presented in the Appendix.)</p>
<p>The chemical composition and crystalline structure of β-TCP are similar to that of the mineral phase of bone; it can reproduce the morphology and strength of normal bone <italic>in vivo</italic>, and its degradation is faster than that of calcium HA.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0885328210391919">24</xref></sup> However, it also has shortcomings such as relative brittleness, insufficient porosity, and mechanical strength at the early stage of implantation, and it cannot be molded as required during surgery; α-CSH, on the other hand, when prepared under specific temperature and pressure conditions, is self-solidifying and degrades rapidly.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0885328210391919">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0885328210391919">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0885328210391919">18</xref></sup> Also, α-CSH loses its water of crystallization and becomes anhydrous calcium sulfate when the temperature exceeds 160°C, and its physical and chemical properties change accordingly.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0885328210391919">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0885328210391919">18</xref></sup> In addition, it will absorb water molecules from water-containing solvents to form calcium sulfate dehydrate, again with a change of physical and chemical properties.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0885328210391919">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0885328210391919">18</xref></sup> Thus, some of the most commonly used methods of producing composite materials, such as plasma spraying and ion beam-assisted deposition could not be used for preparing the COB in this study. In this study, α-CSH powder was suspended in dehydrated alcohol to which β-TCP particles were added and suspended. Evaporation of the alcohol allowed the two materials to sufficiently combine to form the composite material.</p>
<p>Results of the micro-CT analysis indicated that the mineral content of the materials decreased gradually, indicating a slow, continuous degradation of the COB. However, the TMC did not change significantly, suggesting that the degradation of the COB matched that of new bone growth, and important consideration in the use of synthetic bone graft materials that maintains mechanical strength of the graft material during the fusion process.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0885328210391919">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0885328210391919">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0885328210391919">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0885328210391919">26</xref></sup> This study, however, did not investigate the effects of various ratios of the two components with respect to degradation. The speed of degradation can be modulated by changing the component of materials to satisfy different requirements of clinical indications, and we believe it should be a topic of future research.</p>
<p>In this study, higher fusion rates were noted on the side implanted with COB at the 8th and 12th weeks after surgery. Other studies comparing the use of autogenous bone with synthetic bone substitutes have shown bone substitutes to be as effective or less effective than autogenous bone, the gold standard.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0885328210391919">27</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0885328210391919">29</xref></sup> There are several possible reasons for these results. The amount of the autogenous bone used was less than that of the COB. All the autogenous bone specimens used in this study were harvested from the spinous processes at the fusion segments, and no additional bone harvesting was performed; so the amount of bone graft may have been relatively insufficient. The α-CSH component of the COB is strongly hydrophilic, and because of the higher solubility of α-CSH, its dissolution will create a local acidic environment and thus induce decalcification and the release of ossification factors inside the bone. In addition, along with the degradation of α-CSH, the natural porous structure of β-TCP is exposed, and this provides an osteoconductive framework for new bone growth.</p>
<p>In conclusion, this study showed that α-CSH/β-TCP in a 3 : 7 weight ratio was as effective as local autogenous bone in producing spinal fusion in a rabbit model. Used in this ratio, the speeds of material degradation and new bone formation are relatively equivalent, and the rate of new bone mineralization, though slightly less, is similar to that of autogenous bone graft.</p>

<sec id="sec20-0885328210391919"><title>Solidification time</title>
<p>When the solid-to-liquid ratio was 1 g : 0.3 mL, the initial solidification time of α-CSH was 4.3 ± 1.2 min, and the final solidification time was 11.5 ± 3.4 min. The initial solidification time of combined artificial bone graft (COB) (α-CSH/β-TCP = 9 : 1) was 4.9 ± 1.3 min, and the final solidification time was 13.2 ± 3.5 min. The initial solidification time of COB (α-CSH/β-TCP = 7 : 3) was 6.1 ± 1.4 min, and the final solidification time was 14.3 ± 3.1 min. When the solid-to-liquid ratio was 1 g : 0.2 mL, the initial solidification time of COB (α-CSH/β-TCP = 5 : 5) was 4.6 ± 1.3 min, and the final solidification time was 13.1 ± 2.9 min. The initial solidification time of COB (α-CSH/β-TCP = 3 : 7) was 4.9 ± 1.3 min, and the final solidification time was 14.7 ± 3.4 min. When the solid-to-liquid ratio was 1 g : 0.1 mL, the initial solidification time of COB (CSH/TCP = 1 : 9) was 3.5 ± 0.9 min, and the final solidification time was 12.8 ± 3.1 min.</p>
</sec> 
<sec id="sec21-0885328210391919"><title>Strength</title>
<p>The compressive strength was gradually reduced as the percentage of α-CSH in the composite artificial bone decreased (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0885328210391919">Table A1</xref>). The compressive strength of COB (α-CSH/β-TCP = 3 : 7; 7.32 ± 1.27 MPa) was less than half of the compressive strength of pure α-CSH (18.12 ± 1.13 MPa) 7 days after curing. It is worth noting that the compressive strengths of COB (α-CSH/β-TCP = 1 : 9) at each time point (2.34 ± 0.47 MPa, 2.78 ± 0.56 MPa, 3.02 ± 0.95 MPa, 1d, 3d, and 7d, respectively) were lower than the compressive strength of the pure β-TCP material (4.47 ± 0.63 MPa), and the differences were statistically significant (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05).
