<p>The ‘Legal Process Theory’ emerged in the 1950s as an alternative to legal formalism and legal realism in American legal thought. It saw its basic formulation in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0964663912463631a">Wechsler and Hart’s (1953)</xref> <italic>The Federal Courts and the Federal System</italic> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0964663912463631a">Sacks and Hart’s (1958)</xref> <italic>The Legal Process</italic>. The fundamental assumption of this theory was its view of the nature of reality as one of the continuous changes rather than stability. Broadly speaking, the theory of interests included processes involved in law-making and legal decision-making, institutional distribution of legal authority, the connection between adjudication, legal reasoning and law-making as well as social foundation of law. <italic>Rethinking Law as Process: Creativity, Novelty, Change </italic>falls squarely within this tradition in that it shares its basic interests and emphasizes the ontological priority of change over stability.</p>
<p>The particular focus of the volume is ‘the problem of finding justifying reasons for legal decisions in hard cases’ (p. 2). The volume contains four parts. In Part I, the author points to legal debates surrounding the surgical separation of a pair of Maltese conjoined twins in England as an example of such hard legal cases, in that there was no legal precedent in English law on this issue and no other law applied directly. In such cases, the author wonders, how the judges’ decisions are achieved. On what grounds they are justified? In this regard, the author points to the key shortcoming of the existing legal discourses: their abstract, dualistic view of legal reasoning that separates decision-making from lived experiences of decision-makers and their situational practices. The author argues that this shortcoming is due to their anchorage in conceptual frameworks derived from static, mechanistic views of reality that forces them to forge concepts poised to arrest and classify reality instead of capturing its fluidity. This, in turn, results in legal concepts that portray decision-makers as unaffected by fluid situational, emotional and interpretive demands. As such, they fail to capture and convey the full spectrum of continuous human interaction and interpretation that render the legal decision-making a <italic>process</italic> involving countless number of influences and adjustments and, instead, portray it as a momentary act of a lone decision-maker. Therefore, extant discourses’ attempt to offer justifying reasons for legal decisions register only at the level of explanation:
<disp-quote>
<p>This ‘justification’ explains and describes the effect of the decision on the legal system and on the parties involved; however, it does not admit us into the experience of how and the why and by what means the decision was actually achieved… (p. 173–174).</p>
</disp-quote>
As examples of such existing discourses, the author mentions Neil MacCormick and Ota Weinberger’s ‘institutional’ approach, the ‘discursive turn’ that views institutional approach as a special case of practical discourse, Michael Detmold’s ‘natural’ approach, Bernard Jackson’s ‘narrative structure’ perspective, American Legal Realism and certain strands of Critical Legal Studies such as feminist jurisprudence.</p>
<p>In Part II, the author provides the contours of an alternative perspective derived from a variety of sources. One is the Whiteheadian tradition of process thought. This is the most novel aspect of the book. While there have been noteworthy developments in the application of Whitehead’s philosophy in a number of disciplines, little notice has been taken of it in legal thought. Whitehead redrew attention away from the rationalistic and mechanistic assumptions of Newtonian thought, with its tendency to seize and classify reality toward the fundamentally undividable stream of human experience. Other sources informing the author’s theoretical framework are Gilles Deleuze’s concept of ‘rhizomic’ communication, Henri Bergson’s notion of ‘creative evolution’, Michael Polani’s concept of ‘tacit’ knowledge and Edward Levi’s views on legal reasoning and courts. He also draws upon recent developments in organization theory, which enables him to avert dualistic thinking and bridge the gap between legal theory and practice. This means refocusing of attention from <italic>organizations</italic>’ influences toward <italic>organizing</italic> practices and their consequences for legal thought and practice.</p>
<p>Deriving from the constructionist approach developed by organization studies, which emphasizes the connection between individual knowledge, organizational knowledge, and human action undertaken within organized contexts, Part III describes how the different, and often contradictory, types of legal knowledge permeate legal institutions and how they result in contradictory processes and institutional features. It points to the important role of legal actors and decision-makers in this regard. The key role is that of the judges’. The author also borrows the theories of complexity and chaos in order to further explain these processes.</p>
<p>In Part IV, the author brings arguments of the volume to a conclusion by showing the creative potentials of processual thinking in bridging the gap between legal reasoning and reality. Social reality is a stream of lived experiences and activities of individuals. Legal reasoning must come to see itself as a part of this broader reality. It must acknowledge that its abstract concepts are only historically specific views of reality. In other words, they are temporary crystallizations of experiences, interests, beliefs and personal decisions of legal agents (judges, prosecutors, juries, etc.) and not mirror images of some objective and eternal reality. As reality changes, so must they. The author attaches key importance to the adoption of this view of reality specifically as it relates to judges since they need to pay just as much attention to particulars of a case as to the abstract legal rules.</p>
<p>This is a sophisticated, engrossing and meticulously written volume from beginning to the end. Reading it requires a rather detailed knowledge of a number of key issues in ethical, legal and philosophical thought. Its complexity is due to its eclecticism, which opens it to a number of questions and doubts regarding compatibility of its philosophical sources and, therefore, the validity of its theoretical conclusions. <italic>Deleuze, Whitehead, Bergson: Rhizomatic Connections</italic> by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0964663912463631a">Robinson (2008</xref>) can help potential readers with some such concerns. As far as the public appeal of the book is concerned, being very sophisticated may ultimately prove to be its main handicap. For the most part, a graduate-level (maybe even higher) knowledge of the subject matters discussed is required. This makes it unsuitable as an introductory textbook. On the whole, however, it is an absorbing book that enormously enriches the existing knowledge of the legal field and challenges many of its fundamental concepts.</p>
