<p>‘Six decades after the end of World War II, it is still difficult for historians to accept that many Germans actually experienced this era as positive and apolitical’, writes Jana Bruns. Entertainment, in particular film, in her view, was one means whereby the Nazis influenced opinion. This leads her to examine three Third Reich female film stars: Hungarian-born dancer and singer Marika Rökk, sultry Swedish singer and actress Zarah Leander, who returned to Sweden in 1943, and another Swedish-born actress, Kristina Söderbaum, who married the director Veit Harlan. Söderbaum took a leading role in the egregious <italic>Jud Süss</italic> (1940), the film for which her husband was tried in 1949 and 1950 for Crimes against Humanity and acquitted. Rökk is discussed under the heading ‘The Queen of Revue Films’; Leander under ‘The Eternal Feminine’ and Söderbaum under ‘The Disobedient Maiden’.</p>
<p>Mass entertainment, and in particular film, Bruns contends in her agreeably jargon-free study, was one means whereby the Nazis managed to create a ‘false impression’ as well as ‘illusions’. Film stars, especially female, could provide a means of ‘indoctrination’, even if their powers of seduction whether on screen or off (the latter through fan clubs) often contradicted Nazi ideas about the place of women in the scheme of things. By combining literary theory with historical analysis Bruns claims to offer ‘new insights into the design and operation of gender ideology in the Third Reich’ (9) and thereby a fuller understanding of Nazi culture. Though literary scholars provide some insights, they neglect the context, while historians, who explore institutional, political and social milieus, in her view, can benefit from the ‘nuanced picture of textual significance’ provided by practitioners of Film Studies. This is a study at the edge, so to speak, of the historical discipline.</p>
<p>What can one learn by concentrating on the careers and popularity of just three film stars, whose careers do not fully span the 12-year period of the Third Reich: Rökk from 1935 to 1945; Leander from 1937 to 1943 and Söderbaum from 1937 to 1945? Does this study fall between two stools? Unfortunately, the answer is yes. The first chapter, dealing with ‘the institutional background’, provides a useful historical survey of the German film industry between 1933 and 1945: how the industry began working with the state; the new system of censorship; and finally the nationalization of the industry during the war when <italic>Ufi</italic> replaced <italic>Ufa</italic> and other film companies. Three chapters on the film stars are followed by a very brief conclusion.</p>
<p>Does the Hungarian-born and not very talented Rökk, who found work in a ‘cleansed’ industry, to become the star of the German revue film for which she was very well paid, merit examination? Pushing at the boundaries of prescribed feminine behaviour, verging at times on ‘deviant’, but safely dismissed as ‘Hungarian’ or ‘un-German’, she also managed to keep audiences happy, even if some Nazi radicals objected to ‘over-foreignization’ (73). Without offering much evidence, Bruns concludes that the popularity of her films helped sustain the Third Reich, by providing a form of escapism, often at odds with Nazi teachings and even with the conduct of the war itself.</p>
<p>Leander, on the other hand, did not remain in Germany to the bitter end. An earlier view suggested she was apolitical, though film scholars have found traces of Nazi antifeminism in her work. Bruns examines her more ‘openly political films’, pointing out that on screen Leander never sacrificed herself for <italic>Volk</italic> or Fatherland though did so for lover or child (113). Söderbaum, another Swede, did remain in Germany, given her marriage to Harlan. In <italic>Jud Süss</italic>, after which her husband became the Third Reich’s leading director, she played the victim of the Jewish courtier and would continue to play the sacrificial victim in his subsequent films.</p>
<p>Much has already been written about these stars and the major films, more often by non-historians than historians. Bruns has little new to offer. Her bibliography suggests extensive archival research, but too often she relies on the work of what practitioners of Film Studies have previously written about individual films. She makes some errors: <italic>Jud Süss</italic> did not lose to an Italian film at the Venice film festival but to another German film in the foreign film category; nor did it appear after <italic>Der ewige Jude</italic>; and the American audiences ‘smitten’ with the Leander film <italic>Heimat</italic> were German speakers since in the US German films were only screened in a few small German-language cinemas. These are minor errors but ones which reflect an obvious weakness in a study based on a PhD dissertation which often comes closer to Film Studies than history.</p>
