<p>Dan Breznitz, in <italic>Innovation and the State: Political Choice and Strategies for Growth in Israel, Taiwan, and Ireland</italic>, presents a powerful and persuasive explanation of how emerging markets can become major players in the global information technology (IT) sector in spite of domestic constraints and limited resources.</p>
<p>Breznitz’s argument, in a nutshell, is that globalized and fragmented knowledge-based IT production networks created windows of opportunity for small enterprising IT firms in Israel, Ireland, and Taiwan. Relying on hundreds of interviews, official government documents, and an extensive literature review, Breznitz presents an intricate argument that addresses both how peripheral countries can participate in the global IT production structure and why they succeeded in spite of selecting different strategies. Arguing against neoliberal as well as developmental statist theories, Breznitz singles out the choices made by state agencies that fostered different patterns of interaction among multinational corporations, the private sector, and innovative technologies.</p>
<p>Israel, Ireland, and Taiwan were relatively underdeveloped until the 1980s, especially compared to their neighbors (Europe, the United Kingdom, and Japan). The three countries also coped with considerable diplomatic and political challenges because of their geopolitical situation. Moreover, all three gained independence after a long and difficult struggle, and their existence was questioned by larger, more powerful neighbors. Accordingly, the early generation of political leaders viewed economic development as a tool not only to improve the quality of life of their citizens but also as a test to demonstrate to themselves and the rest of the world that they belonged to the community of sovereign nation-states.</p>
<p>The private sector in all three countries was underdeveloped and politically weak. Israel had a substantial state-owned sector, alongside small private firms. Taiwan blocked the growth of Korean-type <italic>chaebols</italic> and was suspicious of the concentration of capital. Ireland sought to liberate itself from national autarkic policies and did not care much for its own manufacturing base. Since all three countries possessed a private sector dominated by small firms, they could not mobilize the skills and resources to oversee R&amp;D intense IT expansion. Therefore, state policies mattered as state institutions constituted the only agent capable of overcoming the fragmentation of the private sector and of aggregating resources to jump-start the expansion of innovation-based export sectors.</p>
<p>Israeli firms succeeded in IT software as well as hardware. Israeli firms supplied high end new technologies that in some cases have generated international standards (Check Point Software Technologies [IT security solutions]). Taiwanese companies excelled in improving product design and manufacturing technology and produced integrated circuit chips based on the design of other companies (MediaTek [fabless semiconductor company]). Irish firms were not active in the hardware sector but were integrated into the globalized production structure organized by U.S firms such as Dell and Microsoft. How does Breznitz account for the fact that they acquired different expertise within the globalized IT industry?</p>
<p>In a brilliant analysis, he makes the persuasive case that choices matter; state officials made decisions that led to different areas of expertise and success. First, state agencies in the three countries pursued different paths to acquire the necessary know-how and skills to steer the private sector; as a result, in some cases state institutions dominated the area of R&amp;D and in others they did not. The second choice or variable he highlights is how state officials decide to raise funds to develop R&amp;D. The third decision faced by state officials centers on whether to select a national champion or not. Finally, state agencies may decide to court foreign investors and encourage joint ventures with international corporations.</p>
<p>What does that mean in terms of actual economic decisions and policy choices? Breznitz claims that the three countries possessed different state traditions and priorities and that this accounts for why they evolved different links with the globalized IT sector. The different configurations reflect the particular biases and capabilities of the state administration. Ireland developed an English-style bureaucracy in which managerial bureaucrats dominated. After a miserable period of extreme national autarky, state leaders became obsessed with job creation. Lacking faith in the domestic private sector, they enticed U.S. multinationals to shift service and production facilities to Ireland, which would bring jobs to Ireland. At the same time, Irish officials were less interested in nurturing a domestic base of high-level R&amp;D centers, and domestic industry had limited influence over state policies and development agencies.</p>
<p>Taiwan fits the East Asian model in which bureaucrats tend to be recruited from a few institutions of higher education and come with strong engineering backgrounds. Taiwanese leaders worried about political isolation and encouraged local industry to be a strategic supplier and partner to U.S. multinational corporations. But they did not want to encourage the growth of large economic conglomerates, which could challenge the dominance of the <italic>Kuomintang</italic>. Therefore, the Taiwanese state was a major player in industrial R&amp;D, pulling science and technology expertise into the bureaucracy and relying on public research institutions to stimulate the growth of the IT sector. This top-down model was suited to promoting both knowledge and skill acquisition in hardware sectors, whereas national control allowed the hardware sector to flourish with a variety of firm sizes. But Taiwan suffered from weak software and venture capital sectors since Taiwanese state officials exercised substantial financial and political control over R&amp;D. Officials diffused the R&amp;D into the market through specific alliances with private firms, which focused on second-generation, process, and manufacturing innovation. However, Taiwan is weak in new product development and original new product R&amp;D.</p>
<p>Israel presents a third model, again reflecting the choices and preferences of state agencies and the political leadership. The Israeli bureaucracy maintained strong links with different scientific and economic actors in society. It was common for scientists (and high-tech entrepreneurs) to move back and forth from the private to the state sector. The Israeli political leadership in the 1970s decided that the country’s future rested with a science-based industry. The goal became to improve the environment that would stimulate the development of new knowledge-based products and technologies. At the same time, there was no particular preference for keeping national control over the expansion of innovation, and many U.S. IT companies were encouraged to open R&amp;D centers in Israel and to buy Israeli start-up firms. Leading to the acquisition of the label Start-up Nation, Israeli companies have been at the forefront of innovative hardware and software market niches. The Israeli state, however, mostly focused on promoting cutting-edge R&amp;D capabilities, and funds went into creating new R&amp;D-based products. Government agencies encouraged cross-linkages among academia, defense, and the private sector, while encouraging the latter to diversify in technology-intense products. Since state agencies were primarily targeting R&amp;D activities and innovation, more mature start-ups could find neither the funding nor the managerial skills to grow into true leaders and remain under Israeli ownership. Therefore, many Israeli firms were eventually acquired by foreign (U.S.) investors.</p>
<p>In short, <italic>Innovation and the State</italic> shows that politics matter. Its evidence that different states (and actors within states) in fact make different choices and that these choices matter is convincing.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, there are a few quibbles one can raise. First, the Irish miracle was mostly the result of a friendly tax regime and light financial regulation. It also appealed to U.S. pharmaceutical companies, which relocated to Ireland, and Ireland’s growth owed more to U.S. expansion, EU structural funds, and increased labor force participation rates than a deliberate economic strategy (Breznitz would partly agree with that statement). Certainly, the choice not to regulate produced one of the world’s biggest housing booms (more than 500% between 1994 and 2006), and reckless lending by banks brought about a bailout of $113 billion orchestrated by the International Monetary Fund and the EU. In the end, the boom years were largely squandered, and Irish GDP and per capita income have dramatically shrunk.</p>
<p>A similar point can be raised about Israel. The still vibrant Israeli IT sector has not lifted the rest of the economy, and poverty rates are twice the average of other developed countries (according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development), and the gap between the wealthy and the rest of society has widened. Although Israel did not cope with a financial meltdown, waves of mass protests in summer 2011 suggest that the success of the IT sector has not translated into improved opportunities for the rest of society.</p>
<p>The second observation therefore is that Breznitz refers to the political choices made by development agencies led by highly educated, industry-specific personnel occupying key positions of the bureaucracy. However, the state consists of numerous (and competing) actors and is also embedded in a political system with competitive elections (Israel and Ireland). Who decides how to share the fruits of success with other societal groups and economic sectors? It could be that state officials prevailed in the 1970s and 1980s because of the particular geopolitical circumstances of that era and the relative underdevelopment of the national economy. Politicians were willing to give room to state agencies to carve out a development strategy. Once the strategy yielded success, state officials lost influence and politicians stepped in to decide how to use this wealth. Perhaps their decisions may have been less than optimal, for both society and other economic sectors.</p>
<p>Of course, these are political issues that should go into another (future) research project. For now, Dan Breznitz has given us plenty of material that will assist future scholars in examining how the success of a global IT sector influences domestic politics and wealth redistribution. I have no doubt that this book is required reading for anybody interested in public policy, technology policy, and the rise of emerging markets.</p>
