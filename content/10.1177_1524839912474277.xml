<abstract>
<p>Despite a wealth of intervention research in cancer control, full integration of evidence-based interventions into practice often fails, at least in part because of inadequate collaboration between practitioners and researchers. The National Cancer Institute piloted a mentorship program designed for practitioners to improve their ability to navigate evidence-based decision making within a context of inadequate resources, political barriers, and organizational constraints. The National Cancer Institute simultaneously sought to provide opportunities for practitioners and researchers to share and learn from each other. We identified four key successes and challenges related to translation as experienced by mentees: (a) establishing and maintaining partnerships, (b) data collection and analysis, (c) navigating context, and (d) program adaptation and evaluation. Mentorship programs have the potential to facilitate increased and more successful integration of evidence-based interventions into practice by promoting and building the capacity for collaborative decision making and generating in-depth understanding of the translation barriers and successes as well as strategies to address the complex contextual issues relative to implementation.</p>

<title>Background</title>
<p>Even with tremendous growth in scientific evidence about effective prevention and treatment of cancer, a substantial divide between research and practice still exists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1524839912474277">Emmons, Viswanath, &amp; Colditz, 2008</xref>). Evidence-based interventions (EBIs) to address cancer prevention and control often fail to be integrated fully into practice and do not capitalize on the collaboration between practitioners and researchers across organizational settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1524839912474277">Stetler, Mittman, &amp; Francis, 2008</xref>). To date, practitioners’ attempts to integrate EBIs for cancer prevention and control into routine practice (e.g., training curriculums, minigrants, and partnership programs) have been met with limited success (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1524839912474277">Dreisinger et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1524839912474277">Escoffery, Carvalho, &amp; Kegler, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1524839912474277">Honeycutt, Carvalho, Glanz, Daniel, &amp; Kegler, 2012</xref>). Contextual complexities inherent to research translation, including program adaptation, local resources, implementation settings, and practitioner expertise, help account for these findings. One of the factors central to effective collaborative decision making that may help practitioners address these challenges is enhancing practitioner expertise/skills and other resources for evidence-based public health (EBPH; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1524839912474277">Brownson, Fielding, &amp; Maylahn, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1524839912474277">Jacobs, Jones, Gabella, Spring, &amp; Brownson, 2012</xref>). In turn, strategies are needed to build these skills and knowledge. Mentorship programs show great promise as an effective means to address this factor and to help close the gap between research and practice.</p>
<p>A literature review conducted by the authors showed that mentorship programs have been effective in promoting evidence-based medicine in clinical practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1524839912474277">Mascola, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1524839912474277">Wallen et al., 2010</xref>) as well as in limited areas of public health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1524839912474277">Alpert &amp; Bettmann, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1524839912474277">Lengerich et al., 2003</xref>). However, although the review identified tools and trainings for public health practitioners on EBPH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1524839912474277">Jacobs et al., 2012</xref>), it did not identify any existing mentorship programs specific to this public health audience around the competencies needed for translation of EBIs to address cancer control and prevention. This presents a unique opportunity to explore mentorship programs as a strategy to improve skills and capacity within the public health workforce and to assist with navigating the complex context involved with translating research into public health practice. Moreover, there is an opportunity to inform future research and practice through the creation of an environment in which engagement and sharing between researchers and practitioners nurtures a mutual understanding of the complex social, economic, and cultural contexts, where intervention implementation occurs. This dialogue is a necessary step to address the gap between cancer control research and practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1524839912474277">Rivera &amp; Birnbaum, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>This article describes the development of a mentorship program designed to build both the capacity of public health professionals and a dialogue around translation of EBIs. We share key lessons from the mentees’ perspective around implementing EBIs in real-world settings and discuss implications for both research and practice.</p>

<title>The R2R Mentorship Program Approach</title>
<p>In September 2011, the National Cancer Institute (NCI) launched the Research to Reality (R2R) Mentorship Program (hereafter referred to as the Program). It was an 18-month program with six participating mentor–mentee pairs and was designed in conjunction with the R2R Community of Practice (CoP) website (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://researchtoreality.cancer.gov">https://researchtoreality.cancer.gov</ext-link>). The R2R CoP is intended to provide a platform to engage researchers and practitioners in dialogue through discussion forums, monthly cyber seminars, featured partners, as well as the Mentorship Program, and is one component of the Cancer Control P.L.A.N.E.T. (Plan, Link, Act, Network, with Evidence-based Tools) web portal (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ccplanet.cancer.gov">http://ccplanet.cancer.gov</ext-link>). The Program’s primary focus was to improve the skills of practitioners to navigate within the complex real-world settings in which evidence-based decision making occurs. Simultaneously, the goal was to facilitate discussions and mutual learning between researchers and practitioners.</p>
<sec id="section3-1524839912474277">
<title>Theoretical Framework, Program Components, and EBPH Competencies</title>
<p>Grounded in adult learning and experiential learning theories, and based on a review of mentorship program strategies and components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1524839912474277">Alpert &amp; Bettmann, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1524839912474277">Lengerich et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1524839912474277">Wallen et al., 2010</xref>), NCI developed the R2R mentorship model. From a comparison of competencies used by relevant evidence-based practice and public health trainings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1524839912474277">Brownson et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1524839912474277">Council on Evidence-Based Behavioral Practice, 2008</xref>) as well as competencies for public health professional organizations, NCI adapted six to be relevant to the goals of the Program and to translation of EBIs (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1524839912474277">Table 1</xref>). Mentees prioritized a minimum of two to work on during the Program.</p>

<p>The Program activities focused on enhancing mentees’ skills and core EBPH competencies to navigate the complex issues of translation through three primary program components: (a) mentorship and mentee projects (proposed by the mentee), (b) training and support, and (c) an online community platform (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1524839912474277">Figure 1</xref>). The mentee project provided an opportunity for experiential learning under the guidance of an experienced mentor. Each mentorship pair developed an individualized mentoring agreement plan, project plan, expected deliverables, and time line. NCI staff coordinated quarterly trainings to enhance mentee skills and competencies broadly related to EBPH. Last, a mentorship workspace on the existing R2R CoP website provided a web platform for mentees and mentors to share experiences, engage with a broader community of practitioners and researchers, and build the dialogue around translation. Mentees posted monthly “stories” highlighting the successes and challenges they encountered and shared useful tools and resources. Additionally, a private workspace on the R2R website provided a platform for peer-to-peer learning through private discussion forums, document sharing, notification, and an event calendar for the mentorship pairs.</p>

<title>Application Process and Participant Selection Criteria</title>
<p>The NCI accepted and reviewed mentee applications to select six participants for the pilot program between May and July 2011. NCI staff identified and selected potential mentors and paired them with appropriate applicants based on the mentee’s proposed project and competency development needs. Mentees and mentors represented a spectrum of organizations (i.e., academic, state and local government, health systems, and cancer centers) and geographic locations throughout the United States.</p>
</sec></sec>
<sec id="section5-1524839912474277">
<title>Experiences from the Field: Dynamics of Integrating Ebis in Action</title>
<p>Mentees worked on a diverse range of projects: adaptation of a sun safety screening program, <italic>Pool Cool</italic>, for implementation in rural Idaho; formative research for the implementation of a training program in a Louisiana public hospital system to increase use of, and adherence to, the 5-As tobacco cessation counseling strategy; adaptation and implementation of a nutrition and physical activity program, <italic>Body and Soul</italic>, in New Jersey faith-based organizations; partnership to provide technical assistance for the adaptation of a cervical cancer screening program, <italic>Con Amor Aprendemos</italic> (With Love We Learn), for African American faith-based communities in urban Georgia; and implementation and evaluation of two colorectal cancer screening client reminder programs with health insurance provider organizations in Montana and Michigan.</p>
<p>Although the mentees’ projects were diverse, throughout the program over a series of informal discussions and surveys they identified similarities in both the successes and challenges encountered while translating evidence into practice. These successes and challenges predominantly related to four areas of translation: (a) establishing and maintaining partnerships, (b) data collection and analysis, (c) navigating the context for implementation, and (d) program adaptation and evaluation. Although these identified areas generally map well to the pilot Program’s a priori competencies, this article focuses on outlining the greatest translation-related successes and challenges experienced by mentees throughout the program. An evaluation of the program’s impact on the competencies of mentees will be conducted separately.</p>
<sec id="section6-1524839912474277">
<title>Building Partnerships</title>
<p>Of the six mentees, four acknowledged success with partnership development; the remaining two did not mention partnership. Half the participants indicated the success of their projects hinged on having community buy-in and support. These partnerships yielded a variety of benefits, including additional program support and tangible program materials/supplies. One mentee established a partnership with an organization that was able to provide additional support to the partnering faith-based organizations in the form of materials for implementation of ongoing nutritional and physical activity education in their communities. A second mentee indicated that an initial project success was the identification of an organization able to participate within the parameters of the project goals and timelines. Although partnerships were integral to implementing EBIs in the community, their cultivation took time to ensure buy-in and a lasting commitment to the project’s development and implementation.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1524839912474277">
<title>Collecting Data</title>
<p>Several mentees stated that the use or development of data collection tools, data management, and analysis contributed to successes in translation of EBIs. Data collection methods affected projects in multiple ways. For some projects, data collection activities facilitated formative research to define community needs. For others, the data collection served as both an evaluation tool and a mechanism to coordinate efforts and inputs from partners. Through data collection, mentor guidance, and stakeholder involvement, one mentee expanded an existing adaptation tool to document changes to the program in various stages of implementation. Additionally, the mentee and stakeholders developed a focus group guide using a method that maximized the amount of feedback collected from community partners to inform adaptation of a cervical cancer program. Another mentee adapted effective survey tools used to assess practices and beliefs of clinicians regarding tobacco use in order to shed light on the later adaptation and implementation of a training program.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1524839912474277">
<title>Navigating Context</title>
<p>Mentees identified organizational and political contexts as central to project implementation, both as a barrier and as a facilitator. For two, the Affordable Care Act’s inclusion of preventive services created a supportive climate for implementation of the colorectal cancer screening projects. On a more local level, organizational support of EBIs by the mentees’ organizations and funders contributed to the focus on EBIs and improved translation. Complex contextual factors, however, also contributed to the unintended barriers and delays in moving EBIs into practice. Delays resulted from required organizational processes (i.e., institutional review board, establishing vendor contracts), slow submission of data from partners for tracking and evaluation purposes, illness, and staff changes. For at least two mentees, significant delays in project implementation also resulted from the longer than anticipated time required to identify and gain buy-in from community partners. However, the additional time needed ultimately allowed for the identification of organizations and partners that best fit the respective programs.</p>
<p>Other challenges included participant recruitment, attrition, and program sustainability. For one mentee, whose program is volunteer run, barriers experienced involved maintaining attendance at trainings and support from the faith leaders, as well as planning for program sustainability when the stipends, included in the intervention pilot, may no longer be available.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1524839912474277">
<title>Adapting and Evaluating Interventions</title>
<p>Several mentees identified program and evaluation planning as critical to success. For two, adaptation of existing interventions and materials were central to their projects and to successful implementation. Using adaptation guidelines, in conjunction with mentor guidance and ongoing community partner engagement, one mentee tailored sun safety education materials to the specific needs of the community partner. Two mentees used a tool, MIYO (Make It Your Own; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://miyo.gwb.wustl.edu/about.php">http://miyo.gwb.wustl.edu/about.php</ext-link>), allowing community partners to adapt existing materials in order to incorporate culturally appropriate language, images, and messaging specific to the partner organization while maintaining the inherent message. The willingness and ability to adapt materials with partners were also seen as essential to gaining buy-in from them.</p>
<p>Mentees also identified the development of an evaluation plan as instrumental to their success of identifying short- and long-term program outcomes. However, some mentees indicated that the limited availability of evaluation plans or instruments from the original intervention study proved challenging. One mentee found that although significant information surrounding efficacy trials for their topic existed, limited research on long-term program evaluation was available for program implementation and sustainability for low-resource community organizations. Other mentees had similar difficulty locating implementation guides or evaluation plans of EBIs and strategies.</p>

<title>Implications for Practice and Research</title>
<p>This article reports on the mentorship model used in the R2R Mentorship Program and the resulting challenges and successes learned by the mentees in translating EBIs to inform future research and practice. The R2R Mentorship approach piloted a model to not only build the capacity of the mentees in implementing EBIs but also expand knowledge and understanding surrounding the translation of EBIs in cancer control and prevention.</p>
<p>The experiences, barriers, and successes mentees reported are similar to those identified in previous studies examining factors related to translation of research to practice in public health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1524839912474277">Dodson, Baker, &amp; Brownson, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1524839912474277">Emmons et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1524839912474277">Honeycutt et al., 2012</xref>). The mentees’ experiences underscore that replicating EBI requires basic program planning skills alongside opportunities to enhance professional capacities. There is an ever-increasing number of EBIs, but there is a lack of guidance or training programs that focus on integrating these into local settings. As the mentees came to realize, adopting and implementing EBIs take substantial time to conduct a systematic program planning process and to engage stakeholders and partners, but both are essential for translating research. When pushing to address critical local cancer control issues, it is important to allow for time to develop needed partnerships, understand the context in which the intervention will be delivered, and account for changes and unintended barriers when translating EBIs into practice. Taking the time to establish strong partnerships, adaptation, implementation, and evaluation tools contributed to stronger local relevance and presumably more effective interventions.</p>
<p>Given the mentees’ barriers with limited availability of interventions resources, there is also a need for the intervention developers to share implementation materials (i.e., implementation, adaptation and evaluation protocols, time lines, logic models, costs) and give greater consideration to factors of external validity in study design that address applicability, and implementation in, complex community settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1524839912474277">Green &amp; Glasgow, 2006</xref>). In turn, practitioners also have an obligation to expand the evidence base by sharing evaluation plans and outcomes, program adaptation, and what worked and, equally important, what did not work. In addition to training and technical assistance programs, such as the mentorship program, we also view the increased availability and use of resources, such as Cancer Control P.L.A.N.E.T. and R2R, as partial solutions to improving translations of EBIs in cancer control and prevention. These platforms offer an opportunity to share EBIs and implementation materials and bidirectional discussions between research and practice. This mutual learning is not only about moving research to reality but also about reality to research.</p>
<p>Although the research translation experiences reported in this article is limited to six mentees, they suggest that key components of the Program’s logic model were implemented as intended to help understand and enhance the translation bridge. The project component of the model, as well as the training and support component, contributed to many identified successes. Mentees also indicated that through the Program, they were better prepared and able to address contextual challenges that arose. The initial qualitative findings shared here suggest that EBPH competencies can be supported by mentoring programs; however, contextual factors that affect successful implementation require further investigation. Additional evaluation of the online community platform of this Program will help understand peer-to-peer dialogue regarding research translation via Web 2.0 platforms that can potentially increase program reach. Thorough long-term or continued evaluation of other aspects of the program, including changes in mentees’ EBPH competency, program delivery, and use of evidence-based resources, will be conducted and will inform future adaptations to this mentorship model.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Mentoring programs have the potential to facilitate increased utilization and fuller integration of evidence-based cancer control interventions into practice by promoting collaborative decision making for addressing complex contextual issues. The R2R Mentorship Program offers a capacity-building model in which we can learn more about the challenges and facilitators of translation, enhance the skills and knowledge of cancer control practitioners, and promote dialogue around translation. Mentorship programs, as a strategy for research translation, are an understudied area with potential to inform innovative research and practice-based evidence in cancer prevention and control.</p>
