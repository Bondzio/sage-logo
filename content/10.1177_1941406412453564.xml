<title>Breastfeeding disparities are frequently reported between different racial/ethnic groups across all parameters: initiation of breastfeeding, exclusive breastfeeding for 6 months and breastfeeding for 1 year. Based on your experience and practice, discuss two barriers that you have identified in these at risk populations</title>
<speech>
<speaker>Geraghty:</speaker>
<p>One opportunity in which we can help overcome racial/ethnic disparities is by helping a mother consider breastfeeding before her baby is born. The prenatal period is where mothers decide that they are going to breastfeed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1941406412453564">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1941406412453564"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1941406412453564"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1941406412453564">4</xref></sup> Mothers talk to their family and societal support network about their infant feeding choices. It stands to reason, therefore, that if a pregnant woman does not know anyone who has breastfed or seen any women breastfeed, then she is unlikely to choose breastfeeding for herself.</p>
<p>Prenatal breastfeeding classes are primarily geared toward women who have made the choice to breastfeed, otherwise there would be no reason for them to attend. However, the infants of low-income women who do attend prenatal breastfeeding classes are fed supplemental formula less often in the initial postpartum period.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1941406412453564">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1941406412453564"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1941406412453564">7</xref></sup> Women who were not in the category of “usual breastfeeders” were assisted in making the decision to at least initiate breastfeeding if they worked with a lactation consultant<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1941406412453564">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1941406412453564">9</xref></sup> or counselors within the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1941406412453564">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1941406412453564">11</xref></sup> Prenatal visits with physicians also have been shown to have beneficial effects on breastfeeding and a variety of health outcomes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1941406412453564">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>Improving the success rate of breastfeeding requires the constant effort on the part of all health professionals and advocates. A mother should not be considered a “formula feeder” indefinitely just because she did not breastfeed an older child. A mother coming to any general pediatric or obstetric practice will have contact with the office with subsequent pregnancies and during that prenatal period is when her questions or concerns about breastfeeding should ideally be addressed.</p>
<p>In our outpatient Breastfeeding Medicine Clinic we see mother–baby dyads, thus every mother who comes to see us has made the decision to breastfeed her current baby. Often the mothers have challenging problems breastfeeding and are quick to say, “I am never going to do this again.” We strongly urge mothers not to think that far into the future and feel negatively about breastfeeding in general since every experience is different. We do recommend a proactive approach with subsequent pregnancies and encourage mothers to try to see us before problems occur so we can prevent them from becoming worse.</p>
<p>Along with this prenatal education, there must be consideration as to the health literacy of the patient population. It has been shown that lower income mothers often do not have the ability to understand written materials on health-related topics for their children.<sup>13-19</sup> Breastfeeding materials for low-income, minority women and their families must be designed for them and culturally sensitive to the population.</p>

<p>Overall low breastfeeding rates are strongly negatively associated with color and social and economic class in the United States. Disempowerment is pervasive among poor women of color; even when they know why and how they should breastfeed exclusively, they are often unable to advocate for their rights in health care facilities with practices that systematically override the mother’s verbalized desire to breastfeed. This simultaneously erodes her ability to produce breast milk. Poverty, lack of support, fear of “making waves,” or rocking the status quo add to the helplessness felt by the mothers. This leads to so many women being thwarted in what they wanted to do: breastfeed their baby for at least a few months.</p>
<p>Sometimes mothers may not know enough about what is at stake when they reach for a can of formula. Mothers across the spectrum want the best outcomes for their babies; however, the very reasons that their rich white counterparts in the corporate world are breastfeeding exclusively for at least the AAP (American Academy of Pediatrics) recommended 6 months is because the latter have read the scientific reports and understand that exclusive breastfeeding can make a huge difference in their own and their child’s short- and long-term health and life achievement.</p>
<p>The very low rates of exclusive breastfeeding at birth, 1, 2, 4, and 6 months in WIC populations must be seen as an issue of social justice. The children that need the protection afforded by breast milk, against morbidity and mortality, the most, are afforded it the least. In a country grappling with runaway health care costs it is about time we realized that exclusive breastfeeding is an investment whose time has come. In her study, “The Burden of Suboptimal Breastfeeding in the United States: A Pediatric Cost Analysis” (2010), Dr. Melissa Bartick showed that if 90% of US families could comply with medical recommendations to breastfeed exclusively for 6 months, the United States would save $13 billion per year and prevent an excess of 911 deaths, nearly all of which would be in infants.</p>

<p>One barrier that is often overlooked is the lack of education of and support from the people who are closest to the breastfeeding mother. This may include the father of the baby, grandparents, and friends. Though breastfeeding is the most natural way to feed an infant, it requires a mother to be rested, well nourished, and to have the energy to connect with the infant while breastfeeding as well as at other times. Among “at-risk” populations, families are often struggling with needing to return to work to provide for the family, needing both incomes, or are a single parent with multiple children. Fortunately, those mothers (and families) who realize the many benefits of breastfeeding have a greater likelihood of “pushing through,” asking for, and receiving help. However, without programs and health care providers that offer culturally relevant and easily accessible services, these “at-risk” populations will continue to have lower breastfeeding rates.</p>
<p>Another barrier to breastfeeding is an overall feeling of what I have frequently referred to as a “microwave consciousness.” We live in a time in which quick is best and desired … food, cars, information, money, and even taking care of those things that matter most. Breastfeeding takes time and patience and it requires coordinating with others to make sure that other responsibilities are taken care of. This, of course, requires everyone around the breastfeeding mother to slow down, even though they may need to get more accomplished in less time, as they assume some the tasks that the new mother would typically have handled. Though WIC supports breastfeeding and is a very valuable program, the mere knowledge that food and formula is provided becomes attractive to some families because it seems easier to give formula, is less time consuming, and free. Commercials have an influence, especially on those mothers who may be struggling with breastfeeding, such that the idea of formula, despite their knowledge that “the breast is best,” becomes increasingly attractive as a solution to reduce their stress and perhaps, increase the amount of sleep they are getting. When the media has more breastfeeding commercials than formula commercials, we may see an increase in breastfeeding across all cultures.</p>
<p>Another related societal flaw is the growing attitude of pregnancy and all things related to it (i.e. birth, breastfeeding) as a medical process. As stated earlier, women’s bodies were designed to give birth and to nourish the newborn. More empowering messages about the miracle of birth and the body may empower mothers to continue to breastfeed and to look for help when they reach a difficult moment during their breastfeeding experience. Instead of mothers saying, “I tried but I could only do it for 2 weeks,” they may begin to say, “I tried for 2 weeks, I got frustrated, but I knew there had to be a way to continue so I asked for help - and I got it!” .</p>

<title>A recent report indicated that when an agency adopts baby-friendly practices, the racial and ethnic disparities in breastfeeding “disappear.” Describe some of the baby-friendly practices that your agency has implemented to support breastfeeding in at-risk populations</title>
<speech>
<speaker>Geraghty:</speaker>
<p>I am the medical director of the Cincinnati Children’s Center for Breastfeeding Medicine. Our Center is located in a free-standing children’s hospital, thus babies are brought to us when they are sick and in need of medical assistance. Our facility is not able to programmatically meet the ten steps outlined in the Baby-Friendly Hospital Initiative (BFHI).</p>
<p>As part of our Center, we do have an outpatient Breastfeeding Medicine Clinic, in which 3 physician/IBCLCs (International Board Certified Lactation Consultant) and 1 nurse/IBCLC care for patients referred to us.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1941406412453564">20</xref></sup> In a recent analysis of the Infant Feeding Practices Study II, only 32% of mothers met their exclusive breastfeeding goals.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1941406412453564">21</xref></sup> Even among women experiencing 6 of the 10 steps outlined in the Baby-Friendly Hospital Initiative, fewer than half exclusively breastfed as long as they intended.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1941406412453564">21</xref></sup> This means that in all populations of mothers, “at risk” or not, those of us who help lactating mothers must develop ways to improve the success rate of mothers’ breastfeeding intentions.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Saluja:</speaker>
<p>Baby Friendly originated in the context of birthing facilities and the 10 steps of the BFHI, when adopted, do make racial and ethnic disparities in breastfeeding “disappear” (at birth and maybe up to hospital discharge). In the WIC setting, some of the 10 steps are not applicable (eg, steps 4, 6, 7, and 8).</p>
<p>The Public Health Foundation Enterprises (PHFE) WIC program has adopted step 1 (have a written breastfeeding policy that is routinely communicated to all staff), step 2 (train all health care staff in skills necessary to implement this policy), step 3 (inform all pregnant women about the benefits and management of breastfeeding), step 5 (show mothers how to breastfeed and how to maintain lactation, even if they are separated from their infant), step 8 (encourage breastfeeding on demand), and step 10 (foster the establishment of breastfeeding support groups and refer mothers to them on discharge from the hospital or clinic). WIC is deliberate in not showing or talking about infant formula unless the participant asks for it; there is no routine issuance of formula in the first month for breastfeeding mothers and we <italic>are</italic> and have been a significant component of step 10, the community resource component. Many WIC programs support extended breastfeeding by loaning electric breast pumps, free of charge, for women returning to work.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Merchant:</speaker>
<p>I am Vice Chair of the Board of Soul Food for Your Baby which is a program focused on increasing breastfeeding among African Americans. Our programs and outreach efforts are in alignment with baby-friendly practices as outlined in the BFHI. The classes we offer educate and empower mothers and their support persons with an emphasis on “promoting, protecting and supporting” breastfeeding as is the intention of the BFHI. I do not, however, believe that the adoption of baby-friendly practices makes racial and ethnic disparities disappear. because most hospital settings that “at-risk” populations find themselves in tend to be overcrowded and understaffed. However, the adoption of such practices increases the likelihood of service equity. Ethnic “majorities” (people of color), especially if they are of lower socioeconomic levels, continue to have a greater likelihood of receiving less advocacy and support with breastfeeding. I believe that even with “baby-friendly practices” in hospitals, families have to be educated and empowered long before the baby’s birth. They must know they are their own best advocate for ensuring that medical professionals follow their birth plan that should include, but is not limited to <italic>no formula</italic>, put the baby on the mother immediately following the birth—and prior to “cleaning” the baby or bringing a pump to the mother immediately if the baby has to be rushed to the neonatal intensive care unit/pediatric intensive care unit. Also, at-risk populations need to be met with opportunities to breastfeed at their workplaces or extended breaks to allow for pumping.</p>

<title>Racial/ethnic disparities in breastfeeding are attributed to a variety of reasons. Culture, education, economics, and family structure have all been identified as contributors. If you had an opportunity to address one of these issues, which one would you choose and why? What is your agency/organization doing to address the issue you have identified?</title>
<speech>
<speaker>Geraghty:</speaker>
<p>One of the biggest barriers to continuation of breastfeeding for women is the need to return to work. Often at 6 weeks postpartum, women have to leave their infants with another caregiver for 8 to 10 hours a day. By 9 months, almost 60% of women are working.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1941406412453564">22</xref></sup> Employed mothers have lower breastfeeding rates than women who are not employed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1941406412453564">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1941406412453564">24</xref></sup> In fact, women have been shown to wean before going back to work knowing/anticipating that they will have difficulty doing both.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1941406412453564">25</xref></sup></p>
<p>Going back to work is difficult for all mothers, but mothers of lower socioeconomic status have more barriers. To support their families, they often have to go back sooner.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1941406412453564">26</xref></sup> Minority mothers of lower socioeconomic status go back to work at nonmanagerial jobs where they have no support for pumping and storing milk.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1941406412453564">27</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1941406412453564"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1941406412453564">29</xref></sup> Also, central to welfare reform is that recipients are required to be in work-related activities by the time the infant is a few months old.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1941406412453564">30</xref></sup> Racial and ethnic disparities in this country hinder minority mothers from being able to breastfeed even if they wanted to.</p>
<p>Since women often express to us that they have to go back to work even though they would like to stay home, we offer them advice and support on realistic ways to help them continue their breastfeeding goals. There is information to help women to know what pump they need, how to maintain their milk supply while separated from their baby, how to store milk, and then how to feed their baby at the breast when they are home.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1941406412453564">31</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1941406412453564"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1941406412453564"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1941406412453564"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1941406412453564">35</xref></sup> We take a “proactive” approach with mothers and help them think of the barriers they may face and how to overcome them—no matter their job position. Our Center has an information phone line in which lactation consultants talk to mothers as they do go back to work and find they need assistance with ongoing problem-solving. Although minority mothers often face more challenges, they are able to provide breast milk for their infant longer than they thought that they could.</p>

<speaker>Saluja:</speaker>
<p>Knowledge is power; when families are educated about what is at stake when their baby does not get breast milk, when they understand how to advocate for their baby and themselves, they can take action to affect the immediate outcome for themselves and their baby and be successful at exclusively breastfeeding their baby. This indeed impacts the trajectory of their and their baby’s life. Stories resonate in WIC about mothers who succeed with breastfeeding stating that they are more confident as mothers, as women, and as members of society. Breastfeeding their baby is truly empowering for mothers; it is particularly critical for the mothers participating in the WIC program who are disproportionately disenfranchised women of color, likely to be less educated and poor. Educating all WIC moms thoroughly, on what, when, how and how long to breastfeed is just one part. We also have to improve their and the health care provider’s understanding of the physiology of breastfeeding and the adverse effect of supplementation on developing milk supply in the early postpartum period. Knowing how to read a baby’s cues are important for mothers in establishing the frequency of breastfeeding. We encourage mothers to “wear” their baby in the first few weeks, feeding early and often. All these concepts are based on a normative model of breastfeeding that is contrary to what is understood and “accepted” as normal in our bottle-feeding formula filled world.</p>
<p>Nutrition education is a core WIC service as is breastfeeding education and support. The current WIC food benefits heavily incentivize exclusively (fully) breastfeeding mothers and babies by providing supplemental food for the mothers. Prenatally, women get regular doses of breastfeeding education at each WIC visit. Some WIC programs receive Breastfeeding Peer Counselor Program funding and are able to provide enhanced case management services, albeit to a limited number of WIC participants. We teach baby cues, have group discussions, talk about the laws that protect the rights of breastfeeding mothers, give our moms material to read and DVDs to watch. Many WIC programs reach new mothers early in the postpartum period to offer the much needed support. Subsequent WIC visits, along with the availability of breast pumps for working mothers, and the enhanced fully breastfeeding package, provide leverage to the dialogue supporting mothers with extended breastfeeding.</p>
<p>However, pregnant women need to hear these messages from multiple sources besides WIC. Every agency, physician, practice that touches the pregnant woman should be reinforcing the same messages.</p>
<p>We recognize we have a long way to go. WIC mothers live and function in the constraints of living and working environments that are harsh and as yet quite unsupportive of breastfeeding and parenting.</p>
</speech>

<speaker>Merchant:</speaker>
<p>One issue? They all need to be addressed. However, if I have to choose one, today I would choose education. I would want to start educating boys and girls about health and reproduction as early as middle school, if not sooner. This would hopefully influence their relationship behaviors and choices as well as empower them to be proactive about their health and to know how awesome the human body is. Perhaps it would eliminate the false belief that pregnancy and birth are medical processes. Education would be provided about the benefits of breastfeeding to provide inspiration for people to make choices earlier in life that would help them design lives that ensure that the context of their lives supports breastfeeding.</p>
<p>As part of Soul Food for Your Baby, we offer breastfeeding classes focused on the needs of the African American community, specifically related to breastfeeding. Community-based classes on breastfeeding provide up-to-date information and strategies for successful breastfeeding. We work to dispel the myths commonly reported among African Americans that keep them from breastfeeding and/or understanding how breastfeeding benefits not only the baby but also the mother. We encourage the mother-to-be to bring fathers, grandparents, or other supportive person with them to the classes. Our classes are available to all who are interested, regardless of their economic situation.</p>

<title>You have been given an opportunity to create a breastfeeding promotion campaign that targets a specific population. Describe your marketing campaign to recruit participants.

<speech>
<speaker>Geraghty:</speaker>
<p>The population with which I would choose to promote breastfeeding is employers. Until 2010, no federal law provided protection to employed mothers to produce milk while at work. Under the enactment of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, eligible employers are now required to provide “reasonable break time” for lactating employees. However, many employers are unfamiliar with the law and the potential benefits it may provide to them. Some employers may have employees in managerial positions who know the benefits of breastfeeding, but do not know the specific details of what a woman needs to do to maintain her milk supply while separated from her baby.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1941406412453564">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1941406412453564">37</xref></sup> Most workplaces do not have written policies on supporting breastfeeding women.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1941406412453564">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1941406412453564">39</xref></sup></p>

<p>The WIC population lags behind the non-WIC population in the United States in breastfeeding initiation and duration rates, in spite of recent improvements.</p>
<p>In thinking about a breastfeeding promotion campaign for this population, the timing and messaging are of critical importance. We would like to significantly improve the initiation of exclusive breastfeeding and then <italic>maintain</italic> the rates so there isn’t the steep drop off by week 2, often a factor of unnecessary supplementation with formula because moms worry about their ability to make “enough” milk and many receive similar messages from family, friends, and alas even health care providers!</p>
<p>An effective campaign would encompass messages that inspire confidence in the mother’s ability to grow her baby while acknowledging that it’s okay to ask for support. I would propose a campaign stating that “my baby is too special for FOURTH best”; including that the preference for feeding is: mother’s own milk, mother’s pumped milk, banked milk, and THEN infant formula.</p>
<p>Support networks need to be built and made widely available to new mothers. WIC programs offer prenatal support and breastfeeding education. Other health care providers, including the obstetrician, pediatricians and family care doctors, the hospitals, any and all home visitation type programs like Early Head Start, Nurse Family Partnerships, promotora programs, and so forth, can all play important roles in supporting a breastfeeding woman. A lot of these entities and networks exist but they are not all necessarily ON message and often are not building on each other’s strengths to close the safety net.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Merchant:</speaker>
<p>As a member of Soul Food for Your Baby, Inc. (SFYB), the target population of a breastfeeding campaign would be African American women and their families as well as other identified support persons that may include friends, teachers, co-workers, etc. SFYB is designed as a campaign with the objective of educating African American families of the importance of, the protective factors offered, and how to successfully breastfeed. Through education, support groups, engagement of support persons, outreach with and to other organizations, as well as an increasing media presence, SFYB strives to increase breastfeeding among a population described in this discussion as “at-risk.”</p>
<p>It is important that breastfeeding campaigns reach those who are not actually breastfeeding, those who can support the mother in believing that she can do it and/or who provide support that would allow her to be successful. As indicated earlier in this discussion, it is also important to include discussions that empower all people to recognize the natural ability of a woman’s body to reproduce and nourish an infant beginning as early as perhaps middle school health classes or science or physical education. Increased education and awareness on a national level will help to normalize breastfeeding as opposed to it being something that is new and trendy. We are in great need of efforts that raise awareness about how dynamic the body is, not just with respect to breastfeeding but also with respect to one’s ability to engage in activities and to develop habits early in ones life that will serve as protective factors against prematurity and infant mortality, which is disproportionately high for African Americans. Adopting healthier behaviors overall would also serve to reduce the alarming rates of other diseases and illnesses that plague the African American community.</p>
<p>Finally, a campaign that focuses on increasing images of breastfeeding within the media is essential. There are plenty opportunities to represent situations that promote/highlight breastfeeding in a positive context and as an activity that the entire family can have a role in. There are plenty of birth control (pills and condoms) and infant formula commercials, however, there are few, if any commercials or television programming that incorporate pregnant women and/or breastfeeding. While it is apparent that most commercials are designed to sell something, I can’t help but ask where the commitment is from the media and perhaps our nation to do a better job of selling health and wellness? As of 2005, the United States ranked behind 29 other nations in infant mortality, with a rate worse than many European nations, but also behind Singapore, Japan, Israel, New Zealand, Australia, and Cuba.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1941406412453564">49</xref></sup> If we don’t do more to address the infant mortality rate, which would indirectly affect breastfeeding as well, will we have children and mothers to benefit from our breastfeeding campaigns?</p>

<title>As educators, we often tell mothers about the benefits of breastfeeding. Who else do we need to be talking to? What would you like to say?</title>

<speaker>Geraghty:</speaker>
<p>One of the most important groups in which we as breastfeeding educators need to speak to is grandmothers. Grandmothers have a profound influence on mothers and their infant’s feeding-related decisions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1941406412453564">49</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1941406412453564"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1941406412453564"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1941406412453564"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1941406412453564">53</xref></sup> Many grandmothers never experienced breastfeeding their own children. The rates of any breastfeeding in the initial postpartum period was less than 25% during the late 1960s and early 1970s.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1941406412453564">54</xref></sup> While the initiation rates did go up over the next decade, only about a quarter of mothers were still breastfeeding at 6 months.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1941406412453564">54</xref></sup> Grandmothers of today are a “lost generation” related to breastfeeding in the United States.</p>
<p>Since the time in which grandmothers fed their own children, there have been a myriad of advances and new discoveries as to the importance of breastfeeding.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1941406412453564">55</xref></sup> Grandmothers may not know how the science of infant feeding has changed and may not be aware of the information that the new mother is receiving from the many places in which she is receiving her prenatal care and advice. Grandmothers might think that they are being helpful by recommending to a mother that she can just use formula because that is what she fed her daughter (or son) and everything “turned out OK.” This approach, however, may sometimes lead to distress in the mother who is having difficulties when it seems as if the grandmother is implying that she just gives up.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1941406412453564">56</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1941406412453564">57</xref></sup> Grandmothers themselves need advice on how to best support the new mother when breastfeeding.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1941406412453564">58</xref></sup></p>

<p>The following are recommendations that I may provide to a grandmother coming with the mother of her grandchild to our Breastfeeding Medicine Clinic:</p>
<list id="list1-1941406412453564" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Learn all that you can as to the benefits of breastfeeding and the most recent recommendations concerning infant feeding.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>It is better not to bring up the past and the fact that you fed all of your children formula and it was “easier” and “just as good” as breastfeeding.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The mother could use a great deal of help with many other activities in the home (i.e., cooking, cleaning, laundry, caring for other children, etc) so that the mother can concentrate on breastfeeding.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>If the mother is having difficulty, compile a list of local resources in your area whereby you can provide the mother with a list of places to contact if she needs it.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Listen to the mother throughout her struggles and successes related to breastfeeding-sometimes that is all she needs.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>When grandmothers are incorporated into the infant feeding process and feel that they are heard, they can become invaluable partners in the success of a mother’s breastfeeding experience.</p>
<speech>
<speaker>Saluja:</speaker>
<p>The reality is that the education about benefits of breastfeeding no longer needs to be forefront in the discussion. We have already moved on to emphasize risks of not breastfeeding and are now talking about exclusive breastfeeding as the optimal risk reduction strategy. When women verbalize their desire and state their goals of breastfeeding to 3 months or 6 months or even 1 year, we must help them understand the critical importance of getting breastfeeding <italic>established</italic>. There is an urgent need that mothers understand why and how what happens in the first 2 hours, the first 2 days, the first 2 weeks is key to getting to the individual mother’s duration goal.</p>
<p>In the face of mounting incontrovertible evidence about the protective effects of breastfeeding on child and adult obesity, with every month of breastfeeding affording a 4% reduction in childhood obesity, the health care community must throw their unconditional support into helping mothers breastfeed exclusively to at least 6 months. The understanding and therefore commitment to support exclusive breastfeeding varies widely among health care providers. Mothers receive mixed messages along with well-intentioned but damaging formula supplements. The World Health Organization/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention growth charts based on breastfed infant are not widely embraced by doctor’s offices. This leads to inaccurate interpretation of the growth of breastfed infants.</p>
<p>The health care industry responds to standards and measures. What gets measured gets attention. We measure immunization rates at the local and individual doctor’s office level. We need to develop measures for exclusive breastfeeding rates, breastfeeding duration, numbers of referrals to lactation consultants, the use of appropriate growth charts, and so on, in the medical clinics where our patients are seen.</p>
<p>Worksite lactation accommodation policies are in place in the majority of the states across the country and have been written into the affordable health care act. Raising awareness among employers about this law and developing breastfeeding friendly worksites is another critical component for breastfeeding duration. Policy makers have come together to support breastfeeding duration; the next step is a discussion about paid maternity leave.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Merchant:</speaker>
<p>Everyone, whether you are breastfeeding, know someone who is, or are not able to breastfeed, needs to be educated about breastfeeding benefits, how to support the breastfeeding mother, how to transition from breast milk to <italic>healthy food</italic>—vegetables first, <italic>not</italic> formula or cereal, which often lead to other health issues that can be avoided.</p>
<p>It is the increased awareness that will trickle down and through communities such that breastfeeding is as common an activity or topic as recycling.</p>
<p>All persons who advocate for breastfeeding need to be talking about it whenever the topic comes up. When comments are made in casual conversation about infants, breastfeeding, pregnancy, we should not be afraid to ask the question, “Is the mom planning to breastfeed?” This should then be followed with a brief “commercial interruption” that increases the awareness of those within earshot. In general, people are quick and find it easy to talk about random topics for which they have no influence or control. However, with respect to improving the health outcomes of the generations to come as well as those giving birth to them, we actually do have influence, by sharing what we know, with whoever comes our way. If you don’t have the answers, be willing to take the time to connect mothers, fathers, grandmothers, and friends to the supports within the community. It takes all of us who know and honor the gift of mother’s milk to take a stand and to fight for those yet to be born.</p>
