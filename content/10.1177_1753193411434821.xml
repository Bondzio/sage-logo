<p>In this month’s edition of the Journal I want to draw your attention to two particular papers.</p>
<p>The first is “Two year outcomes of Elektra prosthesis for trapeziometacarpal arthritis: a longitudinal cohort study” and the second is “Severe ulnar nerve entrapment at the elbow: functional outcome after minimally invasion in situ decompression”.</p>
<p>In the first paper, for which there is an accompanying podcast, the authors from Spain report their experience of using the Elektra thumb CMC joint prosthesis. They report poor results and do not recommend its use. All too often this sort of information has not been published. Authors have been reticent or embarrassed about publishing their poor results and have simply given up using the implants. That was seen in the UK with use of the LPM implant for PIP joint arthroplasty. Problems only came to light due to the courageous reporting of poor results by one surgeon, Mr Field (one of the experts on the podcast). It is very important that bad results are reported, perhaps even more important than the reporting of good results. If surgeons worldwide had started reporting their concerns about metal on metal hip replacements earlier, then the numerous problems that have occurred may have been reduced if not avoided.</p>
<p>It is inherent in human nature to be attracted to new ideas and new developments. This helps drive progress but also risks clouding our judgement when combined with effective marketing strategies. We need to have the courage to challenge new ideas and perhaps refute them, even at the risk of appearing backward looking.</p>
<p>In the second paper on minimally invasive in situ decompression of severe ulnar entrapment at the elbow, Karthik and co-authors report their experience of ulnar nerve decompression in a difficult group of patients using a very small incision. They report very good results using an incision comparable to the incision used in endoscopic ulnar nerve decompression, which is cited as one of its significant advantage. This does not mean that endoscopic carpal tunnel decompression is wrong or should be abandoned but this paper should help open the debate more widely. There is typically no marketing budget or well-run courses for straightforward tried and tested operations. However, until a new operation/technique is proven to be better, we need to remain cautious for the sake of our patients, not least as the learning curve does not always run smoothly.</p>
<p>One of the leaders in helping us evaluate new techniques is Professor Davis in Nottingham. We are privileged that next month we publish the latest data from his study comparing trapezectomy with trapezectomy and LRTI. This is just the sort of evidence-based medicine that we should rely upon to benefit our patients. Moreover you do not have to wait for your print copy as you can read it online already.</p>
<p>New techniques do not necessarily require radical changes of practice and often simple ideas can be very effective in improving what we do. Included in the short reports this month are two elegant techniques: a technique for exsanguination of the hand, reported by Sammut and Garagnani; and a technique for manipulation of the hand avoiding radiation of the surgeon reported by Rust and ter Linden. We are a scientific journal but we do encourage reports of techniques because hand surgery remains a physical as well as an intellectual challenge. To develop this further we will be publishing a small collection of short reports on techniques in the November edition of 2012.</p>
<p>We encourage full length submissions of scientific studies reporting on techniques but also short reports of simple ideas that can aid daily practice.</p>
<p>I encourage you to submit your ideas and also to comment on what we publish.</p>
