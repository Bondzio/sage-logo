<abstract>
<p>Advances in instruments and visualization tools as well as circulatory systems for cardiopulmonary bypass during the late 1990s have stimulated widespread adoption of minimally invasive mitral valve surgery (MIMVS). Today, MIMVS is the standard approach for many surgeons and institutions. There are multiple benefits of MIMVS. Patient satisfaction and improved cosmesis are important. Additionally, studies have consistently shown faster recovery times and less associated pain with MIMVS. Statistically significant improvement in bleeding, transfusion, incidence of atrial fibrillation, and time to resumption of normal activities with MIMVS has also been shown when comparing MIMVS with conventional mitral surgery. Most important, these benefits have been achieved without sacrificing perioperative safety or durability of surgical repair. Although a steep learning curve still exists given the high level of case complexity, continued development fueled by increasing patient demand may allow for even further expansion in the use of minimal invasive techniques.</p>

<p>The earliest mitral valve procedures, commisurotomy for rheumatic stenosis, were performed via large thoracotomy incisions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1089253211434591">1</xref></sup> With the introduction of extracorporeal circulation and the development of contemporary mitral valve surgery, exposure had been previously accomplished almost exclusively through a median sternotomy approach. Advances in endoscopic instruments and visualization tools as well as peripheral cannulation circulatory systems for cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) during the late 1990s stimulated widespread adoption of minimally invasive mitral valve surgery (MIMVS).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1089253211434591">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1089253211434591">10</xref></sup> Today, MIMVS is the standard approach for many surgeons and institutions. Although a steep learning curve still exists given the high level of case complexity, continued development fueled by increasing patient demand and the possibility of improved surgical exposure and dexterity may allow for a further expansion in the use of minimal invasive techniques.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1089253211434591">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>There are multiple benefits of MIMVS. Patient satisfaction and improved cosmesis are important benefits, particularly in women where the incision can be hidden in the right inframammary crease. Additionally, case–control studies have consistently shown faster recovery times and less associated pain with MIMVS.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1089253211434591">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1089253211434591">15</xref></sup> In the most recently published meta-analysis, which is also the largest to date, a statistically significant improvement in bleeding, transfusion, incidence of atrial fibrillation, and time to resumption of normal activities with MIMVS was shown when comparing MIMVS with conventional mitral surgery. Furthermore, improved patient satisfaction with the surgical incision site scar was also demonstrated.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1089253211434591">16</xref></sup> Of course, these benefits would be of little consequence if the quality and durability of mitral surgery was limited by MIMVS techniques or if MIMVS increased morbidity or mortality. In both of the available meta-analyses of MIMVS, perioperative and long-term mortality were equivalent between techniques for mitral valve surgery, as was long-term freedom from reoperation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1089253211434591">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1089253211434591">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1089253211434591">17</xref></sup> These findings are supported by 2 recent large single-center outcome studies. Eight-year freedom from reoperation was better with MIMVS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1089253211434591">18</xref></sup> as was short term and 1 year survival.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1089253211434591">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1089253211434591">19</xref></sup></p>
<p>The term <italic>minimally invasive mitral valve surgery</italic> encompasses several different surgical approaches. For some it merely refers to the avoidance of sternotomy with a large right anterior thoracotomy incision while still using many central CPB cannulation strategies. The right parasternal incision for MIMVS was first described in 1998.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1089253211434591">20</xref></sup> It was often complicated by chest wall instability and bradycardia due to transection of the artery supplying the sinoatrial node during an altered transseptal atrial approach. Although improved results have been seen with modification, this approach has largely been supplanted by the small right anterolateral thoracotomy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1089253211434591">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1089253211434591">22</xref></sup> Because the mitral valve lies in an annular plane that nearly approximates the sagittal plane of the body, a right anterolateral incision is particularly well suited for mitral valve exposure. The angle becomes more direct as the incision moves more laterally. Although the distance to the valve does increase with an increased lateral position, it is a problem that can easily be overcome with the use of robotic techniques.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1089253211434591">23</xref></sup></p>
<p>In general, both the small thoracotomy incision as well as the parasternal approach for mitral valve surgery requires peripheral CPB cannulation. This is also generally the case for both complete endoscopic surgery as well as more simplified mini-thoracotomies using direct vision through an access incision. For the anesthesiologist involved in MIMVS, a definite theme exists: the smaller the surgical incision, the more intimately involved the anesthesiologist becomes in the conduct of the operation. In a small retrospective study of Port Access surgery, anesthesia preparation time was increased by 16 minutes on average when compared with conventional surgery.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1089253211434591">24</xref></sup></p>
<sec id="section1-1089253211434591">
<title>Preoperative Preparation</title>
<p>The preoperative evaluation of patients for MIMVS generally mimics the evaluation of patients undergoing standard mitral valve surgery. The decision regarding suitability for MIMVS typically rests with the surgeon, but the anesthesiologist should clearly be familiar with the pertinent issues and should review all available patient data before the surgery begins. Although use of certain modifications may still allow MIMVS, the feasibility and safety of accessing the vascular tree to achieve peripheral CPB cannulation represents an important concern regarding suitability for MIMVS. Additional surgical concerns relate to previous right chest surgery or adhesions, as well as an abnormal orientation of the heart within the chest cavity. Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) has become so intricately involved in guiding surgical cannulation, monitoring hemodynamics, and assessing the mitral valve before and after intervention in MIMVS, that it is essentially mandatory for the operation. Therefore, the inability to obtain an intraoperative TEE (IOTEE) often precludes the operation. In rare instances, limited epicardial echocardiography can be achieved through the access incision and this may suffice for certain scenarios such as mitral valve replacement or simple mitral valve repair.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1089253211434591">
<title>Conduct of Anesthesia</title>
<p>Although some centers use regional anesthesia techniques for minimally invasive direct coronary artery bypass surgery (MIDCAB), the need for CPB and IOTEE essentially eliminates this option for MIMVS and necessitates general anesthesia. The choice of anesthetic agents is practitioner and institution dependent and not dictated by MIMVS. Patient positioning is typically supine with the right upper trunk elevated in some manner. The right arm is positioned at the side to allow the shoulder to drop down and improve surgical exposure. External defibrillator pads should be applied as limited surgical access makes use of internal defibrillator paddles more difficult although not impossible with an access incision. One must remember that, depending on the exact location of the external pads, if defibrillation will be occurring across the right lung field, a deflated right lung and empty thoracic cavity during single lung ventilation may impair defibrillation success. The right lung can be reexpanded to attempt to enhance defibrillation efficacy.</p>
<sec id="section3-1089253211434591">
<title>Airway Management</title>
<p>Because most MIMVS uses a right thoracotomy, lung isolation has been a mainstay of anesthetic management. The right lung is typically deflated as the surgeon enters the chest cavity and opens the pericardium to expose the left atrium prior to the initiation of CPB. One lung ventilation (OLV) is also typically employed at certain points after separation from bypass as surgical sites are checked, bleeding controlled, and the chest closed, as well as during aortic decannulation depending on surgical technique.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, OLV is not mandatory for the conduct of MIMVS. Ventilation can be held or made intermittent both prior to CPB or at its conclusion to allow for exposure. CPB can also be initiated prior to exposing the left atrium at the beginning of the operation, although this approach may unnecessarily increase the total CPB time. The method of choice for achieving lung isolation is also debatable. Although rarely discussed, a standard endotracheal tube can simply be advanced into the left bronchus under fiber-optic brochoscope guidance when lung isolation is needed. The most common techniques for achieving lung isolation are left sided double lumen tube (DLT) or right sided bronchial blocker placement. Each technique has its own set of advantages and disadvantages. DLT may be more challenging to place in certain patients and may be associated with airway trauma and bleeding. Another disadvantage of DLT is that postoperative swelling may make the exchange to a single lumen tube at the end of the case dangerous, even with the use of airway exchange catheters. Once positioned, however, there are definite benefits as they are less likely to be dislodged than bronchial blockers and they allow for the application of continuous positive airway pressure and suction to the deflated lung. Bronchial blockers allow OLV without the need for DLT placement or tube exchange. In a small study of robotic coronary bypass surgery (which requires left lung deflation), the Arndt bronchial blocker (Cook Medical Inc, Bloomington, IN) was as efficacious in providing OLV as a DLT, while easier to place.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1089253211434591">25</xref></sup> The applicability of the study’s findings in MIMVS may be somewhat limited given the need for right lung isolation in MIMVS, which can be more difficult to achieve with a blocker.</p>
<p>The institution of OLV may create significant management difficulties, particularly in patients presenting for cardiac surgery. Depressed cardiac function will increase dead space ventilation and limit pulmonary blood flow. Hypoxemia and hypercarbia will both increase pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) as will increases in intrathoracic pressure. Patients with mitral disease may already have elevated PVR, and the additional strain on the right ventricular may lead to dysfunction and increase any concomitant tricuspid regurgitation. Ventilation abnormalities may also lead to arrhythmias and increases in sympathetic tone, which may also be poorly tolerated, particularly in patients with marginal ventricular function. Although, in general, the period of OLV is relatively short during MIMVS compared with lung surgery or MIDCAB, it can be protracted particularly when intrathoracic bleeding requires persistent surgical attention. OLV after CPB during MIMVS has been associated with significant hypoxemia.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1089253211434591">24</xref></sup> There is limited evidence to suggest that any preoperative pulmonary function testing should preclude MIMVS, although some consider the identification of severe pulmonary dysfunction to be a relative contraindication.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1089253211434591">
<title>Intraoperative Transesophageal Echocardiography</title>
<p>Intraoperative transesophageal echocardiography is a critical component of both the anesthetic and surgical management in MIMVS. The importance of IOTEE to help guide clinical decision making in cardiac surgery has been well established.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1089253211434591">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1089253211434591">27</xref></sup> In few settings does this relationship hold truer than with decision making during mitral valve surgery.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1089253211434591">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1089253211434591">29</xref></sup> Additionally, in MIMVS, IOTEE plays an essential role in guiding the placement of certain peripherally placed CPB cannulas as well as serving as a continuous monitor of these cannulas once placed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1089253211434591">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1089253211434591">31</xref></sup></p>
<p>Although it is common practice to confirm the presence of the surgical indication with IOTEE before incision, with MIMVS it is also useful for the anesthesiologist to use IOTEE to confirm the appropriateness of the patient for a minimally invasive technique prior to incision. Ideally, this determination should also be completed before the placement of any specialized CPB cannulas. For example, the pre-incision finding of significant descending aortic atheroma will typically contraindicate retrograde arterial CPB flow and requires either alternative aortic cannulation strategies or a change in surgical approach. Some surgeons consider the presence of severe mitral annular calcification a contraindication to MIMVS given the increased degree of operative difficulty. The presence of other significant concomitant disease that requires surgical intervention that cannot be addressed via a minimally invasive approach should also be excluded as soon as possible.</p>

<title>Cannulation for Minimally Invasive Mitral Valve Surgery</title>
<sec id="section6-1089253211434591">
<title>Venous Drainage</title>
<p>Venous return to the CPB circuit can be achieved in several ways. Various commercially available long percutaneous venous return cannulas may be introduced into the right atrium or either vena cava via the femoral venous system. After accessing the femoral vein, a long wire is advanced toward and then visualized on TEE within the right atrium or the adjacent vena cava. The venous cannula is then advanced over the wire into the right atrium or vena cava with TEE confirmation. As will be discussed below, the final position of this cannula depends on individual practice and the type of procedure being performed. If femoral venous access cannot be achieved, use of a larger access incision may allow for direct cannulation.</p>
<p>Typically adjunctive measures are used to assist venous drainage. Advances in perfusion techniques such as kinetic or vacuum assisted venous drainage can increase flow dynamics by 20% to 40%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1089253211434591">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1089253211434591">33</xref></sup> With the tip of the femoral venous cannula positioned in the superior vena cava (SVC), adequate drainage can be achieved as long as the cannula’s multi-orificed side ports reside in the body of the right atrium. However, additional measures to idealize surgical exposure for MIMVS are often critically important. Drainage from the superior and inferior cava can effectively be separated by surgical retraction on the intraatrial septum,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1089253211434591">34</xref></sup> thereby complicating single-stage cannulation. In many practices it is standard to place an additional percutaneous venous drainage cannula from the neck (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1089253211434591">Figure 1</xref>). This is best achieved via the right internal jugular (IJ) vein given the near direct path it takes to the SVC. Placement of a drainage cannula from the left IJ increases the risk of vascular injury and, because of the increased distance from the left side, does not allow for direct drainage of the SVC.</p>

<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1089253211434591-fig1.tif"/></fig>
<p>The placement of these large-bore catheters in the neck are not without substantial risk of vascular injury. The risk likely increases with increase in size of the cannulas, as more force must be generated to advance the catheter percutaneously. As with all upper extremity central venous cannulations, local traumatic injuries can occur as well as damage to more central structures including the great vessels. Perforation of the right atrium, vena cava, or other vascular structure within the pericardium can lead to pericardial tamponade. As such, efforts should be made to decrease the risk of placement. Using a strict “Seldingner” technique to minimize the chance of wire kinking with catheter advancement is a critical component to improving safety. Use of sequential dilators with increasing size in advance of the cannula may facilitate placement. Ideally, an assistant with sterile gown and gloves should be present (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1089253211434591">Figure 2</xref>). Although not mandatory, the ability to visualize the wire in the right atrium on TEE may be useful.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1089253211434591">35</xref></sup> Because this cannula is typically placed after the induction of anesthesia and before surgical preparation, a small dose of heparin is given prior to placement and the cannula is flushed after it is secured to prevent clotting or thrombus formation. Sutures may be placed around the cannulation site at this point or later to facilitate closing the defect and provide hemostasis upon cannula removal.</p>

<p>Some institutions use the Endopulmonary Vent Catheter (Edwards Lifesciences, Irvine, CA) in conjunction with a long femoral venous cannula to decompress the heart in lieu of IJ cannulation. On the surface, the Endopulmonary Vent Catheter appears similar to a standard pulmonary artery catheter (PAC). It is placed in the same fashion as a standard PAC, although because it is more flimsy, TEE or fluoroscopic guidance may be more necessary at times. It has a specialized design with multiple distal holes to allow venting of the pulmonary artery at approximately 50 mL/min,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1089253211434591">33</xref></sup> in order to optimize surgical exposure. This strategy is acceptable in MIMVS as the surgical approach to the mitral valve is via a left atriotomy as opposed to the more common transseptal approach used in conventional mitral surgery. However, when the right atrium must be exposed in conjunction with MIMVS (ie, concomitant ASD closure or tricuspid valve repair), bicaval cannulation and occlusion are necessary to prevent air entrainment from an exposed right atrium. When SVC occlusion is employed, continuous monitoring of right IJ pressure is important to help ensure adequate SVC drainage. Many clinicians monitor right IJ pressure in all MIMVS for the same reason.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1089253211434591">
<title>Arterial Outflow</title>
<p>Regardless of whether arterial outflow from the CPB circuit is achieved via percutaneous central or peripheral cannulation, or even direct central cannulation, the anesthesiologist is usually highly involved in assisting with placement. When Seldinger techniques are used by the surgeon, confirmation of correct wire position in either the ascending or descending aorta is usually made via TEE before the placement of the arterial cannula. In addition to the various techniques used for arterial cannulation, there are also several approaches to aortic cross clamping, aortic venting, and cardiolplegia administration. The anesthesiologist’s role in these will be discussed below.</p>
<p>The Port Access system (Edwards Lifesciences) was designed to facilitate MIMVS and introduced into clinical practice in 1997. A similar product is also produced by Estech (Estech, Danville, CA). At the cornerstone of this new technology was the development of an endoluminal aortic balloon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1089253211434591">Figure 3</xref>), the EndoClamp Aortic Catheter (Edwards Lifesciences). Although technical modifications have been made over the years, the concept remains unchanged to this day. The EndoClamp is placed through a side port of a Y-shaped large (21 or 24 French) arterial cannula (endoreturn arterial cannula) and advanced into the ascending aorta (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1089253211434591">Figure 4</xref>). This requires significant TEE guidance. When advanced from the femoral artery with the Seldinger technique, first the wire and then the balloon tipped catheter is visualized in the descending aorta. After confirmation of descending aortic positioning, the wire followed by the EndoClamp Aortic Catheter is advanced to the ascending aorta, again under TEE guidance (ascending aortic long axis view). The EndoClamp can also be advanced into the ascending aorta percutaneously from the right axillary artery,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1089253211434591">36</xref></sup> or directly via the transthoracic EndoDirect cannula. The EndoClamp is best visualized on TEE in the ascending aorta before the institution of CPB as the opening of the hemostatic valve on the Y-shaped cannula limits perfusion when adjustments are needed. Prior to inserting the EndoClamp, the TEE examination should confirm that the size of the ascending aorta is appropriate. A large diameter ascending aorta (greater than 3.5 cm in diameter) may limit endo-occlusion and a small diameter aorta may increase the chance of catheter migration on balloon inflation as well as the risk of aortic injury.</p>

<p>The echocardiographer’s role does not end with cannula placement. After the institution of CPB, the ascending aorta must be visualized on TEE (ascending aortic long axis view) during inflation of the EndoClamp to confirm that it remains in place (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1089253211434591">Figure 5</xref>). The flow of cardioplegia should also be noted using TEE and color flow Doppler. Proper position above the aortic root is essential to allow for adequate cardioprotection. At the same time prevention of distal migration avoids malperfusion of the head vessels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1089253211434591">Figure 6</xref>). Motion of the balloon is a delicate balance between proximal flow from either residual cardiac contraction or infusion of cardioplegia and distal flow from the proximal port of the aortic cannula.</p>

<p>Balloon migration may continue to occur throughout the case after initial inflation. Once the left atrium is opened, TEE visualization of the ascending aorta for balloon adjustment is limited by air interposition. The effects of air can be mitigated by filling the atrium with blood or another fluid when necessary. Monitoring for distal balloon migration is typically achieved by continuously and simultaneously observing bilateral upper extremity arterial pressure (lower extremity pressure monitoring can be employed in lieu of a left upper extremity arterial catheter). A precipitous, isolated drop in right upper extremity pressure indicates distal migration and occlusion of the inominate artery by the balloon. Some centers use a single right arm arterial catheter and watch for otherwise unexplained drops in blood pressure as a sign of migration. Cerebral oximetry can also be used although false negatives may occur with an intact Circle of Willis. Proximal migration of the balloon may limit aortic occlusion, inhibit adequate myocardial protection, and possibly injure the aortic valve.</p>
<p>Many surgeons who use MIMVS have chosen to forgo Port Access techniques and instead have attempted to mimic standard open cannulation schemes through an MIMVS incision. Use of the angled Chitwood Transthoracic Aortic Cross Clamp (Scanlan International Inc, Minneapolis, MN), which is inserted percutaneously and guided toward the ascending aorta under direct or endoscopic vision, is a key component to success with this approach (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-1089253211434591">Figures 7</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-1089253211434591">8</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-1089253211434591">9</xref>). A separate aortic root vent is then placed directly for cardiac venting and antegrade cardioplegia administration. The popularity of this technique over Port Access is based on several factors. Certainly decreases in infrastructure demands play a role. In addition, concern about the risk of aortic dissection and other major vascular complications with use of the EndoClamp may also sway surgeon preference away from the Port Access approach. Severe complications associated with vascular access and retrograde arterial perfusion were reported by Onnasch et al with Port Access surgery.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1089253211434591">37</xref></sup> By avoiding the need for the EndoClamp, the larger EndoReturn arterial cannula becomes unnecessary and a smaller perfusion cannula may be used. In addition to these issues, longer operative and cross-clamp times have been demonstrated with Port Access surgery.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1089253211434591">38</xref></sup></p>

<p>Despite these concerns, the most recent meta-analysis available found an extremely low iatrogenic dissection rate during MIMVS (8 in 5117 patients, or 0.2%). It should be mentioned however that there were no events in the comparable group who underwent sternotomy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1089253211434591">16</xref></sup> The report did not differentiate dissection rate between Port Access and the use of a transthoracic clamp even though this distinction was made for other outcomes. The number of patients who underwent Port Access and MIMVS transthoracic clamping was similar. This suggests that the cross-clamping approach was not a significant variable for risk of aortic dissection. Because use of a transthoracic clamp in itself does not obviate the use of peripheral arterial cannulation, peripheral vascular complications may still occur as can proximal embolization of descending aortic atheroma when retrograde arterial flow is employed. Although an elevation of arterial outflow line pressure on the CPB circuit is often the first sign, early evaluation of the descending aorta after the initiation of retrograde CPB on TEE should be made to rule out dissection. Unlike with standard direct surgical cannulation, aortic dissection may not be apparent in the surgical field until retrograde extension to the ascending aorta occurs, typically a short time after the initial injury. Early recognition and conversion to antegrade central flow may limit the damage of this potentially devastating complication.</p>
<p>Definitive advantages of transthoracic clamping over Port Access include a significantly lower cost of surgical cannulation, less reliance on TEE imaging, and no need for bilateral upper extremity arterial line placement by the anesthesia team. A reduction of $2800 in the cost of disposable products has been shown by eliminating Port Access.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1089253211434591">38</xref></sup> One disadvantage to the transthoracic clamping technique is the need to place an aortic root vent directly onto the ascending aorta. It can be surgically challenging to make repairs if needed after vent removal, particularly when more endoscopic surgical techniques are used. There is some circumstantial evidence that use of an aortic root vent may provide more effective air venting of the aorta than does the EndoClamp. In the meta-analysis of Cheng et al,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1089253211434591">16</xref></sup> there was a trend demonstrating an increased incidence of stroke with Port Access surgery compared with MIMVS with transthoracic clamping. The authors hypothesized that this increase may be related to less effective deairing with the EndoClamp. There is no direct evidence of this hypothesis at this time, however. This trend for increased neurologic complications was also shown in a smaller single-center case series from Germany.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1089253211434591">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1089253211434591">39</xref></sup> When evaluating studies comparing the overall safety of the 2 approaches, it is important to consider the more significant learning curve associated with Port Access surgery. The steepness of the curve was exemplified by the findings of the first Port Access International Registry in which the incidence of iatrogenic aortic dissection was 1.3% in the first half of the study followed by a decrease to 0.2% in the second half.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1089253211434591">40</xref></sup></p>
<p>In addition to transthoracic clamping, other alternatives to Port Access exist. The simplest involves operating on a beating heart. The obvious advantage of this is that the heart need not be arrested allowing coronary flow to remain mostly uninterrupted. Disadvantages of this approach include a more disturbed surgical field and the possibility of systemic air embolization. Although the heart may be able to eject air into the systemic circulation with the left atrium and ventricle exposed to air, this is uncommon as the empty or underfilled ventricle cannot generate enough pressure to open the aortic valve while on CPB. However, it remains important for the anesthesia and surgical team to monitor for this possibility. The occurrence of aortic valve opening can be signified by the appearance of “over-ride” on the arterial waveform or the valve can be visualized on IOTEE. The aortic vent should also be directly observed for the appearance of any air entrainment. These concerns can be limited by inducing ventricular fibrillation to create ventricular stand-still. Fibrillation can be achieved either by a fibrillator applied directly to the heart or through the use of a pacing PAC.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1089253211434591">41</xref></sup></p>

<title>Cardioplegia</title>
<p>As discussed above, antegrade cardioplegia can be delivered via the EndoClamp or direct aortic root cannulation. Direct retrograde coronary sinus cannulation during MIMVS is more challenging. By adjusting the metal stylette to compensate for the more lateral surgical position, direct coronary sinus cannulation can be achieved through an access incision. With this approach, TEE guidance and subsequent confirmation of correct retrograde cardioplegia cannula position are important. An additional option is the use of a percutaneous coronary sinus catheter.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1089253211434591">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1089253211434591">43</xref></sup> The Endopledge Coronary Sinus Catheter (Edwards Lifesciences) is advanced through an 11-French introducer sheath, typically via the right IJ vein. It is a long triple-lumen catheter with a balloon on the end that allows for occlusion of the coronary sinus, measurement of distal pressure, and the infusion of cardioplegia. The obvious advantage of this approach is the ability to administer retrograde protection while remaining completely endoscopic.</p>
<p>Endopledge cannulation can be guided by TEE, fluoroscopy, or both. TEE is most commonly used to help direct the cannula into the coronary sinus ostia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-1089253211434591">Figures 10</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11-1089253211434591">11</xref>). Once in the coronary sinus, TEE is limited in its ability to exactly define the position of the tip and provides limited functional information. The generation of a “ventricularized” distal pressure waveform during inflation of the occlusion balloon suggests adequate sinus occlusion. The cannula should be advanced until this ventricularized waveform is seen with balloon inflation. The cannula is deemed to be inserted too far if ventricularization occurs with less than 0.75 to 1 mL of balloon inflation and not far enough if more than 1 mL is required for occlusion. Fluoroscopy can be used to better visualize the cannula in the coronary sinus. The cannula should be seen moving synchronously with each ventricular contraction to confirm its presence in the sinus. The appearance of the catheter “wrapped” too far behind the heart signifies distal displacement. Obstructive venography can also be performed using diluted radiologic contrast agents to observe opacification of the entire coronary venous system. This ensures that the cannula is not misdirected into a cardiac vein or obstructing a major coronary vein. Thorough steps to ensure proper placement are important as, because of its design, a careful balance exists between having the catheter distal enough in the sinus to prevent dislodgement and proximal enough to ensure adequate cardioplegia delivery to all myocardial segments. There is a single report that suggests that adequate cardioplegia distribution occurs irrespective of catheter depth because of the widespread network of collaterals within the cardiac venous system.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1089253211434591">44</xref></sup></p>

<p>Although conceptually appealing, the use of the EndoPledge cannula has not been widely adopted with MIMVS. Concerns about coronary sinus perforation risk, increased complexity of placement, and high rate of dislodgement have limited its penetration. The overall incidence of coronary sinus disruption is unknown but anecdotal reports clearly exist. Perforations of both the right atria and ventricle have also been reported.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1089253211434591">45</xref></sup> A difficult and prolonged attempt at placement presumably increases the likelihood of trauma, particularly when there is difficulty with advancement after the coronary sinus ostia has been engaged.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1089253211434591">46</xref></sup> In a recent retrospective study of 95 EndoPledge catheter insertions using a combined TEE and fluoroscopic approach with venography, the mean time for proper placement was 16.1 minutes (±14.1 minutes).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1089253211434591">46</xref></sup> Successful positioning was achieved 87.5% of the time. Of the 13 failures, 9 were dislodged during surgery and not related to an inability to place the cannula. It is unclear what the impact of even a small dye load is on renal function in the setting of CPB and cardiac surgery.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most important reason for more widespread avoidance of the EndoPledge cannula is that many surgeons do not believe that retrograde cardioplegia is necessary for cardiac protection when adequate antegrade cardiolplegia can be delivered. This has been demonstrated in several case series.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1089253211434591">46</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1089253211434591">49</xref></sup> Suggested indications for retrograde cardioplegia include anticipated long complex cases; those with significant ventricular hypertrophy; patients with a history of prior CABG, particularly those with patent mammary grafts; and significant aortic insufficiency. However, none of these indications have been well established. Meyer et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1089253211434591">50</xref></sup> reported successful results in 45 patients with previous CABG who underwent reoperative MIMVS without the use of retrograde cardiolplegia. Even in the setting of moderate aortic insufficiency, adequate antegrade protection can be achieved in most patients. Increased vigilance regarding myocardial protection is required however in this setting. Patients with more than moderate aortic insufficiency should probably be considered for concomitant aortic valve intervention via conventional sternotomy.</p>

<sec id="section9-1089253211434591">
<title>MIMVS and Previous Cardiac Surgery</title>
<p>Previous cardiac surgery does not preclude MIMVS, and in fact MIMVS may provide some significant advantages in these patients. The right lateral thoracotomy incision limits exposure to previous chest wall adhesions from previous sternotomy as well as most previous coronary bypass grafts. Multiple studies have shown an at least equal if not better mortality with redo MIMVS compared with redo sternotomy mitral valve surgery.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1089253211434591">51</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1089253211434591">53</xref></sup> Additionally, a decreased infection rate, transfusion requirement, and length of hospital stay were also consistently shown in these studies.</p>
<p>Management of patients with patent left internal mammary (LIMA) coronary bypass grafts requires some mention, although in practice differs little from patients undergoing sternotomy. The ability to clamp the LIMA and prevent myocardial warming is limited; thus, management strategies revolve around more aggressive systemic cooling or “beating heart” surgical strategies. The need for retrograde cardioplegia in patients with a patent LIMA graft is suggested by some but is not necessarily required as discussed above.</p>
<p>The presence of anterior chest wall adhesions from previous sternotomy may limit exposure to the right ventricle preventing the ability to apply temporary epicardial pacing wires. This may be particularly true when using true endoscopic surgery. The preoperative placement of a pacing PAC can alleviate this problem. Similarly, the combination of previous cardiac surgery and endoscopic MIMVS may also create difficulties achieving caval occlusion if the right side of the heart must be entered. The placement of an endoreturn arterial cannula in the right IJ as well as another interpositioned endoreturn cannula distal to the femoral venous return cannula can allow for occlusion balloons to be placed into each respective cava. On opening of the right atrium, these balloons can be inflated under direct vision percutaneously to proximally occlude each cava while still draining the body.</p>

<sec id="section10-1089253211434591">
<title>Cardiopulmonary Bypass Management</title>
<p>Although most aspects of the conduct of CPB are unchanged from conventional mitral surgery, there are some additional considerations during MIMVS. Limitations to flow may occur through smaller peripheral arterial cannulas or when the EndoClamp limits the effective cannula orifice. An additional arterial cannula may need to be placed and added to the circuit if high arterial line resistance occurs when attempting to achieve appropriate CPB flow, although for all practical purposes this solution is very rarely used. Similarly, even with assisted venous drainage, total heart decompression may not occur during normal systemic flows requiring a permissive low flow state. A left atrial venting cannula can be placed across the chest wall and into the right superior pulmonary vein. Positioning this cannula tip into the left inferior pulmonary vein after left atriotomy may clear the operative field as this often becomes the most gravity-dependent location. When the EndoClamp is used, systemic blood pressure may need to be lowered to prevent proximal migration of the balloon. It may be more difficult to achieve a bloodless surgical field when the systemic blood pressure is elevated as well. Although these alterations in systemic flow and blood pressure are often out of the anesthesiologist’s control, it is important to remain informed and involved in the management process. Normothermic or even tepid bypass may not be appropriate when low CPB flow is required.</p>
<sec id="section11-1089253211434591">
<title>Mitral Valve Exposure and Repair</title>
<p>Exposure and visualization of the mitral valve requires equipment and techniques that vary from a standard sternotomy approach. Specialized left atrial retractors have been developed to expose the mitral valve. These can be mounted to the chest retractor or the operative table. Placing the mitral valve repair ring annuloplasty sutures first and retracting under tension enhances exposure of the mitral valve. This tactic is often performed with the increased confidence of valve reparability provided by a detailed IOTEE. Videothoracoscopic imaging systems greatly enhance field lighting and visualization of the mitral valve (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12-1089253211434591">Figure 12</xref>). Very important, the additional monitors in the operating room allow all members of the operative team to observe and even participate in the mitral valve repair. The immediate visual confirmation of the pathology detected on IOTEE greatly strengthens the diagnostic skills of the anesthesiologist. Direct observation of the repair can also tune the anesthesiologist into specific concerns and issues to evaluate on the postrepair IOTEE exam.</p>

<title>Separation From CPB and Immediate Post Bypass Management</title>
<p>During separation from CPB, there are no dramatic differences in principal from open operations. However, unquestionably, these operations require increased cross-clamp and CPB times. This should be factored into decision making regarding post-CPB pharmacologic, ventilatory, fluid, and blood product management. After a period of reperfusion, preparations are made and any requirements for pacing and hemodynamic support are adjusted. If a pacing PAC is being used, adjustments in position may need to be made because once the heart fills, the wire may migrate away from the ventricular wall. The amplitude may also need to be increased if the ventricular pacing threshold has increased. Initial ventilation of both lungs should be instituted when possible. Attempts to de-air the heart are made in the usual fashion. The ability to dislodge retained left atrial air is typically not hampered by the incision. Exposure to dislodge retained left ventricular air, however, may be more limited. The use of carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) insufflation via a catheter introduced into the right thoracic cavity may simplify de-airng, as CO<sub>2</sub> will resolve much more rapidly than air.</p>
<p>While clearly a focused evaluation of the mitral valve must be made, a thorough yet timely TEE examination after CPB is critical. Given the close proximity of the noncoronary leaflet of the aortic valve to the anterior mitral valve annulus, a directed TEE examination of the aortic valve after CPB is also important. With less surgical access to the heart and great vessels, the anesthesiologist plays an even greater role in monitoring all aspects of cardiac function. For example, with sternotomy the ascending aorta and right ventricular can typically be observed in the surgical field for signs of injury or dysfunction. However, TEE evaluation is required during MIMVS. As the replacement of the components of CPB after their initial removal in MIMVS can be time consuming and technically involved, early and accurate TEE diagnoses prior to decannulation is important. For the same reason, ensuring adequate de-airing is also important, as emergent reinstitution of CPB may be delayed if coronary air embolism leads to significant cardiac dysfunction after surgical decannulation.</p>
<p>A careful assessment of ventricular function must be made. The efficacy of subsequent antegrade cardioplegia doses maybe diminished in the setting of potential iatrogenic aortic regurgitation induced by robust left atrial retraction. If even used, there is a reduced protective effect of retrograde cardioplegia on the right ventricle, which can especially complicate long operations. Inadvertent occlusion of coronary ostia by balloon migration is a consideration with Port Access surgery, particularly with a high anomalous origin. Ensuring that no new wall motion abnormalities have developed after surgery is also required. Iatrogenic injury or occlusion of a coronary artery may occur during surgery, most commonly involving the circumflex artery. There may be an increased incidence of circumflex artery injury in patients with a left dominant or codominant circulation, as in these patients the circumflex takes a more prolonged course along the posterior annulus of the mitral valve.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1089253211434591">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1089253211434591">55</xref></sup> While this is certainly a known complication of mitral surgery through open sternotomy, there may be a stronger predilection for circumflex artery injury with MIMVS because annular sutures are placed more tangentially to the annulus, and thus directed more toward the circumflex, as opposed to the more perpendicular angle used during sternotomy. Left atrial appendage exclusion during MIMVS is achieved with sutures that begin within the left atrium as opposed to outside the appendage during sternotomy. This internal approach can also predispose iatrogenic coronary artery injury.</p>
<p>Although in theory it would seem that iatrogenic coronary injury should be easily diagnosed in the immediate post bypass period, in practice this is not always the case. There are many factors that may delay diagnosis. Use of only a 2-lead EKG system in the operating room may limit the sensitivity for ischemia. Initial signs suggestive of ischemia may first be considered a result of myocardial stunning and recovery from cardioplegia. In addition, because embolism of retained myocardial air not infrequently disrupts coronary flow when separating from CPB, initial ischemic changes may first be considered related to air embolization. Finally, the appearance of definitive EKG changes and wall motion abnormalities on echocardiography may be delayed, even by several hours to days. This is related to the variable location and type of injuries that may occur. For example, ischemia may not be induced until delayed thrombosis of an iatrogenically narrowed coronary occurs. Delayed diagnosis of iatrogenic coronary injuries may also be related to the presence of high sympathetic tone and/or circulating catecholamines. Not only will this augment collateral flow but this milieu of sympathetic surges can also lead to surrounding segmental hyperkinesis. This can then mask adjacent wall motion abnormalities through translational forces.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1089253211434591">56</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1089253211434591">57</xref></sup> Enhanced mid and epicardial wall contraction can also compensate for subendocardial ischemia.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1089253211434591">56</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1089253211434591">58</xref></sup></p>
<p>During the initiation of surgical chest closure, OLV is typically needed. Superimposing this additional strain on the right ventricle in patients with preexisting dysfunction or residual myocardial stunning may lead to decompensation. Permissive hypercapnea or persistent hypoxemia during OLV will increase sympathetic tone and can lead to hyperkalemia and arrhythmia promotion. An elevation of pulmonary vascular resistance may also occur, which can impair right ventricular function. If an aortic root vent was used, this period of OLV may need to be prolonged to allow for surgical inspection and control of bleeding, particularly if removal did not take place with the patient on CPB. Control of bleeding from other sites may also prolong this period and further complicate the hemodynamic management. Ensuring adequate reinflation of the lungs after CPB and before the required OLV may help prevent difficulties. Measures such as PEEP to the ventilated lung or intermittent lung inflation may be necessary. It may be helpful to temporarily ventilate the deflated right lung in isolation on resolution of normal ventilation to fully reinflate it without having to generate excessive positive pressure.</p>

<title>Preparing for Transfer and the Intensive Care Unit</title>
<p>At the conclusion of surgery, there are a number of preparations the anesthesia team must make prior to transport that are not usually necessary following sternotomy. First, if a double-lumen endotracheal tube was used, it should be switched to a single-lumen tube unless immediate extubation is planned or oropharyngeal swelling or trauma poses a significant risk for loss of airway during tube exchange. An adequate level of sedation should be obtained before attempting the exchange. The same degree of muscle relaxation used with initial intubation may not be necessary. The use of an airway exchange catheter may be helpful. In patients with significant upper body swelling or airway trauma, the double lumen tube may need to be left in place. If a second arterial catheter or an IJ return venous catheter were used, they should be removed at the conclusion of surgery. Some technique to achieve hemostasis must be employed on removal of the IJ return catheter. A boxed “purse string” or a “U” stitch closure are commonly employed. If cosmesis is a significant concern, after hemostasis is achieved, the closure stitch can be removed and a subcuticular closure made.</p>

<title>Postoperative Pain Management</title>
<p>There are numerous options available for pain control after MIMVS beyond the traditional use of parenteral opiods. The use of these adjunctive measures is widespread. Excitement for their use in MIMVS is enhanced by the desire for and possibility of a quicker extubation and recovery in many of these patients. Successful “fast-track” anesthesia has been well described in the setting of MIMVS.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1089253211434591">59</xref></sup> Although it is true that many of the patients for MIMVS are excellent candidates for early extubation, caution must still be exercised because of the potential occurrence of significant postoperative chest wall bleeding given the multiple chest wall puncture sites.</p>
<p>The simplest adjunct pain management technique involves the use of limited intercostal injections of local anesthetic during surgical closure. The desire for a longer duration of local anesthesia has led many to use continuous infusions via temporary catheters and specialized pumps. Catheters may simply be left under the subcutaneous tissue prior to closure and then tunneled out through the skin.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1089253211434591">60</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1089253211434591">61</xref></sup> An extrapleural intercostal catheter can also be placed under direct vision and may also provide improvements in pain control and possibly pulmonary function as well.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1089253211434591">62</xref></sup> The inability to adequately strip the parietal pleura posteriorly beyond the incision may limit optimal positioning of the catheter tip. Interpleural injections of local anesthetics have also been reported to be of utility. If this technique is used, chest tube suctioning should be discontinued for 30 minutes after the injection.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1089253211434591">62</xref></sup> Because of the high vascularity of the chest wall cavity, caution must be exercised when injecting local anesthetics in this region as the possibility systemic toxicity is quite real. Although thoracic epidural use has been reported during MIDCAB surgery, both for postoperative pain and as the anesthetic technique,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1089253211434591">63</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1089253211434591">66</xref></sup> epidural anesthesia has rarely been used with MIMVS. Paramount among the concerns with epidural catheters is the risk of epidural hematoma formation and consequent spinal cord injury. Additional concerns relate to bilateral sympathectomy leading to hypotension. Finally, the successful use of unilateral continuous paravertebral blocks has been described with MIMVS for postoperative pain control. Authors have shown a high level of safety with equally effective pain control compared to epidural anesthesia.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1089253211434591">65</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1089253211434591">67</xref></sup> Advantages of a paravertebral block over a thoracic epidural include a higher safety margin for neurologic complications and avoidance of bilateral sympathectomy.</p>

<title>Summary</title>
<p>Traditional mitral valve surgery is rapidly being supplanted as the primary surgical approach to the mitral valve by innovative minimally invasive techniques. Patients are experiencing a decrease in pain and faster recoveries without sacrificing the durability of their surgical repair.
