<abstract>
<p>Group B streptococcus (GBS) is the commonest cause of early onset sepsis in UK newborns. Several risk factors for early onset GBS sepsis (EOGBS) have been described. The presence of these risk factors provides an opportunity for intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis (IAP) and forms the basis of current UK EOGBS prevention guidance. Having observed poor compliance with national guidelines in a review of EOGBS cases within the UK Neonatal Infection Surveillance Network (NeonIN), we reviewed 14 NeonIN unit guidelines. We found substantial variation in recommendations within and between units on indications for IAP and treatment of asymptomatic neonates, and discrepancies between obstetric and neonatal guidelines, potentially increasing infants’ risk of infection. The lack of high quality evidence in this area and related ambiguity in national guidance may have contributed to diverse local approaches. A common approach would permit prospective evaluation of an EOGBS prevention strategy, generating an evidence base to benefit future guidelines.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Group B streptococcus (GBS) is carried by over 20% of UK mothers and is the leading cause of early onset neonatal sepsis in the UK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1757177412437985">Hughes et al, 2003</xref>). Early onset GBS sepsis (EOGBS) can be largely prevented by intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis (IAP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1757177412437985">Hughes et al, 2003</xref>). In 2003, the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG) published national guidance suggesting that IAP should be considered in the presence of risk factors including: GBS colonisation in pregnancy, prematurity, previous infant with EOGBS, intrapartum fever, prolonged rupture of membranes (PROM) and chorioamnionitis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1757177412437985">Hughes et al, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>A retrospective case-control study in 2009 found that 65% of 138 infants with EOGBS had at least one risk factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1757177412437985">Heath et al, 2009</xref>). A retrospective review of cases by the UK Neonatal Infection Surveillance Network (NeonIN) between 2003 and 2007 similarly identified risk factors in 67% of cases, of whom only 21% (6 out of 29 cases) received IAP. An estimated 54% of these might have been prevented by IAP using a risk-based approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1757177412437985">Vergnano et al, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>We reviewed local EOGBS prevention guidelines from 14 of the 18 NeonIN-participating units to assess the degree of consensus and extent of consistency with national guidance. In particular, we compared recommendations on indications for IAP and management of infants born to women with risk factors. The 14 neonatal units contributing guidelines to this review are among 128 units providing high dependency and short-term or continuing neonatal intensive care in England.</p>

<title>Intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis</title>
<p>The choice of IAP antibiotic was consistent between all local guidelines and with national guidance. The recommended minimum dosing interval pre-delivery that was considered to be effective varied between 2 hours (five guidelines) and 4 hours (nine guidelines). The RCOG guideline recommends a minimum 2 hour interval, contrasting with 4 hours in the Centers for Disease Control guidelines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1757177412437985">Schrag et al, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>Twelve local guidelines suggested IAP for women with GBS carriage detected in the current pregnancy, including one that recommended IAP only if GBS is identified in the 5 weeks before the estimated date of delivery. Two local guidelines made no recommendation on this issue. The RCOG guideline sets out the numerical risk estimate of EOGBS amongst infants born to colonised women, with a recommendation to <italic>consider</italic> IAP if GBS is incidentally found. In two local guidelines, GBS carriage in a previous pregnancy was also considered an indication for IAP, contrary to RCOG guidance.</p>
<p>There was substantial variation in local recommendations on the use of IAP in the presence of single risk factors, ranging from a recommendation to give IAP in the presence of any single listed risk factor, to an absence of any reference to maternal risk factors for EOGBS beyond maternal colonisation or a previously affected infant.</p>
<p>National guidance does not make a specific recommendation on this issue but rather presents the risk associated with each factor, alongside the corresponding number needed to treat (NNT) to prevent infection or mortality, leaving the decision to individual clinicians.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1757177412437985">
<title>Neonatal management</title>
<p>Local guidelines unanimously recommended that all symptomatic infants should be treated, but varied in their approach to asymptomatic infants. Nine guidelines suggested screening and treating infants born to women with a single risk factor who did not receive adequate IAP, though with inconsistency between guidelines in the risk factors targeted as indications for neonatal antibiotic therapy. Five guidelines suggested that only presence of a further risk factor justified screening and empirical treatment.</p>
<p>The approach to a well infant with risk factors whose mother received adequate IAP also varied considerably, from no intervention and early discharge, to partial septic screen and empirical treatment. Risk factors were again targeted variably as indications for enhanced investigation and/or neonatal antibiotic therapy. For example, one guideline recommended a limited infection screen without lumbar puncture for asymptomatic newborns in the presence of two risk factors, but stipulated that a lumbar puncture should be carried out if those risk factors were chorioamnionitis and PROM.</p>
<p>All local guidelines suggested a period of observation for infants at risk of EOGBS whose mother received inadequate IAP, although this varied between 12 and 24 hours.</p>
</sec>

<sec id="section6-1757177412437985" sec-type="discussion">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We have identified significant variation in local guidance for preventing EOGBS and subsequent neonatal management amongst UK units. These units by virtue of their declared interest in neonatal infection might be expected to show greater consistency in guidance on EOGBS prevention than would be found in an unselected survey. It is clear that the evidence base from which decisions (nationally or locally) can be made is weak. Few randomised controlled trials have been performed in this area and guidelines are generally based on consensus rather than evidence. This remains a fundamental problem.</p>
<p>The observed variations in the recommendation for maternal IAP use are largely explicable as different interpretations of the national guidance, which encourages case-by-case evaluation based on attributable risks and NNT. This is consistent with the results of a national audit in 2007 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1757177412437985">Cromwell et al, 2007</xref>) and is reflected in the variable use of the terms ‘give’, ‘offer’ and ‘consider’ in both national and local guidance documents. However, more significant inconsistencies are also apparent, both between and within local guidelines. For example, although the estimated risk of EOGBS following maternal recto-vaginal colonisation in the current pregnancy (1:500) is lower than for maternal fever, PROM or preterm delivery, 12 of the 14 local guidelines reviewed recommended IAP for maternal colonisation but were less consistent in recommending IAP in the presence of these risk factors. Most of the guidelines reviewed recommended empirical treatment of infants who were born to women who had one risk factor but did not receive ‘adequate’ IAP (with some variation around the definition of ‘adequate’), but paradoxically, several that adopted this approach did not explicitly recommend maternal IAP in the presence of that same risk factor. Clinicians’ awareness of infection with other organisms may contribute to variations in guidelines relating to risk factors for early onset infection.</p>
<p>We have identified a similar level of inconsistency within and between local guidelines relating to neonatal management, with the potential for both over- and under-investigation and treatment. Some guidelines did not recommend neonatal antibiotic therapy in the presence of single known risk factors despite inadequate IAP, whilst most recommended antibiotic treatment of asymptomatic infants born to women who had received adequate IAP despite negligible relative risks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1757177412437985">Cromwell et al, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Current national guidance emphasises the increased risk of EOGBS attributable to certain risk factors, without defining recommended thresholds for either IAP or empirical treatment of the asymptomatic neonate. This is reflected in a diversity of approaches at local level, which we suggest is confusing and unsatisfactory. We have shown IAP is failing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1757177412437985">Vergnano et al, 2010</xref>) and this report shows inconsistent obstetric management but also a substantial variation in neonatal management, often without joined-up thinking to link obstetric and neonatal guidelines; this further puts babies at risk of infection.</p>
<p>The RCOG guidelines are being updated and many will want more definite recommendations. In addition, NICE has initiated the development of clinical guidance for the prevention and treatment of early onset neonatal infection. It must be emphasised that this will again, to a large extent, reflect expert opinion. Nevertheless, for a clinical guideline to be correctly interpreted and implemented, its recommendations need to be clear and consistent. The development and agreement of a common approach will also permit a prospective evaluation of an EOGBS prevention strategy, generating an evidence base that will benefit future guidelines.</p>
