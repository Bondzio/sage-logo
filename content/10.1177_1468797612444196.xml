<abstract>
<p>This paper presents insights on how to rebrand a nation with a negatively viewed brand name and identity caused by disaster, atrocity or political upheaval, to stimulate tourism. Following a review of the literature, the authors conceptualise the notion of negatively viewed nation brand and propose a positioning model for rebranding negatively viewed nation brand identity. The study reveals that nation brand association and identity redeployment in post genocide or natural disaster are critical resources for an effective nation rebranding exercise. The study provides insights on how tourism marketers can successfully leverage nation rebranding to stimulate tourism in the aftermath of a disaster. It proposes a theoretical framework for nation rebranding in post atrocity in emerging markets.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Nation branding theory is an area of academic endeavour that is gradually witnessing a burgeoning of literature. Nation branding as a distinctive practice is a very recent development in marketing literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1468797612444196">Jansen, 2008</xref>), subject to hot debates, controversies and arguments among practitioners and academics. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1468797612444196">Anholt (2000)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1468797612444196">Olins (2001)</xref> argue that a nation can be branded or rebranded, while <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1468797612444196">Girard (1999)</xref> disagrees, contending that a nation such as France could not be rebranded in the same way as a corporation or a product. This controversy notwithstanding, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-1468797612444196">Srikatanyoo and Gnoth (2002)</xref> argue that nations engage in competitive marketing strategies in order to improve their brand images, identities and reputations in the global market, with the intention of boosting their exports and stimulating inflow in investment, tourism, education and services.</p>
<p>However, little attention has been given to theorising on rebranding negatively viewed nation brands, which can be described as those perceived by international audiences as being characterised by the absence of distinguishing or marked qualities resulting from large scale deaths in a war, disaster, torture, incarceration, dictatorial rule, drug peddling, money laundering and other crimes. Some scholars have described attraction to such incidences as dark tourism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1468797612444196">Foley and Lennon, 1996</xref>), thanatourism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1468797612444196">Seaton, 1996</xref>), atrocity tourism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1468797612444196">Ashworth, 2004</xref>), morbid tourism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1468797612444196">Blom, 2000</xref>) or black-spot tourism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1468797612444196">Rojek, 1993</xref>), among others. Importantly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1468797612444196">Pezzullo (2009)</xref> argues that the practice of touring in the aftermath of disasters warrants closer examination, illustrating how non- commercial and commercial tourism marketing can offer compelling opportunities for nation rebuilding, enhancing sustainable memories and political critique after a disaster.</p>
<p>This paper concentrates on rebranding a nation after atrocity or political crisis, reviewing literature on nation and destination branding, discussing sources of negatively viewed destination brands, analysing nation rebranding strategies and articulating a positioning model for unattractive destination brands.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1468797612444196">
<title>Nation rebranding</title>
<p>One of the earliest scholarly papers on rebranding was <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1468797612444196">Berry’s (1988)</xref> analysis of Ogilvy and Mather’s brand revitalisation strategy. Subsequently, there have been rising academic theoretical developments about corporate rebranding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1468797612444196">Ewing et al, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1468797612444196">Merrilees and Miller, 2008</xref>), yet there is a dearth of research studies on the concept of nation rebranding. There have been campaigns that attempt to refute negative place-images. For instance, Amsterdam’s ‘City on the Water’ rebranding campaign was aimed at promoting a genteel tourist destination in contrast with its image of sexual liberalism and narcotics indulgence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1468797612444196">Bennett and Savani, 2003</xref>). In addition, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1468797612444196">Gotham (2007)</xref> observed increased strategic rebranding campaigns to reposition New Orleans as an entertainment city following the Hurricane Katrina crisis.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, in the last decade, there has been a slow rise in studies of nation rebranding. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1468797612444196">Olins (2004)</xref> has used historical analysis to contextualise nation rebranding practices in 19th century France and 20th century post-colonial nations such as Ghana, Sri Lanka, Zimbabwe, Indonesia, Pakistan and Bangladesh. Some countries such as Japan, Ireland, Germany, Scotland, New Zealand, Croatia, Slovenia and South Korea have rebranded themselves with the intention to enhance public perception of their brands, subsequently adding enormous benefits to their economies and self-respect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1468797612444196">Anholt, 2004</xref>). The Rebranding of Nigeria campaign was aimed at improving its image locally and internationally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1468797612444196">Agba et al., 2009</xref>). In addition, countries such as Oman, the United Arab Emirates and Qatar have tried to rebrand themselves by projecting positive images of open nations receptive to business, investment and political liberalism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1468797612444196">Cooper and Momani, 2009</xref>). The Labour government rebranded Britain overseas as a modernising nation at the forefront of the world’s knowledge economy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1468797612444196">Lee, 2001</xref>). Likewise, the rebranding of the ‘shining’ new India in the 1990s was premised on feel-good, militarised ‘Hindu’ IT and economic super-power (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-1468797612444196">Shani, 2004</xref>). Spain also provides an example of successful nation rebranding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1468797612444196">Fan, 2006</xref>). Though these studies discuss how some nations have been rebranded successfully, none of them articulate a theoretical framework for rebranding an unattractive nation brand.</p>
<sec id="section3-1468797612444196">
<title>Nation branding</title>
<p>Some studies of nation brand image (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1468797612444196">Olins, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-1468797612444196">Srikatanyoo and Gnoth, 2002</xref>) argue that a favourable nation image is crucial to the success of tourism marketing. The popularity of this notion among some marketing and tourism scholars has prompted some researchers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1468797612444196">Fakeye and Crompton, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-1468797612444196">Tasci and Gartner, 2007</xref>) to undertake conceptual and empirical studies of nation or destination image formation process, and to propose methods of measuring it.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1468797612444196">Aronczyk (2008)</xref> argues that nation branding allows national governments to better manage and control the image they project to the world, and to attract the ‘right’ kinds of investment, tourism, trade and talent, successfully competing with a growing pool of national contenders for a shrinking set of available resources. These resources include not only those available in a deregulated global marketplace, but also the coveted rewards of the so-called ‘attention economy’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1468797612444196">2008</xref>: 42). Nation branding also involves applying branding and marketing communication techniques to promote a nation’s image (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1468797612444196">Fan, 2006</xref>). In addition, nation branding is an engine of neo-liberalism that explicitly embraces a reductive logic, which privileges market relations (market fundamentalism) in articulations of national identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1468797612444196">Jansen, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Developing coherent and comprehensive nation brands is of vital importance for transitional countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1468797612444196">Nuttavuthisit, 2007</xref>). Some countries that emerge from the rubble of political upheavals, mass killing, natural disasters, genocide and holocaust have decided to apply nation rebranding strategy to change their negatively perceived identities. This is a conscious transition from negative nation brand identity, stereotypes and prejudices held by tourists and investors to redefining and reconstructing positive nation brand identity after such crises (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1468797612444196">Nuttavuthisit, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1468797612444196">Lampert and Jaffe (1998)</xref> assert that nation image has the potential to enhance consumers’ favourable perception of some brands, offering extrinsic cues that stimulate consumers to make purchase decisions concerning brands from nations with favourable brand names and images (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1468797612444196">Gürhan-Canli and Maheswaran, 2000</xref>). A positive nation brand image can stimulate consumers’ preference for some products and services (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1468797612444196">Lim and Darley, 1997</xref>), including vacation choices. Nations with strong positive brand identities may gain competitive advantage in the global marketplace (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1468797612444196">Kotler and Gertner, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-1468797612444196">Skinner and Kubacki, 2007</xref>), with nation branding practices and discourse promoting export volume, foreign direct investment and tourism revenue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1468797612444196">Dzenovska, 2005</xref>). The branding campaigns of some nations that emerged after the Cold War, such as Montenegro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-1468797612444196">Vitic and Ringer, 2008</xref>), Estonia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1468797612444196">Jansen, 2008</xref>), Latvia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1468797612444196">Dzenovska, 2005</xref>), Slovenia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1468797612444196">Konecnik, 2004</xref>) and Poland (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1468797612444196">Florek, 2005</xref>), were geared toward promoting economic well-being by stimulating high tourism and investment. However, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1468797612444196">Jansen (2008)</xref> warns that nation branding is a risky business that can backfire, since its success depends, in large part, on the intuitive knowledge of individual industry ‘creatives’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1468797612444196">2008</xref>: 121). In order to avert potential risks prevalent in nation branding strategy, it is imperative to heed the advice of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1468797612444196">Dinnie et al. (2010)</xref> that enhanced coordination needs to occur not only between the different governmental organisations engaged in nation branding strategy, but also between those organisations and their respective private sector stakeholders.</p>

<sec id="section4-1468797612444196">
<title>Destination branding</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1468797612444196">Ritchie and Ritchie (1998)</xref> conceive destination brand as a name, symbol, logo, word mark or other graphic that identifies and differentiates the destination, conveys the promise of a memorable travel experience, and consolidates and reinforces the recollection of pleasurable memories of the destination experience. The ability of a tourism marketing manager to ensure that positive and memorable experiences linger in the minds of tourists is a critical resource in destination branding. Studies show that when tourists purchase tourism services, the destination experience is what they are buying (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1468797612444196">Otto and Ritchie, 1996</xref>). Positive destination brand awareness reduces the need for strenuous and detailed information searches, and guides tourists towards the destination of their choice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1468797612444196">Seddighi and Theocharous, 2002</xref>). Destination branding further involves creating and establishing a mutual relationship between destination brands and tourists’ self-images, self-concepts and self-identities in order to satisfy their emotional and basic needs.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1468797612444196">Gould and Skinner (2007)</xref> conceive place branding as a method of promoting a positive image based on an agreed single national identity. They likened the nation branding strategy of the Northern Ireland to the metaphorical Janus whose nature symbolises change and transition, a progression from past to future. That is, Northern Ireland adopted a double-edged branding strategy to market the country as ‘Irish’ in Irish-friendly markets and as ‘British’ in British-friendly markets at an international level; it was aimed at projecting the new identity of a modern, peaceful and forward-thinking nation. It is challenging to rebrand a nation in post conflict or atrocity in the absence of an agreed single national identity, and so nation rebranding in post political conflict, genocide or atrocity should be constructively undertaken with high sense of responsibility to counteract or reformulate the myths, prejudices and stereotypes that result from negative discourse, narratives and ill-conceived judgments about the country.</p>
<p>Creating a unique destination proposition aimed at establishing a competitive identity for a destination should be the starting point in effectively differentiating a nation brand. Failure runs the risk of marketing a destination that is not easily remembered by tourists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1468797612444196">Morgan et al., 2002</xref>) and not clearly differentiated from competing destinations. Alternatively, successful implementation of a unique destination can help to bridge perceptual gaps between a destination’s reputation and attributes presented by a destination marketer. Importantly, a unique destination proposition should be supported with robust visualisation, symbolism, logos, slogans, narratives, discourse and cultural motifs that can create a niche in the minds of tourists.</p>
<p>The more favourable the destination brand image the greater the likelihood of choice. Destination brand images are thus the means by which a prospective tourist determines a destination’s potential for satisfaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1468797612444196">Hankinson, 2004</xref>). The key role of nation rebranding after conflict or natural mishap is to develop a destination as a positive perceptual brand capable of drawing consumers of dark brands from around the world. It is imperative for professionals and academics involved in destination branding to consider a broad suite of values including social, cultural, historical, geographical, symbolic, environmental and economic, in order to fully reflect on what a destination has to offer tourists. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-1468797612444196">Wheeler et al. (2011)</xref> propose the concept of ‘sense of place’ as a theoretical lens through which to view destination branding and suggest that sustainable brands are those that are developed organically, driven by the values held by local brand communities and networks, rather than a more limited consumer-based values being imposed upon a destination.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1468797612444196">Marzano and Scott (2006)</xref> emphasise the importance of stakeholders’ power and their influences on the destination branding process. They advance collaboration theories to underscore the relevance of stakeholders’ power in promoting effective destination branding. However, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1468797612444196">Ndlovu and Heath (2011)</xref> point out that any political conflict could have negative impact and therefore political actors in emerging markets should prevent crises that may impact negatively on their nation’s brand identity and reputation.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1468797612444196">
<title>Sources of unattractive nation brand identity</title>
<p>In many cases, negatively viewed nation brand identity develops out of socio-political and natural accidents rather than by design. That is, sources of negatively viewed nation brand can be manmade such as holocaust, genocide, mass killing, torture camp, prison and penal sites, which are avoidable, while others are due to natural occurrences such as earthquake, tsunami and hurricane. Example of sources of negatively viewed nation brand identity include the following: the killing fields in Choeung Ek and Tuol Sleng, Cambodia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1468797612444196">Hughes, 2008</xref>), where Pol Pot and his Khmer Rouge government killed about 1.7 million Cambodians, almost 21 percent of the population, between 1975 and 1979; the Srebrenica genocide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1468797612444196">Miller, 2006</xref>) that occurred in July 1995 in which more than 8000 Bosnian Muslims were killed by Bosnian Serbs, leading to the exodus of between 25,000 and 30,000 Bosnian Muslims from their homes in and around the town of Srebrenica; the Rwanda genocide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1468797612444196">Grosspietsch, 2005</xref>) that occurred between April and July 1994, when the militias of Hutu ethnic majority, the <italic>Interahamwe</italic> and the <italic>Impuzamugambi</italic>, supported by the Hutu-led government, gruesomely murdered about 800,000 Tutsi minority in Kigali.</p>
<p>The term ‘dark tourism’ connotes travel to sites associated with death, disaster, atrocity, suffering and others, often involving the presentation and consumption of real or recreated death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1468797612444196">Lennon and Foley, 1999</xref>). Dark tourism takes many forms. Thanatourism involves travel to locations motivated by the desire for actual or symbolic encounters with sites of violent death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1468797612444196">Seaton, 1996</xref>) due to their historic and memorial values, such as at Ground Zero in New York. Dark attraction or black spot tourism is the commercialisation of gravesites and locations where celebrities or large numbers of human beings have met with sudden and violent death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1468797612444196">Rojek, 1993</xref>). Grief tourism involves visiting scenes of tragic accident such as Chernobyl nuclear accident in Ukraine, whereas disaster tourism refers to travel to sites of natural disaster such as the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami or Haiti’s earthquake. Suicide tourism involves travel to places where people intentionally commit suicide, for example by jumping from the top of landmarks, or where the terminally ill people commit suicide through euthanasia. Penal tourism refers to visiting sites of penal punishment and incarceration such as at Alcatraz in the United States and Robben Island in South Africa, where prisons have been converted into museums or heritage sites. Heritage atrocity tourism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1468797612444196">Ashworth, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1468797612444196">Austin, 2002</xref>) concerns touring locations of mass murder and tragedy, such as Auschwitz-Birkenau in Poland, or the killing fields of Cambodia or Kigali in Rwanda. Nevertheless, dark tourism is a controversial term among scholars and the above typologies are subject to debate.</p>
<p>At this juncture, we will discuss how to rebrand and reposition negatively viewed nation brand identity below.</p>
</sec></sec>
<sec id="section6-1468797612444196">
<title>Nation rebranding strategy</title>
<p>Nation rebranding after genocide, mass killing or natural disaster involves initiating progressive reform and making a radical break with past socio-political policies that precipitated the mayhem or caused the disaster. It involves designing a new nation brand vision, core nation brand ideology, concept and values to ensure they are relevant to the contemporary conditions. Maintaining a nexus between the negative nation brand and the new nation brand identity may be counter-productive. The negative nation brand heritage may be abandoned, as in the case of Cambodia under Pol Pot and after the Rwandan genocide, replaced with a new nation brand built on a new vision, political culture and economic prosperity.</p>
<p>Effective nation rebranding requires consistency between internal rebranding and external rebranding strategies, especially aligning behaviours of top political office-holders in the presidential or prime ministerial office, ministries, national and state institutions, local counties, diplomatic missions, including employees of public and private institutions and all citizens, through focused and strategic planning and implementation. Nation brand orientation succeeds when internal stakeholders develop brand ownership and live the nation brand culture in their daily script (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-1468797612444196">Urde, 1999</xref>) at all brand touchpoints. Thus a new customer service culture based on the new nation brand ideology should be imbibed by top public service employees down to ordinary citizens. In addition, the nation brand executive must ensure that front office personnel at all brand touchpoints in the airports, seaports, government ministries, tourist destinations, hotels, restaurants, embassies, museums, galleries and others act and live the new nation brand script consistently with the newly espoused nation brand personality. Effective nation rebranding requires the national brand executive to ensure integration and coordination of the marketing mix to reposition the new nation brand ideology and identity in the minds of stakeholders.</p>
<sec id="section7-1468797612444196">
<title>Positioning nation brand identity</title>
<p>Some scholars have amplified the central role of positioning in destination marketing. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1468797612444196">Pike and Ryan (2004)</xref> underscore the role of cognitive, affective and conative perceptions in destination positioning. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1468797612444196">Sarma (2003)</xref> emphasises the importance of determining tourists’ preferences and matching them with their perceptions in order to arrive at preferred positioning of a destination. In addition, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1468797612444196">Govers and Go’s (2009)</xref> model advanced three ways in which the strength of a place brand as experienced by the host–guest, and between culturally diverse groups, might be affected. Based on their view, we argue that brand managers can build dark/atrocity brands by projecting their uniqueness through consistent narratives, delivering their experience effectively to dark tourists to avoid a disappointing experience, and projecting a consistently unified brand image in order to avoid a skewed image often caused by different cultural interpretations of brand image, situational influences and biased word-of-mouth. Positioning is the perceptual distance between two brands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1468797612444196">Sayman et al., 2002</xref>), the process of establishing a distinctive place for a destination in the minds of the travellers in the target markets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1468797612444196">Crompton et al., 1992</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1468797612444196">Baloglu and McCleary (1999)</xref> contend that the development of a positioning strategy consists of (1) identifying a target market’s images of a destination, (2) comparing these images with those of competitors, and (3) selecting destination attributes that meet the needs and wants of travellers, whilst differentiating a destination from its competitors.</p>
<p>However, the positioning process of a negatively viewed nation brand in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1468797612444196">Figure 1</xref> below starts with the development and communication of new nation brand concept, ideology, vision and identity to dark/atrocity and general interest tourists. It includes identifying tourists, evaluating their interests, segmenting them, matching destination attributes with their interests, and identifying brand values that will benefit them. It also involves developing unique propositions that will capture their attention, creating positioning statements, communicating brand messages and evaluating tourist satisfaction. Importantly, the positioning and propositional statements should be sobering, empathising, educative and informative, and less solicitous. The promotional statements should be commemorative, restorative and preservative rather than commercial. Therefore, positioning brochures need be richly informative and commemorative, relatively conservative, and devoid of the glossy embellishments that often characterise services or positive destination marketing.</p>

<p>It is imperative to provide ample interpretive texts and photographs in all the areas of the atrocity heritage museums and genocide memorials to give tourists rich information. Essentially, interpretation staff should be on hand to provide information and explanations on the images and objects on display, the historical circumstances leading to the horror, the lessons learnt from the tragic accident, and the new way forward charted by the new leadership. Finally, positioning statements and promotional messages for unfavourable nation brand should be concise and consistently articulated to establish the brand firmly in the minds of dark and atrocity tourists and other consumers interested in historical heritage experiences.</p>
<p>Unlike natural and manmade attractions, positioning horrifying scenes of killing and torture carries grave ethical concerns; its objective should be memorial rather than commercial. Effective positioning of unattractive nation brand should be directly connected with a desired nation brand image and identity to be established in the minds of the tourists, which should be commemorative, symbolic, functional, unique and distinctive. A major objective must be to change deeply held prejudices and stereotypes that already exist in the minds of some potential tourists and international investors. The marketers and suppliers of dark tourisms need to understand the model shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1468797612444196">Figure 1</xref> and deploy it effectively while marketing locations in nations with unattractive destination brands. Positioning an atrocity/dark tourism brand can be more effective if it is supported with nation brand identity management strategy.</p>

<title>Nation brand identity management process</title>
<p>Scholars such as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1468797612444196">Balmer (1995)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-1468797612444196">van Riel (1995)</xref> have offered insightful ideas on effective corporate identity management. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1468797612444196">Markwick and Fill’s (1995)</xref> corporate identity management process comprises corporate personality analysis, corporate identity development and communication to stakeholders to enhance corporate image and reputation. While these studies enrich our understanding of brand identity management, it must be emphasised that nations are too complex to be branded in the same way as products or services (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1468797612444196">Anholt, 2005</xref>) in comparison with corporate, product and service brands.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the nation brand identity management process should consist of systematic presentation through messages, cues and the visual identity of a nation’s positive attributes, values, including cultural, economic and touristic signals to its various stakeholders through a variety of communication channels, to enable the stakeholders to distinguish that nation from other nations. A nation whose personality, image, identity and reputation are adversely affected by genocide, mass killing, penal torture or natural disaster requires a great deal of marketing creativity to endear itself to global tourists and other stakeholders. In a situation where genocide is externally inflicted, as in the case of Bosnian Serbs against Srebrenica Muslims (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1468797612444196">Miller, 2006</xref>), there is high possibility of genuine international sympathy that the nation can leverage to project distinctively sober and empathetic brand identity to tourists. However, where the genocide is internally motivated as in the case of Pol Pot’s Khmer Rouge in Cambodia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1468797612444196">Hughes, 2008</xref>) and Hutus against Tutsis in Rwanda (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1468797612444196">Grosspietsch, 2005</xref>), there is likelihood of ambivalent responses – revulsion and sympathy – from different segments of the international community and tourists.</p>
<p>Post genocide or disaster nation brand identity management starts with a critical examination of the internal and external environments that provoked the crisis. A nation that suffers genocide, mass killing and disaster should identify the positive symbolic, historical and functional elements of the tragedy to develop empathetic messages, themes and slogans, including educative, informative, commemorative and interpretive materials, to foster sustained communication with stakeholder groups. It is imperative that the nation communicates its background, what led to the genocide, the lessons that can be leant from it, how the lessons have been internalised and the future of the nation. The symbolic historic elements are emotional attributes that should form the bulk of the themes and messages disseminated to stakeholders in ways that touch the parts of the human psyche that may be difficult for rational arguments to penetrate. More functional elements consist of rational and utilitarian dimensions of the destination. Together, innovative blending and creative packaging of symbolic and functional elements may project clear and distinct nation brand themes, slogans, signals and messages that differentiate the nation brand identity from others. The messages should be communicated to stakeholders through print and electronic media, including videos, booklets, commercials, flyers and souvenirs, as well through diplomatic policy engagements, cultural, musical and sports sponsorships, foreign direct investment strategies, national air and shipping lines, commodity and cultural exports, the public spheres, tourists’ word of mouth, and others. In addition, use of international media including holistic digital platforms such as websites, search engines, blogs, mobile and social media, and e-commerce may equally enhance engagement and interaction, destination brand awareness and association.</p>
<p>Global media representations and presentations of genocide and torture sites may spur dark tourists into impulse purchases. The international media concentration of news reports on some sites of mass deaths invariably influence public discourse and set public agenda, which helps in creating awareness in a large segment of the international audiences. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1468797612444196">Iwashita (2006)</xref> contends that representations and images of tourist destinations constructed by popular cultural forms of media, such as films, television and literature, play a significant role in influencing people’s holiday decision-making process, powerfully promoting and reinforcing particular images, views and identities of destinations. In view of this, we believe that the video footages of tragic events relayed on the international television networks can encourage dark or heritage tourists to visit such sites of horror. Tourism marketers should note that global perception of nation brand identity is formed by a combination of perceptual (cognitive) and affective (emotive) evaluations of the place (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-1468797612444196">Stern and Krakover, 1993</xref>). Knowledge about national brand attributes is represented by its perceptual component (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1468797612444196">Baloglu and McCleary, 1999</xref>), whereas the emotive component is knowledge about its affective quality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1468797612444196">Genereux et al., 1983</xref>). However, it is essential to redeploy new nation identity to stakeholders in post genocide or natural disaster for identity management to be effective.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1468797612444196">
<title>Nation brand identity redeployment</title>
<p>There is research evidence on brand redeployment in situations where corporations decide to change their names, identities, images and personalities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1468797612444196">Jaju et al., 2006</xref>). Mostly these brand name redeployment activities are traceable to mergers, acquisitions, sponsorship, strategic alliances, cobranding deals, corporate and product brands repositioning exercise among others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1468797612444196">Jaju et al., 2006</xref>). A nation whose brand name and identity have been impacted negatively due to genocide, mass killing or natural disaster has to undertake rebranding strategy either through brand name change or identity modification, and subsequently redeploy the new brand identity to its stakeholders. However, unlike corporations, nation rebranding and nation brand name redeployment are intricately complex exercises. However, we propose vertical and horizontal nation brand identity redeployment strategies for effective nation rebranding.</p>
<sec id="section10-1468797612444196">
<title>Vertical nation brand identity redeployment strategy</title>
<p>Vertical nation brand identity redeployment consists of communicating brand identity, personality and attributes top down to stakeholder networks in the form of a command chain. Vertical nation brand redeployment starts with destination brand attributes, benefits and characteristics dissemination by executives through various channels and lines of authority to the lowest cadre of stakeholder groups. Brand messages, slogans, themes and cues are communicated to stakeholders in the form of information, direction and instruction characteristic of a master–servant relationship; this approach is devoid of mutual partnership. The problem with such vertical strategy is the likelihood for brand redeployment messages to be modified in the process of disseminating them through the cascade of stakeholder groups, so that they may be omitted or inaccurately transmitted. The net effects of distorted brand messages transmission are formation of multiplicity of brand images, brand misalignment, identity dissonance, brand image and personality confusion, and loss of reputation among stakeholders, which may lead to stakeholders’ inability to differentiate brand identity effectively from competing nations.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1468797612444196">
<title>Lateral or horizontal nation brand identity redeployment</title>
<p>Lateral or horizontal nation brand identity redeployment involves communicating new nation brand attributes, identity and personality to key consumers and stakeholder groups. This process enables the executive to communicate nation brand personality directly with target stakeholders without passing messages and benefits through several cascade levels of group networks. Given the elasticity of horizontal nation brand redeployment, each stakeholder segment within the group network has direct access to brand messages, identity cues and signals reception, evaluation, processing and sharing. Lateral national brand redeployment is designed primarily to promote partnership, equality and mutual relationship in messages, nodes, cues and signals sharing among partners, promoting enhanced stakeholder loyalty, commitment, trust and robust partnership. It promotes timely resolution of conflicting messages, increased brand equity and reputational capital, as well as sustainable competitive advantage and performance.</p>

<sec id="section12-1468797612444196">
<title>Nation brand association strategy</title>
<p>Marketing scholars (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1468797612444196">Aaker, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1468797612444196">Brown and Dacin, 1997</xref>) have underscored the primacy of consumers’ cognitive associations in product and corporate brand associations. Brand association relies on a meaning transfer process based on associative learning theory, where multiple stimuli are repeatedly linked together to enhance association and relationship. Cognitive associations play a crucial role in consumers’ evaluation and choice of a product or services brand. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-1468797612444196">Van Osselaer and Janiszewski (2001)</xref> argue that brand associations are fundamental to brand inference making, product brand evaluation, consumer persuasion and brand equity. It is argued that association influences perception of a brand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1468797612444196">O’Shaughnessy and O’Shaughnessy, 2000</xref>). One of the underlying assumptions is that consumers use brand names, identity and attributes as retrieval cues to obtain information about brand performance. Associative memory theory asserts that declarative knowledge is represented as a network of nodes connected by links that are strengthened each time two events co-occur. The onus of this is that the more a brand name co-occurs with brand benefits and attributes, the stronger the link formed between the brand name and the benefits by consumers. Invariably, the stronger the link that tourists are able to form with a nation brand and its perceived benefits, the more likely for them to form association with it and visit such a nation.</p>
<p>Besides human associative theory, marketers of a nation with unattractive destination brands need to understand how to apply other conditioning theories. For example, using adaptive network theory <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-1468797612444196">van Osselaer and Janiszewski (2001)</xref> argue that association strengths update and evolves as cues interact, and often compete, to predict outcomes. Further, contiguity theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1468797612444196">Guthrie, 1959</xref>) states that overtime stimuli and responses that are paired together in space and time will become associated together. That is, a combination of stimuli leading to particular responses will lead to those same responses when repeated. Contiguity theory emphasises pairing of multiple stimuli, repetition of stimuli, and simultaneity of stimuli and responses. In addition, similarity theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1468797612444196">Duck, 1994</xref>) posits that stimuli with similar referents that are paired together will probably become associated over time. Duck’s theory explains the influence of similarity and attraction in the persuasive process. Likewise, similarity–attraction theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1468797612444196">Byrne, 1971</xref>) holds that attraction toward an individual is a linear function of attitudinal similarity with that person.</p>
<p>In our attempt to translate the imports of these theories into the nation branding context, we argue that the tourists learn cues and nodes independently; those cues and nodes interact to condition their minds to elicit particular responses to destination campaigns. This enables them to infer similarity between their personalities and nation brand attributes, aids their perception of nation brand benefits and ultimately influences their travel decision-making to a destination that forms congruity with their attributes. Consequently, the consumption of dark tourism brand is a function of effective association between the brand and preferences of tourists. The consumption of a dark destination also depends on how the brand message can productively aid tourists’ prediction of its promises and benefits effectively. Moreover, marketers should ensure nation brand image and identity transfer to the consumers of dark and heritage tourisms by relying on the effective use of associations transfer and conditioning response mechanisms. This can enable destination marketers to form associative relationship between networks of tourists and different types of dark tourism, their attributes and promises. Importantly, the extent to which tourists are able to form similarities and a relationship between their personal attributes and a national brand attribute will determine the likelihood of their being attracted to the brand. Finally, insights from the contiguity approach can enhance the creative pairing of dark attraction brands with memorial cultural heritage brands, in order to influence tourists to simultaneously consume those brands during a visit to dark spots.</p>

<sec id="section13-1468797612444196">
<title>Nation brand image and identity differentiation</title>
<p>The effects of destination image on individual’s subjective perception, subsequent behaviour and eventual destination choice have been acknowledged by scholars (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1468797612444196">McCartney et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1468797612444196">Schneider and Sönmez, 1999</xref>). Nation image has the potential to enhance consumers’ favourable perception of some brands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1468797612444196">Lampert and Jaffe, 1998</xref>). It offers extrinsic cues that stimulate consumers to make purchase decisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1468797612444196">Cordell, 1992</xref>). It can generate consumers’ preference for products and services (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1468797612444196">Lim and Darley, 1997</xref>). Nation brand image is a net result of all the experiences, beliefs, feelings, knowledge and impressions that tourists have about a destination.</p>
<p>Consistent redeployment of empathetic, sober, compassionate and commemorative messages, cues and signals to dark or heritage tourists has the potential to shape, influence and persuade them to etch a commemorative image of the nation in their minds. Focused communication deployment of positive aspects of heritage destination attributes can stimulate stakeholders’ behaviours toward establishing a common image and vision of reality to consume a memorial tourism brand. Deployment of commemorative images, visuals, themes, slogans, cues and nodes, including sober and empathetic interpretive materials, can associate tourists with heritage and memorial destinations. In addition, when commemorative images and visuals of heritage tourism are supported with nation image advertising that reinforces symbolism of spiritual reflection, they can persuade heritage and memorial tourists to actively engage in cognitive reconstruction of positive image of a ‘pilgrimage’ associated with memorial destinations. When positioning statements stimulate dark tourists to indulge in watching real or recreated death, it may offer them an opportunity to construct spiritual image and representation of mortality. Consumption of dark tourism for memorial, commemorative, entertainment and education purposes can offer tourists a pragmatic mechanism to conceptualise the positive image of neutralising the fear of mortality and develop strategies to cope with its inevitability. Ultimately, the symbolic spiritual reflection and ‘pilgrimage’ inherent in dark tourism can be reinforced through arousing the curiosity of the tourists.</p>
<sec id="section14-1468797612444196">
<title>Creating engagement through curiosity</title>
<p>Playing on human’s psychological states may create action and facilitate engagement. Dark tourism brands should be packaged with elements of curiosity, identified as a motivating force behind some consumption practices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1468797612444196">Belk, 1997</xref>). Theoretical conceptualisation of curiosity is based on the knowledge gap perspective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1468797612444196">Loewenstein, 1994</xref>), the difference between what a person knows and what she/he would have loved to know. It is characterised by inquisitive behaviour to explore, investigate, observe and learn new ideas, and has potential to motivate tourists to take action and eventually develop engagement. Curiosity-stimulating nation brand identity communication, including visual, graphic and artistic creativity on printed materials, can attract attention, increase interest, and educate tourists about brand promises and positioning statements, eliciting curiosity in dark tourists. Some disasters resulting in the destruction of human beings draw the curious from around the world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-1468797612444196">Strange and Kempa, 2003</xref>). The underlying motivation behind the increasing tourists’ consumption of death camps may be morbid curiosity, for instance, where sudden death quickly attracts large numbers of people (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1468797612444196">Blom, 2000</xref>), though some tourists may visit atrocity locations simply for a unique activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1468797612444196">Best, 2007</xref>).</p>

<title>Leveraging Nietzschean tragic joy: A consumer-demand driven strategy</title>
<p>Leveraging Nietzschean tragic joy in dark tourism can enhance its appeal to its consumers and stimulate high in-flow of visitors. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1468797612444196">Nietzsche (1967)</xref> conceives tragedy as a poetic and musical art, the art of sensual acceptance of the tragic reality and rejoicing in a tragic fate. Comprehending the world from the standpoint of suffering, Nietzsche finds the secret of joy in the mystery of tragedy. Some scholars contend that dark tourists like listening to stories of humans butchered and starved to death, or embark on a spiritual re-awakening to empathise with the pains of death as in Cambodia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1468797612444196">Hughes, 2008</xref>), Rwanda (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1468797612444196">Grosspietsch, 2005</xref>), Srebrenica (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1468797612444196">Miller, 2006</xref>) and Dachau (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1468797612444196">Marcuse, 2001</xref>). In addition, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1468797612444196">Mills (1993)</xref> confirms in an attitude interpretation study that tragedy appeals to people more than pleasant events. Thus a nation with unattractive brand identity resulting from tragedy and disaster can leverage the hidden and often ironic Nietzschean joy in tragedy to persuade and attract consumers of dark and heritage tourism. Unlike positive destination brand marketing, dark destination brands are in many cases consumer-demand driven rather than supply-driven. Importantly, media presentation and distribution of tragic news events to potential consumers of dark tourism indirectly whet their appetite to consume horror spots, enhancing the pull strategy associated with Nietzschean tragic joy. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1468797612444196">Mercille (2005)</xref> establishes the effects of the media on representations of destination image in the minds of the tourists, while <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1468797612444196">Lennon and Foley (2000)</xref> underscore the powers of global communication technologies in heightened interest in the consumption of genocide, torture, penal and prison memorials. Global media representations and presentations of genocide and torture sites may potentially spur tourists into impulse travel decision-making. The international media concentration of news reports on some sites of mass deaths invariably influence public discourse and set public agenda, which helps in creating awareness in a large pool of international audiences. However, marketing Nietzschean tragic joy should be done ethically for memorial purposes rather than for profit-making drive.</p>
</sec></sec>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>This study has some limitations. As a conceptual study, its assumptions have not been empirically tested, and because it focuses on emerging markets, its assumptions may not be easily generalised. However, in providing a theoretical framework for nation rebranding for nations that suffer genocide, torture and natural disaster, we argue that it has fundamental implications for managers of tourism marketing. Essentially, nation rebranding is more of political exercise than marketing communication, therefore, good knowledge of public affairs, state bureaucratic mechanism, attitude of civil service employees, conduct of government business and political culture are prerequisites for tourism managers involved in this exercise. Importantly, they require the creative blending of symbolic, historical and functional elements of the tragedy to develop empathetic messages, themes and slogans. Moreover, they should bear in mind that nation rebranding carries grave ethical responsibilities, and so promotional messages should only be educative, informative and commemorative rather than overtly commercial.</p>
<p>Tourism managers should be aware that some nation rebranding projects failed to achieve desired purposes due to poor understanding of rebranding strategies, a mismatch between national identity and culture, and the lack of a dedicated brand executive in government. For example, Cool Britannia failed because it jettisoned all cultural and historical images associated with Britain in favour of trendy images; Beers’ rebranding of the US campaign turned out to be a disaster because it was anchored on a communication blitz rather than the complete overhaul of the US brand; and a Kenyan rebranding initiative failed because it lacked top brand executives in government.</p>
<p>Tourism managers should acquaint themselves with vertical and horizontal nation brand redeployment strategies to communicate a new nation brand identity to stakeholders in the post disaster rebranding process. In addition, they should understand the nitty-gritty of human associative, contiguity, similarity and similarity-attraction theories, and how to utilise them to facilitate nation brand association and the meaning transfer process in the minds of stakeholders.</p>
<p>The creative incorporation of a Nietzschean tragic joy in dark tourism promotion campaign can draw also some dark tourists. Destination brand promotion managers should learn the skill of blending Nietzschean tragic joy with dark destination brand messages. The nation brand executive should ensure consistency in the alignment of the attitudes and behaviours of the public service employees in culture and tourism, and external affairs ministries, airports and seaports, and export departments with the nation brand personality. Moreover, the alignment of the behaviour of employees of private companies such as hotel and hospitality, leisure, entertainment, transportation, telecommunication and others with the nation brand identity is crucial in order to project a unified and holistic nation brand personality to tourists.</p>
<p>Finally, the skilful use of curiosity tools in dark brand promotion can draw tourists’ attention, increase interest and enhance nation brand attributes and personality learning. This is because when dark destination marketers build high curiosity in tourists, they generate alertness and interest, change resistance to willingness, avoidance to involvement, and hesitation to the consumption of dark destinations.</p>
