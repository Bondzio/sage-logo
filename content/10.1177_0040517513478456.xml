<abstract>
<p>The current military ballistic vest, with its ceramic plates, weighs over 8 kg, and there is a gap between the body and clothing owing to the flat shape of the military ballistic vest. Moreover, since the weight is concentrated on the shoulders, it is likely to exacerbate musculoskeletal pains and fatigue. Although reducing the weight of the military ballistic vest is very important for military operations, it is difficult to decrease the weight because the selection of materials and textiles is limited to protecting the wearer against ballistic hazards. Therefore, this study proposes ways to distribute the weight of a ballistic vest more uniformly using three-dimensional (3D) technology, so that comfort is maximized under identical weight conditions. The impact from the military ballistic vest and its vector magnitude, depending on the fit of the military ballistic vest during jumping, were also analyzed. For the experiment, 3D-scanned body data of average Korean males were used to design a military ballistic vest that is well fitted to a real human body. A wear test was also performed to investigate how effectively a fitted military ballistic vest is able to evenly distribute the weight compared to a loosely fitted military ballistic vest. In addition, the pressure sensation of the wearer was analyzed to investigate the overall performance of developed military ballistic vests.</p>

<body>
<p>Reducing the weight of the military ballistic vest is an important issue in the comfort of soldiers, when executing military operations, because the weight of the military ballistic vest excluding other equipment is approximately 8 kg.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0040517513478456">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0040517513478456">2</xref></sup> It has been reported that shoulder fatigue and pain increase owing to the heavy weight of the military ballistic vest or when soldiers walk, run, and jump in the field.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0040517513478456">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0040517513478456"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0040517513478456">5</xref></sup> More specifically, the total number of stair steps, pull-ups, hurdles, and wall climbs, as well as the durations for hang time and uphill walking decrease by 16–63% and the rate of performing those activities also decreases by 12–44%, when soldiers wear a heavy military ballistic vest.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0040517513478456">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0040517513478456">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0040517513478456">7</xref></sup> The heavy weight of the military ballistic vest also burdens soldiers physiologically. Heart rate and oxygen consumption (VO<sub>2</sub>) increase to a greater extent during physical exertion when wearing the military ballistic vest.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0040517513478456">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0040517513478456"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0040517513478456">8</xref></sup> It was noted that the rectal temperature increases as the weight of the clothing increases with the full set of armor.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0040517513478456">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>It is clear that the weight of the military ballistic vest influences the comfort and performance of the soldiers; however, it is difficult to reduce the weight of the military ballistic vest due to the ceramic plates and several layers of aramid fabric that are necessary for protection. Under the condition of constant weight, the impact of a ballistic vest on specific protruding body areas may be reduced by distributing the weight of the vest over a larger area. To reduce the impact on specific areas from jumping, distributing the load of the ballistic vest to the thorax in addition to the shoulder is helpful. This can be realized by using three-dimensional (3D) technology to enhance the 3D fit of the ballistic vest around the torso. Consequently, the load of the ballistic vest over the torso is distributed more uniformly than that of an improperly fitted ballistic vest, in which greater pressure or physical burden is concentrated on the shoulders. In a similar context, Birrell and Haslam<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0040517513478456">3</xref></sup> found that distributing the load of a military carriage system was beneficial for the kinetics of human gait, where they noted that distributing the load evenly on the trunk reduced the maximum braking force. However, an approach to decrease the impact of a ballistic vest on the shoulders in a 3D clothing system has not yet been reported. If we adopt 3D technology in the design of the military ballistic vest to widen the contact area between the ballistic vest and skin surface, we might be able to reduce the problematic load burdening on the shoulders, when soldiers jump and run vigorously.</p>
<p>The focus of this study was to conduct a quantitative investigation of the impact of military ballistics vests on the shoulders by comparing current two-dimensional (2D) vests to newly developed 3D vests shaped to redistribute the weight of the vest on the body. In order to determine the impact of the military ballistic vest on the shoulder, depending on the fit of the vest during jumping, experiments were conducted under the following conditions: when the 3D military ballistic vest was well fitted to the human body, and when it was not, either by loosening the Velcro straps of the vest or by use of a conventional 2D military ballistic vest. Moreover, to investigate the dynamics of the subjects and the ballistic vests, their vector magnitudes (VMs) were measured simultaneously when the subject was wearing the ballistic vest and jumping.</p>
<sec id="sec1-0040517513478456"><title>Experimental methods</title>
<sec id="sec2-0040517513478456"><title>Tested military ballistic vest</title>
<p>To test the effect of fit on impact, the following types of ballistics vests were examined in this experiment: (1) the current 2D vest with flat ceramic plates; (2) a specially designed 3D vest with body-shaped ceramic plates; and (3) the same 3D vest worn in a loose configuration. By using 3D technology, a well-fitted ballistic vest with ceramic plates shaped in accordance with the curves of the human body was designed. This 3D ballistic vest was produced based on 3D body data of Korean males in their twenties obtained from SizeKorea 2005, which provides 3D-scanned data of Koreans (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0040517513478456">Figure 1(a)</xref>). The inner-layer pattern of the 3D ballistic vest was designed, based on the assumption that the vest is worn above the military uniform, by offsetting the 3D body data by 1 cm with the Rapidform XOR program. Hence, the space between the body and the 3D ballistic vest is assumed to be evenly distributed. This offset ensured sufficient room for undergarments and other clothing. Then, by using the 2 C-AN program, the offset data were developed as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0040517513478456">Figure 1(b)</xref>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0040517513478456">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0040517513478456">11</xref></sup> The outer layer was constructed to cover 41 layers of aramid fabric (about 1 cm), and the ceramic plates were inserted into the outermost built-in pockets on the back and front of the vest. The 3D ballistic vest was constructed as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0040517513478456">Figure 1(c)</xref>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0040517513478456">12</xref></sup> The outer layer, ceramic plates, aramid layers, and their cover were constructed to follow the 3D shape of the body. In the case of the aramid fabrics, we differentiated the fabric cutting of 41 layers to match the contour to the 3D shape as much as possible. To design the ceramic plates, we considered the 3D shape of the torso as well as the layered system of the ballistic vest.

<p>To achieve more rigorous control of the “fit” of the vest in order to test its effect on the impact upon the shoulder, we used the same 3D ballistic vest and loosened it by using Velcro taping. That is, we included “3D-fitted” and “3D-loose” conditions, which were identical except for how the vest was worn. Hence, by loosening the Velcro straps on the shoulders and waist, the 3D-fitted ballistic vest could be changed to a 3D-loose ballistic vest (this is highly useful when wearers feel hot and humid while resting during military operations). To evaluate the improvement of the developed ballistic vest compared with a conventional armor vest, we used a commercial 2D ballistic vest as the control, which contains the same number and thickness of aramid layers. Both aramid layers are made of typical flame-resistant fabrics used for a ballistic vest; however, the main concern of this manuscript is the geometrical feature and its influences on the function of the ballistic vest. The ceramic plate is the same thickness of the 3D vests, but the shapes are different. Although this 2D ballistic vest fits the body fairly well, the extra space between the body and clothing is uneven. Both ceramic plates and aramid fabrics were also used in the 2D ballistic vest; however, the shape of the ceramic plates and aramid layers was flat. In addition, the weights of the 3D and 2D ballistic vests were matched to about 8.5 kg by adding weight to the braid sewn onto the 3D vest at the waist.</p>

<sec id="sec3-0040517513478456"><title>Measurements of pressure and dynamics of the ballistic vest during jumping</title>
<p>The weight of the military ballistic vest itself can cause fatigue and pain. Moreover, if the soldiers run and jump, the acceleration of the vest is expected to increase, which in turn increases the impact. According to preliminary tests, subjects felt more uncomfortable during jumping than during ordinary walking or running. For this reason, we chose to investigate the interaction between the human body and the ballistic vest, with a focus on its fit near the shoulders—a factor highly related to the pressure distribution of the impulse from jumping. The 20 repetitions led to improved consistency in the measurements and allowed a reasonable time for subjects to rate their sensations of pressure. To complete 20 jumps, the subjects required about 13 s. The results from the 20 repetitions showed a consistent mode of jumping, and subjects felt no fatigue after a series of continuous jumps. In order to investigate the impact and dynamics of the ballistic vest, six male volunteers (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0040517513478456">Table 1</xref>) were recruited, aged in their 20s, who had military training experience. All of them fully understood the process of the experiment and agreed to participate in it and signed the consent form. A human wear test was conducted using three distinct military ballistic vests: a conventional 2D ballistic vest, a 3D-fitted ballistic vest, and a 3D-loose ballistic vest that has extra space on the shoulders and waist created by adjusting the Velcro straps on the ballistic vest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0040517513478456">Figure 2</xref>). The type of ballistic vest given to the subjects for each test was randomly selected. The girths of the chest and bottom opening of the ballistic vest were measured as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0040517513478456">Figure 2</xref>; the human body values from the measurements are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0040517513478456">Table 2</xref>, along with body size measurements of the subjects without clothing. The values increased in the order of 3D-fitted, 2D, and 3D-loose ballistic vests. From information on the size specifications of the 2D and 3D ballistic vests, the amount of space between the body and the ballistic vest was estimated (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0040517513478456">Table 2</xref>).

<p>When the wearer jumped at a constant height, the clothing pressure and dynamics of the ballistic vest (expressed as values of VM) were measured. After donning the ballistic vest, the wearer jumped to a designated height 20 times. In order to ensure that the jumps were at a constant height, the VM of the body movement was also measured using a three-axis accelerometer. Landmarks were also attached to the body, and jumping motions were recorded to observe the changes in position of the landmarks. The pressure change was measured at two points, the left and right shoulders, and the VM was measured both on the body of the subject and on the ballistic vest at the left waist and center back of the waist (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0040517513478456">Figure 3</xref>). There was no statistically significant difference between the left-hand side and back of the waist. Therefore, we calculated the average VM of both positions. A force-sensing resistor (Interlink Electronics, Inc.) was used to measure the pressure change. The sensor was calibrated to ensure that the pressure data obtained from the experiment were in the linear response region. The linearity of the sensor was between 50–200 kPa and <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> was above 0.96 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0040517513478456">Figure 4(a)</xref>). Raw data of the pressure measurement are plotted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0040517513478456">Figure 4(b)</xref>, and it was confirmed that the range of the maximum pressure on the shoulders was in the range of higher linearity, shown as the shaded area in the graph. Therefore, data within this linear range were analyzed further (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0040517513478456">Figure 4(b)</xref>). The measurement locations of pressure on the shoulders were carefully defined because the human shoulder is curved in various directions, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0040517513478456">Figure 5</xref>. As the measurement location, we chose the highest point from among the points where the shoulder straps of the armor touched the body because the shape of the shoulder varied across subjects. When sensors are attached to the front and back of the shoulder, as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0040517513478456">Figure 5</xref>, the measured value is inaccurate, because the direction of the pressure is not perpendicular to the surface. If the air-pack-type sensor (AMI 3037-2, AMI Techno Co.), which is often used to measure the subtle pressure changes beneath the clothing, is used, the position of the measurement does not matter. However, the pressure range of the ballistic vest is over 100 kPa, which is beyond the limit of measurement for a soft air-pack-type sensor. Therefore, care should be taken to determine the accurate position when the maximum clothing pressure is measured using film-type pressure sensors (402 FSR™, Interlink Electronics, Inc.). The dynamics of the ballistic vest and subject were measured with ActiLife 6, which is a type of three-axis accelerometer that has the inclinometer feature. The ActiLife 6 was originally used for measuring the energy expenditure of a person, but the data set of ActiLife 6 also provides the VM in three directions: Axis-1, Axis-2, and Axis-3, and the sum of each value. Therefore, “counts” values for the three axes and the total VM of the ballistic vest and subject were measured using ActiLife 6 at two positions, the left waist and the center back of the waist. The experiments were performed with six subjects and were repeated. The order of wearing the three experimental ballistic vests was randomly selected to eliminate cross-over effects. The experiment consisted of 3–4 sets, and the subjects jumped 20 times in each set, each time wearing a different ballistic vest. The mean values for VM and clothing pressure from the 20 jumps were used for the further analysis.

<p>The changes in the impact pressure on the left shoulder were measured, and the time-dependent raw data are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0040517513478456">Figure 6</xref>. This graph shows what happens between the shoulder and ballistic vest during jumping. The time span of one jump is approximately 0.7 s. The contact time and the magnitude of the impulses are different for the three ballistic vests. Because the 2D ballistic vest and 3D-loose ballistic vest are separated from the body for longer times when jumping, they have a larger impact pressure. On the other hand, the 3D-fitted ballistic vest contacts the shoulders two times with lighter pressure. Notably, two smaller peaks of clothing pressure were observed in the case of the 3D-fitted ballistic vest. During jumping, the body and the ballistic vest move upward with the same force, and the ballistic vest moves further because its weight is less than that of the body. The subject feels the impact of the ballistic vest when the body and the vest overlap around the shoulder area. In the case of the 3D-fitted ballistic vest, the overlap occurs during upward motion because there is less upward movement of the 3D ballistic vest when it is well fitted than when it is loose, a condition which gives rise to two smaller peaks. In the case of the 3D-loose ballistic vest, there is little overlap between the vest and the body during upward motion, for the same reason that there is no smaller peak for the 2D-fit case where the highest impulse occurs only during the landing period. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0040517513478456">Figure 7</xref> shows an example of the pressure change on the shoulder for 20 jumps. Almost maximum values in each peak were selected, except for the first and last jumps, and averaged for the each session. These values were effective because all the peak values were in the linear region as stated (50–200 kPa). To compare the pressures changes depending on the ballistic vest, SPSS Statistics 19 software was used. The results of a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0040517513478456">Table 3</xref>. There is a significant difference in the maximum impact pressure depending on the type of ballistic vest. The results of Ducan’s post-hoc test indicate that the maximum pressure increased in the order of 3D fitted, 2D, and 3D loose. The maximum impact pressure of the 3D-fitted ballistic vest was the lowest, at 121 kPa, and that of the 3D-loose vest was the highest, at 142 kPa, which is statistically in the same range as that of the 2D ballistic vest. A shorter distance between the body and the ballistic vest resulted in lower pressure on the shoulders (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0040517513478456">Table 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0040517513478456">Figure 8</xref>). The ballistic vest was made based on measurements of the “average” man extracted statistically (not from the subjects in this experiment). The impacts on the left- and right-hand sides of the shoulder were slightly different during the jumping motion because the body is not perfectly symmetric. However, their trends were very similar. During the experiment, there was an error from the pressure sensor for one case that lead to missing data and the case was not included for analyzing. When any part of the body experiences an impact greater than a certain threshold, the body senses greater fatigue. Jumping can be considered a movement that exceeds this threshold. In real battlefield situations, more intense circumstances that necessitate severe jumping may occur. Therefore, considering the result of this study will be advantageous for coping with the difficulties of potential discomfort in soldiers.

<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0040517513478456">Figure 9</xref> shows the representative results of the VMs of the ballistic vests and the human body obtained from ActiLife 6 during four sessions of 20 jumps. The value of VM is the sum of the movements in the <italic>x</italic>-axis, <italic>y</italic>-axis, and <italic>z</italic>-axis; the <italic>x</italic>-axis represents the up and down motion, the <italic>y</italic>-axis represents the right and left motion, and the <italic>z</italic>-axis represents the front and back motion. The number of values of VMs during jumps while wearing the ballistic vest ranged from 364 to 389 counts. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0040517513478456">Figure 9</xref>, the blue lines for the VM of the human body are immediately followed by red lines for the ballistic vest. In other words, the ballistic vest moved right after the body jumped. Eighteen jumping values of VM in each curve were averaged, except for the values of the first and the last jump. As we observed the subject’s jumps, the first and the last jump were not stabilized enough, so we decided not to include those data for the analysis. For the 3D-fitted ballistic vest, the shapes of the curves for the body and the armor were very similar. For the other two ballistic vests, however, the red lines of VM of the ballistic vest were much greater than the blue lines of the human VM. These results indicate that when the ballistic vest does not fit well, the movement of the ballistic vest is greater and that the subsequent momentum would be higher.

<p>The subjective preferences were scored on an 11-point Likert scale that ranged from strongly prefer (10 points) to strongly dislike (0 points). The results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11-0040517513478456">Figure 11</xref>) of the study showed that the subjective preference before the jumping was in the order of 3D-fitted (5.2 points), 3D-loose (3.6 points), and 2D ballistic vest (3.2 points). After the jumping, the 3D-fitted ballistic vest was scored at 5.0 points and both the 3D-loose and 2D ballistic vest were scored at 3.6 points. Clearly, the subjects preferred two small impacts to one big impact. Since the ballistic vest is heavier than regular clothing, the all of the scoring was low. However, the subjects prefer the 3D-fitted ballistic vest compared to others.

<p>The 3D-fitted ballistic vest has a lower pressure change or impact on the shoulders than both 2D ballistic vest and 3D-loose ballistic vest when subjects are jumping. The 3D-fitted ballistic vest also moved less than the other two ballistic vests, as indicated by the 3D-fitted ballistic vest having the smallest VM.</p>
<p>However, if a soldier is wearing a backpack, the benefit of the 3D-fitted ballistic vest regarding less impact on the shoulders will be decreased, as the backpack presses the ballistic vest and shoulders simultaneously. Accordingly, the 3D-fitted ballistic vest is more efficient for soldiers, who need to move more vigorously, while not wearing a heavy backpack, for example, for those suppressing terrorism, police, and undercover civilian personnel. Further work on the relationship between the momentum of armor and the clothing pressure during actual field conditions is necessary.</p>
<sec id="sec10-0040517513478456"><title>Further suggestions</title>
<p>The thermal burden is one of the most important problems for soldiers, along with the weight of the ballistic vest. If the 3D ballistic vest fit the body more closely, the heat and moisture management capability would be decreased. To overcome this problem, conversible ventilation channels over the shoulders and back of the neck can be inserted to reduce the thermal burden. Results from studies on using ventilation channels to improve the thermal comfort of the body will be published in another paper. In fact, the 3D-fitted ballistic vest used in this experiment could be loosened at the side using Velcro when a soldier needs to expel the heat and moisture from the body.</p>
