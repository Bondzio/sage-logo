<title>Global Motion Control Market Contracted in 2012</title>
<p>According to a study recently published by IMS Research (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.imsresearch.com">http://www.imsresearch.com</ext-link>), sales of motion control products have decreased in 2012 in China as a result of overcapacity, and the global motion control market is forecast to decline by 1.9% compared to 2011. In 2013, this market is projected to rebound with revenue growth of nearly 5% helped by recovery of the Chinese market, yet limited by the continued Eurozone recession.</p>
<p>In 2010 and 2011, the global motion controls market grew strongly with revenues increasing over 20% to reach an estimated value of £8.4b. The year, 2012, says the study, presented a very different situation, with the Eurozone recession and softening of the Chinese economy causing motion control sales to fall well below expectations.</p>
<p>The biggest surprise in 2012 was the extent of the contraction in the Chinese motion control market, where revenues are forecast to decline by an estimated 16.5%–18.5%. Reduced order rates have resulted from overcapacity concerns and conservative buying patterns from machine builders.</p>
<p>Sales of low-end servo products in China have been most affected, impacting the Chinese and Japanese suppliers who rely heavily on this market. The market for high-end servo products is more stable.</p>

<title>Collimating Light for Precision Measurement</title>
<p>Schott and Moritex have developed a telecentric illuminator built on an innovative concept for precision measurement using backlights. It converts diffuse light from an illumination source into a powerful collimated light beam that can produce a highly accurate silhouette for image measurement.</p>
<p>The new generation collimated illumination system MTI-78 is based on Moritex’s advanced telecentric lens optics technology for machine vision. With the help of telecentric optics, light generated by a light-emitting diode (LED) or fibre optic light source passes through the MTI-78 system and is transformed into a parallel light beam. The parallel beam creates a clear edge silhouette image of the object placed between the MTI-78 and telecentric lenses.</p>
<fig id="fig1-0020294013481707" position="float">

<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0020294013481707-fig1.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>The main benefits are extreme illumination uniformity because of the advanced optics, as well as a variable iris that enables optical light intensity adjustment. The new lens is well suited for use in various applications such as the precise size measurement of automotive parts, electronic components or pharmaceutical packages.

<title>Distech Building Management System Makes the Grade in Scottish Schools</title>
<p>A new Building Management System (BMS) from Distech Controls (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.distech-controls.eu">http://www.distech-controls.eu</ext-link>) is helping Renfrewshire Council reduce fuel consumption and cut carbon emissions at four schools while educating future generations on the benefits of integrated, energy-efficient control.</p>
<p>This major project has seen a new Distech Control system fitted as part of an extensive building services refurbishment programme.</p>
<p>The existing heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) plant and control systems in use at St Margaret’s Primary School, Johnstone; St John Bosco Primary School, Erskine; and St Mary’s Primary School and Gallowhill Primary School, both in Paisley, had reached the end of their lifetime. Glasgow-based Advanced Energy Management Services (AEMS) was tasked with stripping out and replacing the mechanical services at each school within a very tight timescale – including configuring and commissioning – of just the 6-week summer holidays.</p>
<p>AEMS has equipped each of the four schools with a more efficient main HVAC plant solution. This includes new gas detection systems and automatic controls from Distech within each boiler house. These monitor and regulate heating and hot water operation, ensuring optimum system efficiency.</p>
<fig id="fig2-0020294013481707" position="float">

<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0020294013481707-fig2.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>AEMS selected the Distech EC-NetAX web-based, integrated building management platform for the project with the company’s EC-BOS series of network controllers and ECB series of BACnet field controllers, providing approximately 70 control points at each school. Converging with the school’s information technology (IT) network, EC-Net allows secure web-browser access to the system from anywhere within the school environment or locally through touch screens in the main reception area and boiler house.</p>
<p>Apart from providing access to the school management and staff, the control system has also become a part of the education process. Under teacher supervision, kids can access and adjust settings and see the impact of these changes and other energy conservation measures taken at the school. The EC-NetAX platform is easy to use and understand, while attractive three-dimensional (3D) graphics help to engage pupils.</p>

</fig>
<p>For high-speed serial data standards, designers are using differential signalling, which can be more efficiently acquired on an oscilloscope using this new mini-coaxial differential probing method. The new P7600 Series includes two direct connect 2.92 mm coaxial inputs enabling conversion of an incoming differential signal pair to a single oscilloscope input channel. This enables up to 30 GHz differential measurement capability on all four DPO/DSA73304D oscilloscope channels.</p>
<p>Efficient uses of oscilloscope channels enable multilane serial bus acquisitions and/or simultaneous acquisition of high-speed data alongside other system activity, like 100 MHz reference clocks or chip-to-chip bus traffic like I2C.</p>
<p>The P7600 Series also includes TriMode functionality that provides full support of differential measurements found in high-speed serial signals, along with independent single-ended and direct common mode measurements through the same probe connection.</p>

</fig>
<p>The company is still expanding because, it says, of the continuity of a prudently run family-owned business whose first and foremost principle is to satisfy customers’ needs and requirements. ‘First serve, then earn’ was one of the mottos of company founder Georg H Endress (1924–2008), and the company says that this is still valid today.</p>
<p>Headquartered in Switzerland, Endress+Hauser is a world leader in measurement and automation engineering. The company’s independence, fully owned by the founder’s family, has been laid down in a charter and is bound to be upheld in future.</p>
<p>It all began in February 1953 when Swiss engineer Georg H Endress and German banker Ludwig Hauser set up their company in a backyard in Lörrach, Germany. The first-level measurement instrument was patented 2 years later, and these instruments soon enjoyed a good reputation in the industry. As early as 1957, sales exceeded 1 million Deutschmarks (DM1m).</p>

<title>First Time-Division Duplex–Feature-Driven Development Network Handover Using Long-Term Evolution Test System</title>
<p>Network operators around the world are commissioning dual-standard networks as part of the rapid expansion in time-division long-term evolution (TD-LTE) (long-term evolution time-division duplex (LTE TDD)) networks, and Aeroflex says that its E500 LTE Capacity Test System is ‘the industry’s first capacity tester to successfully handover data services between TDD and FDD networks’. The E500’s handover capability is, therefore, crucial for both operators and network suppliers testing TDD/feature-driven development (FDD) networks.</p>
<p>Converged TDD/FDD networks allow mobile operators to maximise the benefits from their investments, as well as providing the best quality service for customers.</p>
<p>This new test system enables operators to confirm the operation and performance of their network before releasing into the field. It achieves this by enabling the network to be loaded with hundreds to tens of thousands of user equipments (UEs), each capable of emulating different radio-fading profiles with varying data service mixes in a multi-cell environment. The E500 exploits Aeroflex’s TM500 Test Mobile platform, which the company says is the de facto industry standard for LTE and LTE-Advanced (LTE-A) base station and network testing.</p>

<title>Solid-State Logic Solver Can Make Nuclear Plant Safer</title>
<p>Safety systems specialist Hima-Sella (<bold>Companion Company</bold>) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.hima-sella.co.uk">http://www.hima-sella.co.uk</ext-link>) says that its Planar4 solid-state logic solver modules have gained approval from Sellafield for use in nuclear safety systems. The Planar4 is a modular solid-state logic system where each module within the system includes input/output (I/O) and logic processing – all interconnected using wiring techniques such as wire-wrap, solder or termi-point.</p>

<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0020294013481707-fig7.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>All non-software- or processor-based modules are being evaluated for Safety Integrity Level 2 (SIL 2) for use in the nuclear industry (up to SIL 4 for all other industries). Securing this approval is a rigorous process using the EMPHASIS assessment methodology. It included a Sellafield representative visiting Hima in Germany where the Planar4 was designed and manufactured.</p>
<p>In addition, the software-based (processor-based) Planar4 modules have been subjected to the EMPHASIS assessment methodology. These modules have only been evaluated as suitable for SIL 1 in accordance with current Sellafield requirements. However, they can be re-evaluated to SIL 2, if required, by Sellafield carrying out an additional Independent Confidence building measure such as ‘software evaluation’.</p>
<p>EMPHASIS was developed as part of an R&amp;D project by the UK Control and Instrumentation Nuclear Industry Forum (CINIF) with inputs from the Office of Nuclear Regulation (ONR). It is considered to be the nuclear industry’s methodology for substantiation of SMART and Type ‘B’ devices.</p>
