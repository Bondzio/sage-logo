<abstract>
<p>One the most difficult challenges experienced by people with dementia and their caregivers is their communication. The ability to communicate is essential to creating and maintaining social relationships. Many individuals who suffer from dementia experience increased agitation and diminished social interaction in the long-term care living setting. This paper demonstrates how, through language, they construct social relationships. As part of The Friendship Study, which is an ethnographic observation of persons with dementia living in a long-term care setting, we analyzed transcripts from video- and audio-taped data and performed a discourse analysis of conversations to show how persons with dementia who live in a long-term care setting use language to create friendships. These analyses show that friendships are constructed using concepts such as conversational objects, discourse deixis, indexicality, and alignment among speakers.</p>

<p>Communication problems are among the most difficult faced by people with dementia and their caregivers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1471301211421187">Orange &amp; Colton-Hudson, 1998</xref>), contributing to an increase in stress, mortality, and decreased quality of life for both persons with dementia and their caregivers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1471301211421187">Dunn et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1471301211421187">Mittelman, Ferris, &amp; Steinberg, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1471301211421187">Mobily, Maas, Buckwalter, &amp; Kelley, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1471301211421187">Schulz &amp; O'Brien, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1471301211421187">Wright, 1993</xref>). A variety of studies of communication-related stress show that caregivers perceive communication breakdown to be a major problem in coping with the disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1471301211421187">Clark, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1471301211421187">Gurland, Toner, Wilder, Chen, &amp; Lantigua, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1471301211421187">Orange, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1471301211421187">Richter, Roberto, &amp; Bottenberg, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1471301211421187">Williamson &amp; Schulz, 1993</xref>). For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1471301211421187">Williamson and Schulz (1993)</xref> found that communication problems increase the risk of early institutionalization of the person with dementia. Better understanding of the processes of communication used by persons with dementia in creating and maintaining relationships in the long-term care setting might reduce the negative impacts of communication problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1471301211421187">Orange, 1991</xref>). The present paper is part of a larger ethnographic project, The Friendship Study, examining social interactions of persons with dementia who live in the long-term care setting.</p>

<sec id="sec2-1471301211421187"><title>Background</title>
<p>In the last three decades, most of the research regarding dementia has focused on the neurobiologic or the neuropsychological processes of the disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1471301211421187">Harris, 2002</xref>) and has made efforts to link these findings with the presentation of symptoms. The aim of treatment has been almost exclusively to improve cognition and to manage undesirable behaviors through pharmacologic and behavioral efforts, as well as by the manipulation of the physical environment. There is a growing body of literature studying psychosocial dimensions of persons with dementia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1471301211421187">Clare, 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1471301211421187">2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1471301211421187">Clare, Goater, &amp; Woods, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1471301211421187">Clare &amp; Pearce, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1471301211421187">Downs, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1471301211421187">Harman &amp; Clare, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1471301211421187">Hughes, Louw, &amp; Sabat, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1471301211421187">Keady &amp; Nolan, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1471301211421187">Keady, Nolan, &amp; Gilliard, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1471301211421187">Kontos, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1471301211421187">Leibing &amp; Cohen, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1471301211421187">Pearce, Clare, &amp; Pistrang, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1471301211421187">Sabat, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1471301211421187">Van Dijkhuizen, Clare, &amp; Pearce, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1471301211421187">Cotrell &amp; Schulz, 1993</xref>). This current project broadens this body of research by examining how persons with dementia living in a long-term care setting interact socially and suggests ways that formal and informal caregivers may learn from these interactions.</p>
<p>Starting with the personhood movement, Kitwood and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1471301211421187">Kitwood, 1993</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1471301211421187">1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1471301211421187">Kitwood &amp; Benson, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1471301211421187">Kitwood &amp; Bredin, 1992</xref>) have attempted to bring to the forefront the person-centered approach to dementia research and care. In this approach, the person with dementia is viewed and treated under the assumption that she or he retains an identity with which to construct and maintain a self through usual types of social interaction. This approach views a person with dementia as being the same as any other to the extent that her or his ‘selfhood’ is publicly manifested in various discursive practices such as telling autobiographical stories, taking on the responsibility for one's actions, expressing doubt, declaring an interest in care, decrying the lack of fairness in a situation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1471301211421187">Sabat &amp; Harré, 1992</xref>). Our paper examines the language of persons with dementia to show how they establish social relationships with their conversational partners in the institutional setting.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1471301211421187">Kitwood (1993)</xref> developed a person-centered approach to evaluating dementia care in formal settings, called Dementia Care Mapping. He examined the viewpoint of the person with dementia, using both empathy and observational skills. Working within this framework, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1471301211421187">Phinney (2002)</xref> described the different ways persons with dementia talk about living with the disease. She pointed out that to understand the symptoms, as people who actually have the illness experienced and articulated them, provides a richer understanding of the whole person. In addition, she suggested that intervention strategies are available only by paying attention to the communicative behaviors of persons with dementia. For example, persons in the early stages of dementia often fall silent in conversations. It may be because they are having trouble keeping up with the pace of the conversation. This is a salient issue for conversations between persons with dementia in the institutional setting. Conversational partners may limit conversation because they have difficulty keeping pace or understanding the semantic content. Knowing this, one conversational partner might try to slow down, making extra effort to repeat or rephrase previous comments and to ensure that the person with dementia is following along. If the partner has cognitive impairment, there may be problems accommodating the conversational needs of the other.</p>
<sec id="sec3-1471301211421187"><title>Discourse studies of persons with dementia</title>
<p>Social psychologists and sociolinguists have a long tradition of examining the communicative experiences of persons with dementia. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1471301211421187">Sabat and Harré (1992)</xref> suggested that it was common to perceive strategies used by persons with dementia as symptoms of the disease rather than as attempts to maintain selfhood. Communicative behaviors are a relevant example of this phenomenon. For example, data collected by the present author (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1471301211421187">Saunders, 1998a</xref>) include a conversation excerpt from the clinical setting between a physician and a person diagnosed with dementia. When the physician asked the patient, ‘Who is the president of the United States?’, the patient responded, ‘Oh, he was forgettable’. This statement is open to a variety of interpretations. Clinicians may call this a circumlocution (i.e. words and phrases substituted for intended word) and view it as a symptom of the disease, or as a way to save face (a form of semiotic, or meaning-driven, behavior) in a humorous way, given the speaker's inability to recall the name of the president. To interpret this response as also a socially acceptable communication behavior is to appreciate it as a way to present oneself as a humorous person who has certain opinions or political views.</p>
<p>Sociolinguistic studies also examine the language and conversational discourse of persons with dementia in a naturalistic setting. The goal of these studies is to understand social and psychological interactions through a linguistic analysis. In an important early study, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1471301211421187">Hamilton (1994)</xref> described a nursing home resident, Elsie, who maintained the ability to ask and answer questions into advanced stages of dementia. Elsie describes her own memory loss by saying, ‘I've had so many names… sometimes they are hard to get’. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1471301211421187">Ramanathan (1997)</xref> examined the coherence of the speech of people with dementia, noting that interlocutors frequently ‘take over’ the conversation, reducing opportunities for subjects to contribute to the conversation. Previous research by the author, Saunders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1471301211421187">1998a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1471301211421187">1998b</xref>) analyzed the accounts (i.e., explanations) employed by persons with dementia regarding their memory loss as a means through which to construct personal identity. For instance, an example of a memory account is shown here:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>Clinician: What floor are we on right now?</p></disp-quote>
<disp-quote>
<p>Patient: I don't know because I wasn't paying attention (ha ha).</p></disp-quote>
<p>Sociolinguistic studies as referenced above examine language as an analytical unit used by persons with dementia. These studies shed light on how we understand social relationships of people with dementia.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-1471301211421187"><title>Friendships in persons with dementia in long-term care</title>
<p>Research on social relationships within dementia special care units examined dementia residents' relationships with staff members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1471301211421187">Cohen-Mansfield &amp; Marx, 1992</xref>), residents' friendships related to agitated behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1471301211421187">Kutner, Brown, Stavisky, Clark, &amp; Green, 2000</xref>), and staff members' perceptions of residents' characteristics and successful social placement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1471301211421187">Wood, Cooper, Richardson, &amp; Forbes, 1992</xref>). Specifically, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1471301211421187">Cohen-Mansfield and Marx (1992)</xref> studied relationships between residents with dementia and ‘outsiders’ (e.g. family, friends not living in the nursing home) but not social relationships among residents. They found increased agitation was associated with fewer outside social contacts. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1471301211421187">Kutner et al. (2000)</xref> studied friendship and agitated behaviors among 59 residents of a dementia care unit. Like <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1471301211421187">Cohen-Mansfield and Marx (1992)</xref>, Kutner and colleagues found an association between friendship and lack of agitated behavior. However, these authors did not investigate qualities that contribute to the formation of friendships, or characterize those friendships, such as communicative ability, cognition, and physical function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1471301211421187">Astell &amp; Ellis, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1471301211421187">Chen, Ryden, Feldt, &amp; Savik, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1471301211421187">Wood et al. (1992)</xref> investigated whether residents’ characteristics (specifically cognition, affect, and mood and/or behavior) influenced staff members’ perceptions of the residents’ successful placement in a care facility, and found that negative affect and depressed mood, rather than cognitive function or behavior, were linked with residents’ being labeled ‘unsuccessfully placed’. These authors did not investigate social interactions among residents but rather whether or not individual residents ‘fit in’ at the facility.</p>
<p>Even fewer published studies to date have explored friendships specifically among people with dementia in long-term care. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1471301211421187">Diaz Moore (1999)</xref> conducted participant observation, as part of his study of social interaction in the dining room of a specialized dementia long-term care unit, and described three types of social relationships between residents: (1) ‘congenial friendships’ based on equality of the participants; (2) the ‘clique’ based on similarity or power of personality; and (3) ‘confidants’ based on asymmetry. Diaz Moore also characterized staff/resident negotiations as: ‘befriending’, a positive negotiation in which a staff member is friendly and sociable with a resident; ‘suggesting’, a negotiation technique in which staff attempts to convince the residents to do something; and ‘invading,’ a strategy in which staff occupies residents' space to socialize among themselves. Diaz Moore's work provides important insights into how to examine the types of friendships or social interactions that may exist.</p>
<p>The above studies examine the discourse of persons with dementia using frameworks that highlight the discourse and language used by persons with dementia. The current study illustrates examples of social relationships that are constructed and maintained through language and discourse among residents in the long-term care setting.</p>

<sec id="sec5-1471301211421187" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title>
<p>The Friendship Study takes place at Cedar Hill, which is a 20-bed, assisted-living, residential, care unit for people with moderate to severe dementia. The dementia diagnoses were determined by the clinical team and confirmed through scores on the Mini-Mental Status Examination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1471301211421187">Folstein, Folstein, &amp; McHugh, 1975</xref>). The research team collected data from residents to characterize their cognition, language, communicative ability, and depression at Cedar Hill (see the companion article by de Medeiros et al. in this issue). Cedar Hill is a pseudonym to protect the privacy of the staff and resident participants of this study. The Institutional Review Board of the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine reviewed and approved this study. Resident participants were recruited by first contacting their legally authorized representative (LAR), then obtaining written informed consent from both LAR and research participant, and then gaining oral assent from residents again at the time of data collection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1471301211421187">Black, Kass, Fogarty, &amp; Rabins, 2007</xref>). Staff participants were recruited through staff meetings where the research team described the study. Staff participants also signed informed consent documents. The following sections describe in detail both participant samples.</p>
<sec id="sec6-1471301211421187" sec-type="subjects"><title>Participants</title>
<sec id="sec7-1471301211421187"><title>Residents</title>
<p>A total of 31 residents (21 women, 10 men) participated in the study over the course of the 6-month period. Two participants described their race/ethnicity as African American; the remainder (<italic>n</italic> = 29) were European American. Years of education ranged from 8 to 20 years (mean 14 years, SD 3.6 years); see the companion article by de Medeiros, et al in this issue for full details of the subject sample.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec8-1471301211421187"><title>Staff</title>
<p>The staff participants (<italic>n</italic> = 10) were from three Cedar Hill departments: activities (<italic>n</italic> = 3), social work (<italic>n</italic> = 2), and nursing (<italic>n</italic> = 5). The nursing staff included certified nursing assistants and medication aids. Staff had to be employed for at least 1 month at Cedar Hill with a weekly workload of at least 10 hours to be included in the study.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="sec9-1471301211421187"><title>Ethnographic observations</title>
<p>This study conducted ethnographic observations of residents at Cedar Hill for 10 hours per week for 24 weeks (6 months). The research team members sat quietly in background areas and took field notes on interactions between residents, the general social environment, and other overall impressions. The researchers were instructed to be as unobtrusive as possible to avoid influencing the interaction between residents more than necessary. When possible, to capture non-verbal data such as facial expressions, physical position, ‘body language,’ and other cues to communication, the researchers obtained videotaped footage of residents. Video-taping was limited to common, public areas of the assisted living wing (e.g., dining room, television lounge, hallways). Residents’ assent to video-taping and/or audio-taping was obtained at the start of each observational session. Members of the research team conducted this additional assent process as extra protection for the residents with dementia to ensure they were willing to be taped each time. Only written notes were used if residents did not assent to taping or if residents, staff members, or visitors were present for whom consent had not been obtained. If participating residents did not assent to taping, the researcher took hand-written ethnographic notes. Multi-modal transcription techniques used to transcribe videotapes include non-verbal communication such as images and gestures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1471301211421187">Baldry &amp; Thibault, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1471301211421187">Iedema, 2003</xref>). Verbatim transcriptions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1471301211421187">Du Bois, 1991</xref>) were made of audiotapes.</p>
<p>Most of the interactions reported in this study occurred in the dining room, which served as the main social space for Cedar Hill residents. Since residents are free to sit in the dining room at anytime during the day, often they lingered prior to and after meals. They would walk through this centrally locating dinning space to their rooms and to reach the activity rooms and other areas of the assisted-living wing. The doors of each wing were open for residents to move freely between them.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="sec10-1471301211421187" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title>
<p>What is the motivation for people with dementia living in long-term care settings to talk to one another? In the dining room, the present authors observed conversations around mealtimes. These conversations resembled what one might expect to hear in any dining room regardless of the diagnosis of the participants. The research team considered this an important issue of inquiry: who talks to whom and why? Does it depend on similar personal attributes of the residents, ambulatory function, language ability, or cognitive status?</p>
<p>One finding of the current study was that often the impetus for a conversation involved a person or an object in the immediate surroundings. These ‘conversational objects’ were animate items, inanimate items, and abstract concepts in the local surroundings serving to promote interaction. Apart from the research team's equipment (e.g., tape recorder), these objects were part of the everyday décor at Cedar Hill. See <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1471301211421187">Table 1</xref> for a taxonomy of conversational objects. An animate object includes people and animals. Inanimate objects include physical or non-living objects that might be found in a home or office environment.

<p>Conversations also focused on topics that are abstract concepts, such as ideas, feelings, or sounds. Persons with dementia experience anomia (i.e., word-finding problems) and tend to use function words (e.g., pronouns, determiners) more frequently than content words (e.g., nouns and verbs) as their disease progresses. Hence, the ways in which they referenced conversational objects may be somewhat non-specific. The following examples will illustrate the use of conversational objects using pronominal reference.</p>
<p>In the following example, Anna, a resident, is sitting with Mary, a staff member, at the dining table. Anna initiates a conversation by indexing (i.e., pointing to) a tape recorder, sitting in the center of the dining table. This tape recorder (an inanimate object) serves as a conversational object. Example 1 begins with Anna's reaching for the tape recorder and Mary's moving it out of Anna's reach.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1471301211421187">1</xref></sup></p>

<p>Anna starts the conversation about a novel object sitting on the dining table. Tape recorders do not usually appear on the lunch table; thus, its presence is a reasonable conversation starter. Mary, the staff person, knows the tape recorder belongs to the research team and tries to keep Anna from touching it. On line 3, Anna claims it belongs to her by saying, ‘that's mine’; but Mary disagrees. Anna continues by insisting she had one in her possession and constructs her story using indefinite terms ‘one’ and ‘that’. In addition, she supports her story with the report of a third party ‘she tells me’.</p>
<p>Much of the talk in this example is punctuated with discourse deixis, which is the use of pronouns to refer to people, places, and things (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1471301211421187">Levinson, 1983</xref>). Deictic pronouns are a way of pointing to things in the environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1471301211421187">Lyons, 1977</xref>) using indefinite pronouns (e.g., that, it). On line 3, Anna refers to the tape recorder with the pronouns, ‘that’ and ‘it’. The use of non-content words, such as pronouns, is common in the speech of persons with dementia since anomia is a symptom of the disease. Anna makes herself very clear, as this example shows by Mary's response on line 4. The use of pronominal reference allows the person with dementia to feel that she has made herself clear and initiated a conversation. Such feeling is an important part of being a social actor in any environment.</p>
<p>Moving from the textual level to the discourse level, Example 1 shows that Anna's use of deictic pronouns functions to create cohesion and coherence. Cohesion is what makes a text semantically meaningful and is achieved through syntactic features, such as deictic, anaphoric and cataphoric elements<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1471301211421187">2</xref></sup> or a logical tense structure, as well as presuppositions and implications connected to general world knowledge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1471301211421187">Halliday &amp; Hasan, 1976</xref>). Coherence is a broader interpretation by interlocutors regarding the understandability of the interaction. Anna and Laura together achieve cohesion and coherence through the sequence of turn taking in which they accept and make sense of each other's utterances.</p>
<p>Up to a point, the conversation in Example 1 appears still to be about a tape recorder. Then, on lines 6 and 8, Laura, another staff member who is serving lunch, says, ‘All right, I'll get you it’ and offers Anna a glass of water. Now the textual cohesion is complicated by another interlocutor. It is unclear whether Laura is trying to distract Anna by offering her a glass of water or if Laura perceives Anna's claim ‘that's mine’ to refer to a glass of water. In line 9, Anna accepts Laura's offer and her reinterpretation of the conversational object in question. This re-framing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1471301211421187">Goffman, 1974</xref>) is a technique used by caregivers to minimize behavioral disturbances. Was Laura aware of her re-framing? Is this a conversational diversion on the part of the staff member? The present authors suggest that Laura applied her knowledge of the resident's ambiguous discourse and found a solution to the issue of tape recorder ownership.</p>
<p>In the following excerpt, Liz, a physical therapist at Cedar Hill, has just brought Bob, a resident, back to the dining room after his therapy session. She assists Bob in navigating the tables and chairs with his walker and then bids him goodbye. When Bob sits down, he is joining John, another resident, who is already seated. The conversation with Liz, the therapist, is included to contextualize the conversation that ensues between Bob and John.</p>

<p>This example illustrates the use of indexicality to create linguistic and social meaning. An indexical behavior or utterance points to (or indicates) some state of affairs. Indexicality is a phenomenon far broader than language, one that, independently of interpretation, points to something, such as smoke as an index of fire (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1471301211421187">Peirce, 1932</xref>). In discourse analysis, indexicality functions to show how speaker-meaning can be viewed on the sentence level and on the discourse or interactional level.</p>
<p>In Example 2 on line 6, when Bob said ‘today’, he means he would rather not wait until Monday to see the physical therapist. Then he addresses his comments to John in an attempt to start conversation. Liz, the therapist, is the conversational object. The presence of an attractive young woman serves as a way for one gentleman to initiate conversation with another. The conversational object is indexed by the word<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1471301211421187">3</xref></sup> ‘today’ and points backward to Liz's comment on line 3 as well as forward to the present moment of the lunch table with his dining companion. In pointing backward, Bob uses an indexical to create meaning and continuity in his discourse. At the same time, he uses an indexical to point forward. First, he points forward by moving the conversational center to a new interlocutor, John, and second he points forward by talking about himself. On line 11, he recalls himself in the past. From this example, we see Bob using language to create coherence in his discourse along a time continuum from present to past. Bob's cognitive status of being diagnosed with dementia in the mild stages as defined by clinical criteria does not interfere with his ability to construct his own identify as a gentleman who notices ladies and recalls himself as a younger man. He uses this identity construction in his discourse and to construct his social relationships.</p>
<p>The next example illustrates an inanimate item as the conversational object and highlights the use of function words for indexing a social relationship. Here two residents were sitting down for lunch when a staff member interrupts the conversation to offer a cup of coffee.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec13-1471301211421187"><title>Example 3</title>

<list id="list3-1471301211421187" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Bob: How are you doing?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Clara: OK.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Staff: Would you like a hot cup of coffee?</p></list-item>

<list-item><p>Clara: Not too much. [laughing]</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Bob: Not at all. [Bob begins to eat and silence returns to the table]</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>This is an example of a typical interaction between two residents. The conversational object introduced on line 5, refers to the lunch table. The conversation is short and punctuated by staff interjections as seen on line 3 when the staff member offers Bob a cup of coffee. Bob and Clara align themselves with each other using linguistic devices such as indefinite nouns as in line 5, when Bob says, ‘these things don't move’. Alignment, as described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1471301211421187">Goffman (1974)</xref>, is the way we position ourselves in a social interaction. This may be done by shifting our footing, stance, or the positions that interlocutors take up in relation to one another and their utterances. Shifts in footing can affect task, tone, social roles, and interpersonal alignments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1471301211421187">Goffman, 1981</xref>). Bob is constructing conversational cohesion through his linguistic usage. Clara's response ‘Not too much’ serves to support the construction of coherence in that she agrees with Bob's assessment that the table does not move too much on the carpet. Bob continues to align himself with Clara when he completes the interaction with a repetition of Clara's statement on line 6, ‘Not too much’. Indexicality, as a discursive component of the social relationship, is being co-constructed by Bob and Clara when they align themselves using function words, adverbs, and prepositions.</p>
<p>Despite the limited verbal exchanges of persons with dementia in long-term care settings, repeatedly the data revealed that residents aligned themselves to their conversational partners. Sometimes the work of making friendly conversation can be challenging when staff members and meal logistics interrupt. Because these conversational interactions can be so brief, staff members may overlook them and thus may not recognize them as examples of friendships being created and maintained.</p>
<p>In the next example, two residents are engaged in a conversation that is recognizable as a friendly interaction based on the topic of food and caring for others.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec14-1471301211421187"><title>Example 4</title>
<p>
<list id="list4-1471301211421187" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Lilly: Listen, you better go get something for yourself to eat.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Anna: I am not hungry.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Lilly: You are very foolish.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Anna: My stuff can sit there.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>If I get hungry</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>I can get it myself.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Lilly: You're not at home now.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Anna: I am.</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>Here Lilly urged Anna to get something to eat and the conversational object is food, an inanimate item. Lilly expressed, in line 1, her concern for Anna's state of hunger. Caring for one another is what friends do for each other. Anna disputed Lilly's concern, ‘I am not hungry’ and informed Lilly on line 4 what her plans are if she gets hungry. While Lilly and Anna seemed to disagree on one level, this author proposes that the indexical behaviors reveal friendship or, at least, caring between the speakers. Each line is similar in length, about four or five words. The structure of the sentence follows a similar syntactic pattern (subject–verb–object). The repetition of pronouns shows alignment. On lines 1, 2, and 5 Lilly repeats the second person pronoun, ‘you’. Anna matches this pattern by responding consistently on lines 2, 5, 6, 8 with the first person pronoun, ‘I’. This example illustrates the concept of indexicality in that the speakers align themselves using language and syntax that is synchronous and at the same time indexes their social identities: Lilly as the caregiver and Anna as the self-sufficient.</p>

<sec id="sec15-1471301211421187" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title>
<p>The conversations among persons with dementia reveal many of the elements of conversation that one would expect in the conversation of non-impaired adults. The topics chosen to talk about related to their environment: the food, the furniture, and the people around them. Their discourse serves socially to construct the residents' identities as well as their social relationships. While staff members may subscribe to a person-centered philosophy, may thoughtfully design the physical environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1471301211421187">Brawley, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1471301211421187">Briller &amp; Calkins, 2000</xref>), and may plan activities accordingly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1471301211421187">Davis, Byers, Nay, &amp; Koch, 2009</xref>), even still, they may not then be aware of the ways in which language in conversational interaction functions in the social relationships among persons with dementia. Conversational interactions reveal that residents with dementia in long-term care do develop and maintain relationships. These relationships focus on the mundane (e.g., the furniture) as well as personal (e.g., taking care of oneself). The construction of these relationships is revealed through the discourse: the use of conversational objects and linguistic elements that show alignment between friends.</p>
<p>Conversational objects are indexed using definite and indefinite pronouns. Residents with moderate to severe dementia use their linguistic resources to communicate with staff and other residents, and this use of language is well within their conversational skill set. A conversational object is an analytical tool to identify the start of a conversation. While this study highlights the conversational discourse between residents, this same analytical tool can easily be applied to the conversations between resident and staff members. The identification of conversational objects allows for the analysis of coherent conversations, as well as of misunderstandings, as seen in Example 2, with Bob and John's conversation about the staff member. Bob is doing his best to have a friendly conversation with John about his memories of himself at a younger age. John in turn is trying to make sense of what John was saying. This misunderstanding reveals much about how persons with dementia communicate despite cognitive impairments. That is, they communicate using indefinite linguistic reference and use alignment of social identities (old self versus young self) thus revealing how social relationships are constructed in this setting. That is, there may be misunderstandings, and yet the relationship still perseveres as relationships do among non-diagnosed people who experience misunderstandings in conversation.</p>
<p>While staff communication was not itself examined here, it was inevitable that it would appear as part of the communicative interaction in the long-term care setting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1471301211421187">Small, Gutman, Makela, &amp; Hillhouse, 2003</xref>). Between staff members and residents, conversational objects motivate conversation and smooth interaction. In Example 1, the conversational object starts out as a tape recorder. However, as the conversation ensued Laura, another staff member, interprets the conversational object to be something else. While it is not clear whether re-framing is a conscious move on Laura's part, there was some resolution to the issue when Anna accepted the glass of water. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1471301211421187">Vasse, Vernooij-Dassen, Spijker, Rikkert, and Koopmans (2010)</xref> reviewed the literature on staff interventions designed to improve communication strategies among residents in long-term care facilities. While the meta-analysis found no overall effects, several of the single-task session interventions with residents (e.g., life review) and one-on-one tasks embedded in activities of daily living showed improved communication. Future studies of intervention should include information for staff members about how persons with dementia use language to construct their social relationships. In addition, such training should emphasize how the role of the staff members themselves influences social interaction among residents and how such influence can be improved further.</p>

<sec id="sec16-1471301211421187" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title>
<p>While research on the subjective experience of dementia is a growing field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1471301211421187">Pearce et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1471301211421187">Sabat, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1471301211421187">Woods, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1471301211421187">Clare, Rowlands, Bruce, Surr &amp; Downs, 2008</xref>), additional research is necessary to understand how the person diagnosed copes with the difficulties (the realities of their) everyday life. The Friendship Study used both ethnographic and neuropsychological assessments to explore communication and social relationships among persons with dementia in the long-term care setting, as well as to examine individual views of friendship (see the companion article be de Medeiros et al. in this issue), all while keeping the perspective and the experience of the persons with dementia as a focus of this research.</p>
<p>Using discourse analysis, the conversational examples in this paper illustrate how persons with dementia use specific linguistic behaviors to construct and maintain relationships with their fellow residents. These conversational interactions are evidence of how these individuals construct their own social identities and, in so doing, their social relationships. Using language, these individuals align themselves with each other to form social bonds at the conversational level. At the same time, using language in their daily conversations, they indexically construct social meaning and social relationships with their table-mates. The individuals observed herein are very capable of forming and maintaining friendships, or pleasant social relationships despite their cognitive or physical impairments. Future studies will examine interventional strategies with staff and family caregivers to improve social interaction in long-term care settings.</p>
