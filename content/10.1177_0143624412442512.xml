<p>Located around the Yangtze River, with special architectural climate characteristics due to their unique geographical location, China’s hot summer and cold winter zone is hot and humid in summer, cold and humid in winter, and have a long humid climate period throughout the year. In winter, the ambient dry-bulb temperature (DBT) drops below 10℃ about 2 months and occasionally drops to zero. In summer, the ambient DBT is generally below 35℃ and exceeds 35℃ only 15–25 days in a year. Relative humidity (RH) of four seasons is not very different from each other. Annual average RH is 70–80%. In the typical representative city Shanghai, the average DBT of the warmest month is 27.5℃ and of the coldest is 4.5℃. Due to this particular weather conditions, heating, cooling, dehumidification, and ventilation requirements exist in this region. In addition, this region has a large population density, and its economy and culture are both more developed. Unique architectural climate features and higher level of economic and cultural development make the hot summer and cold winter region’s requirements for health and comfort living environment particularly prominent.</p>
<p>At present, summer air-conditioning devices have been popular in residential buildings of this region, mainly dominated by convection air-conditioners. Of course, split air-conditioning unit will give better control of the indoor temperature and then improve the comfort and productivity. However, there also exist many examples of discomfort due to draught, uniform temperature, noise, and sick building syndrome.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0143624412442512">1</xref></sup> In winter, split air-conditioner or heating unit is currently used for local heating and intermittent heating. When hot air is used for heating, poor comfort exists due to hot draft and noise.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0143624412442512">2</xref></sup> When electric heating devices are used for local heating, indoor temperature distribution is uniform.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0143624412442512">3</xref></sup> In addition, the Yangtze River region is China’s important region with rapidly developing real estate. The rapid increase in urban residential area objectively causes the rapid growth of energy consumption in residential buildings.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0143624412442512">4</xref></sup> Due to the shortcomings of current residential air-conditioning systems, there is an urgent need for a new air-conditioning system to replace the traditional air-conditioning system. Radiant cooling system is an effective choice and it has received a lot of concerns by a growing number of heating, ventilating, and air-conditioning (HVAC) engineers and occupants. Studies have shown that, compared to traditional air-conditioning systems by convection, radiant cooling systems have the following advantages: (1) Reducing indoor vertical temperature gradient, almost no air flow, reducing local discomfort.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0143624412442512">5</xref></sup> (2) The smaller air supply volume can reduce cooling feeling due to cold air, and thus can reduce the discomfort caused by draft.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0143624412442512">6</xref></sup> (3) For a radiant cooling system, the radiant terminal device bears all or part of the sensible heat load. The air supply terminal device only bears the latent heat load and the remaining sensible heat load, and meets occupants’ healthy needs for fresh air. The smaller air volume can reduce air transport energy and then achieve the energy-saving effect.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0143624412442512">7</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0143624412442512">9</xref></sup> (4) Reducing indoor noise. Radiant cooling systems have been widely used in Europe, mainly used in commercial and office buildings.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0143624412442512">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0143624412442512">11</xref></sup> In the recent years, radiant cooling systems also began to be used in China, have received more and more attention, and also have been gradually used in residential buildings. Currently, the domestic applications of radiant cooling cases are mainly the technical systems of radiant cooling combined with ground source heat pump, and the district buildings are centralized cooled. However, centralized cooling cannot achieve occupants’ flexible adjustments and cannot meet occupants’ individual needs.</p>
<p>In view of the current problems existing in indoor living environment in hot summer and cold winter zone of China, and a wide range of needs for energy efficient control equipment of heat and moisture environment in this zone, supported by the Key Project of the National Eleventh-Five Year Research Program of China ‘research and demonstration on low-power control technology of indoor thermal environment in residential buildings around the Yangtze River Valley’, based on the climate characteristics in this region, this research studied the combination of active and passive air-conditioning technology system which could compatibly meet heating, cooling, dehumidification and ventilation requirements, and developed a residential environmental control machine<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0143624412442512">12</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0143624412442512">14</xref></sup> using air source heat pump as hot or cold source, radiant floor for heating in winter, radiant ceiling for cooling in summer, and also employing the outdoor air supply system to meet both indoor health requirements and dehumidification needs. Cooling radiant terminal device was also designed with a concrete core structure with pipes embedded in concrete slabs between each story, similar to radiant floor heating systems.</p>
<p>For the applications and promotions of radiant cooling systems in residential buildings, both thermal comfort performance and energy savings of systems are important. This article mainly focused on thermal comfort. The achievement of full energy saving potential for residential radiant cooling systems depends on whether the system can achieve flexible control to meet the actual needs of users. This issue will be addressed in system optimization projects of follow-up studies.</p>
<p>With regard to applications and thermal performance evaluations of radiant cooling systems, there have been some literatures. Nagano and Mochida<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0143624412442512">6</xref></sup> analyzed the thermal comfort of five subjects in an experimental test room equipped with cooling ceilings, and calculated SET* and predicted mean vote (PMV). They concluded that the mean radiant temperature for a supine human body should be used in the design of ceiling radiant cooling in hospital rooms and bedrooms. Vangtook and Chirarattananon<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0143624412442512">15</xref></sup> studied the application of radiant cooling in residential houses in hot humid climate. They took a series of whole year simulations using TRNSYS computer code on applications of radiant cooling to a room model. PMV was used for comfort assessment. The result concluded that cooling tower could be employed to provide cooling water for radiant cooling and for pre-cooling of ventilation air to achieve thermal comfort, if adaptive comfort is used for residential households. Catalina et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0143624412442512">16</xref></sup> took a full-scale experimental campaign and a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) study of a radiant cooling ceiling equipped with capillary tubes in a tested room, under controlled conditions. The thermal comfort was studied using the PMV index. The results reported confirm that the cooling ceiling has advantages such as low vertical air gradient and that the thermal comfort is obtained even for higher metabolism rates or clothing insulation. Zhao et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0143624412442512">17</xref></sup> analyzed the cooling ability of the cooling ceiling in theory taking the method of equivalent radiation heat transfer coefficient, simulated the heat transfer situation of the ceiling in which the water pipe were buried with CFD software.</p>
<p>In summary, current literatures about applications and performance of radiant cooling systems mainly based on chamber test measurement or analysis by numerical simulation software, and practical application measurement is less, especially for small-size residential radiant cooling air-conditioning system. This article presented a small-size residential radiant cooling system. The purpose of this study is to investigate the various characteristics of this system and its practical application in residential buildings.</p>
<p>This article presents an experimental analysis on a residential radiant chilled ceiling system combined with an outdoor air handling unit applied in hot summer and cold winter zone of China. The tested system was located in a villa in Shanghai City in China. The operating characteristics of this system in stable operating conditions and the indoor thermal environment parameters were both measured and analyzed, and the thermal comfort evaluation on indoor thermal environment was also given. The research results can provide technical data for the promotion of this residential radiant cooling system, and also provide a reference for the further optimization of it.</p>

<sec id="sec3-0143624412442512"><title>Introduction of the residential building tested</title>
<p>The residential building tested is a three-layer linking row villa, floor area of which is approximately 170 m<sup>2</sup>, taking 30 mm expanded polystyrene (EPS) board as the thermal insulation layer for its external wall and 40 mm extruded polystyrene (XPS) board as the thermal insulation layer for its roof. The heat transfer coefficients of the building envelope are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0143624412442512">Table 1</xref>. Contrasting with the limits of the standard ‘design standard for energy efficiency of residential buildings in hot summer and cold winter zone of China’,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0143624412442512">18</xref></sup> all the coefficients given in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0143624412442512">Table 1</xref> are within the limits, and meet the energy efficiency design requirements. For HVAC system design in Shanghai, the design outdoor DBT and wet-bulb temperature in summer are 34℃ and 28.2℃, respectively. The design outdoor DBT in winter is −4℃. In conventional HVAC system design for residential buildings, many engineers use 26℃ DBT and 50% RH in summer and 18℃ and 50% RH in winter as the target space condition.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0143624412442512">18</xref></sup> However, according to the literature,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0143624412442512">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0143624412442512">20</xref></sup> if radiant cooling ceiling is used for space cooling and radiant heating floor is used for space heating, 1–2℃ higher design space temperature in summer and 1–2℃ lower design space temperature in winter can be used without significant negative impact on thermal comfort. Therefore, the target space condition in the research was set at 28℃ DBT and 50% RH in summer and 16℃ DBT and 50% RH in winter. The design cooling load of the tested building is 4652 W, the cooling load per unit area is 33.7 W/m<sup>2</sup>, the design heating load is 4077 W, and the heating load per unit area is 29.5 W/m<sup>2</sup>.

<sec id="sec4-0143624412442512"><title>Introduction of tested air-conditioning system</title>
<p>Taking an air source heat pump as the cooling and heating source of the system, the air-conditioning system in summer (the form of terminal device: radiant cooling combined with outdoor air supply) and heating system in winter (the form of terminal device: radiant floor heating combined with outdoor air supply) employs an integration of the cooling source and the heating source. In summer, one part of chilled water is provided for the outdoor air handling unit and the other for the radiant cooling ceiling after mixing with the return water of it. In winter, one part of heated water is provided for the outdoor air handling unit and the other for the radiant heating floor. For the air-side system, the outdoor air is handled by a total heat recovery unit before entering into the air handling unit for recovering part of the exhaust air energy.</p>
<p>Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0143624412442512">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0143624412442512">2</xref> show the outdoor heat pump unit and total heat recovery unit of the tested system, respectively. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0143624412442512">Figure 3</xref> shows the piping layout of the water system in testing scene. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0143624412442512">Figure 4</xref> shows the schematic for radiant cooling combined with outdoor air supply system. It provides a more intuitive conformation form of the water system. Traditional air-source heat pump can only make low-temperature chilled water. High-temperature chilled water was made for chilled ceiling by mixing supply water with one part of return water in the study. The tested water system has three electromagnetic three-way valves that match three temperature sensor measuring points. The first electromagnetic three-way valve is used to control the mixing water volume in summer by sensing the return water temperature of the radiant ceiling, so that the water supply temperature of the radiant ceiling can be controlled within a certain range to maintain no condensation detected on the cooling surface. The second electromagnetic three-way valve is used to regulate water supply volume for the radiant ceiling in response to sensible load change. When the return water temperature of the radiant ceiling exceeds a certain limit, the electromagnetic three-way valve opens up, and one part of water supply of the radiant ceiling directly comes into the return water pipe. The third electromagnetic three-way valve is used to adjust the water supply temperature of the outdoor air handling unit.

<p>As for the air-side ventilation strategy, all outdoor air ventilation strategy was employed in the research. The air supply terminal device employed the minimum outdoor air volume, which removed all the latent heat loads and a small part of sensible heat loads, and also played a function of diluting indoor pollutants. The outdoor air ventilation rate was set at one air change per hour according to the national standard JGJ134-2001.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0143624412442512">18</xref></sup> As for the air distribution, underfloor air-distribution (UFAD) system was used. In the test room, the air was supplied approximately 0.2 m above floor level and exhausted 0.2 m below the ceiling level.</p>

<p>The testing period was on 20 August to 15 September 2008, during which the outdoor temperature was 17–34℃. The test data of a typical day during the system stable operating time were analyzed in this article. The typical day has a maximum outdoor air temperature closest to design condition (34℃). Some parameters, such as indoor temperature and humidity, indoor air speed, outdoor temperature, cooling ceiling surface temperature, inside surface temperature of envelope, water supply, and return temperatures, were measured. Copper–constantan thermocouples were used as the temperature sensors. All the data were observed and automatically recorded by a data collection board in real time. RH in test room was automatically recorded by a temperature and humidity meter. Heat pump unit power consumption was measured by an electric power meter. All measurement equipment are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0143624412442512">Table 2</xref>. The experimental error sources included the measurement equipment accuracy errors, calibration errors, and data processing errors, of which the measurement equipment accuracy errors played a major role. By calibration of the measuring equipment, as well as insulation of connecting pipe, the test error could be controlled to be less than 5%.

<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0143624412442512">Figure 6</xref> presents the water supply and return temperature variation trends along with time under system stable operating conditions. It can be found that the water supply and return temperatures cyclically fluctuate. This happens mainly because the outdoor heat pump unit is shut down automatically due to self-protection when the chilled water temperature pouring from chiller reaches the set upper limit, thus making the cyclical fluctuations of water supply and return temperatures. It can be seen from the figure that the total return water temperature is lower than the return water temperature of the radiant system as well as that of the air supply system. This is mainly because when the return water temperature of the radiant system exceeds a certain limit, the electromagnetic three-way valve opens up, one part of chilled water supplied for the radiant system directly enters into the water return pipeline and mixes with the return water of the air supply system as well as that of the radiant system, which makes the total return water temperature lower than the return water temperature of the radiant system as well as that of the air supply system.

<p>Taking the central location of the tested room as the research location, human thermal comfort in room which employed the radiant cooling system combined with an outdoor air handling unit was evaluated with PMV–PPD (predicted percentage of dissatisfied) index. For radiant cooling environment, the mean radiant temperature is an important thermal micro-climate parameter affecting human thermal comfort.

<p>By MATLAB program, the human thermal comfort index can be calculated, based on the PMV–PPD model put forward by Professor Fanger. For residential buildings, indoor occupants’ activities are usually sitting and rest, the body metabolic rate is 1 met. In summer, occupants are generally used to wearing shorts, shirt, pajamas, slippers, and other household clothing in room, thermal resistance of which is low with a value between 0.25 and 0.65 clo. In this study, the closing thermal resistance is set 0.5 clo, just as same as that value of summer conditions in ASHARE 55-2004. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0143624412442512">Figure 7</xref> presents the variation trends of the mean radiant temperature and indoor temperature during a day cycle. Due to the cooling function of the chilled ceiling to the other enclosure walls, the indoor mean radiant temperature is lower than the indoor air temperature. The indoor air temperature varies between 26.7℃ and 29℃ and the mean radiant temperature between 25.5℃ and 27.1℃; the difference between indoor air temperature and the mean radiant temperature is about 1–3.2℃. Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0143624412442512">8</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0143624412442512">9</xref> show the variation trends of the PMV and PPD indexes of the occupants in sitting posture along with the outdoor temperature, respectively. During a testing day cycle, the outdoor temperature changes to a great extent with the minimum and maximum temperatures of 23.5℃ and 34℃, respectively; the PMV and PPD indexes vary between −0.15 and 0.5 and 5% and 10%, respectively, and both indexes meet the thermal comfort standard (ISO 7730).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0143624412442512">22</xref></sup> When the outdoor temperature varies greatly, in other words, when the indoor load varies greatly, by the chiller’s regulation of stop and opening, the micro-climate parameters can be controlled within the limit of the thermal comfort requirements.

<sec id="sec10-0143624412442512"><title>Temperature distribution in the vertical direction</title>
<p>Temperature measuring points were set from the ground, points on the ceiling were at the height of 2.8 m and the other measuring points were set at the height of 0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.8, 1.6, 2.2, 2.4, 2.6, 2.8 m, respectively. For radiant cooling environment, the indoor air flow field is formed due to the combined effects of temperature difference caused from ceiling radiation, natural convection from indoor thermal load, and forced convection from outdoor air supply. The temperature distribution along the vertical direction is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-0143624412442512">Figure 10</xref>. Two sections in the center location of the room were selected as the study objects and named <italic>X</italic>- and <italic>Y</italic>-sections, respectively. It can be seen from the figure that the indoor air temperature distribution in the vertical direction is different from the air temperature stratification distribution that the indoor air temperature increases with height and comes into a stratified structure, under the traditional convection air-conditioning environment caused from UFAD. Instead, it shows two distribution characteristics: (1) The indoor air temperature increases with height under 1.75 m due to the rise of hot air, similar with the temperature distribution of traditional convection air-conditioning environment caused from UFAD. (2) The indoor air temperature reduces with height in space above 1.75 m due to the cooling effect of the radiant ceiling. The temperature gradient in space which is 20 cm below the ceiling is larger, and the temperature difference is about 4℃, which indicates that there is a strong convection heat transfer near the radiant cooling ceiling surface. In accordance with the comfort standard of ISO 7730, the vertical temperature gradient from human foot to the head (sit-in staff for 0.1–1.1 m) should be less than 3℃/m. The temperature gradient in space of 0.1–1.1 m at <italic>X</italic> position is about 2.5℃/m and that in space of 0.1–1.1 m at Y position is about 1.53℃/m, the two values both meet the comfort standard of ISO 7730.

<p>In air-conditioning environment by convection, draft caused by air movement is one of the main factors which lead to unwanted local discomfort of the body. Previous studies show the discomfort caused by draft is significant for people taking minor physical activities such as sitting quietly with the standard dress. Therefore, it is necessary to analyze the local discomfort caused by draft in residential air-conditioning environment. Professor Fanger’s research shows that predicted percentage dissatisfied (PD) of people due to draft depends on air speed, air temperature, and turbulence intensity, and the calculation formula is

<p>According to ASHRAE standards, the turbulence intensity of mixing ventilation is around 35%. In this research, the air supply strategy is underfloor air supply, and the air supply speed is relatively high with a value of 2 m/s; therefore, the turbulence intensity in this section is also set the value of 35%. Four points of 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, and 0.7 m heights are selected as the research points, which have a distance of 0.5 m from the air inlet, named A, B, C, and D, respectively. The predicted PD of occupants due to draft of these four points are calculated, and the results are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0143624412442512">Table 3</xref>. As observed from the data in the table, because of the smaller air supply volume, indoor air speed is very low, all the values of PD are less than 15%, which shows that the radiant cooling system has good thermal comfort and avoids unwanted local discomfort due to draft.

<p>The condensation problem of radiant cooling ceiling in summer is an important issue that impedes the widespread application of this system currently; condensation can not only damage the system’s normal cooling capacity, but also lead to indoor microbial growth, thus resulting in health problems.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0143624412442512">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0143624412442512">24</xref></sup> When the cooling ceiling surface temperature is lower than indoor air dew point, condensation occurs on cooling surface. In order to avoid the occurrence of condensation, two methods such as controlling the water supply temperature for cooling ceiling or controlling water supply volume of it are often employed to control the cooling ceiling surface temperature.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0143624412442512">25</xref></sup> This research took the second control method, just as described in ‘Introduction of tested air-conditioning system’ section. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13-0143624412442512">Figure 13</xref> shows the variation trends of indoor average RH during a testing day cycle. It can be seen from the figure that indoor average RH varies between 55% and 65% with an average value of 58.3%. In addition, during the testing period, the indoor DBT is around 27.8℃, and the dew point temperature corresponding to the average RH is 21.7℃. The cooling ceiling surface temperature is 23.1℃, obviously higher than the dew point temperature, so there is no risk of condensation during the testing day.

<p>The data above were measured under the condition that the room was well closed and the system worked well. Thus, with reasonable design, matching dehumidification unit, when the system runs well, the user uses properly, and the room is well sealed, the condensation risk cannot occur in rooms which employ radiant cooling systems. However, there is perennial high humidity in hot summer and cold winter zone of China, so some extreme conditions may cause sudden increase in indoor moisture content and accordingly cause condensation, such as the sudden increase in indoor staff, improper use of windows open for ventilation in hot and humid weather, ventilation system failure, and other unexpected phenomena. Therefore, for radiant cooling system, good anti-condensation measures are essential. In European countries, dew point sensor is mainly used for controlling water system of cooling ceiling to solve the condensation problem,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0143624412442512">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0143624412442512">25</xref></sup> but this method is more suitable for responsive capillary and metal radiant cooling ceilings. As the concrete ceiling has the characteristics of delay and untimely response to regulation, it is suggested to set the sensor on the outdoor air system simultaneously. The dehumidification amount of outdoor air can be adjusted according to the changes of indoor moisture content.</p>

<p>This article details a study on the operating conditions analysis of a residential radiant cooling system combined with an outdoor air handling unit in summer, as well as the field measurement, and evaluation of indoor thermal environment. Several conclusions are concluded as follows.
<list id="list1-0143624412442512" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>The residential radiant cooling ceiling combined with outdoor air supply system works well in summer; it can provide high-temperature chilled water for the radiant terminal device and also can provide low-temperature chilled water for the outdoor air supply terminal device, taking into account the different needs of two air-conditioning terminal device. This system takes into account the cooling, dehumidification, and ventilation requirements, which makes up the deficiency of outdoor air supply of traditional residential air-conditioners. Indoor air speed ranges from 0.1 to 0.3 m/s, the outdoor air volume can meet the thermal comfort requirement on the premise of meeting the health requirements of occupants.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>In stable operating period of the system, during a testing day cycle, when the outdoor temperature varies larger, through the start–stop control of the heat pump unit, the indoor PMV index can be controlled with a range from −0.15 to 0.5 and the indoor PPD index can be controlled with a range from 5% to 10%, these two indexes both meet the comfort standard of ISO 7730.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The temperature gradient of representative measurement points at the vertical direction are 2.5℃/m and 1.53℃/m, respectively, both values meet the comfort standard of ISO 7730. The predicted values of PD due to draft of representative measurement points are less than 15%, eliminating the local discomfort due to draft caused by traditional convection air-conditioning system. During a testing day cycle, the floor temperature fluctuates around 25℃ and the maximum indoor temperature fluctuation range is only 2.8℃. Each of the local thermal discomfort evaluation indexes are within the recommended range of ISO 7730.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>With reasonable design, matching dehumidification unit, when the system runs well, the user uses properly, and the room is well sealed, the condensation risk cannot occur in rooms which employ radiant cooling systems in hot summer and cold winter zones of China. However, considering high humidity characteristics of this region, for some extreme conditions, good anti-condensation measures are essential. For concrete cooling ceiling, not only the dew point sensor is suggested, but also another sensor is suggested on the outdoor air system to regulate the dehumidification amount of outdoor air. This will be studied in future work.</p></list-item>
