<abstract>
<p>We examine how war and rivalry affect state building in the Middle East. We argue that wars and rivalries promote state capacity, defined as the ability of a government to penetrate society for the purposes of resource extraction. Using cross-national time-series data for eighteen Middle Eastern countries from 1960 to 2003, we find that the structural pressure caused by the presence of international and domestic rivals augments extractive capacity. Conversely, both international and civil wars jeopardize state building in the Middle East. Furthermore, the negative effects of war upon state capacity are far greater than the constructive effects of rivalry.</p>

<p>This paper explores how war and rivalry influence state building in the Middle East. It does so through an application of the classical European-inspired predatory theory of the state (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr97-1065912912448538">Tilly 1985</xref>) and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-1065912912448538">Thies’s (2004)</xref> modified approach to predatory theory. We argue that stronger state capacity in the Middle East may result from war in keeping with Charles Tilly’s famous aphorism that “war made the state, and the state made the war.” We also extend Thies’s modified predatory approach that emphasizes the structural pressures induced by external and internal rivalry to the Middle Eastern region. In particular, we argue that both internal and external rivals may augment state capacity in this region. While previous studies in other regions have consistently demonstrated positive effects for external rivalry on state capacity, the evidence for internal rivalry has been mixed. We also argue that both civil and interstate war may increase state capacity, especially since war is so prevalent in this region compared to the rest of the world. State building, we therefore suggest, may proceed along both classical and modified predatory theory lines in the Middle East.</p>
<p>To test these propositions, we assemble a cross-national time-series data set that includes eighteen Middle Eastern countries from 1960 to 2003. We find that the structural pressure exerted by the presence of international and domestic rivals augments state capacity, consistent with a modified approach to predatory theory. However, in contrast to our expectations, both international and civil wars significantly damage state building in the Middle East. Moreover, the positive effects of rivalries do not offset the damage to state capacity incurred by wars. These findings are robust across different statistical estimation strategies, and controlling for a variety of factors, including oil rents, political openness, social fractionalization measures, and other economic control variables.</p>

<title>Classical and Modified Predatory Theories of State Building</title>
<p>Predatory theory was originally developed to explain the state building process of European countries in early modern times. Specifically, it argues that wars facilitate state building activities (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1065912912448538">Levi 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1065912912448538">North 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1065912912448538">Olson 1993</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr98-1065912912448538">Tilly (1992)</xref> specifies four core activities of state building in early modern Europe: state making by neutralizing domestic competitors in the territory claimed by the state; war making by deterring rivals from outside of the territory claimed by the state; protection of the rulers’ allies both inside and outside of the territorial state against the predation of external and internal rivals; and extraction of resources from its population in support of the other three activities.</p>
<p>These core activities are also consistent with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1065912912448538">North’s (1981</xref>, 21-23) model of state building. In this model, a state performs three fundamental functions, namely, the exchange of services (e.g., protection and justice) for revenues, the design of property rights to maximize its revenues, and revenue extraction. Revenue extraction, predominantly in the form of taxation, is the lifeblood of the state that allows it to perform all other state functions, such as building administrative and military institutions, providing protection, justice, and other public goods. However, the state’s revenue extraction is constrained by the opportunity cost incurred by potential rivals both within the state and without. To put it differently, the state’s extractive activities, which are indispensable to the provision of public goods, are conditioned by both state making and war making.</p>
<p>The connection between war and revenue extraction is often characterized by the “ratchet” effect (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1065912912448538">Rasler and Thompson 1985</xref>). Because of the war and threat of war, the state apparatus is able to increase the tolerance of citizens for rising extraction, because the benefits of protection in the face of foreign or domestic turmoil outweighs the costs that come with the expansion of the state’s fiscal and administrative prowess (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr97-1065912912448538">Tilly 1985</xref>). On the other hand, a less threatening international environment hinders state building (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1065912912448538">Centeno 2002</xref>; Atzili 2010). For instance, Jeffrey Herbst and others argue that the lack of interstate war and significant border changes in Africa reduced the capacity of African states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1065912912448538">Herbst 1989</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1065912912448538">1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1065912912448538">Jackson and Rosberg 1982</xref>).</p>
<p>Thies’s modified predatory theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-1065912912448538">2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-1065912912448538">2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-1065912912448538">2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-1065912912448538">2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-1065912912448538">2009</xref>) advances the classical theory in several ways. First, Thies has tested classical predatory theory in non-European regions, including the whole developing world, Central America, South America, and Sub-Saharan Africa. Overall, Thies finds that countries in the aforementioned contemporary regions follow a path of state building similar, but not identical, to that of early modern Europe. Second, Thies modified predatory theory in order to account for the changed historic circumstances under which non-European states emerged and developed. Among other things, Thies focuses on interstate rivalry as a driving force behind the expanded extractive capacity of developing countries, because interstate war is rare in the post–World War II era. He has argued that even in the absence of war, the state may manipulate their relations with neighboring countries as a means to extract more resources from their subjects. Third, Thies also considers the role of internal rivals engaged in conflict with the state, which tend to be overlooked in most bellicist approaches to state building. Internal challengers to the state may similarly stimulate increased state capacity because of the state’s need to neutralize or eliminate them, or they may even reduce state capacity as challengers bargain with rulers for their continued support or make some parts of the territory inaccessible to rulers. Finally, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-1065912912448538">Thies (2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr93-1065912912448538">2010</xref>) has also considered the changed resource environment for contemporary states and their internal rivals by demonstrating that while some primary commodities may enhance insurgents’ ability to initiate civil wars, much of these resource rents, including those generated by oil, actually augment state capacity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1065912912448538">Morrison 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-1065912912448538">Smith 2004</xref>).</p>

<title>Middle Eastern State Building</title>
<p>In this paper, we expand Thies’s analysis to state building in the Middle Eastern region. Thies is not the first to focus on particular regions, since many other scholars have provided compelling explanations for the study of international relations across regions. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1065912912448538">Katzenstein et al. (2000)</xref> argue that international security has become autonomous and prominently regional since decolonization (also refer to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1065912912448538">Lemke 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1065912912448538">Buzan and Waever 2003</xref>). The Middle East is particularly characterized by an autonomous regional level of security that has operated strongly for decades.</p>
<p>Scholars disagree about the scope of the Middle East, as they always do when considering the boundaries of any region (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1065912912448538">Garaibeh 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1065912912448538">Lemke 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1065912912448538">Buzan and Waever 2003</xref>). For instance, Buzan and Waever define the region as stretching from Morocco to Iran, including all of the Arab states plus Israel. They exclude Cyprus, Sudan, and the states in the Horn of Africa. Afghanistan is considered an “insulator” (not a buffer) between the Middle East and Asia. We slightly broaden Buzan and Waever’s list to include the following countries as the Middle East: Algeria, Bahrain, Egypt, Iran, Iraq, Israel, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Libya, Morocco, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, Syria, Tunisia, United Arab Emirates, and Yemen. Except for Israel, all of the Middle Eastern countries selected are Islamic. All but Iran, Israel, and Sudan are predominantly culturally Arabic.</p>
<p>Many scholars describe the states in the Arab world as “weak artifices” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1065912912448538">Halpern 1963</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-1065912912448538">Sharabi 1966</xref>). Nevertheless, except for a few cases of disintegration, the vast majority of the Arab states have consolidated themselves without “fusion, secession, reconstitution, or dissolution” into a larger Pan-Arab entity. Revolutions in Iran and Sudan, or political disintegration in Lebanon, were the exceptions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1065912912448538">Dawisha and Zartman 1988</xref>). These states are “hard,” but not “strong.” According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1065912912448538">Ayubi (1995)</xref>, the hard state “punishes and coerces,” whereas the “soft” state achieves its goals through persuasion and compellence. All Arab states are hard, especially Syria and Iraq (pre-U.S. invasion). These ultra-hard or fierce states employ bureaucracies, armies, prisons, and other coercive tools to preserve themselves by force. Meanwhile, these states are weak because they are incapable of enforcing laws and tuning in to changing conditions through persuasion and economic incentives.</p>
<p>The major exception to this argument is Israel. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1065912912448538">Migdal (1988)</xref> explains the emergence of Israel as the combined action of war and mass migration. State building in Israel was driven by exogenous political forces that favored concentrated social control. These forces included World War II, military threats from the Islamic world, the presence of a social group (the Jews) independent of existing social control and “skillful enough to execute the designs of state leaders,” as well as “skillful leadership” with the intention to build a strong state under adverse circumstances. However, ethnically speaking, Israel is still a weak state. As a result, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1065912912448538">Butenschoen (1992)</xref> argues that state building in Israel is not yet completed. Israel was built upon minority mobilization and failed to integrate its indigenous population. It is a pluralistic society in which one ethnic group (the Jews) dominates the state apparatus and excludes rival groups (mainly the Arabs) from central political, military, and economic positions.</p>
<p>The pervasive weakness of the state in Islamic countries in the Middle East is heavily grounded into their history and endowments. Specifically, these weak states have been shaped by a series of factors, predominantly colonization, tribal politics, Islam, and oil wealth. Among other things, colonizers imparted different legacies to the states in Middle East, which led to both strong (e.g., Egypt and Tunisia) and weak (e.g., Lebanon and Libya) states. Colonization also resulted in boundaries that were rarely congruent with indigenous social formations or economic systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1065912912448538">Anderson 1987</xref>).</p>
<p>Except for the Crescent Strip, the current Middle East state system was founded on the core societal units in the Arab world: tribes, villages, and extended families (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-1065912912448538">Salame 1987a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-1065912912448538">1987b</xref>). While North Yemen, Oman, Morocco, and Libya were founded on the basis of the imam-chief system, Saudi Arabia originated from the alliance system of chiefs and imams (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1065912912448538">Harik 1987</xref>). The nucleus of the state, which was later recognized by Western powers in the nineteenth and twentieth century, took the joint efforts of tribal leaders, Islamic reformers, and ambitious emirs. These traditional social forces still hold great sway over the Middle East states. For instance, state identities that emerged after the 1950s were based more on compliance with the state’s preexisting polities, predominantly tribalism, rather than on modern legitimizing forces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr99-1065912912448538">Van de Walle 1987</xref>). Consequently, the Middle Eastern states are characterized by fragmented societies with artificially imposed states.</p>
<p>The long tradition of tribal politics, together with the legacy of Arab political thought, may predispose many Arab countries to accept autocratic rule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1065912912448538">Butterworth 1987</xref>). In the Arab world, all countries except Lebanon are controlled by “one or a few persons” who do not attempt to empower the state. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1065912912448538">Frish (1999)</xref> contends that in Palestine it was Arafat and the modernizing “traditional” society that gained ground at the expense of the state, principally through regulation, extraction, and distribution. Meanwhile, the presence of Islam, which is described as a pervasive ideology that defies the separation between state and religion and prescribes total obedience to the ruler, reinforces the prevalence of autocracy (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1065912912448538">Dawisha 1988a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1065912912448538">Donno and Russett 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1065912912448538">Fish 2002</xref>). Of course, furtive efforts beginning in Iran in 2009 and the wider Arab Spring in 2010 may change long-held views concerning Middle Eastern societies’ predisposition for autocracy.</p>
<p>Middle Eastern state building is politically and economically wedded to oil reserves in the region as well.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1065912912448538">1</xref></sup> Oil allows the government in rentier states to rule with little financial extraction from their societies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr100-1065912912448538">Van de Walle 1998</xref>). Non-rentier states are also strongly influenced by oil. They depend heavily on aid, expatriate remittances, and various secondary rent sources from oil producers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1065912912448538">Beblawi 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-1065912912448538">Salame 1987b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1065912912448538">Ross 2001</xref>). Because of the small size and low skill level of their labor forces, non-oil producers become an important source of skilled workers for rentier states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1065912912448538">Beblawi 1987</xref>).</p>
<p>Scholars are divided about the effect of oil wealth on state building in the Middle East. A cohort of scholars argues that oil jeopardizes these states by creating incentives for rampant rent seeking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1065912912448538">Karl 1997</xref>), retarding institutional building (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1065912912448538">Garaibeh 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-1065912912448538">Shafer 1994</xref>), and destabilizing the national economy (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1065912912448538">Fearon and Laitin 2003</xref>). Conversely, affluent oil producers are arguably capable of building a huge and coercive state security apparatus by extracting from resource, winning the support of great powers in combat with domestic rebels, and redistributing oil rents for the purchase of loyalty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1065912912448538">Ayubi 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1065912912448538">Le Billon 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1065912912448538">Ross 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1065912912448538">Morrison 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-1065912912448538">Smith 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr93-1065912912448538">Thies 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Tribal politics, colonization, Islam, and oil wealth constitute the backdrop under which wars and rivalries exert their effects on Middle Eastern state building. International wars are a conspicuous characteristic of the Middle East, and undoubtedly affect the state building processes of the region. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1065912912448538">Anderson (1987)</xref> argues that the development of state capacities in the Middle East was less a reaction to domestic political competition and economic change than a response to international pressure. Buzan and Waever (2002) identify three regional security subcomplexes that relate to each other in the region. First, the Levant subcomplex between Israel and its Arab neighbors including Israel, Egypt, Syria, Lebanon, Jordan, and nonstate actors, such as Hamas and the PLO. In addition, a number of countries, including Iraq, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Libya, and Tunisia, are indirectly engaged against Israel and become enmeshed in this security complex. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1065912912448538">Ayoob (1996)</xref> argues that the national security of the Middle East is unique in that Israel poses a long-standing threat to the Arab states. Particularly, Israeli military and technological superiority is perceived in the Arab world as a function of its Western character. Hence, despite the religious and ethnic uniqueness of Israel, it has played an indispensable part in shaping the international security environment in this region. Second, the Persian Gulf subcomplex, which came into being after the British withdrawal in 1971, involves Iran, Iraq, and Saudi-led Gulf states (Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Bahrain, Qatar, UAE, Oman), as well as the peripheral rivalry between Saudi Arabia and Yemen and within North and South Yemen (prior to unification). The 1979 Islamic revolution in Iran intensified the competition between Saudi Arabia and Iran for leadership in the Islamic world. The intensity of conflict in this subcomplex is far less than that of the Arab–Israeli dispute, but there is also interdependence between them. Third, the Maghreb subcomplex, characterized by shifting and uneasy relationships between Libya, Tunisia, Algeria, and Morocco, is primarily concerned with the Moroccan annexation of Western Sahara starting in 1975. This annexation led to a twelve-year dispute between Algeria and Libya. The Maghreb states are also involved in the Arab–Israeli and Persian Gulf conflicts.</p>
<p>Because of the complicated security situation in the Middle East, war making and preparation for war is thought to have greatly affected state building in the region. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1065912912448538">Heydemann (2000)</xref> argues that war making is directed, mediated, and deeply transnationalized in the Middle Eastern militant countries (e.g., Egypt, Syria, Israel, Jordan, and Iraq). Moreover, the transnationalization of wars, as well as war preparation funded by foreign power or oil rents, has become an explicit and conscious strategy of state elites. This is because foreign policy has played a central role in legitimizing the Arab leaders and their political orders. Both Arabism and Islam tend to weaken the identity of the state. Therefore, foreign policy becomes a convenient vehicle for regime stability and legitimacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1065912912448538">Dawisha 1988a</xref>).</p>
<p>Interstate war in the Middle East is also often a response to international security dilemmas or acute domestic crises. Because of the flat terrain in the Middle East, offense is often deemed to be superior to defense. Leaders have frequently anticipated offensive advantages, such as Israel’s offensive strategic planning in case of conflict with Arab states. The advancement of military technology blurs the offensive and defensive postures, since traditional defensive weapons, such as antiaircraft missiles, can easily be utilized for offensive purpose as the Egyptian army showed across the Suez Canal in 1973 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-1065912912448538">Stein 1993</xref>, 57-62). Internally, social stress often makes leaders oblivious to the prohibitive costs of military action, which transform the state–society relationship into a highly militarized form in a number of Arab countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1065912912448538">Picard 1988</xref>). Hence, the vulnerabilities engendered by political, economic, the Arab–Israeli, and other external conflicts have become the tools to justify extensive domestic censorship and suppression of dissent, facilitating the imposition of strict internal security measures. This is how the “security” state in the Middle East has emerged, such as in the cases of Syria, Iraq, Jordan, and Egypt.</p>
<p>The Arab world is also characterized by many local nationalisms as well as the effort to construct pan-Arab or pan-Islamic nationalism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-1065912912448538">Salame 1987a</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1065912912448538">Barnett (1995)</xref> demonstrates that pan-Arab nationalism has generated far more interstate rivalry and conflict than cooperation and harmony. The continued legitimacy of the concept of an Arab nation creates problems for the legitimacy of Arab regimes as well as confusion over their security priorities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1065912912448538">Ayoob 1996</xref>), as has the inter-Islamic relationship. Specifically, the inter-Arab rivalries relate to competition for the leadership in the Arab world, as well as rivalry over territory, water, ideology, clan interests, and royal succession. Accordingly, pan-Islamists are more often the domestic opposition groups in the Arab states. For the same reason, Iran, the Islamic but non-Arab state, is naturally a threat to its neighbors. The interplay between the Arab versus non-Arab dynamics on the one hand, and the Arab versus Arab ones on the other, complicates the security situation in the Middle East. Despite the fact that Arab versus non-Arab disputes are usually more salient than those that pit Arab against Arab, significant exceptions do exist. For example, Syria aligned with Iran during the Iran–Iraq war. Both Jordan and Syria attacked the Palestinians despite their collective Arab stand against Israel. Syria has occupied substantial portions of Lebanon and on occasion has threatened Jordan.</p>
<p>This trajectory leads to the vast expansion of military bureaucracies and expenditures as well as the emergence of domestic political economies constructed around the regional and international pursuit of strategic rents. For example, in Syria, a high level of war preparation mingled with the explicit reluctance to engage in a full-scale war likely constrained state building and state institutional formation and fostered the organization of state capabilities to maintain a high level of threat. Only a sufficient perception of threat allows regimes to extract rents from regional and international alliance networks. Therefore, in many Middle Eastern states, war preparation and war making are routine modes of governance and domination, rather than responses to the exceptional and temporary exigencies of war.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, war making and preparation may not always empower the state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1065912912448538">Barnett 1992</xref>), such as in the cases of the Iran–Iraq war and the Egypt–Syria conflict. The financial challenge of war making may induce or worsen the fiscal crisis of the state. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1065912912448538">Gongora (1997)</xref> argues that war preparation explains the rise and fall of state power in both Egypt and Israel. The frequency of interstate wars also explains the reliance on externally derived resources, such as foreign military and economic aid. This dependence reinforces the weakness of postcolonial state structures. A case in point is the Iran–Iraq war from 1980 to 1988. The war resulted in a decline of centralized state power because the financial pressure led the Iraqi government to liberalize its economy and downsize its bureaucracy and public sector.</p>
<p>The Middle East is also not short of civil wars and internal rivals. Much of the civil violence in this region is ethnic or religious in nature. In Iran, Iraq, and Syria, Kurds, the third largest ethnic group in the Middle East and the world’s largest stateless nation, have greatly shaped the state building process. The Kurds became a threat after the collapse of the Ottoman Empire. With the establishment of nation states in the aftermath of the First World War, Islamism was largely replaced by ethnic nationalism as the leading ideology in the region. Turkish, Arab, and Persian ethnic nationalisms constituted the central social fabric of loyalty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1065912912448538">Natali 2005</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1065912912448538">Entessar (2010)</xref> argues that Iran and Iraq have a commonality regarding Kurds: a weak central government corresponds to wide-ranging concessions that Kurds extract from Iran and Iraq; conversely, a stronger state apparatus is accompanied by the massacre of Kurds, imposition of tighter control without provision for autonomy or minority status. Hence, the presence of the Kurdish minority promotes the construction of a more coercive state apparatus in those countries. Yet, ethnic civil wars do not empower the state all the time. Their positive effects on state building may turn negative once ethnic civil wars cause the ethnic majority to divide. For instance, after 2003, the Sudanese civil war (1983-2005) was accompanied by both a genocidal campaign conducted by the Sudanese government against the non-Arab ethnic groups (e.g., Fur, Zaghawa, and Masalit) and the split of the Arabs in the Darfur region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-1065912912448538">Schmidinger 2009</xref>). This war greatly weakened Sudanese government capacity, which eventually led to the secession of South Sudan.</p>
<p>Radical Islamic movements associated with terrorism have become another salient feature that have drawn increasing attention in the region since 9/11. Successive U.S. administrations have discouraged democratization in Egypt in the belief that a push to check the Egyptian president’s power will usher in the control of radical Islamists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1065912912448538">Brownlee 2002</xref>). Cautious U.S. support for Mubarak’s recent overthrow is continued evidence that the U.S. would rather see a continued secular military domination of Egypt than a democratic election that might empower the Muslim Brotherhood. Such actions strengthen the coercive capacity of Middle Eastern autocracies. Antiterrorist fervor helps to promote state building domestically as well. For instance, the current internal politics of Lebanon is characterized by the power struggle between the Lebanese Prime Minister Fouad Siniora and a primary internal rival, Hezbollah. The fact that much of the West labels Hezbollah as a terrorist organization facilitates the internal political process from the outside, as any gains made by Hezbollah can be categorized as a threat to both internal and external stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr104-1065912912448538">Zweiri and Johnson 2008</xref>). At the same time, the tag of “terrorism” encourages the “targeted” murders of Arab fighters on the Gaza Strip (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1065912912448538">Fotopoulos 2006</xref>). More importantly, the chronic contention between Jews and Arabs sets the stage for Israeli state capacity strengthened by internal rivalry. Israel has thus far avoided full-scale civil war despite great potential for one as indicated by the Intifada. The resilience of Israel partly stems from the strong institutions of the state, which forestall internal conflict. But according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr96-1065912912448538">Tilly’s (1975)</xref> logic, the state apparatus has also become stronger in this process. Political grievance, which mainly originates from Jewish settlements on the West Bank, is rife in Israel. However, high-intensity civil violence has been prohibited chiefly because of the sense of solidarity among Jews, and the perception of existing threats confronting Israel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr101-1065912912448538">Weissbrod 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Civil wars in the region are enmeshed in regional and global politics as well. These side effects include the flow of refugees into neighboring countries, increased terrorism, and heightened Sunni–Shiite tensions. It is noteworthy that Hezbollah continuously finds sympathy and support throughout the Muslim world because of its resistance against Israel (Zweiri and Johnson 2006). In addition, the rise of Shiite identity politics significantly affects political life in Lebanon and Iraq. Shiites were historically disenfranchised throughout the Middle East, though the possibility they may gain power make some fear they would institute a more coercive state apparatus (Zweiri and Johnson 2006).</p>
<p>The aforementioned review of the literature suggests a variety of factors that have affected state capacity in the Middle East. Oil wealth, democratization, and a variety of cultural factors all have roles to play in state capacity. Our focus is on the role of external and internal conflict and threat in building state capacity. While the aforementioned literature suggests some variation by case on the relationship between conflict and state capacity in the Middle East, on balance we suggest that international war/rivalry and internal war/rivalry should strengthen state capacity. We hypothesize the following.</p>

<title>Data and Method</title>
<p>We test our hypotheses against the backdrop of eighteen Middle Eastern countries.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1065912912448538">2</xref></sup> Our unit of analysis is the country year from 1960 to 2003. The maximum number of observations in our data set is 737, though a few instances of missing data reduce the in-sample observations to 731. The states in the sample exhibit a maximum of 44 yearly observations (e.g., Iran) and a minimum of 33 observations (e.g., United Arab Emirates), depending largely on their year of independence.</p>
<sec id="section4-1065912912448538">
<title>Dependent Variable</title>
<p>Our dependent variable is the extractive capacity of the government. State capacity is most often operationalized as extractive capacity, since taxation and bureaucracies that support extractive activities play a fundamental role in the survival of a state (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1065912912448538">Organski and Kugler 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-1065912912448538">Snider 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-1065912912448538">Thies 2007</xref>). Our predicator, relative political capacity (RPC), is a fiscal indicator that measures governmental efficiency in extracting resources from their population relative to other states with similar resource endowments and levels of development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1065912912448538">Arbetman and Kugler 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1065912912448538">Johnson and Robinowitz 2005</xref>). It is operationalized as the ratio of actual revenue to expected revenue. An RPC score higher than 1 indicates that the state is able to extract more resources than is expected. Conversely, a score below one implies that the state extracts less than expected.</p>
<p>In this research, we do not utilize the state’s tax revenues as a percentage of gross domestic product (GDP), which is frequently used as a measure of extractive capacity (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1065912912448538">Campbell 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-1065912912448538">Thies 2004</xref>). This is because ten of the seventeen Middle Eastern states in the sample are OPEC members. These countries are characterized by low extraction from their populations, because of their oil wealth, as well as the unwillingness of autocratic governments to extract resources from the citizenry lest they stir up internal dissent. Hence, the conventional operationalization of extractive capacity as the tax ratio is less useful than RPC, which reflects both actual and potential extractive capacity.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1065912912448538">
<title>Primary Independent Variables</title>
<p>We select two sets of primary independent variables. First, following Thies (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-1065912912448538">2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-1065912912448538">2007</xref>), we employ the presence of external and domestic rivalry. Thies argues that interstate rivalries represent the threat of war and mobilization for possible conflict, which should enable government extraction. We examine two operationalizations of the interstate rivalry concept: enduring rivalry from Klein, Goertz, and Diehl (2006)<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1065912912448538">3</xref></sup> and strategic rivalry from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr95-1065912912448538">Thompson and Dreyer (2011)</xref>.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1065912912448538">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>Klein, Goertz, and Diehl (2006) conceptualize enduring rivalry as a relationship between two long-term adversaries that is characterized by regular military threats and use of force, as well as the formulation of foreign policy in military terms. They measure an enduring rivalry as a pair of states that experiences at least six militarized interstate disputes (MIDs) within at least twenty years. On the other hand, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr94-1065912912448538">Thompson’s (2001)</xref> strategic rivalries occur when states view each other either as a competitor, or the source of actual or potential threats that have the prospect of being militarized, or as an enemy. It is the perception of the decision makers in both states that determines the beginning and ending of the strategic rivalry.</p>
<p>Two significant characteristics distinguish these two approaches to external rivalry: First, Thompson does not specify breakpoints in the dispute frequency or duration according to MIDs, as seen in Klein, Goertz and Diehl. Instead, Thompson depends on the foreign policy histories of each state for information about decision makers’ perceptions of threat. In this way, Thompson not only includes militarized activity represented by MIDs, but the structural pressures that exist between a pair of adversaries even if they do not confront each other militarily. Second, while the enduring rivalry data set reflects both intraregional (e.g., Morocco and Algeria from 1962 to 1984), and interregional competition (e.g., Israel and Russia from 1956 to 1974), strategic rivalry focuses on intraregional rivalry (e.g., South Yemen and North Yemen from 1967 to 1989) alone. Almost half of the enduring rivalries (twenty-six of fifty-three) are interregional, while all twenty-seven strategic rivalries are intraregional in nature. We expect these differences in operationalization to potentially produce some intriguing findings across the Middle Eastern countries.</p>
<p>We use data on domestic rivalry from the enduring internal rivalries data set (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1065912912448538">Bercovitch and DeRouen 2008</xref>). An enduring internal rivalry exists if at least one of the following two conditions is met: first, the internal conflict must persist for a long period and change very little over time (e.g., Guatemala, Colombia); second, while these internal conflicts persist over time, actual fighting may sporadically relapse after temporary ceasefires (e.g., Sri Lanka, Indonesia). Six Middle Eastern countries have had enduring internal rivals.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1065912912448538">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>We operationalize external enduring rivalry, strategic rivalry, and enduring internal rivalry in a manner different from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-1065912912448538">Thies (2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-1065912912448538">2007</xref>). Thies measured a rivalry as a dichotomous variable, coded 1 if the state experiences any number of rivalries in a given year, and 0 otherwise. This measure captures the presence of rivalry, but may lead to systematic bias in the analysis because the dummy variable fails to account for the number of rivals at a certain time point. Theoretically, the pressure from five rivals is substantially different from that of only one adversary. In the former situation, leaders have a much stronger motivation to empower the state machinery. For example, in 1985, Egypt was under threat by five strategic opponents, including Iran, Iraq, Libya, Sudan, and Syria. On the other hand, Algeria was only strategically threatened by Morocco. Hence, we choose to operationalize the rivalry in any of the aforementioned forms as the number of rivals in a given year. Such an operationalization has two more unique advantages in the Middle Eastern context: first, some countries, such as Iraq and Iran, are in strategic rivalry with international adversaries from the 1950s through the present (e.g., Iraq vs. Egypt, Iran vs. Iraq). Coding the number of rivalries will allow us to demonstrate the changes in threat level that would be masked by a dichotomous measure of rivalry. Second, we will also be able to compute the extent to which an additional rival increases the extraction capacity of a state.</p>
<p>The second set of main independent variables includes two dummy variables: international and civil wars. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-1065912912448538">Thies (2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-1065912912448538">2007</xref>) previously operationalized conflict in terms of rivalries mainly because wars are very rare across the post-1945 world. However, the Middle East is an exception to the general rarity of wars. For example, the Middle Eastern countries experienced at least twelve interstate wars and eight civil wars between 1945 and 1994 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1065912912448538">Arnold 1995</xref>). Therefore, we have a chance to directly test whether the original predatory theory is applicable to the Middle East as well. The Armed Conflict Dataset (ACD) defines a civil war as “a contested incompatibility that concerns government and/or territory where the use of armed force between two parties, of which at least one is the government of a state, results in at least 25 battle-related deaths” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1065912912448538">Gleditsch et al. 2002</xref>). We follow the convention in conflict studies and only count as an interstate war an armed conflict that induced at least 1,000 battle-related deaths per year.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1065912912448538">
<title>Control Variables</title>
<p>We control for a number of standard variables in our empirical test. The first control variable is oil wealth. We utilize <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1065912912448538">Ross’ (2008)</xref> newly collected oil rents per capita data set instead of traditional measures of oil exports divided by GDP (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1065912912448538">Ross 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1065912912448538">Fearon and Laitin 2003</xref>). This variable is computed as a country’s total rents from oil and gas in 2000 constant U.S. dollars divided by its midyear population. This measure has a number of advantages. Among other things, it subtracts production costs and does not include oil that is imported and subsequently reexported. Since most theories about the resource curse imply that resources generate rents for the government, the traditional measure of oil exports is a rather blunt instrument toward this end. Conversely, oil rents per capita, whose value is normalized by a country’s population, is much more precise. We expect that oil rents per capita will be positively related to extraction in the Middle East, since so many rentier states populate the region. Oil rents have recently been found in empirical studies to strengthen state capacity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-1065912912448538">Smith 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1065912912448538">Morrison 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr93-1065912912448538">Thies 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>The openness of political institutions is measured by the polity2 value taken from the Polity IV data set (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1065912912448538">Marshall and Jaggers 2000</xref>). The original data ranges from −10 to 10 with 21 integer scales. In order to facilitate interpretation, we add 10 to the data and divide by 2. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1065912912448538">Ayoob (1995)</xref> suggests that political openness is positively associated with state capacity, though previous studies find mixed results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1065912912448538">Cheibub 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-1065912912448538">Thies 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-1065912912448538">2007</xref>).</p>
<p>We also control for the three most often used cultural variables: ethnic, linguistic, and religious fractionalization. The three indices range from 0 to 1, with a higher value denoting more cultural diversification. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1065912912448538">Alesina et al.’s (2003)</xref> updated data sets are based on a broad classification of group composition and cover almost twice as many countries as those normally used in the literature, such as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1065912912448538">Easteban (1994)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1065912912448538">Easterly and Levine (1997)</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1065912912448538">Fearon and Laitin (2003)</xref>. Cultural clashes are expected to potentially reduce state extractive capacity, either because they prevent state access to certain populations for extraction purposes or such groups may bargain with the state over their relative share of revenue extraction. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-1065912912448538">Taylor and Botea (2008)</xref> argue that a dominant ethnic group facilitates the growth of state. Hence, we expect all three fractionalizations to reduce state capacity.</p>
<p>We measure the durability of a state in terms of the number of years since official independence from the former colonizers according to the Correlates of War state system data set (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1065912912448538">2008</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1065912912448538">Jackman (1993)</xref> argues that the duration of a state demonstrates its ability to survive the changing international and domestic environment. This effect may be curvilinear since institutional age may have a diminishing impact on state capacity. Accordingly, we create the squared term of a state age to capture such an effect following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-1065912912448538">Thies (2007)</xref>.</p>
<p>Finally, we control for economic conditions with four indicators. GDP per capita and GDP per capita squared are intended to operationalize national wealth and economic development. We extract the data from the World Development Indicators (WDI) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr102-1065912912448538">World Bank 2010</xref>). We expect economic development to affect state building in a nonlinear manner as well, since increases in extraction may peak as a society becomes increasingly wealthy and more likely to lobby to retard state extraction efforts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-1065912912448538">Thies 2007</xref>). Trade openness, operationalized as the sum of imports and exports divided by GDP, is expected to increase taxation capacity because trade broadens the taxation base for the government and speeds up the accumulation of wealth in a society (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-1065912912448538">Thies 2004</xref>). We use the data from the Penn World Tables (version 6.3) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1065912912448538">Heston, Summers, and Aten 2006</xref>). We also incorporate Official Development Aid per capita (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr102-1065912912448538">World Bank 2010</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1065912912448538">Bates (2001)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-1065912912448538">Snider (1990)</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-1065912912448538">Thies (2005)</xref> suggest that foreign development aid may prevent developing countries from improving their state extractive capacities.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1065912912448538">
<title>Model Specifications</title>
<p>We test our hypotheses using two statistical models.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1065912912448538">6</xref></sup> First, our panel data, which contains observations on multiple states observed over time, allows us to do time-series cross-sectional analysis (TSCS). Specifically, we run the random effects, instead of the fixed effects models. We make this choice for two reasons: first, the random effects models are less subject to bias in regressions due to omitted variables. We are unable to control for several variables previously used to predict extraction, such as the inflation rate and debt, because of large numbers of missing values in the WDI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr102-1065912912448538">World Bank 2010</xref>). Neither of these particular variables may be particularly salient for the Middle East in general, but nonetheless, we expect the random effects model to minimize the bias resulting from these omitted variables. Second, the random effects model also allows for the incorporation of variables that have no temporal changes within a country, unlike fixed effects models. For instance, cultural variables in our models, namely ethnic, religious, and linguistic diversity, do not vary over time within a particular country.</p>
<p>We conduct a Hausman test to determine the appropriateness of the random effects regression for our purposes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-1065912912448538">Stock and Watson 2003</xref>). This test evaluates the significance of an estimator versus an alternative one and thereby determines whether a statistical model (the fixed effects or random effects model) corresponds to the data. The null hypothesis of the test is that the coefficients estimated by the efficient random effects are different from those estimated by the consistent fixed effects estimation. If the null hypothesis is verified, the fixed effects model should be used; otherwise, the random effects model is a better choice. Overall, our tests reject the null, suggesting the random effects models are appropriate.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1065912912448538">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>Endogeneity is also an important consideration between some of the independent variables and relative political capacity. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-1065912912448538">Stein (1993</xref>, 60) suggests that the security dilemma in the Middle East may become more acute as the extractive capacity of states in this region grows and allows for a higher level of military expenditure. For this reason, we lag all variables one year on the right side of the equation, with the exception of the three time invariant cultural variables.</p>
<p>We also estimate a second set of OLS models for comparison. OLS is unbiased in the presence of auto-regression, conceptually simple, and computationally straightforward. However, OLS also does not allow us to avoid the endogeneity problem altogether, nor does it resolve the bias induced by omitted variables. Thus, our interpretations will focus on the random effect TSCS models.</p>

<title>Findings and Analysis</title>
<p>Our empirical findings lend support to our hypotheses about rivalry, but reject our hypotheses about war. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1065912912448538">Tables 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1065912912448538">2</xref> present the findings from the series of regressions. The main findings about war/rivalry and state building are as follows: whereas external and internal rivalries strengthen Middle Eastern state capacity, both international and civil war reduce state capacity drastically. Since the OLS models are less refined, for example, not controlling for temporal dependence and cross-national heterogeneity, our analysis will focus upon the results out of the three random effects TSCS models (models 1, 2, and 5).</p>

<p>We regress RPC on external and internal rivalries in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1065912912448538">Table 1</xref>. We do not place enduring external rivalry and strategic rivalry in the same model because the two variables are highly collinear, with the Pearson coefficient of above 0.75. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1065912912448538">Table 1</xref> shows that both external strategic rivals and enduring internal rivals significantly increase state capacity across all models, though the enduring external rivalry variable is not significant in model 1. In model 2, an additional strategic rival leads to an increase of 6.94 points in RPC. In the same model, the marginal effect of enduring domestic rival is 3.04 points, about 44% of the leverage of the former. In model 1, the marginal effect of domestic rivalry is 4.49 points, 1.45 points more than found in model 2. A tentative explanation is that where external rivalry does not exert significant effects upon state capacity, the impact of internal rivalries becomes more salient. But in model 3, in which both enduring external and internal rivals are significant predicators, the marginal effect of the former (2.56 points) is much smaller than that of the latter (7.32 points). This evidence suggests that internal rivals play a more important role than enduring external rivals in shaping state capacity in the Middle East. Furthermore, the differences between model 1 and 2 return us to our distinction between the operationalization of strategic and enduring rivalries: it appears that intraregional adversaries outweigh interregional opponents in fostering state capacity. As we noted previously, strategic rivalry mostly takes place between the Middle Eastern countries but a considerable proportion of enduring external rivals are outside of this region. Theoretically, this finding is not surprising given that the threat from intraregional or neighboring countries is much more salient than that from distant opponents. Except for global powers (e.g., USA) that have the ability to project military power throughout the world, interregional rivals do not pose a direct challenge to the national security of a state. In addition, intraregional rivalry exerts a stronger effect on state capacity than domestic rivalry (model 2), with a marginal effect of 6.94 vs. 3.04 points. This finding is consistent with the ratchet effect found in Latin America and Sub-Saharan Africa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-1065912912448538">Thies 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-1065912912448538">2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-1065912912448538">2007</xref>). The presence of rivalries increases the tolerance of the citizens for higher levels of state penetration.</p>
<p>Among control variables, oil wealth, as operationalized by <italic>oil rents per capita</italic>, significantly reinforce the state apparatus in all models. Although this result supports the rentier effect of oil money (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1065912912448538">Karl 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1065912912448538">Ross 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-1065912912448538">Smith 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1065912912448538">Morrison 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr93-1065912912448538">Thies 2010</xref>), it does not necessarily contradict the resource curse literature (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1065912912448538">Le Billon 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1065912912448538">Humphreys 2005</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1065912912448538">Basedau and Lay (2009)</xref> recently distinguish high resource wealth per capita from oil dependence, which is operationalized as oil income as a percentage of GDP. Given that we only control for the absolute amount of resource rents per capita, the effect of oil dependence, operationalized as the ratio of oil exports to GDP, is not observable.</p>
<p>Progress in political openness consistently and significantly consolidates a Middle Eastern state. This finding confirms both the classic predatory theory (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr98-1065912912448538">Tilly 1992</xref>) and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-1065912912448538">Thies’s (2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-1065912912448538">2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-1065912912448538">2007</xref>) findings on Central and South America, and Sub-Saharan Africa. Conversely, religious diversification jeopardizes state building efforts. This evidence is consistent with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1065912912448538">Reynal-Querol’s (2002)</xref> empirical findings that religious differences, given their fixed and nonnegotiable nature, are a social cleavage more important than linguistic differences in the development of civil wars. Neither ethnic nor linguistic fractionalization is robustly related to RPC. The insignificance of the two factors may lie in the fact that many Middle Eastern countries are rentier states that do not depend on the population for resource extraction. Even if there are cultural conflicts within states, the predominant ethnic group controls the oil wells. It is worth noting that the ELF measure does not capture tribalism in the Middle East. We should not thereby conclude that tribalism does not have important effects on their state building. Durability, proxied by the age of a state, follows an inverted-U-shaped curve associated with extraction in the Middle East. Early in their histories, Middle Eastern states extracted less revenue than expected, but over time they extract at a level that is essentially indistinguishable from other similarly aged states. GDP per capita follows a similar inverted-U shape, as expected.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1065912912448538">Table 2</xref> presents the regression results using the dichotomous variables of international and civil war as the main independent variables. Both international and civil war significantly reduce state capacity in models 5 and 6. Specifically, involvement in an international war decreases state capacity by 18.1 points and civil rebellion by 12 points. The negative impact of international war on state building is nearly 50% more severe than that of civil war. This evidence questions whether Tilly’s classic argument that wars make the state is still true in the contemporary period, at least for the Middle East. The implication of this finding is that wars do not consolidate, but weaken, the state in the contemporary Middle East. This evidence is similar to the impact of wars on state capacity in Latin American countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-1065912912448538">Thies 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-1065912912448538">2006</xref>). Finally, in models 5 and 6, the control variables exert very similar effects to that found in models 1 to 4.</p>
<p>Synthesizing the results from the models in Tables 4 and 5, we find that it is not wars per se but the structural pressure that comes with the presence of military and political threats from external and internal rivals that build the Middle Eastern state. Because of the high costs, rivals do not fight each other constantly but only sporadically. Nonwar confrontations or sporadic wars empower the state apparatus, promote the national economy, and make people more likely to identify with the state. In the words of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr97-1065912912448538">Tilly (1985)</xref>, which actually fit most closely with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-1065912912448538">Thies’s (2004)</xref> expectations, it is the “protection racket” of the constant threat of conflict that strengthens the state. Conversely, international and civil wars, which bring increased civilian suffering, greatly damage the political capacity of a Middle Eastern state. More importantly, wars damage state building far more than what rivals can recoup through structural pressures.</p>
<p>The severe negative effects of wars on state building may result from two facts: first, the Middle East has experienced far more wars than other regions of the developing world; second, many wars in the Middle East were severe and chronic. For instance, the civil war between Kurds and their three hosting countries (Iran, Iraq, and Syria) seems to be “endless,” lasting from 1945 onward. The Iran–Iraq War (1980-1988) led to approximately 1.5 million deaths (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1065912912448538">Arnold 1995</xref>). These wars consume human lives and livelihoods, thereby weakening the state’s legitimacy and authority in the eyes of their citizens. Many civil wars in this region are ethnic or cultural in nature. Ethnic wars may well lead to political cleavages in a country. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1065912912448538">Centeno (2002)</xref> points out that wars make states only when a politically or militarily dominant institution and a social class share the viewpoint that war is the best approach to maintaining their position or privilege. Otherwise, interstate wars, together with civil wars, diminished the autonomy and capacity of the state (see also Lopez-Alves 2001). While <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1065912912448538">Centeno (2002)</xref> argues that “limited wars” undermined state capacity in Latin America, “total wars,” which resulted in severe deaths and spanned many years in the Middle East, were harmful to state building as well.</p>
<p>The severe negative effect of wars, particularly international wars, on state building in the Middle Eastern countries is thought provoking. The Middle East and early modern Europe are similar to each other in the state building process in two aspects, that is, a relatively high frequency of war and severe fatalities; but why did wars strengthen state capacity in Europe but have the opposite effect in the Middle East? We suggest two interrelated explanations: First, violent state deaths, in the form of conquest and occupation, have virtually ceased after World War II. The international community holds fast to a norm not to conquer and formally take over a state by force (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1065912912448538">Barkin and Cronin 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr103-1065912912448538">Zacher 2001</xref>; Atzili 2010). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1065912912448538">Fazal (2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1065912912448538">2007</xref>) identifies 66 state “deaths” since 1817, but finds merely nine occurrences after 1945, most of them occurring in a nonviolent way, such as East Germany uniting with the West and the Soviet Union’s collapse into successor states. Conversely, state building in modern Europe was characterized by frequent conquest and annexation by force. In the span of 400 years, the number of polities in Europe decreased from around 500 to 25. Wars per se were highly exhausting, but the enlargement of territory greatly compensated for war costs. This was mainly because a larger territory brought more natural resources and population from which to extract. In contrast, the Middle Eastern countries experienced wars that did not yield territorial expansion. Such wars only led to decreased state capacity, especially when those wars were chronic and intense. Second, the bipolar system that prevailed throughout the Cold War played a role in shaping the negative connection between wars and state capacity as well. During the Cold War, the Middle East was subject to a great deal of superpower contestation. Each had its own sphere of influence. For instance, the U.S. aided Iraq during the Iran–Iraq War (1980-1988) and the Soviet Union assisted Iran. Their military and economic assistance helped to prolong the war, which resulted in the loss of more human lives and economic destruction. The superpowers were not interested in building state capacity in the region, but rather furthering their own geopolitical goals for control of a strategic region.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Our research indicates that rivalries and wars affect state building in a significant manner in the Middle East. Tilly’s version of predatory theory does not seem to travel very well to the contemporary Middle East, nor would he necessarily expect that it would. His aphorism that “war makes states, and states make war” fails to explain what happened in the Middle East from 1960 to 2003. Both interstate and civil wars greatly damaged state building. In contrast, the structural pressure incurred by the presence of international and domestic rivals augmented extractive capacity. These findings fit more closely with Thies’s modified predatory theory. Contemporary developing states, including those in the Middle East, may be running a kind of protection racket—their interstate rivalries and even their internal challengers may serve to slowly augment the capacity of the state over time.</p>
<p>The finding that oil wealth enhances state capacity is both reassuring and troubling. The peace of the Middle East, and indeed most regions, eventually depends upon the establishment of strong states (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1065912912448538">Collier and Hoeffler 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1065912912448538">Gurses and Mason 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-1065912912448538">Sobek 2010</xref>). While conflict may be needed to produce strong states, once a region of strong states emerges with settled borders they are unlikely to fight each other or experience significant internal conflict because of the political bargains that must be struck for revenue in exchange for representation and public goods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1065912912448538">Gibler 2007</xref>). Financial resources like oil wealth may serve as a substitute for this process. The natural endowment of petroleum gives these countries a privilege that greatly facilitates their state building without democratization (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1065912912448538">Le Billon 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1065912912448538">Ross 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1065912912448538">Morrison 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-1065912912448538">Smith 2004</xref>). Nevertheless, oil cannot buy a strong state and political loyalty forever. The oil wells are going to run dry in the foreseeable future (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1065912912448538">Beyond Petroleum 2007</xref>). Oil is also not an eternal substitute for democratization, as the current Arab Spring demonstrates, which paves the way for long-standing stability and prosperity. When oil runs out, authoritarianism and state failure will be two sides of the same coin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-1065912912448538">Schmidinger 2009</xref>). Our models above show that progress toward democracy contributes to state building in the Middle East. Wise leaders would move to democratize their country while the oil wealth lubricates their efforts. Therefore, the fourth wave of democratization that began with Tunisia in December 2010 was not a challenge to, but an opportunity for, state building in the Middle Eastern countries.</p>
<p>Our study of Middle Eastern state building generates a number of research questions that future researchers may consider. For instance, our analysis does not distinguish between rentier and nonrentier states. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1065912912448538">Barnett (1995</xref>, 12-18) suggests that the ratchet effect of war preparation in Egypt and Israel was salient before the 1967 War and declined thereafter. Both Egypt and Israel were nonrentier states, and Israel was particularly characterized as having “scarce, if nonexistent” resources. But our main finding is that war preparation (in the form of external rivalry) consistently fortified the state, which may be biased in favor of the oil producers since they are a large part of our sample. Therefore, what distinguishes rentier from nonrentier Middle Eastern states in terms of state building is a worthwhile research question.</p>
<p>At the same time, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1065912912448538">Porter (1994</xref>, 11-19) identifies two contrary effects of wars on state capacity. Whereas formative and organizing effects consolidate a state through territorial coalescence, the rallying or unifying effect, centralization, bureaucratization, increased taxation and so on, the disintegrative effects weaken a state through state destruction, revolution, and by destabilizing the government. Our empirical work shows that disintegrative effects dominated in the Middle East. It would be worthwhile to explore this dynamic more thoroughly in the Middle East and in other regions of the developing world.</p>

<p>According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1065912912448538">Ross (2001)</xref>, ten of the fifteen states most reliant on oil are located in the Middle East, including Algeria, Bahrain, Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Libya, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Syria, and Yemen.</p>

<p>Apart from the TSCS and OLS models, we follow <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-1065912912448538">Thies (2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-1065912912448538">2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-1065912912448538">2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-1065912912448538">2007</xref>) and run PCSE models as well. Our findings concerning the main independent variables are very similar to those in the TSCS models. However, given the time span in our data set is more than forty years, PCSE is not generally a good choice. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1065912912448538">Beck and Katz (1995)</xref> suggest that PCSE is not very effective for panel data with more than twenty time units. Hence, we do not report the findings from those models, although they testify to the robustness of our main findings.</p>
