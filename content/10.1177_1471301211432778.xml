<sec id="sec1-1471301211432778"><title>A Loving Approach to Dementia Care: Making meaningful connections with the person who has Alzheimer’s Disease or other dementia or memory loss Laura Wayman, The John Hopkins University Press, Baltimore MD, 2011, 128 pages, $14.95 (USD, Paperback) ISBN-10: 1-4214-0034-0 (paperback), ISBN-10: 1-4214-0033-2 (hardcover)</title>
<p>Laura Wayman’s <italic>A Loving Approach to Dementia Care</italic> is an important reminder for carers to take care of themselves and to approach their caring task with compassion and creativity. The book contains a series of vignettes, each describing a real dilemma faced by a dementia carer. Each vignette is followed by the <italic>Lessons Learned</italic> and the <italic>Perceptions and Approaches</italic> that were useful in managing or responding to that particular situation. Guided by the ‘affirmative response method of communication’, the book encourages carers to abandon efforts to correct the person with dementia’s view of the world and instead affirm his/her view of reality and engage with him/her within that ‘wonderland’. To do this, however, Wayman often draws on personal information about the person with dementia, such as their previous occupation or traumatic childhood experiences. This information is not always available to care workers, or even family carers, and these readers may be left wondering how best to engage the person with dementia in the absence of this information.</p>
<p>Written in plain English and drawing on Wayman’s personal and professional experiences, the book is targeted at family carers, personal care workers, and nursing staff. The short chapters make it easy to read in small bursts between other tasks and some vignettes will resonate strongly with carers. A Reader’s Guide, unfortunately hidden at the back of the book, provides a good overview of the main message of each chapter.</p>
<p>In some places, however, the book feels like a promotional brochure for Wayman’s professional services. The links between the vignettes and the ‘lessons learned’ or ‘perceptions and approaches’ are also tenuous at times. Further, the book lacks step-by-step instructions for implementing many of Wayman’s suggestions, which may leave some carers feeling frustrated. Despite this, the book does contain some timely reminders of the importance of staying calm, being creative, and treating the person with dementia with dignity and respect. It also provides insight into the perspective of the person with dementia and background information on the causes and consequences of dementia. Wayman’s strategies for taking the battle out of bath-time and practicing gratefulness may also offer tangible ‘take home’ solutions for some readers. Overall, this is a well-intentioned book which may inspire some carers to take a new approach, but the disjointed structure and lack of practical applications will disappoint others.</p>
