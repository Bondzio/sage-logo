<abstract>
<p>This article examines the complexity of the internet control mechanisms in China by breaking it down to five layers, ranging from the government, service and content providers to webmasters and individual users. It inquires into the logic of the control mechanisms and how such logic is naturalized into organizations and individuals’ everyday practices. It shows the dynamic between proactive, synchronized and reactive strategies and how the relationship between these components evolves in different phases. Through comparative online ethnography of the two most prominent Chinese forums located in China and the USA, <italic>QQ</italic> and <italic>MIT BBS</italic>, data analyses and interviews with regulators and content providers, this article aims at locating internet control in the historical trajectory and the socio-cultural specificity of China. More importantly, it reveals the effectiveness of these control mechanisms and the implications for the average internet user’s everyday life.</p>

<title>Ongoing debate about internet control in China</title>
<p>On 25 July 2008, <italic>USA Today</italic> announced that with 253 million users China replaced the USA as the number 1 nation of internet users. By the end of 2008, the scale of Chinese netizens expanded to 298 million with a coverage rate of 22.6%, which surpassed the world average of 21.9% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1354856512439500">CNNIC report, 2009</xref>). The significance of the internet in China has not received the attention it deserves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1354856512439500">Tsui, 2005</xref>). To begin with, the assumption that internet technology should lead to democratization in China restricts analyses to one particular teleological frame (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1354856512439500">Tsui, 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1354856512439500">2008</xref>). Chinese views of technology have historically contradicted western assumptions about the democratic potential of the internet. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1354856512439500">Tsui (2008</xref>) and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1354856512439500">Landsberger (2001</xref>) observe, China has a long history of ‘Ti-Yong’, meaning utilizing imported western technology without jeopardizing its distinct social and cultural values and the very idea that the internet will transcend this social and cultural context is untenable. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1354856512439500">Zhou (2006</xref>) also discovers that the emphasis on commercial, rather than the political potential of the internet reflects the regulation philosophy applied to the telegraph in the Qing dynasty. Methodologically speaking, the main instrument of controlling the internet is by filtering and censoring; the most typical method is tracking the ‘blacklist’ of sites compiled by the Chinese government (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1354856512439500">Crandall et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1354856512439500">Open Initiative, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1354856512439500">Zittrain and Edelman, 2003</xref>). In 2006, representatives from Microsoft, Cisco, Google and Yahoo were summoned to Capitol Hill in the USA to explain why they compromised with the Chinese government in building a censorship network, allowing them to extend the scope of investigation further to foreign companies in the Chinese market (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1354856512439500">Zhao, 2008</xref>: 144). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1354856512439500">Villeneuve’s study (2008a)</xref> on China’s Tom-Skype platform confirms that despite denial, the well-known global brand does execute the surveillance demanded by the Chinese government. These discouraging facts led to the interrogation on ‘who lost China’ for democracy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1354856512439500">Zhao, 2008</xref>). Zhao attributes the ideological root of the democracy-driven discourse to the presumption that<disp-quote>
<p>the United States is by nature a beacon for and enabler of democracy in the rest of the world ... moreover, firewall technologies and electronic surveillance are not developed and deployed in the United States itself for proprietary, labor, and broad social control in the first place. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1354856512439500">Zhao, 2008</xref>: 144)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>In recent years, scholars have started to adopt a more nuanced perspective towards the technological aspect of internet control. They have discovered great variation from company to company in terms of surveillance strategies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1354856512439500">Human Rights Watch, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1354856512439500">Villeneuve, 2008b</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1354856512439500">McKinnon (2009)</xref> designed a sophisticated testing scheme to demonstrate the latitude of censorship on blogs. She argued that chances for politically sensitive content to survive could be improved with better strategic knowledge. Nevertheless, a US-biased ideological approach prevents researchers from acknowledging the constraints on reception in China, particularly the influence of demographics and internet users’ everyday experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1354856512439500">Harwit and Clark, 2001</xref>). Zhou reminds us that divorcing the information from its receiving context is problematic for two reasons. First, ‘it assumes that if certain kinds of information are made accessible to people, they will be influenced, affected, and changed in the precise way the information promotes’; secondly, ‘the available information can be interpreted in a radically different way from the expectations of “free” information advocates’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1354856512439500">Zhou, 2006</xref>: 238–239). Accordingly, those routes round the Great Fire Wall fail to explicate two essential questions: In what way would users benefit from bypassing the firewall? What is the actual impact of the control mechanism on ordinary users’ everyday experience?</p>
<p>The second pitfall is an unconsidered blanket rejection of all internet censorship which prevents the consideration of rational arguments for any kind of control system. Instead of treating internet control as inherently vicious, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1354856512439500">Chua (2009</xref>) reminds us of the crucial difference between censorship and moderation. According to him, censorship is to prohibit speeches ‘about particular topics across a wide range of platforms’; while moderation is to prohibit speeches ‘in a particular virtual community by authorities within that community. A topic that is moderated on one virtual community can be communicated elsewhere’. Ironically, he plunges into the claim that internet control in China should be categorized as censorship without a second thought on the complexity of this issue. The surveillance level actually varies dramatically across different online venues. Meso- and micro-level regulators play an important role in the censoring process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1354856512439500">McKinnon, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1354856512439500">Qiu and Zhou, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1354856512439500">Zhou, 2006</xref>). The implementation of internet control at micro-level is influenced by webmasters’ backgrounds and personalities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1354856512439500">McKinnon, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1354856512439500">Zhao, 2008</xref>); while the following factors contribute to variation at meso-level: where the company is registered. Regulations are stricter in Beijing and nearby provinces, while the east coast enjoys more freedom (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1354856512439500">McKinnon, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1354856512439500">Qiu, 2000</xref>); other factors include scale and performance of the company, level of competitive pressure, level of public attention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1354856512439500">Brady, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1354856512439500">McKinnon, 2009</xref>). Besides, the intensity of control is much higher during holidays or sensitive dates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1354856512439500">Brady, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1354856512439500">Qiu, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1354856512439500">Zhao, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Furthermore, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1354856512439500">Chua (2009</xref>) points out that appropriate regulation actually contributes to the solidarity of collective identity and improves the dynamic of virtual sphere. This resonates with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1354856512439500">L Guo’s 2007</xref> report that the regulation of the internet has been always been considered essential or relatively essential in China (86.1% 2003, 82.4% 2005, 82.7% 2007). In fact, 84.8% of survey respondents in 2007 believed that the government should be the main body to regulate the internet (L <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1354856512439500">Guo, 2007</xref>). When the 2003 statistics first came out, they were criticized by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1354856512439500">He (2004)</xref> who said it was fake data from the mouthpiece of the government, but Guo confirmed in an interview that the field work for his survey was conducted by a third party private company and that the interviewees’ names were kept anonymous. Moreover, his research was funded by the New York based Markle Foundation not the Chinese government. He sent neither the questionnaire nor the report to the government for censorship. His data were also cited by Fallows in her 2008 <italic>Pew Internet and American Life Project </italic>report. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1354856512439500">Fallows (2008</xref>) points out, an essential reason behind these figures is people’s perception of the internet as both dangerous and unreliable. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1354856512439500">L Guo’s report (2007)</xref> shows that only about 30% of users consider general information online reliable, while about 75% consider information on the government website reliable. Shared resentment towards offensive content and concerns over online security justifies the call for internet control. Eighty-seven per cent of internet users would like to see pornography controlled, followed by: violent content, 86%; spam or junk mail, 83%; advertisements, 66%; and slander against individuals, 64%. Although only 40.1% believe that political content needs to be regulated, compared to 12.4% in 2003 and 7.6% in 2005, this is the fastest growing category across time. Similarly, the infamous internet police execute duties more than just censorship. According to an investigative report from China Human Rights Defenders in 2006, which was written by a former internet policeman, internet police are the upper-level supervisors of the internet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1354856512439500">Human Rights Watch, 2006</xref>); they watch over targeted websites, and send notice and orders to violators. Yet more importantly, according to <italic>Outlook</italic> (Liaowang) – the major magazine published by Xinhua News Agency – (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1354856512439500">
<italic>Outlook,</italic> 2008a</xref>), in 2007, the internet police solved 266 pornography-related crimes and 298 fraud or online gambling crimes. In October 2007, 150 cities adopted the virtual internet police system by placing police avatars at the corners of websites, allowing users to click on it whenever they wanted to report a crime or needed help. As mentioned earlier, people are concerned with all kinds of hazards online, including the disclosure of private information, online purchasing, and addiction to the web. The CNNIC report (2009) revealed that only 27.6% believe that trading online is safe. In addition, 93% of internet users consider online content unsuitable for children. As a result, the overemphasis on the political function of the internet police prevents us from acknowledging how, though surveillance, they moderate the internet preventing crime and other abuses and thus fails to reveal why netizens desire governmental efforts. These data warn us that a black-and-white approach towards internet control in China inevitably prevents us from grasping the complexity of the issue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1354856512439500">Zhou, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>More importantly, the portrayal of internet policing as a single centralized monolithic institution for censorship prevents us from understanding the economic and organizational reasons for internet control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1354856512439500">Qiu and Zhou, 2005</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1354856512439500">Qiu (2000</xref>) and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1354856512439500">Zhou (2006</xref>) suggested that internet control studies are historically and culturally specific, because the definition and criteria of free information are ‘ideologically specific and change as time passes’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1354856512439500">Zhou, 2006</xref>: 238). Therefore, without embedding the internet control issue in the cultural and social background of China, it is difficult to understand the logic of the mechanism, let alone how power relationships are formulated between different interested parties and how they are perceived by ordinary people. However, it is no easy task to fulfill this goal. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1354856512439500">Tsui (2005</xref>) illustrates the ecology of nationalistic discourses among hackers and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1354856512439500">Zhou (2006</xref>) exhibits that although initial receiving context for the telegraph and the internet differ, the adoption of both technologies aroused similar concerns and reactions among regulatory bodies and users. Unfortunately, both these empirical studies were carried out among tech-savvy and politically active netizens, hence they fail to reveal ordinary users’ experience.</p>
<p>Existing studies also demonstrate the limitations of assessments of the effectiveness of internet control in China. The first measures the technological capacity of censorship hardware and software and their penetration rate; the second measure is the visibility of sensitive content. But this is more concerned with directly detectable content from sites on the blacklist. Consequently, these measurements ignore the other layers of censorship, which include how these methods are executed at different levels and whether policing confines users to a restrictive default mode in their use. These two are the main subjects under study in this article. The aim of this research is to contextualize the issue of internet control in the social, cultural and historical milieu of China and to show ordinary users’ experience with the control mechanism. Starting from the structural transition of state control from the age of traditional media to the internet as a background, I will discuss major control and anti-control techniques and examine their effectiveness and implications for ordinary users. Online forums are selected here as the key venue for examination not only because they are publicly accessible and by far the largest stable meeting place for people to convene and discuss issues but more crucially, they serve as an arena for users to confront webmasters, the first-level practitioners of regulations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1354856512439500">Qiu and Zhou, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1354856512439500">Zhou, 2006</xref>). <italic>QQ </italic>forum is chosen as a representative domestic online forum over its peers for the specific objective of the study. I will concentrate on the survivors rather than the martyrs of censorship, because they show the regulatory bottom line of what is just acceptable. A desirable subject to study would be one relatively more open to sensitive topics yet popular with ordinary users. This means a forum that would be dominated neither by political activists, tech-savvy users nor political conversations. According to statistics from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1354856512439500">China Website Ranking (2008</xref>), <italic>QQ</italic> ranks the first in number of users in China. It has the third highest market value in the world, which is bigger than the combination of <italic>Sina</italic>, <italic>Netease</italic> and <italic>Sohu </italic>altogether (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1354856512439500">Techweb, 2009</xref>). Moreover, <italic>QQ</italic> was registered in Shenzhen, Guangdong province instead of Beijing. The scale, success and geographical location of the company have the advantage of a higher level of regulatory freedom as mentioned earlier. Furthermore, unlike the widely researched <italic>Qiangguo</italic> forum established by People’s Daily, <italic>QQ</italic> forum covers a wide range of topics and is not dominated by political conversations. Starting off with an instant messenger service, <italic>QQ</italic> has accumulated a solid base of ordinary users. All the reasons just given make <italic>QQ </italic>forum the best subject for my research.</p>
<p>Conventional wisdom has it that once free information dissemination is allowed, criticism of the government and demand for democracy would dominate the online speech sphere. The choices in the uncensored space will show whether the assumption stands. We need to compare a Chinese forum with its counterpart in a free information environment to question the presumed causal relation between free information and the designated reception patterns criticized by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1354856512439500">Zhou (2006</xref>). This will enable us to analyze whether the configurations of the speech sphere are different without governmental censorship. <italic>MIT BBS</italic> is chosen here as a reference. It is the largest online forum for overseas Chinese located in the USA hence not under the control of Chinese government. Users back in China can get access to most sections of the forum other than the news section and political discussion sub-forums. Based on the contextual difference between the two forums, I will test the following: whether <italic>MIT BBS </italic>is less controlled than <italic>QQ</italic>; whether information and conversations on <italic>MIT BBS </italic>are more diverse and abundant than on <italic>QQ</italic>; whether attitudes towards the same topic are more diverse in these two forums. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1354856512439500">Yang (2003</xref>) suggests ‘guerilla ethnography’ when studying the kaleidoscopic Chinese internet, which requires explorative studies entering the space without preconceptions. Accordingly, a 15-month, online ethnographic study was conducted in both forums from September 2007 to December 2008. I paid daily visits to both forums without intruding on the conversations and monitored relevant posts of the day published before 11 p.m. Since both forums are equipped with search engines capable of pulling out all archived data up to a date, relevant posts up to 30 December 2008 were collected through keyword search. The purpose of my study is not to chase invisible messages, gauging the survival rate, strategy or life span of sensitive topics, but to propose a socio-cultural analytical frame to internet control through examining sensitive yet visible messages that are relevant to ordinary Chinese users. As an initial effort to advocate a more balanced examination of those keywords, testing all categories listed would be beyond the scope and goal of this study. I established my keyword list based on shared top picks in two lists: McKinnon’s and Xiao’s. Xiao posted a detailed keyword list censored by Baidu<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1354856512439500">1</xref>
</sup> in 16 categories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1354856512439500">2009</xref>) and McKinnon tested 50 different types of sensitive words in the blogosphere (2009). In addition to these, I included popular homonyms not listed in those two lists based on my daily observation (see the detailed keyword list later in this article in the chart in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1354856512439500">Figure 3</xref>).</p>
<p>Comparative studies of these two forums were supplemented by interviews with regulatory personnel and analysts on the topic. An average of two hours’ semi-structured interviews were conducted from December 2008 to August 2009 either face-to-face in Beijing or over the phone in Los Angeles. Since most interviewees have been my personal friends for years, follow-ups were conducted to gather latest information on the topic. They were asked to share their regulatory experience and evaluate key analyses on this matter so far. At the request of my interviewees, only the first interviewee is listed here with his real name, the rest are aliases. The interviewees were: Guo Liang, researcher at Chinese Academy of Social Science (CASS) and author of <italic>Surveying Internet Usage and Impact in China</italic> from 2003 to 2007 (L <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1354856512439500">Guo, 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1354856512439500">2007</xref>); Zheng, CEO of a portal website and internet analyst in China; An, initiator of interactive new media and internet expert in China; Bai, senior producer and director at China Central Television; Cai, official at Xinhua News Agency; Deng, official at the Ministry of Culture; Feng, webmaster at <italic>QQ</italic> forum; Ge, webmaster at <italic>MIT BBS</italic>.</p>

<title>Proactive control mechanisms: When old and new regulatory methods collide</title>
<p>The chart in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1354856512439500">Figure 1</xref> illustrates the operational mechanism of media control before and during the internet age in China. Although fundamental instruments of control are similar at both times, the implementation changes because of the different nature of the media. Among all proactive methods, economic control is most common. Although media ownership restriction has been loosened in the internet age with  the increasing amount of privately owned internet content providers (ICPs) and internet service providers (ISPs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1354856512439500">Esarey, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1354856512439500">He, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1354856512439500">Zhao, 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1354856512439500">2008</xref>), the ownership of the internet access providers (IAPs) is firmly held in the hands of the government (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1354856512439500">Qiu, 2000</xref>). As a result, the traditional licensing system still applies to ISPs and ICPs. According to Article 6 of the ‘Interim Provisions on the Approval and Regulation of Businesses engaging in Opened Telecommunications Services’ issued by former Ministry of Post and Telecommunication (MPT, which was merged with Ministry of Information Industry, MII, in 1997), ‘all direct international networking traffic must use international incoming and outgoing channels provided by the MPT’s national network’. Similarly, Human Rights Watch pointed out that all ISPs and ICPs are liable for any inappropriate content on the web (2006). Just like the old days when everyone who worked in the media industry had to receive professional training on ‘correct political direction’ and attain a certificate in order to be hired, as major players in the internet business, they are required to attend governmental training sessions and attain the certificate to manage the internet. In particular, ICPs are required to provide, upon demand by authorities, all the content from their website and records of users for up to 60 days prior to the request; this also applies to internet cafés (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1354856512439500">State Council Decree 292, 2000</xref>).</p>

<p>Owners of online forums have to keep records of users’ information, published content and the time at which the content was published (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1354856512439500">Cullen and Choy, 2004</xref>). More broadly speaking, these requirements simply reinforce the lifelong training in self-censorship at individual and organizational levels. Politics is a required course from elementary school to higher education, which incorporates Marxist theories with the philosophical thoughts of each administration from the establishment of the New China. This is supplemented by the new model of nationalist education illustrated by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1354856512439500">Brady (2008</xref>). These two methods control both the source of information and possibility of disseminating unfiltered news.</p>
<p>The licensing system has been complemented by a requirement to register. Although the full-scale ‘real-name registration’ system online has been vehemently opposed by scholars, netizens and industry people, this system has been gradually forced onto webmasters and internet café visitors. Zhang’s report in <italic>Nanfang Daily</italic> (28 January <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1354856512439500">2008</xref>) states that Gansu and Ningxia provinces initiated the formal execution of this policy, and other cities and provinces are expected to take similar actions soon. This policy allows only one registered and documented BBS website on each server. Meanwhile, each website must assign a full-time webmaster or forum manager whose mobile phones or fixed lines are turned on around the clock. Moreover, each section of the forum must have at least one webmaster with a guaranteed amount of working hours online; all forum webmasters are required to provide personal information and a contact number to the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT) as well. Recently, domain name registration was requested to stop banned websites from being present online in the future (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1354856512439500">Hornby and Le, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Up till now, scholars’ top complaints were the overlap between regulatory bodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1354856512439500">Sohmen, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1354856512439500">Zittrain and Edelman, 2003</xref>) as well as the vague and capricious nature of the legislation on media regulation in China (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1354856512439500">Chu, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1354856512439500">Esarey, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1354856512439500">He, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1354856512439500">Qiu and Zhou, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1354856512439500">Winfield and Peng, 2005</xref>). The chart in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1354856512439500">Figure 2</xref> lists major governmental regulatory bodies before and after the internet age and it is not difficult to spot that most regulatory bodies now undertake double duties to supervise both traditional media and the internet. This is where problems emerge. Zhou observes that ‘on a macroscopic level, generally speaking, the regulation on the Internet has lagged behind the rapid development of the technology’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1354856512439500">Zhou, 2006</xref>). As <italic>Outlook</italic> (Liaowang) observed, a large proportion of officials at different levels are still internet illiterate. Hence, they still practice the old rules on this new medium. This phenomenon has various unpleasant consequences. A too proactive attitude leads to netizens’ discontent about the regulatory system, while a too reactive attitude runs the risk of missing the opportunity to clarify the situation before rumors prevail. These officials do not possess the required experience and competence to regulate the internet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1354856512439500">

<p>To remedy organizational incompetence, the government resorted to technology to throttle the threat in its cradle. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1354856512439500">Su (2009</xref>), the ‘golden shield project’, which was launched in 1998 and finished in 2008, has become the new surveillance colossus. It is a comprehensive database and surveillance system that involves voice and image recognition, closed circuit television, intelligence card, credit record and internet surveillance. The level of proactive technology reached its height on 8 June 2009. MIIT issued a notice, which required all personal computers sold in China after 1 July to have the Green Dam-Youth Escort software installed on them. This move triggered a huge outcry among Chinese netizens, academics, activists, industry groups and foreign officials as well as companies, speculating that the real aim was to supervise personal data and filter sensitive content. Later on, the software was shown to be flawed and could allow hackers to monitor a user’s internet activity, steal data or plant viruses. Humorously its filtering software, which blocked sites with flesh-colored pictures, led to it blocking the cartoon cat Garfield and infants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1354856512439500">Yu and Liu, 2009</xref>). In response to severe criticism, CCTV broadcasted an exclusive report on how Google.cn disseminates pornographic content and featured a young boy expressing his anxiety over uncontrolled harmful content online. Several days later, the news item was found to be a set-up as the boy was an intern at CCTV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1354856512439500">People’s Net, 2009a</xref>). This further infuriated opponents to the software and MIIT finally decided to postpone the implementation of the whole plan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1354856512439500">Yu and Liu, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>This event scored a victory in the battle against governmental control and urged transparency of control methods. Although the government promised a one-year free use of the software, a closer look at the economics behind the deal raised suspicion about the relationship between the government and software development companies. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1354856512439500">Yu and Liu (2009</xref>), the software is a combined product of Dazheng Human Language Technology Co. and Jinhui. The former is in charge of Youth Escort, a content filtering software for Windows, while the latter developed Green Dam. Although it suffered a loss of 1.32 million Yuan (US$193,000) on a revenue of 2.41 million Yuan (US$351,000) in 2003, Jinhui suddenly invested 32.16 million Yuan (US$4.7 million) in the development of the Green Dam software. This information raised even stronger suspicion. Although the government insisted on a fair bidding process, Zheng and An confirmed that there had been intricate relations between the company and officials at the highest level. Installation of the software will guarantee huge profit despite the resistance to it (Source: interviews). However information on how to uninstall the software is becoming available (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1354856512439500">Yu and Liu, 2009</xref>) which suggests that conception of an omnipotent surveillance technology is doomed to collapse once again.</p>
<p>When it comes to legislation:<disp-quote>
<p>instead of passing legislation about the media, which would inevitably invoke debate over the meaning of the constitutional guarantee of press freedom at the National People’s Congress (NPC), the party has opted to authorize relevant government departments to legitimate its preferred media structure by administrative regulation (tiaoli), which only require approval by the State Council. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1354856512439500">Zhao, 2008</xref>)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>This is even more the case with the internet as no general legislation has been drafted yet on this new medium, thus temporary and administrative regulations are the core guidelines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1354856512439500">Zhao, 2008</xref>). The general law of protecting national interest, the unification of ethnic groups, the socialist system, and social stability or national honor in every major law and stipulation are too abstract and could be interpreted very differently by various interest parties. However, this is a deliberate rhetorical strategy. By redefining those ‘misdemeanors’ as malicious to the nation and culture instead of to the government or party, the political implications of those laws could be subdued and downplayed. In recent years, more regulations have been introduced in the form of normative notices or other measures, which minimize the political implications of the restriction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1354856512439500">Brady, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1354856512439500">Zhao, 2008</xref>). This rhetorical strategy has been upgraded in the internet age with the new slogan of protecting youngsters. By recruiting a ‘mothers’ jury’ (mama pingshentuan) to join the censorship team and coating the control scheme with ‘parental guide to children’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1354856512439500">An, 2009</xref>), the government further justifies its regulations and avoids tainting it with an overt political aim. Ironically, the deliberate move to depoliticize and decentralize internet control giving it to lower-level regulators actually jeopardizes the execution of all the intricate methods higher up, as the rule of natural human justice over a law-based social system has been taken for granted as a legal principle for thousands of years in Chinese history (DH <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1354856512439500">Guo, 2007</xref>). Aware of the need of press freedom, however, the ambivalent attitude towards legislation from the top to the bottom level of the control hierarchy leads to a practical media policy which in China always ‘goes back and forth, testing the line’ (Elizabeth C. Economy, cited by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1354856512439500">Zissis, 2006</xref>).</p>

<title>The Maginot line: Reactive control mechanisms and the selective control logic</title>
<p>As a useful complement to proactive control, reactive mechanisms are adopted as the second line of defense. Nonetheless, the internet differs from traditional media in that every user can be a content producer. Therefore, ‘traditional media’s prepublication preview and post-publication monitoring systems are collapsing into an elaborate process of manually operated and automated censorship’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1354856512439500">Zhao, 2008</xref>: 32). Coming to terms with the failure of an omnipotent control system, in 2004 president Hu jintao proposed a selective control logic under the ‘harmonious society principle’. First coined at the fourth plenary session of the Party’s 16th Central Committee, this principle aims at appeasing ethnic groups and closing social gaps particularly the urban–rural divide. It signals a shift in the Party's focus from promoting all-out economic growth to solving worsening social tensions. Moreover, it suggests that China’s integration into globalization not only transformed it into the market state, but also ignited its desire to revamp its image in the world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1354856512439500">Brady, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1354856512439500">Zhao, 2008</xref>). As a result, similar to the new propaganda focus in the arena of traditional media, ‘passive censorship’ is adopted in the internet age with the aim of ‘limiting the impact of oppositional ideas by neglect within a small elite circle’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1354856512439500">Zhao, 2008</xref>: 34). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1354856512439500">Brady (2008</xref>) further identifies the elite circle as Party members, youth and the armed forces. This decision is based on the demographics of internet users in China. The 2009 CNNIC report confirmed that netizens from 10 to 19 years old have become the largest user group (35.2%), followed by 20 to 29 years old (31.5%). In terms of occupation, students make up the largest proportion (33.2%). Around 65% of users have a qualification higher or equivalent to junior college. Furthermore, 71.6% of the internet population lives in urban areas. Additionally, as <italic>Outlook</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1354856512439500">Liaowang, 2008c</xref>) puts it, the government has attempted to manage the masses online by inviting famous scholars to the official forum to cultivate ‘opinion leaders for the mass’. This control logic resonates with the ‘progressive liberal democratic thought’ proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1354856512439500">Lippman (1922</xref>), which asserts that only a small elite and intellectual community could understand and represent what the masses care about, while the masses, treated as a ‘bewildered herd’, are supposed to function in democracy as spectators, not participants. Their participation could be carried out in two ways: either to lend their power to a representative that belongs to the elite group or master the skills needed to be part of the elite community. This theory explains the current internet control strategy in China since ‘the people who are able to engineer consent are the ones who have the recourses and the power to do it ... that’s who you work for’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1354856512439500">Chomsky, 1997</xref>: 24). This top-elite-mass-follow form of control alleviates the management burden of the central government and allows it to focus more on suspicious websites and users.</p>
<p>However, selective control logic does not prevent the current control system from repeating the fate of the Maginot line in the Second World War. It wastes time controlling those who are not tech-savvy or even interested in those sensitive issues while failing to prevent active agents from bypassing the firewall. The three major contributing factors are: a decentralized control system; users’ resistant innovations; and the ecology of conversations in online forums. To begin with, enforcement of regulations dissolves as lower-level institutions and individuals pragmatically apply those laws and regulations to fit reality and serve the aims of their own department. This cascade model allows more freedom and greater rights to executives at each hierarchical layer. On the one hand, this adjusts such measures to local conditions; on the other, it impairs central power. As a famous saying in China goes, ‘people can always find a way to cope with government policies’. This spirit is well represented by how groups at different levels constantly endeavor to dodge censorship through negotiation with regulatory bodies, or take advantage of loopholes in the stipulations. This is no different from the old days as resistance at the meso-level was also present for example when liberal television producers deliberately released controversial content or inserted social messages within seemingly innocuous materials to demonstrate their editorial views (Bai, interview). However, Zhao categorizes this type of resistance as ‘watchdogs on party leashes’, because ‘they avoid the most sensitive political and social issues, and their targets are limited to low-ranking officials’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1354856512439500">Zhao, 2008</xref>: 253). Besides, in most cases, these actions are a senior producers’ privilege while lower-level employees are unlikely to take the risk as their income and promotion opportunities are more easily affected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1354856512439500">He, 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1354856512439500">Zhao, 2008</xref>). For example, at CCTV, each discrepancy that an anchor commits results in a 200-Yuan deduction from their salary. How well an organization or individual executes censoring tasks and follows the order of the central government is seen as a touchstone of their ‘political reliability’, which is the basic requirement for further promotion. Therefore, these reactive measures are self-sustaining because they directly affect individuals’ lives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1354856512439500">Lu and Pan, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1354856512439500">Zhao, 2008</xref>). However, with the help of the internet, users and webmasters at the micro-level are entitled to more opportunities to practice resistant skills. This is because even at ICP and ISP level, it is still impossible to keep track of everything single-handedly. Although they can monitor contents compiled by editors, when it comes to user-generated content, especially in the case of an online forum, regulatory power actually rests with webmasters who are responsible for determining whether the content is acceptable.</p>
<p>Currently, the most prominent  technologies for controlling the internet are keyword censoring and replacement software designed by western companies such as Cisco (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1354856512439500">Brown, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1354856512439500">Crandall et al, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1354856512439500">He, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1354856512439500">Sinclair, 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1354856512439500">Zittrain, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1354856512439500">Zittrain and Edelman, 2003</xref>). The basic idea is that the content analysis software will work at DNS, IP and other levels to block access to websites with unfavorable contents, prohibit banned words or replace them with asterisks or blanks when they are published online. With the help of deep packet, instead of blocking the entire website, the technique now allows the government to alter only the unfavorable parts. Two strategies against this are ‘word tricks’ and ‘proxy’. With regard to word tricks, The Investigative Report from Chinese Human Rights Defenders (2007) has shown that using signs such as “ ”, “ / ” and “ \ ”, or employing different words, synonyms or homonyms to evade censorship is no longer functional after the installation of new filters that detect and censor these codes. However, people are constantly creating new terms and disseminate them widely to combat new filters. This explains why <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1354856512439500">Zissis (2006</xref>), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1354856512439500">Zittrain and Edelman (2003</xref>) say that each layer of the control network has to be constantly constructing and updating their filtering list, even so, grassroots creativity cannot be beaten by the firewall (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1354856512439500">Wines, 2009</xref>). Therefore, the reactive control mechanism could never keep pace with grassroots innovation. Besides, once a blatant violation is found, the user’s ID or IP will be blocked, thus no future entry into the forum will be permitted. However, without the enforcement of real-name registration, users could easily reapply for a new user name or log on from a different IP.</p>
<p>The selective control model is also composed of multiple vigilance levels on sensitive words. The keyword search and ethnographic study of <italic>QQ</italic> forum reveals three tiers of sensitive words. And it’s important to bear in mind that under the harmonious society principle, the control model not only targets anti-government sentiments, but pro-government content which is expressed radically. Among the 33 posts that are sealed up, which means that although the title of the post remains, the actual content is no longer accessible, 19 are pro-government calling for tough policies on international and ethnic or cross-strait disputes (i.e. Taiwan and mainland China). The chart in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1354856512439500">Figure 3</xref> manifests how different locutions of the same concept can result in different outcomes. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1354856512439500">Brady (2008</xref>) believes that pro-China policies practiced by Ma, the new president of Taiwan led to a greater openness to discussions about Taiwan. The third tier deserves special attention here because this is the hub where user-generated creativity manages to go under the radar of censorship. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1354856512439500">Scott (1990</xref>: 36) reminds us of ‘hidden transcripts’ that represent ‘the whole reciprocal, conversational reply of the subordinate, which, for reasons of domination, cannot be spoken publicly’. Similar to the function of tavern in Scott’s analysis, the third-tier keywords here showcase anti-hegemonic endeavor among internet users. They have ‘typically learned to clothe their resistance and defiance in ritualisms of subordination that serve both to disguise their purposes and to provide them with a ready route of retreat that may soften the consequences of a possible failure’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1354856512439500">Scott, 1990</xref>: 96).</p>
<p>More interesting still, though not censored by the Chinese government, <italic>MIT BBS </italic>users also prefer using locutions in the third tier to the former two. The use of humor, metaphor and symbolism enable people to keep their distance from the government so that they can comply in public while opposing in private. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1354856512439500">Scott, 1990</xref>). Tracing the first occasion these word tricks were used in each forum, it is clear that users of both forums mutually exchange these seemingly innocent words as 261 posts from <italic>MIT BBS</italic> and 311 posts from <italic>QQ</italic> explicitly acknowledge borrowing the terms from the other forum. Among these posts, 65 at <italic>QQ</italic> are posted directly by Chinese users living abroad yet only 10 at <italic>MIT BBS </italic>are posted by users living in China. There are even 355 posts that deride themselves as outdated in inventing new terms compared to their counterparts and among them 176 are from <italic>MIT BBS</italic>. Out of 176 posts at <italic>MIT BBS</italic>, 98 even praise their compatriots back in China as more innovative and imaginative and 65 believe this results from long-term fighting experience. On the contrary, only 64 posts at <italic>QQ</italic> compliment their overseas cohorts and most are responses to overseas students’ nationalistic efforts during the Tibetan revolt and the Olympics. A sense of superiority is expressed among domestic users as 78 out of 102 posts explicitly criticize overseas users as underestimating the dynamic of user innovation back in China and treating domestic users as brainwashed. There are even 77 post explicitly calling overseas creations old-fashioned and detached from domestic culture. Furthermore, most popular word tricks shared by users from both sides of the great firewall are also in the third tier: nicknames for the Dalai Lama, political leaders in mainland China and Taiwan, grass mud horse (represents grassroots) and its rival the river cab (synonym to ‘harmonious’, <italic>hexie</italic>). This is also why when a post is deleted users from both forums will humorously describe it as having been ‘harmonized’ (<italic>hexie diaole</italic>). It is also significant to notice that many of the keywords in the third tier are not necessarily anti-government. For example, the nicknames for Hu jintao and Wen jiabao as brother, baby or grandpa, effuse familial connections with these leaders. On the contrary, the nicknames for the Dalai Lama exhibit scornful and abhorrent sentiments. Cai and Deng both acknowledge knowing many homonyms created by netizens, ‘do not take us as old-fashioned nerds. We are trying hard to catch up with new traits of technology and find a proper way to handle information. We can differentiate critique with good will and aimless slant’ (interview). Their statements mirror Scott’s critique on hegemony (1990), which argues that the powerful may well hide their knowledge of being defied, and concomitantly hide the degree to which they must use coercion to maintain their position in dominance. Therefore, both the powerful and powerless are bound up in a public performance of control and subordination.</p>
<p>A closer look at these sensitive posts reveals that like the old days, central power trickles down to lower levels and it is precisely at the lower levels that the control mechanism becomes elastic as average users are capable of negotiating with webmasters and identifying a suitable platform for their opinions. The issue of forum censorship is addressed in 456 posts from 32 sub-forums at <italic>QQ</italic>, and conversations between average users and webmasters are divided into three major categories. Instead of blaming webmasters directly, the largest proportion (242 posts) calls on other users in the forum to uphold justice. The typical format of these posts is to first announce that posts they tried to post were deleted or did not get through, ask other users to judge whether those contents should be eliminated, then conclude with a plea like ‘if you do not think my message should be deleted, please contact the webmaster with me’. However, the majority of those posts were not responded to by other users: 212 posts received two to five responses and most were in the form of just one word ‘support’ or an expression icon. Meanwhile, only five of them were replied to by the webmaster, four were with a standard reply saying ‘please read the regulation terms on the top of the forum again’ while one said ‘so what did you try to publish? Contact me by email’. This lack of response is due to the fact that only 10 of these posts described the content of their deleted posts explicitly which makes it difficult for others to make a fair judgment of its content. There were 576 replies that asked for the content of the original post directly. For the rest of the 30 posts that managed to get attention in the forum, the average number of replies was seven; 24 narrated the theme of their posts and 17 were replied to by webmasters. Eight of the replies criticized the use of vulgar language in the post or the attempt to upload pornographic pictures and viruses. Webmasters are tough on these types of post and users are more supportive of this type of moderation: for example 40 out of 56 replies report being affected by pictures or links with a virus. One of the posts that managed to collect 25 replies claims an attempt to post a story about corrupt local officials, and the webmaster replies ‘I cannot confirm the authenticity of your story, we cannot spread rumors’. Yet, 11 of the replies refute this argument and insist they should read the story first in order to make a collective judgment on it. After being refused by the webmaster once again, the author compromises a little bit and says ‘then what about I only write the story without mentioning the name of the official and the city he governs?’ This is allowed and the new post is present under the original thread 48 hours later. This is welcomed by three users who respond with compliments on the webmaster’s generosity while five readers believe they should not have supported the author accusing him of posting a long and tedious story that is too commonly read in the newspapers. The webmaster then replies ‘now you see my point’ and after 10 hours the post is deleted once again. This time around, the author vents his anger against other users rather than the webmaster and accuses them of being too cynical and tasteless. Then two users suggest blocking the author’s ID but that is refused by the webmaster.</p>
<p>The second category (174 posts) threatens to switch to other forums if their messages fail to be published constantly. The typical format is to state that their posts were published in other online venues and question why <italic>QQ </italic>is so authoritarian and conservative. This category overlaps with the third category (40 posts), which attacks webmasters or the <italic>QQ</italic> platform directly. As webmasters’ contacts and IDs are open to all users in sub-forums, it is fairly easy to track their regular working hours and monitoring style. Referring to the webmasters’ IDs or user names directly are 145 posts of the second category and 28 posts of the third category and over half of them even discuss the webmasters’ occupations or personal information. As Feng explained when interviewed, tech-savvy and frequent users are major contributors in disseminating webmasters’ personal information. The most common method is to trace either the webmaster’s IP or internet browsing history. Although only around 5% of the posts in the second and third category acknowledged hacking or stalking efforts, resources they collected penetrated the community fast and soon became common knowledge. Newcomers are even recommended to read old posts revealing webmasters’ personal information to fit into the culture of the sub-forum. Besides, smaller sub-groups even organize offline get-togethers where users meet webmasters in person and gain first-hand data. As a result, the following types of argument are prevalent in sub-forums. ‘The webmaster in <italic>Social News</italic> sector is a graduate student, and ours is a middle-age frump, no wonder our posts cannot survive, let’s migrate collectively’. ‘I stopped complaining his monitoring style long time ago, he is a Party member’.</p>
<p>Of this type of post, 108 are cross-published in different sub-forums in order to disseminate the reputation of webmasters. Only five webmasters reply defensively, demanding that users switch platform. The rest are more responsive and three webmasters even apologize publicly and tell users that although they cannot break the rules they do know venues that would be happy to publish their content. Furthermore, sub-forums with webmasters who are more willing to negotiate attract larger traffic and again higher ranking, personal attacks towards these webmasters are rarely found. More interesting still, among the 456 posts in total, 309 write that they know their posts might not be published in advance and 65 even express surprise when their messages are not blocked. ‘OMG! My message is still here after three days!’ ‘Hooray, our webmaster, courageous soul!’ In terms of content, out of the 309 posts, protest against the rich and unfair social policies dominate the chart with 166 contributions, protest against soft foreign policy follows with 95 posts and corruption ranks the third with 35. Critiques of the Party only show up five times, and the rest do not specify the content of their posts. At the same time, 77 posts try to analyze how these posts survived. Most frequent explanations are: webmasters were not on duty during that time period, the topic is not dangerous enough to the Party line and those posts are too long to read or simply are not at all interesting. It is important to notice that of all the posts in these three categories, only 15 blame the overall control system or the central government and the rest all point the finger at <italic>QQ</italic> or webmasters, which reflects the added value of a decentralized control system. It not only alleviates the burden on central government, but also creates scapegoats for the central control mechanism. After all, the censoring system per se is intangible, and people have to resort to the channels to hand, such as ISPs and webmasters, for complaint and to air their discontent.</p>

<title>The Maginot line: Users’ reception and self-monitoring</title>
<p>In addition to using words coded with double meanings and other word tricks, users employ the technique of using a proxy to elude the governmental control. It is not a technique that is widely adopted among ordinary Chinese users as it has problems. First of all, the increasing number of users slows down the service, which is a problem shared with similar technology such as P2P (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1354856512439500">Mulvenon and Chase, 2005</xref>). Also, Proxy servers constantly need to launch new sites when they are spotted and blocked by the government. Because users have to know the proxy beforehand in order to search them and have to switch constantly to different servers, awareness and take-up level is low. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1354856512439500">MacKinnon (2006</xref>), only 5% to 10% or so of Chinese users know how to use a proxy server; real users are even fewer. More importantly, the actual number of Chinese netizens who have a good command of English is very limited, thus a language barrier sets up a natural firewall to foreign information online (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1354856512439500">Tsui, 2002</xref>). According to the 2005 Chinese Academy of Social Science (CASS) internet use survey, written by Guo Liang, 71.2% of users never use proxy, 19.7% seldom use it, and only 0.6% use it frequently (L <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1354856512439500">Guo, 2005</xref>). Yet the absolute number of proxy users is still high considering the overall netizen population in China.<disp-quote>
<p>Young people and educated elites are major users of proxy. They are equipped with the knowledge to get information banned by the government if they want to. However, even equipped with the weapon to get access to free information, the teleological belief of the use pattern and reception model does not rule. Guo explains that according to his own experience, the majority of proxy users are students trying to apply for foreign universities or learning English. Proxies are used to improve their competitiveness in the job market or future development. (Zheng, interview)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>These statements are also backed up by the demographics of internet users in China. The CASS report (L <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1354856512439500">Guo, 2005</xref>) argues that the information highway in China may be better understood as an ‘entertainment highway’ because of its uneven emphasis on entertainment-related information. The <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1354856512439500">CNNIC report (2009)</xref> reveals that although the proportion of people looking for information online has increased, entertainment is still the primary function of the internet: 62.8% netizens play online games and 83.7% download or listen to online music. Such user demographics mean that ICPs prefer to stay away from potentially sticky situations and focus on soft content, especially entertainment news (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1354856512439500">Shanthi, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>What are the three most important issues facing China today? The poll in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1354856512439500">Table 1</xref> shows from another angle that Chinese people are more concerned about economy and living standards than politics. This also explains why among those posts at <italic>QQ </italic>that report to have been censored, the most popular topic is living standards and social gaps.</p>

<p>A comparison of <italic>QQ BBS</italic> and <italic>MIT BBS</italic> further reveals that even without governmental censorship, discussions around topics that – based on teleological and monolithic perspectives towards internet control in China – may endanger the ruling position of the government and support democratization of China still do not prevail. On both sites, the political sub-forum is only one of the top 10 sub-forums, the rest are about everyday life and entertainment. The ranking of political sub-forums fluctuates substantially depending on how frequently hot political topics emerge in a given time. Among the top 10 sub-forums on both sites, the ratio of viewing to replying is about 120:1 in political sub-forums, and around 50:1 in other sub-forums. This indicates a higher level of interactivity among non-political communities. More importantly, although skeptical about the veracity of official reports, ‘many Chinese citizens are even more reluctant to trust reports from international media organizations, and this general preference for domestic news sources extends to the internet’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1354856512439500">Mulvenon and Chase, 2005</xref>: 81). The 2007 CASS report (L <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1354856512439500">Guo, 2005</xref>) showed that 67.8% of Chinese citizens trust domestic television news, while only 40.4% trust foreign television sources; the trust in foreign newspaper and radio is even lower. This situation is aggravated by distorted reports on the Tibetan revolt and the Olympic torch relay in March 2008 from the mainstream western media. Millions of Chinese internet users protested against the slanderous report online and asked for an official apology from western media. ‘Do not be like CNN’ has become the catchphrase among Chinese people (<italic>Xinhuanet</italic>, 23 March 2008). Similarly, the YouTube video uploaded by a Chinese overseas student in Germany showing the evidence of faked reports from mainstream western media called ‘Riot in Tibet: true face of the western media’ received 1,306,027 views up to 20 April 2008. Ironically, when the riot first broke out YouTube was temporarily blocked in China, so even these pro-government comments could not reach the domestic audience. It was not until popular portal sites in China posted this clip on their website that domestic audiences finally managed to watch it and disseminate it to other locations.</p>
<p>A comparison of the content of <italic>QQ BBS</italic> and <italic>MIT BBS</italic> further exhibits that, even if censorship is not carried out by the government, webmasters and users still consciously use their own strategies to manage the forum and set up their own moderation criteria. To begin with, even at <italic>MIT BBS</italic>, keywords in the first tier are still unfavorable among users. Supporters for independence movements in Xinjiang, Tibet and Taiwan are called ‘du’; Fa lungong practitioners are called ‘lun’;<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1354856512439500">2</xref>
</sup> democratic activists are called ‘yun’ (action). The three of them are categorized as ‘du lun yun’: the three ‘toxins’ of the forum. The two common attitudes towards posts from these three groups are either to completely ignore them by not replying to the articles or to attack them with humor. For example, Fa lungong practitioners are called ‘wheel’ (<italic>lunzi</italic>) as a soubriquet; and a famous standardized reply to them is ‘stay away from wheels, cherish your life’. The major location for ‘wheels’ is the ‘democracy salon’, which ranks 242nd of all 392 subsidiary forums. The webmaster posted the regulatory details at the top of the forum, stating that although he is against Fa lungong, he will guarantee freedom of speech for those practitioners. However, he reserves the right to remove the content. This statement was voted upon among <italic>MIT BBS</italic> users and won a majority, validating his position. Users of the forum were fed up with intrusive posts promoting the spirit of ‘wheels’ by simply slandering everything the Chinese government does without reasonable arguments or solid facts. As Awe, one of the forum participants, stated (10 July 2007 at 22:45) ‘why don’t you set up a Fa lungong salon instead? I cannot see any relation between Fa lungong and democracy. Ask your Master Li to execute his omnipotent magic and democratize China if he could’. A lot of articles were posted by ‘wheels’ on the issue of the Tian’an men Square massacre on 4 June 1989 and are critical of either the Party or government. This has triggered natural repulsion amongst users. Ge says in the interview that he constantly receives requests to evict those three groups from the forum and is given advice on tactics to fight them. Among the 234 posts about ‘4 June’, 197 were posted around its anniversary but the topic is not discussed on regular basis. Moreover, 178 posts are neutral in tone either claiming the event is more complicated than it appears to be, or acknowledging both students and government should be responsible for the consequences.</p>
<p>The two backbones of the self-regulatory procedures are nationalism and cynicism. Nationalism has been identified as the underpinning component of online discourse in China and the identity of Chinese netizens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1354856512439500">Qiu, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1354856512439500">Tsui, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1354856512439500">Wu, 2007</xref>). Wu has defined Chinese cyber-nationalism as ‘a non-government sponsored ideology and movement that has originated, existed, and developed in China’s online sphere over the past decade. Taking advantages of the online communication technology, Chinese cyber nationalists have been utilizing the internet as a communication center, organizational platform, and execution channel to promote the nationalistic causes among Chinese people around the world’ (2007: 155). Only severe threats to the nation or the society could trigger nationalism and public attention. Even so, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1354856512439500">Qiu (2006</xref>) observes, nationalism does not necessarily lead to action. It is exactly the low-level offline activism that guarantees the survival of the current control mechanism despite its undesirable effectiveness. At the same time, these two backbones also explain why despite a dramatically different censorship environment, the general discussion pattern and the main opinions voiced are quite similar in both forums. Even within political sub-forums, topics of social equality, economic sustainability and foreign policies that improve China’s status in the world are still the most popular themes. This distribution of content mirrors Wu’s survey findings. Wu’s 2007 survey found out that when the Party holds a nationalistic tone and vows to guard the glory of China, it is bound to be judged positively even though Chinese people realize that serious social problems exist.</p>
<p>A series of domestic disasters and confrontations with western media in 2008 and 2009 won the government unprecedented support. As a result, even without censorship, <italic>MIT BBS </italic>is still not dominated by an anti-government atmosphere. Negative comments on the government dropped 30% at <italic>QQ</italic> and 15% at <italic>MIT BBS </italic>from April 2008 to December 2008; and the figure reached its lowest points during the Olympics and the news of the bankruptcy of financial giants in the USA. All of my interviewees consider these two events as a ‘watershed for public opinion online’. In fact, the Pew Global Attitudes Project (Fallows, 2005) has already shown that Chinese people have the highest satisfaction level with national conditions and that Chinese people have the strongest sense of personal advancement (50%), even 3% higher than Americans (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1354856512439500">Table 2</xref>).</p>

<p>An and Xie<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1354856512439500">3</xref>
</sup> believe that the core of online discussion has shifted from whether China needs democracy to how can China become the strongest country in the world. The main participants are young people born after the 1980s (interview).</p>
<p>However, the form of the posts on politically sensitive topics is different in the two forums. Posts at <italic>QQ </italic>are much shorter and are emotional or vituperative rather than rational. This has two consequences. Firstly, conversations at <italic>QQ</italic> are less dialogical and fade out faster. Less than 20% of posts managed to attain more than three replies excluding expression icons and one word of support. On the contrary, more than 75% of posts at <italic>MIT BBS</italic> achieved this goal. Secondly, although a similar portion of nationalistic fervor is observed in both forums, 20% more posts are cynical at <italic>QQ</italic> than <italic>MIT BBS</italic>. A typical example is the debate about democracy. Some asked the question ‘Is there any human right in the world? Has democracy ever existed?’ Some even went further to say that, ‘I sympathize you all, empty talk, do something practical!’ Cynicism leads to more practical demands from the government and society. As one post said, ‘What is the point of discussing all these nonsense? I’m still starving! When can the price stop rising? These issues are for the rich to kill time, not for poor people like us!’ This tendency resonates with the rise of ‘new leftism’ coined by Hu as:<disp-quote>
<p>allegiance to, and tendencies toward, the notion of social security, which entails meeting the most basic human material needs in food, housing, education, medical treatment and the like. This involves a wide coalition of leftisms at both elite (implicating the uncanny mixture of Party and intellectual leftism) and popular levels and as such, an association of various class fragments. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1354856512439500">Hu, 2007</xref>: 233)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Although <italic>MIT BBS</italic> users post more rational arguments to support their viewpoint, the forum suffers a lot from internecine division, which is rarely spotted on the <italic>QQ</italic> forum. Users split into different cliques and give each other labels. Within the ‘young cynic’ (<italic>fenqing</italic>) category, those who support both the country and the government radically are called ‘low-level general’ (<italic>xiaojiang</italic>), and those who support the country but strongly resent the government are called ‘high-level general’ (<italic>laojiang</italic>). Those who left the country during the 1989 Tian’an men Square massacre and participate in democratic movements sponsored by foreign governments or institutions are called ‘<italic>minyun</italic>’. Those who belittle China and fawn on the West are called ‘wretched North Americans’ (<italic>beimei weisuonan, wsn</italic>). Users who belong to these typical categories are easily identified by their location and opinions; and their posts will not be taken too seriously. Yet they constantly fight with each other in the forum and transform rigorous discussions into flaming. Worse still, even middle-of-the-road users are in danger of being stamped as clique members once they try to moderate the discussion. The appearance of online flaming is three times higher in <italic>MIT BBS </italic>than in <italic>QQ</italic> and this aggravates the feud between the different cliques.</p>
<p>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1354856512439500">Chua (2009</xref>) argues that when voices are not treated equally, people who share similar opinions will set up a new space where similar values and identities are guaranteed, thus degrading the diversity of opinions in the community. He believes this is when moderation is needed. This occurred at <italic>MIT BBS</italic> when users detected the predominance of <italic>laojiang </italic>in ‘China News’ section, they established their own section on military information and soon took a lead in the ranking chart (Ge, interview). As a result, the power of public opinion is easily muffled in the inter-clique struggles, and this situation only subsides when it comes to issues closely related to national honor or interest. The proportion of posts calling for collective efforts and rational discussions during the Tibetan revolt, Sichuan earthquake and the Olympic game is 47%, but 9% during other eras. The schism between users and the event-driven discussion environment illustrates Zhao’s concern with the limits of the internet to produce public opinion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1354856512439500">Zhao 2008</xref>). She points out that although incidences like the ‘Sunzhigang case’<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1354856512439500">4</xref>
</sup> caught the media’s attention and created a big sensation, ‘there was no follow-up at all on authoritative investigation’ (2008: 255). The same situation happened to the ‘hide and found case’ again in 2009.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1354856512439500">5</xref>
</sup> According to Zhao the potential of the internet in formulating public opinion is limited by three elements: apparent elitism in the discourse; swift, severe, but not ‘legally sound court decision’ in response to public outrage; and sporadic, unsystematic occurrences which are only slightly regulated by the core of regulatory system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1354856512439500">Zhao 2008</xref>: 263). Yet, it is worth noticing that the Tibetan revolt, the Olympics disputes and the later global financial crisis prompted reflection on not only the internet control mechanism, but also the whole media control system. Demand for more transparent media atmosphere increased 20% in the last three months of 2008 in both forums. Initial attempts to utilize the internet as a two-way platform for public opinion started in 2008 and 2009 when President Hu jintao and Premier Wen jiabao exchanged ideas with netizens for the first time in Chinese history and emphasized the importance of maintaining this direct communication model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1354856512439500">People’s Net, 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1354856512439500">2009b</xref>). However, the depth, breadth and sustainability of this initiative need to be evaluated over a longer period.</p>

<sec id="section5-1354856512439500">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Three fundamental questions about internet control are: What are the control mechanisms? Why is control enacted? And what is the effect of internet control? Out of these three questions, only the first one has been widely studied, while the latter two are less explored. The internet control mechanisms in China are a legacy of the regulation of traditional media which is being painfully renovated to cope with new challenges brought by the digital medium. The current mechanism is composed of five layers. First of all, the execution of control has been constantly decentralized and thus drizzles down from central government to local institutions, service providers and webmasters. Each level of the executive chain enjoys a certain level of freedom in their application of the regulations. Secondly, the current control mechanism wastes resources preventing insouciant users from accessing information they are not interested in, but fails to prevent tech-savvy users and political activists from bypassing the firewall. Thirdly, the government has focused on influential messengers who possess the power to catalyze public opinion. Moreover, under the ‘harmonious society principle’, any content that may jeopardize this goal may be filtered out whether or not it is for or against the government. Fourthly, the implementation of control is learnt through professional training and education or the everyday practice of self-censorship. The perception of the internet as a risky environment further justifies governmental regulation over the internet. Last but not least, apart from keywords in the first tier, sensitive topics are vigorously discussed among Chinese users, with tech-savvy and active users as major information disseminators. Even if the control mechanism is not present, people do not necessarily criticize the government because of cynicism or their belief in nationalism. Furthermore, the increasingly open access to free information does not necessarily lead to pro-western sentiment. Instead, it enhances Chinese users’ repulsion towards the anti-China expressions from the West and the demand for more objective and rational discussion on domestic issues.</p>
<p>According to CNNIC report (2009), the internet will no longer be the privilege of the social elite as the penetration rate increases in rural areas and among groups with low educational attainment. Therefore, the current ‘liberal democratic’ principle will face a challenge with the expanding diversity of users. To what extent could the ongoing proactive mechanism compensate frivolous reactive strategies? How reliable are cynicism and nationalism in justifying the current control mechanism over the long term? These are all factors that may shift the power dynamic. This article is an effort to propose a more multidimensional approach towards the study of the control of the internet. Such research needs to locate the study in the historical, cultural and social context. Instead of treating the control mechanism as a monolith, a more nuanced approach is needed to analyze layers within the system and the diversity of those applying the control mechanisms in practice. More importantly, the impact of internet control on ordinary users’ everyday lives and their own understanding of the mechanism need to be studied in order to measure the effectiveness of the control system. Constrained by time and resources, only two forums were tested in this study. Further studies should expand the scope and depth following the analytical framework. For example, it is difficult to judge users’ social status or educational background simply based on their IDs or posts in the forum as their behaviors in the virtual world may be dramatically different. As a result, it would be desirable to conduct focus groups among active users and examine which type of user is more likely to resist control and for what purposes in the future. In addition, many discussions on sensitive topics are not necessarily carried out online, thus further studies should also examine discourses offline to offer a more comprehensive understanding of the effect of internet control on ordinary users’ everydaylives.</p>
