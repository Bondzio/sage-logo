<abstract>
<p>Brazilian cultural policy achieved a notable prominence under President Lula with the appointment of internationally renowned musician Gilberto Gil as Minister of Culture in 2003. Particular focus was given to creating cultural programmes that matched the social reform and anti-poverty agendas at the heart of Lula’s government. When Ana de Hollanda became the 14th Minister of Culture in January 2011, she declared her commitment to continuity – yet was immediately thrown into a series of high-profile battles that seemed to position her against the digital democracy heralded by the previous administration. This article looks at decisions and directions taken by the Brazilian Ministry of Culture during the first months of 2011 to consider how far current policies seek to consolidate or to challenge the cultural agenda set during eight years of Lula’s presidency. Will the legacy of Gil and his successor Juca Ferreira be continued in the government of Dilma Rousseff?</p>

<p>If Ministries of Culture were to be given the media attention that relates to their budget allocation and spending powers, we would hear very little of them on radio or television. They would be relegated to inside pages of newspapers and hardly disturb the blogosphere. But cultural ministries and arts funding agencies have a habit of punching above their budget weight to grab headlines. When Arts Council England announced how it was going to implement its share of public spending cuts in April 2011, the media found disproportionate space for what are relatively small (though none the less devastating) cuts in comparison to the attention given to the details of other austerity measures announced by the UK’s Coalition government. In Brazil the media attention given to the Ministry of Culture during the first six months of President Dilma Rousseff’s government seemed to indicate that of all the different priorities faced by her administration, culture was the number one challenge. Despite the fact that 20 other Ministries have budgets above that of the Ministry of Culture, it was rarely out of the news in Brazil during the government’s first few months, and often on the front page. Such was the fervour stirred up by some of the news coming out of the Ministry of Culture during that time that one of the most ferocious debates entered into third place on the global ratings for Twitter. Arts journalists and cultural commentators seemed to be reporting from a war zone. As the Minister Ana de Hollanda herself commented in a rare interview, ‘the game is violent’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0896920512440584">Rabello and Maria, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>When Ana de Hollanda took office on 3 January 2011, she became the 14th Minister of Culture since the Ministry was created in 1985 and the first woman to occupy the position. <italic>Pujança!</italic> was the word she evoked during her inaugural speech to describe the creativity that turns the wheel of culture in Brazil. <italic>Pujança!</italic> The great re-invigorating force that comes from below, bursting forth like a volcano. Little did she know that such <italic>Pujança!</italic> would erupt during her first 100 days in office. Nor could she have realized that she would grab quite so many headlines in such a short space of time.</p>
<p>As other commentators have noted, continuity has been the key concept as Dilma’s government began its work. Ana de Hollanda emphasized this in her opening address, promising to continue advancing the legacy of Gilberto Gil and Juca Ferreira (the two ministers to occupy this position under former President Lula), but that continuity itself seemed to be challenged by the very decision to appoint Ana de Hollanda. A fierce and often vitriolic campaign had been fought to keep in place the previous minster and by implication the policies he represented. The Ministry of Culture was one of the most hotly debated posts in the new government, and almost the last to be decided. In appointing Ana de Hollanda, Rousseff was also <italic>not</italic> re-appointing Juca Ferreira, and many of the extreme reactions to the new minister’s decisions have been framed within a supposed rupture.</p>
<p>Rather than go into detail about each of the polemics that emerged during the first year of the government, I will try to reflect in this article on what the decisions and reactions <italic>might</italic> indicate about the terrain of Brazilian cultural policy as this government goes forward. The specifics of each conflict will disappear like <italic>novela</italic> storylines, but tendencies are already emerging that seem to indicate the narrative trajectory of this Ministry.</p>
<p>The headline issues that dominated the beginning of Ana de Hollanda’s term of office began within days of her inauguration with the removal of the Creative Commons<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0896920512440584">1</xref></sup> logo from the Ministry of Culture website. This was swiftly followed by the announcement of revisions to the Copyright Reform Law that had been proposed by the previous administration. Then in February the Minister was forced into removing the candidate she herself had nominated to take office as President of the Casa de Rui Barbosa,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0896920512440584">2</xref></sup> the important cultural foundation and museum in Rio de Janeiro. This in turn was swiftly followed by the outcry that accompanied the announcement that a poetry blog with the participation of Maria Bethânia, one of Brazil’s most well known singers, was to be allowed to raise R$1.3m under the Cultural Incentive Tax Exemption Laws,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0896920512440584">3</xref></sup> universally known as the <italic>Lei Rouanet.</italic><sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0896920512440584">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>Each of these debates was characterized by media fireworks, with hints of political and artistic forces plotting the Minister’s downfall. Absorbing stories for newspapers, blogs and their audiences, but painful for any of those at the eye of the storm and an unfortunate baptism for the new Minister. In public she remained calm, allowing others to defend her and the Ministry’s policies, and a quieter momentum emerged supporting the direction she is taking. Although it is still too early to say how this combative beginning will affect the long-term plans for the Ministry of Culture, there are certain patterns that emerge from these events. Each of them speaks to the key question of how much the state can and should get involved in regulating and stimulating cultural production. In different ways the polemical cultural debates that arose at the beginning of this government have each raised the same question about the role of the state and the limits or reach of its responsibilities. When the state does nothing, the market controls cultural production and reception. With direct intervention that tries to shape culture activity according to particular ideologies or agendas, free artistic expression may be threatened.</p>
<p>In her inaugural address, Ana de Hollanda laid out a vision for the government’s cultural policy that placed the strategies of the Ministry of Culture into the context of the broad aims of both President Lula and President Dilma: democratic progress. She made it very clear that under her, the Ministry of Culture would be ‘organically connected – at every moment and in every way – to the general programme of President Dilma’s government. To the big government targets of eradicating poverty, guaranteeing and increasing social mobility [and] improving the quality of life for Brazilian cities’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0896920512440584">De Hollanda, 2011</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0896920512440584">5</xref></sup> In expressing her intention to put the democratization of culture at the heart of her Ministry, Ana de Hollanda went further. She insisted that she wants to democratize not only the consumption of culture – guaranteeing greater access to cultural outputs and services – but also ensure that there is a more equitable distribution of resources to support the production of culture. This echoes closely the direction set out by former Minister of Culture Gilberto Gil and subsequently followed by Juca Ferreira (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0896920512440584">Heritage, 2009</xref>). Through eight years of Lula’s government, Gil and Ferreira sought to expand and diversify the state’s recognition of how Brazil expresses itself as Brazil. Gil was insistent that it is not the state’s role to make art or culture: as an artist himself he knew this role belongs to others. But it is the state’s responsibility to ensure that, in Ana de Hollanda’s words, it ‘opens its eyes, and widens its horizons to incorporate those sections of society that have previously been ignored’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0896920512440584">De Hollanda, 2011</xref>). Such a sentiment echoes the words of President Dilma in her own inaugural address to Congress on 1 January 2011, when she made powerful links between social improvement and the need for a greater valorization of cultural diversity. Action on poverty is dependent in Dilma’s vision on strong investment in invention, intellectual creation and artistic production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0896920512440584">Rousseff, 2011</xref>). A vision for the Ministry of Culture was articulated clearly by the President on her own first day in office: investment in cultural production and consumption that recognizes and responds to Brazilian cultural diversity is essential to economic and social progress.</p>
<p>At the first ministerial meeting in January, Dilma defined four thematic axes to guide the policies of her Presidency: development; infrastructure; eradication of poverty; and rights and citizenship. The 37 ministries were grouped into these four areas as government policy forums, with Culture playing a strong role in the Forum for Rights and Citizenship. Inaugurating the Forum on 15 March 2011, the President’s Chief-of-Staff, Gilberto Carvalho, told the ministries that the President has asked them to be bold in bringing citizens in to participate in the heart of government, because a democratic concept of government depends not only on comment and suggestions but on active and effective participation by all sectors of society. Addressing the Forum, the President said that citizenship would be advanced across four axes:</p>
<list id="list1-0896920512440584" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Social participation and democratization of public administration</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Brazil at peace, without violence</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Guarantees of rights</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Development and citizenship</p></list-item></list>
<p>Culture is placed at the nexus of a just, inclusive and more participatory society. Cultural policy is looked to as a means by which new civic relationships are formed with sections of Brazilian society that have previously had no formal relationship with the state. The four axes were laid out not only as a guide to the formation of government policy but as the means by which a range of state initiatives can be tested, and the President specifically included the World Cup 2014 and the Olympic/Paralympic Games 2016.</p>
<p>It is not the intention of this article to raise questions about the nature, validity or plausibility of the democratic vision that has been outlined by the Dilma government. What is significant is that cultural policy should be so closely and confidently aligned to clear ethical and political values, marking a distinctive difference from the rhetoric of most European or North American arts and cultural policy makers who seek to neutralize or abandon overt links between public art and social agendas. If effective, we should expect to see this ethos imprinted in the infrastructure of the Brazilian Ministry of Culture, to find its language embedded in funding programmes and to be the means by which the Ministry’s actions are monitored and evaluated. During the first six months, Ana de Hollanda undertook subtle restructurings of her Ministry, merging two Secretariats that were formerly separate: the Secretariat of Cultural Citizenship (SCC) and the Secretariat of Identity and Diversity (SID) became the Secretariat of Citizenship and Diversity (SCDC).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0896920512440584">6</xref></sup> This Secretariat is responsible for <italic>Cultura Viva</italic> (Living Culture) one of the government’s key flagship initiatives that includes the <italic>Pontos de Cultura</italic> (Points of Culture)<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0896920512440584">7</xref></sup> programme. Often evoked by Lula as one of the greatest achievements of Gil’s term of office, the <italic>Pontos de Cultura</italic> were cited positively by all three presidential candidates during the 2010 election campaigns and their continuation was a foregone conclusion for the new Ministry of Culture. They have often been mentioned in the first semester as commentators, artists and social activists seek to take the political temperature of the new Ministry. Continuity and rupture in the transition between the two governments has been seen to balance on the <italic>Pontos de Cultura.</italic></p>
<p>When Gilberto Gil became Brazil’s Minister of Culture in 2004, he called on Célio Turino to create a programme that became known as Cultura Viva (Living Culture), which was a means for the state to support what Turino called Brazil’s Pontos de Cultura (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0896920512440584">Turino, 2010</xref>). The emphasis of the programme and its funding was placed not on single, fixed or unified sites where Brazilian culture is produced, but on the journeys that can be made between them. Cultura Viva was not just innovative because it found ways to recognize and fund artistic activities that previously existed outside of public funding mechanisms, but for the way in which it created bridges and networks between cultural and social initiatives. It is in the veins between the nation’s ‘vital points’ that the programme finds its strengths. Gil has described the Pontos de Cultura as ‘sharp interventions into the depths of urban and rural Brazil that aim to awaken, stimulate, and project what is characteristic and most positive in communities in marginalized societies’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0896920512440584">Ministry of Culture, 2005</xref>: 8–9). The programme seemingly provides a pre-existing framework for the new administration to fulfil the goals that Dilma has given to her new Minister of Culture. Yet at regional meetings organized by Marta Porto (Secretary of Citizenship and Diversity [SCDC] until August 2011)<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0896920512440584">8</xref></sup> to discuss the focus for the new Ministry, it was clear that significant ground was already opening up between the incoming and outgoing administration.</p>
<p>Encontros Rumo à Cidanania Cultural (Meetings towards Cultural Citizenship) was a series of public encounters organized by Porto and her team at the SCDC in 11 state capitals across the five Brazilian regions. They were an opportunity for the Ministry of Culture to meet with diverse components of the cultural sector such as artists, arts organizations, producers, public administrators, university representatives, and above all participants from its own programmes Cultura Viva and Brasil Plural (Plural Brazil). The aim of the meetings was to discuss how the state should work with civil society to create public policy that stimulates citizenship and cultural diversity. The Ministry announced on its website that the seminars were designed to ‘open a space that affirms the dialogue of the new administration with society’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0896920512440584">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>At each meeting, Porto issued a clarion call to artists, intellectuals and cultural activists to direct their work towards the big social, economic and environmental issues facing Brazil today. There were over 500 people present at each forum including state and municipal secretaries of culture from the region, but the main participants were the representatives of the local Pontos de Cultura. Although the ideas resonated strongly with the audiences at each location, ongoing financial problems within the programme itself demonstrated the intense difficulties at the heart of the Ministry of Culture’s desire to bring radical change to relationships between the state and society. Of all the potential threats to the good intentions of the current team at the Ministry of Culture, none seems more formidable than the financial challenges that it faces in the first year of its administration. The original budget allocation for the Ministry in 2011 had been an unprecedented R$2.1b (about US$1.16b at the current exchange rate) almost immediately reduced by R$529m (US$291m) following cuts introduced by President Dilma and effectively reduced again by debts of R$450m (US$248m) left by the previous administration. Vitor Ortiz, Executive Secretary at the Ministry of Culture, explained, ‘It will be a tight [first] year, while we get our house in order, evaluate our programmes and decide future directions. In a difficult year like this one, we are advising the Secretariats to plan for the long term, thinking about the next four years.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0896920512440584">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>The Secretariat for Cultural Citizenship has prioritized the payment of unpaid grants owed principally to the Pontos de Cultura. People who had never previously had any financial link to government and its agencies, many of whom had never even had formal employment, had become mired in a legacy of bureaucracy, producing a clamour for restitution of monies owed. The Secretariat has emphasized that it will pay all debts before any new spending is announced. This effectively means that new programmes can only begin in the second financial year of this administration. The pledge of continuity is upheld no more firmly than in honouring these commitments.</p>
<p>So where are the signs of the rupture that so many within the Pontos de Cultura programme seem to fear? Despite offering solutions to financial and administrative problems, the new Ministry’s representatives have often been greeted with suspicion because there is a feeling that the programme itself may be subject to change under the new regime. If there has been any shift in discourse it is perhaps one of emphasis and purpose rather than structure. The Pontos de Cultura programme has created a new cultural connectivity thus expressing and giving voice to Brazil’s social diversity. Now the Ministry wants to be able to show how and where cultural action makes effective social interventions in issues of health, education, at-risk youth, citizenship, public security, the environment, etc. It is not enough to show that over 3000 Pontos exist: the Ministry wants to know how they make a difference. Much has been made of how the Lula administration brought representatives of social movements into government (nowhere more so than in the Cultura Viva programme) and the Ministry is both acknowledging that achievement but subtly signposting a change. The vision of the arts as a significant force within the broad political culture of Brazil has not diminished. Cultural life continues to be seen as central to the experience of citizenship and public programmes still support engaged arts practices as a means to build a more healthy, just and safe society. But a new language is emerging that asks what the impact on urgent social agendas from actions in the cultural arena is. There is a different sense of urgency now to the call to artists and cultural activists to bring about transformation.</p>
<p>At public meetings with artists and representatives of civil society, the Ministry has begun to ask questions that build on the role for culture envisioned throughout the two Lula governments. Why is Brazil so culturally strong and so ethically weak? What role can a strengthened cultural sector play in building a Brazilian society based on values that will bring prosperity, health, education and security for everyone? These are the questions that have been publicly posed as a guide to the Ministry of Culture’s policies and the ones by which they have asked to be judged.</p>
<p>Not only has the rhetoric of the new Ministry been rocked by financial realities during these first months of the new government, but, as outlined above, the Minister took some polemical early decisions that threw her intentions into doubt. Given that both the commitment to the principles of Creative Commons and the reform of the copyright law are both part of a tendency towards democratizing culture, the signals Ana de Hollanda sent regarding both those issues placed her in conflict with many key cultural protagonists from the beginning of the year. The Minister has emphasized that the decision to remove the Creative Commons logo from the site of the Ministry was an administrative and not an ideological issue, but it was immediately seen as a reversal of Gil’s embrace of the power of digital culture’s capacity to democratize both consumption and production. Creative Commons’ invocation to share, remix, re-use had found a philosophical home in the Ministry of Culture that no longer seems so secure. Lawrence Lessig (the creator of Creative Commons) commented that if the changes proposed in the reforms of the copyright law by the previous administration were to be adopted, Brazil would have the most modern legislation in the world.</p>
<p>The arguments about the reform of the copyright laws are complex and have often been inadequately and reductively summarized in the media, especially during the first six months of the administration. The rapid polarization of the debate was baffling, as it is not an argument that readily lends itself to angels and devils. In a typical ploy to personalize and therefore popularize the debate, the media represented the debate as a stand-off between Caetano Veloso and Gilberto Gil, further complicating the position of Ana de Hollanda as she has been seen to be supporting the position of Caetano (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0896920512440584">Veloso, 2011</xref>) (‘no-one touches one centavo of my copyrights’) rather than adopting the flexibility that as artist and as minister Gil declared is a natural part of the creative process in the digital age.</p>
<p>What the current Ministry did, as opposed to what it was accused of doing, is to start a process of re-evaluation of the reform legislation that went to Congress in December 2010. This is a natural and familiar review process for all laws presented in the final month of an outgoing administration. This particular legislation had been subject to a two-year public discussion process costing over R$2m (roughly US$1.1m) and it is not surprising that with so many vested and vocal interests involved, the idea of further review was particularly painful. There was also a growing suspicion that Ana de Hollanda was going to re-balance the legislation in more traditional terms: in favour of the Central Office for Collection and Distribution (Escritório Central de Arrecadação e Distribuição, ECAD)<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0896920512440584">11</xref></sup> and away from a more radical and progressive interpretation of rights. This was further reinforced during the visit to Brazil of President Obama in March 2011, when Gary Locke (the US Secretary of Commerce) had a private meeting with the Minister. Having previously questioned Brazil’s commitment to protecting copyright, Locke makes it clear that the USA viewed the previous administration’s proposals to be an incentive to piracy. In reality, although the stage has been set for some fierce battles, Ana de Hollanda has not positioned the Ministry on one or other side of the debate. The legislation was revised, put up on the Ministry’s website for comment and feedback, and a further phase of public consultation was announced. Continuity of sorts in that once again cultural policy was being made – or at least seen to be made – through public consultation.</p>
<p>The other polemic that so severely tested the Minister during the first semester was triggered by the award of a tax exemption certificate to a poetry blog: O mundo precisa de poesia (The World Needs Poetry). Since 1991, Brazil has operated a form of cultural incentives through tax exemption legislation that requires the Ministry of Culture to issue a certificate for specific projects so that a producer can then approach private and public companies requesting that they sponsor an arts event with money that they would otherwise have paid in taxation. The Ministry of Culture determines the amount that each project is allowed to raise when it issues the certificate. Known as the Lei Rouanet (Rouanet Law) after the Secretary of Culture who introduced the legislation under President Collor (1990–92), this federal law for incentivizing culture goes to the heart of how the state makes decisions about which art is funded and who receives state money for the arts. The law has created fierce polemical debate almost since its inception. For some, it is an effective way to remove the financing of culture from the bureaucratic and political machinery of the state (almost as if the Rouanet Law guaranteed the same independence as the Arts Council of England, which operates ‘at arm’s length’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0896920512440584">12</xref></sup> from the politicians). For others it has passed the funding and therefore the policy making of Brazilian culture to the marketing and sponsorship departments of large companies (many of them multinationals). Although the Ministry of Culture decides which projects will be awarded tax exemption certificates, they are constrained by a law that leaves them little room for manoeuvre. The real decisions are made by those who determine where they want to place their logos.</p>
<p>The importance of the Rouanet Law in shaping Brazilian arts and culture policy is evident from the figures for 2010. The Ministry received R$1.3b (US$0.72b) from the central government budget, while the money distributed under the tax exemption rules was approximately R$1.27b (US$0.7b). The Ministry of Culture has no direct control of almost 50 percent of the public money spent on the arts and culture in Brazil. The arguments against this system are obvious. How to construct a consistent national cultural policy when the Ministry only controls half of the public money that is being spent on culture? The perception of money raised by the Rouanet Law as public money is often obscured, as could be seen yet again during the heated debate about the certificate awarded to create the blog O mundo precisa de poesia. The Ministry of Culture was brutally attacked for issuing a certificate that allowed the producers of the blog to raise R$1.3m, even though they constantly argued that there is no mechanism for refusing a certificate on the grounds demanded by the protestors. The high costs for the blog were justified by its producers because of the quality of the artists involved in the project. An award-winning Brazilian film director (Andrucha Washington) would produce 365 short videos of poems read by Maria Bethânia, one of the great icons of Brazilian contemporary music. The cost per video was not excessive,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0896920512440584">13</xref></sup> but nonetheless it was a large amount of public money to be paid to two highly successful commercial artists. The producers and their supporters were indignant that their detractors should accuse them of having been awarded public funding, when they had not as yet received one centavo. All that had happened was that the project had been given a certificate by the Ministry in order to raise the funding. The money itself had yet to be sought and if successful would come from the commercial sector. By a familiar sleight of hand, monies owed to the state in tax revenue are re-characterized in this debate as private funding. At the same time, the producers who presented the project to the Ministry were right to argue that they were using the system appropriately and that there was no abuse of administrative, financial or political processes. The project in itself was a rich, imaginative and generous gesture from renowned artists minded to promote greater access to poetry.</p>
<p>For some powerful voices in the cultural sector, the case of ‘Maria Bethânia’s Blog’ as it became known was used as a revelation of shifts in the Ministry’s focus, but perhaps all it really showed were the pressures the Minister faces if she wants to be effective in democratizing cultural consumption and production. The Rouanet Law will be reformed during this government, making it possible for the Ministry to direct the way in which money raised through tax exemption laws (a feature of the way in which most democratic states support the arts) can be better matched to broader social agendas. This will inevitably provoke the ire of producers who have benefited from the current legislation, but there seems sufficient momentum and determination from the current administration to achieve the much-debated reforms that were set in motion by Gilberto Gil and Juca Ferreira but never brought to fruition. According to Henilton Menezes,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0896920512440584">14</xref></sup> responsible for developing new cultural incentives within the Ministry, the Rouanet Law in its current form cannot match the size and therefore the needs of Brazilian culture. At a public debate in São Paulo at the beginning of June 2011,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0896920512440584">15</xref></sup> he explained that the current law does not allow the analysis of projects presented for tax exemption in a way that can be matched to the Ministry’s own cultural policies. According to Menezes, ‘the criteria for tax exemption should be determined in relation to the social investment that the project offers’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0896920512440584">Ministry of Culture, 2011a</xref>). The distortions produced by the current system are evident and well publicized: 80 percent of the money raised goes to producers based in the South East region (principally the states of Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo) with approximately 50 percent of the funds invested in music and theatre and over 10 percent raised by eight major producers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0896920512440584">Ministry of Culture, 2011a</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0896920512440584">16</xref></sup> It is not difficult to imagine the strength of opposition that will be mounted against the reform of the legislation that is currently being prepared by the Ministry of Culture to present to Congress in the second semester. Having come under heavy fire at the beginning of her period in office for the perceived support for the ‘Maria Bethânia Blog’ it is most likely that the opposing artillery will soon launch its own bombardment – probably by stealth – against the Ministry in the months to come.</p>
<p>The influential cultural commentator Leonardo Brant<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0896920512440584">17</xref></sup> has signposted the course he thinks the Ministry of Culture should take through this battlefield over the next three years, and his voice is heard directly and indirectly in many of the current debates. Brant emphasizes the question of cultural rights as a determinant for cultural policy:
<disp-quote>
<p>Brazil needs to resolve these rights in a more structured way. Just as there are [public] health centers and schools, culture has to be present in communities, because citizenship cannot be guaranteed without the guarantee of cultural services. But to achieve this, we have to have planned budgets and structures, which I consider the basis of financial investment. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0896920512440584">Ministry of Culture, 2011a</xref>)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Two initiatives that have quietly been advanced by the Ministry during the more noisy battles in the cultural wars of the first six months of 2011 are indicative of the sort of achievements that Ana de Hollanda is seeking: structural support for regional cultural projects that link directly to the government’s social agendas and the push towards implementing a federal scheme known as <italic>Vale Cultura –</italic> a national cultural voucher.</p>
<p>On the same day that Menezes was defending the reform of the Rouanet Law in São Paulo, Ana de Hollanda and the President of FUNARTE,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0896920512440584">18</xref></sup> Antônio Grassi, were in Manaus, capital of the state of Amazonas. They were meeting 88 young artists from states across the Northern Region as they presented the first results of 903 cultural projects that have been developed with the support of the Ministry of Culture as part of a 2010 funding programme entitled <italic>Microprojetos Mais Cultura – Amazônia Legal</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-0896920512440584">19</xref></sup> During 2010, R$14m (about US$8m) was invested across the Amazon region in cultural projects that included exhibitions, research, performances, workshops/training, festivals, recordings of CDs, literature, newspapers and digital media. Each micro-project had a dual focus: to develop citizenship and strengthen the local economy, while promoting greater inclusion for a region that has had limited access to financing for cultural production.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-0896920512440584">20</xref></sup> In order to redress historic imbalances and democratize access to public funding, the Ministry had reduced the usual bureaucracy and encouraged alternative funding applications such as the use of digital recordings or audio cassettes, so that small groups without previous experience of preparing written applications would be able to participate in the funding programme. This matches a similar programme that invested R$13.5m (US$7.4m) in just over 1000 cultural micro-projects in the Semi-Arid Region of Northeast Brazil<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-0896920512440584">21</xref></sup> and a partnership with the Ministry of Justice that financed 700 projects in <italic>Territórios de Paz</italic> (Territories of Peace) in areas that are part of the National Programme on Public Security and Citizenship (Pronasci).</p>
<p>Each of these programmes demonstrates the strong links between the outgoing and incoming administration at a time when the Minister herself has been accused of abandoning the political direction of cultural policy under Gil and Ferreira. They represent a robust structural engagement by the Ministry of Culture in directing public resources towards cultural projects that strengthen social agendas promoted by other areas of the government. The personal presence of the Minister for an event with young artists in Manaus signals a shared commitment to this government’s declared goals of strengthening citizenship through reducing poverty and increasing participation in the democratic process. The cultural voucher – <italic>Vale Cultura –</italic>that will be introduced later this year is a similarly structural approach to fundamental questions of equitable distribution of resources and democratization of cultural consumption. It is currently in its last stages of going through Congress after almost two years of planning and campaigning by successive Ministers of Culture. It will provide for a voucher worth R$50 (approximately US$28) to be included in a worker’s monthly pay packet. It can be spent on a variety of cultural benefits and events such as books, CDs, DVDs, tickets for cinema, theatre, dance, shows, exhibitions, etc. Businesses and employers will have to opt into the programme and will be responsible for the distribution of the cultural voucher to their employees.</p>
<p>The price of the voucher will be related to wage levels. Those employees earning less than three minimum salaries (approximately US$900 per month) will pay only 10 percent. Thus for a R$50 cultural voucher, only R$5 will be deducted from their wages. Those earning over three minimum salaries will pay on a sliding scale up to 90 percent. The remaining cost of the voucher will be paid by the employers, who can in turn deduct the expenditure from their annual tax returns. Thus new public money is being invested in culture. Once the legislation is passed, the Ministry of Culture will launch a national campaign to encourage employers to sign up to the programme and promote an increased valorization of culture. Their hope for this programme is that it will stimulate the production, diffusion and acquisition of cultural goods as well as raise awareness and respect for national and international cultural values. It is a direct intervention in a market that has previously allowed an elite few to guide the direction of cultural production by their privileged consumption, while at the same time the voucher will stimulate the overall economic flow in the cultural sector.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-0896920512440584">22</xref></sup> The Ministry expects about 12 million Brazilians to use the scheme and anticipates an injection of about R$7.2b (US$4b) into the Brazilian economy, with a related increase in formal employment within the cultural sector (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0896920512440584"><italic>Cultura e Mercado</italic>, 2011</xref>). Their aim is not only to increase the market but also to create a structural incentive to the democratization of access to cultural services, events and products.</p>
<p>During her inaugural address, Ana de Hollanda used a series of compelling domestic images to stress both her commitment to carrying on and also to completing what had been started under the previous administration:
<disp-quote>
<p>I don’t want the house only half-organized. Things falling apart along the way. Pictures left on their easel because of a lack of paint.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-0896920512440584">23</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Away from the battle, the Ministry of Culture under Ana de Hollanda has set about the task of giving substance to many of the most important policies established by Gilberto Gil and Juca Ferreira during the eight years of Lula’s presidency. The real significance of the changes of direction it seeks have been difficult to discern during the first part of 2011 as successive media-inspired explosions seemed constantly to threaten the very survival of the Minister. In the second year of the government, it would be foolish to predict victory or defeat as the battlefield is still strewn with debris from the recent engagements, but as the smoke clears there is a clarity emerging about the values that the Ministry will defend. The Ministry of Culture will continue the process of strengthening citizenship through the democratization of both cultural production and consumption, determined to show that Brazil’s rich artistic arsenal is of strategic importance in the building of an ethical, just and democratic society.</p>

<p>In 1946 when advising the UK government on state funding of the arts after the Second World War, the economist John Maynard Keynes ‘advocated for the “arm’s-length” principle as a defence against the type of state-supported, and politically censored, art found in Nazi Germany. The arm’s length principle meant that while the Arts Council had the freedom to make individual funding decisions without intervention from government, it had to be prepared to account for these decisions to government, parliament, and the public.’ From the Arts Council of England website, available (consulted 12 June 2011) at: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.artscouncil.org.uk/about-us/history-arts-council/1946-50/">http://www.artscouncil.org.uk/about-us/history-arts-council/1946-50/</ext-link></p></fn>
