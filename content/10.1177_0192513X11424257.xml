<abstract>
<p>Despite infidelity being a highly traumatic experience, not all couples end their relationship after discovery of the affair. The present study provides insights into the experience of couples who remained together after having experienced infidelity by one partner. Narrative inquiry methods were used to undertake and analyze in-depth interviews with eligible participants from eastern Australia who responded to advertisements. The key themes acknowledged by participants as reasons for maintaining the relationship were motivation to stay together, treasuring acts of kindness, meaning making, and social support. However, the reconciliation process was tortuous and involved forgiveness, seeking counseling, managing memories, vicarious learning, and changing couple dynamics. In rebuilding the relationship, a modification often took place, resulting in a shift in the power dynamic. The article outlines professional considerations for counselors and other therapists in relation to professional practice.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Infidelity is a common phenomenon in marriages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0192513X11424257">Atkins, Baucom, &amp; Jacobson, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0192513X11424257">Dupree, White, Olsen, &amp; Lafluer, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0192513X11424257">Gordon, Baucom, &amp; Snyder, 2004</xref>), with lifetime prevalence rates estimated at 20% to 40% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0192513X11424257">Blow &amp; Hartnett, 2005a</xref>) and up to 45% to 60% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0192513X11424257">Gordon, Baucom, &amp; Snyder, 2004</xref>). Infidelity has serious consequences for relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0192513X11424257">Peluso &amp; Spina, 2008</xref>) and is one of the most common reasons for couples entering couple therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0192513X11424257">Whisman, Dixon, &amp; Johnson, 1997</xref>). However, extramarital affairs are considered by couple counselors as one of the most difficult problems to treat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0192513X11424257">Whisman et al., 1997</xref>) and thus need to be better understood.</p>
<p>A key focus of existing research has been to understand the reasons for couples having affairs. Researchers have presented a variety of typologies of affairs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0192513X11424257">Weeks, Gambescia, &amp; Jenkins, 2003</xref>). For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0192513X11424257">Levine’s (1998)</xref> four categories include affairs, just sex, making do, and imaginary-partner sex. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0192513X11424257">Pittman (1989)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0192513X11424257">Pittman and Wagers (1995)</xref> categorize infidelity as the accidental encounter, habitual philandering, romantic affairs, and marital arrangements. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0192513X11424257">Lusterman (1998)</xref> lists eight types of affairs: entitlement, sexual identity, sexual addiction, exploratory affairs, tripod affairs, retaliatory affairs, exit affairs, and midlife events. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0192513X11424257">Brown’s (2001)</xref> typology includes five types of affairs: conflict-avoidant, intimacy-avoidant, sexual addiction, empty nest, and out-of-the-door. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0192513X11424257">Bagarozzi (2008)</xref> proposes seven categories: brief encounters, periodic encounters, instrumental and utilitarian affairs, short-term affairs triggered by developmental challenges or changing life circumstances, paraphiliac affairs, cathartic affairs, and more complex and enduring relationships. Although there is considerable overlap within and across these typologies, it is also clear that there is a wide variety of reasons for and patterns of infidelity.</p>
<p>Infidelity has been associated with multiple factors including gender, with a higher frequency among men (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0192513X11424257">Atkins et al., 2001</xref>), and poor marital satisfaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0192513X11424257">Atkins et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0192513X11424257">Blow &amp; Hartnett, 2005a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0192513X11424257">2005b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0192513X11424257">Brown, 2001</xref>). When two-person systems are under stress, a third person is sometimes brought in to stabilize the relationship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0192513X11424257">Atwood &amp; Seifer, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0192513X11424257">Carter &amp; McGoldrick, 1999</xref>). However, triangles are often dysfunctional in that they offer stabilization through diversion rather than through resolution of the issues in the couple’s relationship. After the secret is revealed, relationship issues may still be obscured, as attention tends to be focused on the affair instead of their part in the marital issues that predated the affair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0192513X11424257">Carter &amp; McGoldrick, 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>The difficult emotional and relationship processes that couples experiencing a disclosure of infidelity tend to go through have been described by a number of researchers. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0192513X11424257">Olson, Russell, Higgins-Kessler, and Miller (2002)</xref> describe the first phase as a <italic>roller coaster</italic> phase in which emotions swing wildly from one extreme to another while the parties deal with the shock of disclosure and the many uncontrollable feelings that are activated. The second phase, the <italic>moratorium phase</italic>, is activated when the couple (or individuals separately) agree to put the hurt aside and try to get on with their lives. In the third phase of this model, couples are oriented more to the future and focused on rebuilding trust in the relationship. However, past research exploring how couples have recovered from infidelity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0192513X11424257">Brown, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0192513X11424257">Dattilio, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0192513X11424257">Glass, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0192513X11424257">Lusterman, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0192513X11424257">Pittman, 1989</xref>) has not adequately illuminated the process of recovery. Factors associated with continuation of the relationships after infidelity include the level of motivation to maintain the relationship and the capacity to forgive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0192513X11424257">Atwood &amp; Seifer, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0192513X11424257">Halford, Kelly, &amp; Young, 1997</xref>). Others have explored what couples need to do to rebuild or maintain the relationship, such as healing their own hurt, forgiving their partner, and seeking counseling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0192513X11424257">Whisman et al., 1997</xref>).</p>
<p>Most research on infidelity is based on quantitative studies. For instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0192513X11424257">Blow and Hartnett (2005a)</xref>, in their detailed review of infidelity in committed relationships, examined all the major studies conducted since 1980 and found only four qualitative studies. Of these, only one has direct relevance to Western literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0192513X11424257">Olson et al., 2002</xref>). However one of the limitations of this study was the focus on exclusive partners only. Only one qualitative study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0192513X11424257">Bird, Butler, &amp; Fife, 2007</xref>) has been identified since <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0192513X11424257">Blow and Hartnett’s (2005a)</xref> review that is of direct relevance to the current study. This paucity of qualitative research involving couples who have experienced infidelity is concerning, since such research offers the potential to inform this difficult area of clinical practice and allows for in-depth exploration and analysis of the recovery process.</p>
<p>Very little research on infidelity has been undertaken with Australian samples and within the last decade. One Australian study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0192513X11424257">McAlister, Pachana, and Jackson (2005)</xref> involving university students aged 18 to 25 years in a dating relationship is limited by its focus on dating rather than married relationships and by its use of hypothetical scenarios. An earlier survey from Western Australia on major reasons for breakdown of the marital relationship found that two main reasons for relationship breakdown were a lack of communication (25%) and infidelity (23%; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0192513X11424257">Esmond, Dickinson, &amp; Moffat, 1998</xref>). Given that attitudes to infidelity are usually influenced by cultural and temporal norms, it is important to investigate current experiences and infidelity within the Australian cultural context.</p>
<p>In this article, we use qualitative research methods to explore the experiences of Australian couples who have stayed together following marital infidelity. The current research includes both exclusive and nonexclusive partners and thus allows a better understanding of the relationship dynamics. It focuses specifically on informants’ perceptions of the rebuilding of their relationship following disclosure of marital infidelity, including exploring the reasons for the affair, how the couples processed the experience, and factors that helped them continue with the relationship.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0192513X11424257" sec-type="methods">
<title>Method</title>
<p>To understand the experience of a complex socioemotional phenomenon such as infidelity, a methodology was required that allowed for the revelation of the breadth and depth of the informants’ subjective experiences as well as their relationship story. Traditional qualitative methodologies of interviewing and coding such as grounded theory have the potential to fragment or decontextualize the events, whereas a narrative approach allows for multiple perspectives to be woven together in a process of making sense of the phases of revelation, adjustment, and change in their lives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0192513X11424257">Reissman, 1997</xref>).</p>
<p>A narrative approach to interviewing and analysis was thus adopted to investigate the storied experiences of living and coping with infidelity using the informant’s own voice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0192513X11424257">McLeod, 2001</xref>). Such an approach allows meaning attributed to objects or events to be constructed through an ongoing process of interaction with their environment. The story that is constructed is reflexive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0192513X11424257">Bruner, 1990</xref>) and subject to constant editing and updating as informants’ lives are lived and their personal understanding and awareness changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0192513X11424257">Crotty, 1998</xref>). A narrative inquiry design is therefore particularly useful in examining nonnormative experiences such as infidelity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0192513X11424257">Reissman, 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0192513X11424257">2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0192513X11424257">Stuhlmiller, 2001</xref>). We used postmodernism as the underlying conceptual framework as individuals’ perceptions of past infidelity is not based on one objective reality but on multiple realities molded by their personal, social, and cultural constructs. Moreover, postmodernism allows a focus on narratives and texts as interpretations of the “lived experience” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0192513X11424257">Denzin &amp; Lincoln, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>One of the methodological challenges for the present research was choosing the terminology that could capture the roles of the marital partners in infidelity. At differing times in the literature, the one having the affair has been described as the “involved partner” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0192513X11424257">Moultrup, 2003</xref>), the “infidel” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0192513X11424257">Pittman, 1991</xref>), the “participating partner” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0192513X11424257">Gordon et al., 2004</xref>), or the “offending partner” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0192513X11424257">Olson et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0192513X11424257">Zola, 2007</xref>)—all of which have a pejorative tone. Descriptions of the partner not having the affair have been the “cuckold” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0192513X11424257">Pittman, 1991</xref>), the “injured partner” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0192513X11424257">Gordon et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0192513X11424257">Olson et al., 2002</xref>), the “noninvolved partner” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0192513X11424257">Moultrup, 2003</xref>), or the “nonextramaritally involved spouse” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0192513X11424257">Bird et al., 2007</xref>). Given that sexual exclusiveness is an assumption for most couples in a marital relationship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0192513X11424257">Atkins, Baucom, Eldridge, &amp; Christensen, 2005</xref>), we chose the terms <italic>nonexclusive partner</italic> for the individual having engaged in the extramarital affair, and <italic>exclusive partner</italic> for the individual not having an affair to describe the roles of partners, while minimizing a judgmental or pejorative tone.</p>
<sec id="section3-0192513X11424257">
<title>Sampling and Recruitment</title>
<p>Purposive sampling was used to seek informants (either exclusive or nonexclusive partners) who had experienced infidelity and who had remained as a couple for at least 2 years following the discovery of infidelity. Two approaches were used for recruitment of suitable informants. First, a media release outlining the study was provided to media outlets in southeast Queensland, Australia, seeking volunteers from eligible people. Second, local counselors were advised of the research so that they could inform suitable clients about the study and provide information about how to participate. To protect confidentiality, counselors were given a standard information letter to give to clients. The letter requested clients who may be interested in being interviewed to contact the researcher directly. The letter stated that the clients reserved the right to participate or not in the study and that declining participation would not influence the outcome of their current therapy. The project was approved by the institutional ethics review committee.</p>
<p>A total of seven people volunteered to participate, five nonexclusive and two exclusive participants. Five participants were referred by counseling agencies, whereas two responded to the media advertisement. Given the sensitive nature of the study and well-recognized difficulties in recruiting this sample for in-depth qualitative research (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0192513X11424257">Bird et al., 2007</xref>), it was decided that the present sample was adequate to undertake the exploratory study.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0192513X11424257">
<title>Procedure</title>
<p>An in-depth interview method was used to elicit the informants’ stories about the affair, how it had occurred, how it was disclosed, how the partners responded to disclosure, and how they managed their relationship over the postdisclosure period. They were also asked to reflect on the relationship more broadly, why they thought the affair occurred, and what contributed to them being able to maintain the relationship after disclosure. Thus the interview focused not just on events but also on their interpretation of these events. The informants told of their challenges and how they faced these and how they had arrived at the place they were in at the time of the interview. This method was consistent with the goal of narrative inquiry, which is not to provide verifiable accounts of events but, rather, to understand the meaning attached to events and how this changes over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0192513X11424257">Reissman, 2003</xref>). The relationship that builds between the researcher and the informant is unique and inherently means that what is said during this encounter may not be replicated if someone else were to elicit the narrative.</p>
<p>Interviews were conducted with volunteer informants in 2005-2006 by the first author. The location of the interview was negotiated to suit each informant and interviews lasted approximately 90 minutes. Prior to the interview, informed consent for audiotape recording of interviews was obtained. The informant’s right to privacy, anonymity, and confidentiality were respected via a pseudonym chosen by each informant. After each interview, the interviewer made notes containing the impressions, reflections, and feelings about the interview and each informant’s story as a whole. By the seventh interview, considerable consistency in key themes was found, although it is too small a sample to claim that saturation had been reached.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0192513X11424257">
<title>Coding and Analysis</title>
<p>Audiotaped interviews were transcribed and coded. A variety of analytic approaches were used for narrative inquiry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0192513X11424257">Jones, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0192513X11424257">Kirkman, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0192513X11424257">Neimeyer, 2001</xref>). For the present study, a thematic analysis and a broader metanarrative (or plotline) analysis were combined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0192513X11424257">Polkinghorne, 1995</xref>). The plot embedded within the stories became a focus of analysis. This focus was determined by the content of the data and meanings within the texts. The deidentified transcripts were read by the remaining authors, and the emergent themes were debated until a consensus was achieved that the key issues in every individuals’ narratives were fully captured in the coding scheme. The validity of the meanings that were emerging from the data was sought by looking for contradictions and consistencies across all the informants’ stories. The reading and rereading of the transcripts allowed for the identification of key words and themes that gave rise to coding and analyses so that meanings could be identified from the individual stories. This process took considerable time but allowed for analytic rigor to be documented in the analysis regarding credibility, dependability, and transferability of the study findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0192513X11424257">Tobin &amp; Begley, 2004</xref>). As recommended by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0192513X11424257">McLeod (2001)</xref>, individual segments of stories can be grafted into a larger story providing a “whole picture.” In the present study, individual narrative vignettes were selected from the full transcripts and included in the metanarrative sections of the results.</p>

<p>In the present study, the duration of infidelity was not more than 2 years, but the total number of transactions was high, almost daily during the period of the affairs. The location was in their own homes or offices. Although most participants made efforts to avoid risk of discovery, some left a trail of e-mails or text messages. Two of the participants revealed the affair of their own accord, and none of the participants had a same-sex affair. Only one of the participants had a past history of infidelity. In terms of occupation, the three female participants reported home duties, whereas the male participants reported being a tradesman, insurance officer, technology professional, and a psychologist, respectively. Three of the seven participants had parents who had experienced marital infidelity.</p>

<title>Reasons for the Affair</title>
<p>All informants found it important to explore and understand why the affair had taken place. In the period preceding the affair, all nonexclusive partners reported profound experiences of hurt, isolation, and pain, combined with an unexpected opportunity for an affair presenting itself. Nonexclusive partners identified that they were particularly vulnerable at the time the affair started because of issues such as the death of a family member, financial and work pressures, and feeling unappreciated and lonely in the primary relationship. The impact of negative life events was often compounded by other stresses. An example of this was expressed by Anton: “My wife was emotionally unavailable for me as she was caught up in being a mother of two and away from the support of her extended family.” Another participant said,
<disp-quote>
<p>I felt neglected by my husband as he was consumed with his business which was failing. He was preoccupied with his problems and did not want to listen to mine so when someone noticed me and seemed to care, I responded.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In addition to their vulnerability, the informants indicated that “opportunity” was a key determinant of starting the affair. In all cases, they had not sought out the affair, but rather the opportunity presented itself and in their vulnerable state, they embraced it. For example, a nonexclusive male said,
<disp-quote>
<p>Not only did my dad die but also I was having problems at home and at work. My son was in trouble at school and my wife was trying to handle it as much as possible. But, she unloaded on me and at the same time I wasn’t happy at work. I didn’t fit in with my work mates and felt alone most of the time. I suppose I had a lot on my mind. Anyway, I found that a new girl at work seemed to notice me and said, “Hi,” now and then. One day we just started talking and I found that she listened to me and didn’t expect me to solve her problems. I began to look forward to seeing her smiling face at work. She was the only bright spark in my life. A few weeks later after the staff party we became lovers. It was great, but I did feel guilty sometimes. (Gary)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Another example was the following:
<disp-quote>
<p>This girl was at work and she was interested in me, got to me during a low time. She was privy to what I earned and I think that was part of her attraction to me. Not that I like to admit that but being realistic about it. She was 14 years younger than me, being 28 or 29 and I was about 44. She came up with all these wonderful ideas on how to make my business more professional like salary sacrificing and I sort of fell into it. At a conference she sat next to me one weekend, so close to me that I could feel the vibes and it was yummy. I didn’t do anything, I resisted that. It would have been about 6 months later at another conference, I had a few beers under my belt and she made it clear that she was available and I ended up in her room. (Darren)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>What these stories seemed to point to was the difficulty informants had in managing their emotional life. Despite clear warning signs of problems in their emotional life and their primary relationship, the problems were not actively dealt with. Rather, the informants’ stories were of stoicism in the face of difficulties, initial resistance to temptation, and then capitulation when resistance failed.</p>

<sec id="section9-0192513X11424257">
<title>Responses to Disclosure of the Affair</title>
<p>When the discovery of the affair occurred, both exclusive and nonexclusive informants found it overwhelming. Two of the nonexclusive informants voluntarily told their partner about the affair because they wanted to be honest. They thought that the disclosure might help their partner have a better sense of their unhappiness leading up to the affair and that this understanding might form a basis for rebuilding their relationship. Even though the exclusive partners valued their honesty, the affair still meant that they separated for a few months. The remaining exclusive partners found out about the affair through suspicion and evidence. For example, one exclusive partner said,
<disp-quote>
<p>I had organized for the children to be looked after and decided to surprise him by accompanying him to Sydney. I jumped up in the morning and said “I’m coming with you” and he said “Oh, that’s good . . . we booked into the hotel that the company had organized for him and the lady behind the reception desk said, “Oh this is Mr. H’s account from last week.” The moment I took that envelope (normally he wouldn’t get a bill because the company would pay for it), I had a feeling this was strange and when I checked the bill I saw dinner and breakfast for two. He denied it for a little while and eventually the other woman’s husband rang me and said, “I believe your husband is having an affair with my wife.” (Cheryl)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Another experience of the discovery of infidelity was the following:
<disp-quote>
<p>My husband began to get suspicious of me as I was distant and unresponsive to him. We did not have sex anymore. Eventually, he followed me to the gym where he saw me talking to the other man and then he watched as we went to lunch. He confronted me in the restaurant. I was shocked and tried to deny his accusations. Later on at home, he demanded to know the truth. I then admitted that I was having an affair. The look on his face was unforgettable, like he had been stabbed in the chest. (Felicity)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The immediate feelings and responses around the discovery of the affair were varied. Similar to experiencing any trauma, the feelings were intense and overwhelming. Feelings such as shock, horror, denial, anger, hurt, anguish, despair, guilt, sadness, inadequacy, rejection, and betrayal surfaced with actions of yelling, silence, withdrawal, and distancing. For those who had the affair, their feelings were ambivalent as they sometimes felt remorse but also elation over what had occurred.</p>

<sec id="section10-0192513X11424257">
<title>Factors Associated With Decision to Stay Together and Rebuild the Relationship</title>
<p>The analysis revealed four key themes that were influential in the decision to maintain the relationship. These were motivation, acts of kindness, meaning making, and support.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0192513X11424257">
<title>Motivation (“Winners never quit”)</title>
<p>In all the narratives, motivational factors had an important impact on the decision to continue in the primary relationship. The informants described how the couples had to be highly motivated to repair the relationship even though they knew that this required enormous effort. Motivation was seen as especially paramount where the relationship involved children, property, and more time already invested in the relationship. Many informants were able to clearly express this. For example, an exclusive female said,
<disp-quote>
<p>Our relationship involved a big investment of time, memories, and property, and we didn’t want to forfeit any of that. We worked out that we both were very motivated as we had three kids, a house, and lots of good memories. (Gary)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>One nonexclusive partner described this determination to work on the relationship and solve problems in the following way:
<disp-quote>
<p>Coming from a farming background, it was up to us to work things out for ourselves. It was up to us to solve our own problems just like getting rid of our own garbage. On a farm, no wheelie bin truck collects our garbage, we see to it ourselves. (Bella)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Their fear of failure led to the informants’ determination to find a way to succeed in saving their damaged relationship. All but one of the couples had temporarily separated when the affair was first discovered. However, most found that, financially, they could not sustain two households, and some stated that they did not want to admit failure of the relationship. Fear of failing in the relationship was evident especially for those from a broken or divorced home and family. They did not want to be a single parent raising children on their own. There was a sense of being emotionally shattered and yet enduring to avoid being labeled a loser or failure. A nonexclusive male described his experience as follows:
<disp-quote>
<p>After having had one failed marriage, I did not want to fail again and be labeled a loser. I was determined to save my marriage and so I made the decision to win. (Darren)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Another nonexclusive female said,
<disp-quote>
<p>Coming from a broken home, where my father had an affair resulting in the family break up, I decided I did not want to walk away and leave my children devastated. I wanted to show them that losers walk away but winners never quit. (Felicity)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0192513X11424257">
<title>Treasuring acts of kindness</title>
<p>Contrary to society’s traditional view on infidelity, the informants in this study realized that even though they had betrayed or been betrayed, <italic>nevertheless</italic> they would show “mercy” and rebuild their relationship. One of the nonexclusive males described an important factor in rebuilding their relationship as, “she was merciful and stopped bringing up my fling with the other woman.” A nonexclusive female added, “After the anger subsided, he was kinder to me and showed mercy.” Even though the nonexclusive partner knew that he or she had offended the exclusive partner, they were taken aback by little gestures of kindness exhibited by the exclusive partner. For example, when one partner found out about the affair, instead of blaming the nonexclusive partner, he showed love and forgiveness by presenting her with a bouquet of flowers.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>This touched me deeply, so much so, that I marveled at him and knew he was the better man. This act was so sacrificial and noble, and in my heart I honored him for it, but at the time I could not speak of it, but I treasured it. (Bella)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-0192513X11424257">
<title>Meaning making</title>
<p>Although the first reactions to disclosure of the affair were often shock, anger, feelings of betrayal, guilt, or shame, the informants described this initial phase being followed by a process whereby they were moved to make meaning of their lived experience. They found that they had to face the truth of what had happened and understand it as a couple issue as well as an individual issue. Facing the truth was experienced as both confronting and liberating. Through ongoing reflection on their stories, the informants began to gradually make meaning of their experience, so that, by the time of the interviews, their stories had developed into their version of the “truth.” Couples recognized that there were several issues that led to the affair and that they had both contributed to it. One exclusive female expressed her process like this:
<disp-quote>
<p>I felt stuck in blaming him for having the affair. Then I gradually realized that I also played a part in what happened. It dawned on me that we were like a pair of shoes that go together and I found that strangely challenging but also liberating. (Cheryl)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In the process of meaning making, the couples found that talking with each other about what went wrong was helpful. Even though it was difficult, they were able to listen and respond. One exclusive female decided that she had a “choice to be better, not bitter.” Several informants described going through an experience of cognitive dissonance, a state of extreme discomfort resulting from the discrepancy between their own and society’s beliefs about the exclusivity of relationships, their confidence in their partner’s love and commitment, and their overt behavior in having the affair.</p>
<p>Several experienced the process of making meaning and healing in a spiral pattern. In other words, it involved a process of moving forward and upward at certain times and at other times, going backward and feeling like they were back at “square one.” However, by the time of the interviews, the informants no longer felt this was the case as they gradually realized that progress was being consolidated for further grieving and healing to take place. As one nonexclusive partner described it:
<disp-quote>
<p>Sometimes he would go on and on about me sleeping with someone else, which made it very uncomfortable for me. But gradually he stopped talking about it, and I promised him I would not do it again. (Bella)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-0192513X11424257">
<title>Support</title>
<p>Exclusive and nonexclusive partners experienced the role of support from others in very different ways. Exclusive partners were generally consoled by family and friends for their partner’s infidelity. However, this was experienced as a conditional support. They knew from listening to the media that societal norms were often in favor of ending the relationship. They expected that they would be cautioned against deciding to stay in the relationship and work things out, and perhaps judged for it. One of the exclusive informants described feeling judged for staying in the relationship:
<disp-quote>
<p>My family and friends thought I was mad to even contemplate staying with the bastard. (Cheryl)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>On the other hand, the nonexclusive partners found that they were criticized for their infidelity, and they received much less support from family and friends. Instead, they found others were skeptical that they would be able to change their behavior. For example, one nonexclusive partner said,
<disp-quote>
<p>I told my parents and siblings. One of my sisters was very critical of me which hurt a lot. My mother showed understanding as she had been unfaithful 12 years before, but my father found it difficult as it took him back to his own pain. Maybe, he identified with my wife more than me. However, he said he could understand how it happened, especially as my wife was not emotionally there for me. (Anton)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-0192513X11424257">
<title>Active Reconciliation</title>
<p>Once informants had made the commitment to stay and rebuild the relationship, they identified a number of strategies that helped them actively reconcile. These included an intention and practice of forgiveness, going to couple counseling, managing intrusive and negative memories, and vicarious learning. The process of rebuilding the relationship was described in all cases as leading to a modification of the fundamental dyadic dynamic of the relationship.</p>
<sec id="section16-0192513X11424257">
<title>Forgiveness</title>
<p>Each informant emphasized that forgiveness played a large part in “getting back on track.” For example, one woman had attended a workshop on forgiveness that helped her forgive her husband for his affair. Some saw forgiveness as a process of “gradual forgiving bit by bit.” Others felt that “forgiveness and acceptance were essential precursors to the healing. I accepted what had happened and was able to overlook it.”</p>
<p>Many couples discovered that when they forgave, their negative feelings toward their partner were not automatically replaced by positive feelings and that they did not forget the injury. A nonexclusive male discovered that forgiveness can be gradual, “bit by bit my wife forgave me and the look in her eyes softened. I felt relieved that the nightmare was fading and after about 5 months we made a truce.” A nonexclusive female found that it took time for forgiveness to happen.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>If my husband had not loved me enough, it would have ended. He did not reject me but reached out to me and he forgave me. He showed me mercy, even though some days he would be hurt and angry. (Bella)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section17-0192513X11424257">
<title>Counseling</title>
<p>Reconciliation also required assistance in the form of counseling. The five participants who had received counseling considered the experience helpful. They felt that counseling was a safe place and having someone really listening and remaining neutral was important. One informant explained it this way, “without a doubt, the counseling helped us to talk without shouting at each other. The counselor acted like a referee.” For relationships to thrive, it was found through counseling that the informants had to give clear expression of their wants and needs. They realized that their partner was not a “mind reader,” and it was important to be open and honest in their communication. Through counseling, the informants realized they needed to learn to operate from a more adult state.</p>
<p>Of the informants interviewed, only two did <italic>not</italic> have counseling. One felt, in retrospect, that counseling would have sped up the healing process, as it took 10 years to rebuild the relationship. The other one felt their professional background gave them the expertise to come to terms with the “critical incident” themselves. Counseling allowed for exploration of new ways of communicating and relating. For example, the informants learned about “I” statements where they owned their issues without blaming. They looked at what went wrong in the relationship.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>There was a lot of pain for us both, but we talked about what went wrong and how we could make it right. We realized how we had been so critical of each other and then how the other one would sulk. It wasn’t easy. In fact it was bloody hard. (Gary)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section18-0192513X11424257">
<title>Managing memories</title>
<p>Informants found it difficult to manage their memories, as they would have flashbacks of moments that would overwhelm them. They found that avoiding the phrases of “if only” and “what if” helped them in coping with infidelity. Informants were very clear that the habit of constantly bringing up what had happened was very damaging to the rebuilding of their relationship. They soon learnt not to say out loud “if only you hadn’t” as it involved a circle of regret, “which goes nowhere.” One exclusive female said,
<disp-quote>
<p>Initially it would come up sometimes but I tried very hard not to. In bringing it up, you’ve got to remember you’re bringing her back to his mind and his thoughts. Every time you raise her name, you are bringing her back into his mind. To be honest, after we reconciled there wasn’t a day that went by for about 4 years that I didn’t think about it. (Cheryl)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section19-0192513X11424257">
<title>Vicarious learning</title>
<p>Another aspect of reconciliation was vicarious learning. Vicarious learning is described as learning that is obtained from sympathetic experience of another’s experiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0192513X11424257">Sharf, 1996</xref>). The informants expressed how helpful it was to learn from others in dealing with infidelity. Being able to observe how others had dealt with similar situations in the past provided helpful insights to repair the relationships. Some informants had reservations after watching what their friends went through. “I’d seen others who were not happier or better off by ending the relationship. Many of my friends are miserable and lonely now and wish they had worked things out.” The real-life examples of others were pointed out as helping in the process as well.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I think it helped that our counselor had also had an affair. He seemed to understand what we were going through and he gave us hope that our relationship could recover. Also the fact that my parents had survived infidelity was helpful.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Another informant shared an example of vicarious learning:
<disp-quote>
<p>I wasn’t going to be the ex-wife from hell. I wasn’t going to hand him to her on a plate. I’ve seen a lot of bitter women. I have a sister-in-law who has been through this and she can’t let that bitterness go. She serves it up to him constantly. You have to make a conscious decision that you are going to move on past that. You don’t bring it up.(Cheryl)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section20-0192513X11424257">
<title>Changing couple dynamics.</title>
<p>Each informant came away from the experience of infidelity with an awareness of how far he or she had come or how much they had emotionally developed. Informants were aware that destructive patterns of relating had been replaced by a more constructive and rewarding way of being in a relationship and understanding each other. They were empowered by learning techniques in improved communication that enhanced their ability to express themselves appropriately. The impact on the relationship was a gradual consolidation of trust and intimacy that ultimately affected the dynamics of the relationship. A nonexclusive male explained how trust was reestablished:
<disp-quote>
<p>I had to be accountable for my movements. At first, she didn’t trust me very well so I would phone to let her know where I was and why I would be late. She would thank me for my consideration. A bigger test came when I had to work away for a week at a time and come home for weekends. At first she was fearful and insecure but after a while she was more trusting. (Anton)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>By avoiding a relationship break-up, the informants felt they had a psychological power as a result of having come through a difficult experience. The informants felt that having experienced infidelity, they had moved from being victims to survivors, with a resulting sense of personal authority. Coming through the healing or grieving process, there was a sense of satisfaction of achieving success. It was like “growing up” and being an adult at last. There was a sense of strength and empowerment that emerged in all the informants. One of informants expressed this new authority as “It wasn’t theory anymore but reality, knowing that I’m a survivor, not a victim.” One of the informants pointed out,
<disp-quote>
<p>We are so glad to have weathered the storm and to be experiencing calmness and peace like never before. It is much more relaxing and real for us both and we appreciate each other much more. Our children are pleased we are back together and we feel it has been helpful for them to see that relationships can be made better with perseverance. (Felicity)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Another nonexclusive informant said,
<disp-quote>
<p>Our relationship has changed because we have changed. We feel we have come through a huge challenge and survived it, which makes us feel strong. (Bella)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>As relationship boundaries had been violated by the affair, many informants felt it was necessary to repair the “broken-down walls” of safety. For couples to rebuild their relationship, they had to fully commit to each other. One of the informants expressed it like this: “It helped that she made a commitment to me again emotionally before it became sexual again.” Another informant used a ritual to show their new commitment, followed by an action.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>We decided to renew our wedding vows, as we wanted to show our family that all was forgiven and that we were starting a new chapter in our relationship. We also had another baby (our fourth boy), which confirmed our commitment to each other. (Gary)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>With the rebuilding of the relationship, power structures shifted in various ways. To begin with, the exclusive partners had the power to forgive or not forgive. Also the exclusive partners were able to be more assertive with requests and decisions, whereas the nonexclusive partners had to be more accountable and communicative, placing a higher value on their partners. For example, one of the informants said of her husband:
<disp-quote>
<p>He is really the needy one now. It’s almost like a role reversal in many aspects. When you reconcile after infidelity there is a real shift in power and you have to be really careful how you use that. (Cheryl)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Another nonexclusive male said,
<disp-quote>
<p>We set some ground rules such as she would control the money with the signing rights and do the books. I couldn’t just come and go as I pleased, but had to be accountable for my whereabouts. (Darren)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Despite the role reversal or changing power dynamic, couples reported feeling more comfortable and relaxed with each other. Power and control shifted so that money, accountability, holidays, and outings were now decided by the other partner. However, as trust was reestablished, issues were negotiated in a more democratic way. They were more honest with their needs, instead of being compliant or critical. After an affair, the informants discovered that they had to be more open and real with their feelings. They had to be “authentic” for their relationships not only to survive but also thrive. The couples who rebuilt their relationships found that authenticity was rewarding. They learnt that being genuine meant they did not have to hide their feelings. They could be more open with each other. One exclusive female said, “I think I got to know him more after the affair than in the previous seven years of our marriage. I got to be me, which was really liberating.” The informants likened the experience of rebuilding their relationship after infidelity to “coming home,” with all the mixed emotions of remembering past times, good or bad, as well as facing both the stability of a common history and the uncertainty of changes that lay ahead. One of the informants explained that
<disp-quote>
<p>there seems to be a longing in the human heart to be able to come home where we are free to be who we really are, however sometimes we are confined or restricted by living with others. It is a constant balancing act. (Errol)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Another informant described her experience as follows:
<disp-quote>
<p>We have entered the best and most tender time of our marriage. It’s like “coming home” with feelings of acceptance, security, and comfort knowing you are loved, no matter what! (Bella)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>To summarize, there were four key themes that were influential in the decision to maintain the relationship. These were motivation, acts of kindness, meaning making, and support. Forgiveness and counseling allowed the couples to repair their relationship. In rebuilding their relationship, a modification took place, resulting in a shift in the power dynamic, and there was a sense of satisfaction at surviving infidelity.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study sought to address the considerable dearth of qualitative research on factors that help couples rebuild their relationship after marital infidelity. One of the few existing qualitative studies has highlighted the practical and methodological difficulties in recruiting real-world samples to undertake in-depth studies of this sensitive topic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0192513X11424257">Bird et al., 2007</xref>). We addressed past shortcomings by recruiting a larger number of participants, including both exclusive and nonexclusive partners (one participant per couple), and examining retrospective accounts of the recovery process once considerable time and healing had occurred and participants could reflect back on the process with some distance and perspective.</p>
<p>A particular strength of this research is that it explores through in-depth interviews the actual lived experiences of informants who had experienced an affair more than 2 years ago and had remained together. This fills an important gap in the research literature, since other researchers have tended to use more indirect methods to elicit information such as vignettes presented to college students for hypothetical responses (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0192513X11424257">McAlister et al., 2005</xref>). A comparative study of hypothetical versus actual infidelity found that responses to hypothetical infidelity were uncorrelated with reactions to actual infidelity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0192513X11424257">Harris, 2002</xref>). More recent studies have started addressing these issues but have used very narrow time frames for relationship outcomes after the affair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0192513X11424257">Bird et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0192513X11424257">Hall &amp; Fincham, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0192513X11424257">Shackleford, Besser, &amp; Goetz, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0192513X11424257">Allen et al. (2005)</xref> provide a useful framework outlining six stages of the process in dealing with infidelity. These include predisposing factors that exist prior to infidelity, followed by approach factors, precipitating factors, maintenance factors, and disclosure or discovery factors, and end with response factors. Prior to the affair, our informants cited two main predisposing factors—stressful life events or circumstances (e.g., a family death, financial pressures, isolation, and performance issues) and dissatisfaction in the primary relationship (hurt, isolation, and distance from their partner with a lack of attention and appreciation). Approach factors including having the opportunity such as independence from partners through work and travel. Precipitating factors include the use of alcohol, particularly at work functions or conferences, and having a person who made their availability overt. It was clear in most cases that it was a combination of these precipitating factors that led to the affair. Factors that helped maintain the affair included opportunity, such as having an affair with a colleague. Disclosure of the affair occurred both through self-disclosure by the nonexclusive partner and through suspicion and discovery by the exclusive partner.</p>
<p>Reviewing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0192513X11424257">Brown’s (2001)</xref> typology discussed in an earlier section of the article, our informants did not describe affairs as a means to avoid conflict or intimacy or because of sexual addiction. Neither were our informants experiencing the “empty nest” syndrome nor were they wanting an “out-the-door” affair. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0192513X11424257">Pittman and Wagers’s (1995)</xref> typology includes four categories, comprising accidental infidelity, philandering, romantic affairs, and marital arrangements. In this study, the informants experienced either accidental infidelity (where infidelity has not been planned but occurs spontaneously when an opportunity presents itself) or romantic affairs (when there is an emotional connection).</p>
<p>Prior research has highlighted the emotional and traumatic impact that discovery of an affair can have on the couple relationship, and particularly on the exclusive partner. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0192513X11424257">Olson et al. (2002)</xref> reported a three-stage process following disclosure of an affair, starting with an “emotional roller coaster” and then moving through a “moratorium” phase before “trust building” takes place. Our results confirm that the impact of infidelity on the exclusive partner was often unexpected and destructive, leaving them feeling defenseless, victimized, and confused, in keeping with the findings of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0192513X11424257">Gordon and Baucom (1999)</xref>. Initially, participants had chaotic and intensely uncomfortable emotions, as they dealt with the cognitive aspect of gathering information so that they could reconstruct their understanding of their relationships. Such reactions may be similar to the emotions felt when people are confronted by any great loss or trauma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0192513X11424257">Gordon, Baucom, &amp; Snyder, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0192513X11424257">Ortman, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0192513X11424257">Peluso, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>After the initial turmoil following discovery, the informants in our study described their process as, first, deciding if they were motivated enough to stay in the relationship. Second, they had to make meaning of what had happened. Third, they described a process of active effort toward reconciliation, and fourth, they had to find a way for the relationship to adjust and rebalance itself as the dyadic dynamic changed and modified throughout the process of rebuilding trust in the relationship.</p>
<p>Motivation played a key role in the participants’ narratives about the process of resolving relational problems and rebuilding their marriage, in line with other research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0192513X11424257">Kelly &amp; Halford, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0192513X11424257">Miller &amp; Rollnick, 2002</xref>). Trying to make meaning has been described in the literature as an arduous process, often involving “obsessing about details, retreating both physically and emotionally and recruiting the support of others in an effort to make meaning of the infidelity” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0192513X11424257">Olson et al., 2002</xref>, p. 427). The couples in this study had to make meaning of what had happened, and they did this primarily by trying to understand the reasons for the infidelity. Their motivation to stay together involved them in a process of challenging some cultural barriers against staying together.</p>
<p>Our findings in relation to the process and role of forgiveness support the view that this is a gradual process, involving an active motivational component, but also that it tended to be a slow, cumulative process that evolved as they rebuilt trust and intimacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0192513X11424257">Allen &amp; Atkins, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0192513X11424257">Diblasio, 2000</xref>). They engaged in an active process of reconciliation through forgiveness, counseling, trust building, and vicarious learning. Modification occurred in the relationship, resulting in a power shift and being more authentic.</p>
<p>The informants in this study did experience the three-stage forgiveness model as proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0192513X11424257">Gordon et al. (2004)</xref>, whereby they had to deal with the impact of infidelity, explore and find meaning, and then move on. However, although forgiveness has been found to increase the chances of reconciliation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0192513X11424257">Hall &amp; Fincham, 2006</xref>), forgiveness did not mean forgetting what had happened for these couples. Rather, it involved remembering, learning from it, and moving on. In conjunction with forgiveness, building trust played an important part in the restoration of violated trust. The informants in this study found that trust had to be earned over time. They changed some of their patterns of relating using authenticity and boundaries, “I” statements, knowing their love languages, and eventually balancing the power between them. Modification occurred in the relationship, resulting in a power shift and being more authentic.</p>
<p>It is of interest that 5 of the 7 couples had received counseling, and all reported that it was helpful. Furthermore, couples who had not received counseling considered, in retrospect, that it would have been useful. A valuable recent study of 530 couples who received couple therapy found that the 145 couples who reported infidelity were significantly more distressed and more depressed at the start of therapy compared with the 385 couples who sought couple therapy for reasons other than infidelity, but both groups made gains throughout therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0192513X11424257">Atkins, Marin, Lo, Klann, &amp; Hahlweg, 2010</xref>). By 6 months posttherapy, the two groups were indistinguishable in relation to marital distress and depressive symptoms. Such findings, along with our qualitative data, provide strong support for the value of relationship counseling following disclosure of infidelity.</p>
<p>Our research revealed two unique concepts that have not previously been identified through research and that provide valuable insights for counselors working with couples who wish to rebuild their relationship after an affair. First, in our study, the nonexclusive partners highlighted the important role of gestures of kindness and mercy by the exclusive partner that helped turn the tide in their recovery. The unexpected acts of thoughtfulness and kindness from the exclusive partners had a profound effect on the nonexclusive partners. Instead of acts of retribution or revenge, a couple of exclusive male partners decided to show kindness, which eventually made a difference in the healing of their relationships. This finding is supported by the growing positive psychology literature on the importance of acts of kindness and positive virtues such as generosity, nurturance, care, compassion, altruistic love, and “niceness” in promoting healthy human relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0192513X11424257">Peterson &amp; Seligman, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Second, there was an acknowledgment of the role of vicarious learning in dealing with infidelity. Most of the informants were able to observe from others who had been through a similar experience and had either chosen to end or persist with the relationship and all that it would entail. The informants were able to remind themselves of how some others had suffered through choosing not to rebuild their relationships and later come to regret the decision made in the turbulent time following disclosure of the affair. This provided a salient lesson for them and helped provide the motivation to overcome the current difficulties and resistances.</p>
<p>An important finding was the differing experiences of family and social support for the exclusive and nonexclusive partners. The nonexclusive partners found that there was a lack of empathy toward them for having an affair, whereas the exclusive partners found they received emotional support as long as they chose to separate from the nonexclusive partner. It is important for counselors working with couples to be aware of this splitting tendency and consider how to sustain the possibility of support for both partners while they work with a range of complex feelings and decisions. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0192513X11424257">Fife, Weeks, and Gambescia (2008)</xref> propose an integrative approach to treating infidelity based on the intersystems model advocated by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0192513X11424257">Weeks et al. (2003)</xref>, which is growth oriented and helps the couples build on their relationships. The finding also suggests that family-based approaches may be helpful in strengthening the couple’s support structures.</p>
<p>There are a number of limitations of the present study that need to be acknowledged. Although the methodology of narrative was chosen for this study to allow freedom for the informants to express their experiences of infidelity, their narratives were bound by the context of time. It needs to be acknowledged that, over time, narratives tend to be recreated as events, circumstances, and people interact in complex ways to reshape the meaning of their experiences and thus their stories. Different perspectives on the informants’ experiences may have been gained if interviewed at different stages of the recovery process and in dialogue with different interviewers. Another limitation is the small sample of seven volunteer informants. It could be beneficial for more narratives to be accumulated so that a greater understanding of different settings and contexts might be gained, although we did find a high degree of consistency in the emergent themes for nonexclusive partners and related to the emotional and physical nonavailability of exclusive participants.</p>
<p>Despite the call for more qualitative research on infidelity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0192513X11424257">Blow &amp; Hartnett, 2005b</xref>), there are practical problems associated with finding potential informants. For instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0192513X11424257">Bird et al. (2007)</xref> failed to recruit any client participants from the 10 therapists they approached. The reasons for this may include therapist gatekeeping, the sensitivity and shame associated with infidelity, or the need for privacy. Recruitment difficulty may also be an indicator of an ongoing sense of vulnerability among those who have experienced an affair. Despite these difficulties, the seven participants in our study seemed to appreciate the opportunity to explore their experience and valued the potential for it to assist other couples who seek to recover from infidelity.</p>
<p>The interviews took place with a postaffair time range of 2 to 10 years, which could alter the construction of informants’ narratives. In this study, only one of the informants was in a de facto relationship, and the rest were married. It is plausible that a different set of issues would have emerged with younger informants and/or by limiting the sample to only those with a recent experience of infidelity. The self-selection of informants and their motivation to be interviewed for this study remains unknown. Future research could sample more broadly and include individuals who decided not to continue their relationship to provide a better understanding the profile and motivation of those who rebuilt their relationship and their desire to be part of such research studies.</p>
