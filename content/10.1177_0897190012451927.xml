               <title>Purpose:</title>
               <p>The objective of this manuscript is to describe the development and implementation of a patient care center in a grocery store supermarket chain pharmacy.</p>
            </sec>
            <sec>
               <title>Methods:</title>
               <p>A clinical pharmacist and shared faculty member between Wayne State University and Kroger Pharmacy developed a patient care center and rotation site for P4 PharmD advanced pharmacy practice experiences (APPEs). The site was developed to provide advanced pharmacy services to patients and as a practice site for students to learn how to deliver care. Preliminary outcomes observed include the number and types of patients that utilized the patient care center and the educational experiences provided for student pharmacists practicing in this setting.</p>
            </sec>
            <sec>
               <title>Results:</title>
               <p>Since implementation, 160 patients visited the patient care center. The pharmacists involved in the clinic performed 30 biometric screenings and 47 comprehensive medication reviews.</p>
            </sec>
            <sec>
               <title>Conclusions:</title>
               <p>Establishing a patient care center in a supermarket pharmacy provides important care for patients and valuable learning experiences for student pharmacists. The collaborative efforts of both Wayne State University and Kroger Pharmacy demonstrate commitment to providing clinical care to patients and strong clinical community practice experiences for students. Future goals include creating more clinical services in the community and practice experiences for students.</p>

         <title>Introduction</title>
         <p>The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMMS) modified the requirements so that more beneficiaries qualify for medication therapy management (MTM) services in 2010.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0897190012451927">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0897190012451927">2</xref>
            </sup> This change provided a larger base of patients eligible for pharmacists’ services. Some private insurance companies added MTM as a benefit in hopes to decrease drug and medical costs.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0897190012451927">3</xref>
            </sup> Examples include insurance companies like Priority Health and Clear One Health Plan who recently contracted with Outcomes Pharmaceutical Health Care, a national provider of MTM services, so that their beneficiaries can have access to clinical pharmacy services.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0897190012451927">4</xref>
            </sup>
         </p>
         <p>Although increased opportunities are available to provide MTM services, barriers have been identified that decrease pharmacists’ ability to provide clinical care services in the community pharmacy setting.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0897190012451927">5</xref>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0897190012451927"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0897190012451927">7</xref>
            </sup> Lack of knowledge and experience providing the services, low reimbursement, increased dispensing responsibilities, and the lack of ancillary personnel to help in the process are a few barriers identified by pharmacists.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0897190012451927">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0897190012451927">7</xref>
            </sup> There are examples of several initiatives in the literature that assist in efforts to decrease barriers so that pharmacists can offer more clinical services in the community.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0897190012451927">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0897190012451927">8</xref>
            </sup> For example, Bright and colleagues reported that ancillary personnel may help to decrease the burden of managing the pharmacy and providing clinical services.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0897190012451927">7</xref>
            </sup> An additional pilot study and focus group of pharmacy technicians reported that they are willing to help pharmacists provide MTM services.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0897190012451927">8</xref>
            </sup> The American Pharmacists Association offers a national certificate training program aimed to educate pharmacists about MTM and to inspire them to create services at their practice sites.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0897190012451927">9</xref>
            </sup>
         </p>
         <p>With more patient care opportunities and lack of clinical community training sites, The Kroger Company of Michigan and Wayne State University developed a new partnership. Both institutions agreed to create a new shared faculty position between Kroger Pharmacy and Wayne State University. The faculty member was charged with creating a patient care center in a Kroger Pharmacy that incorporates learning experiences for P4 PharmD students. The goal of a patient care center is to provide more cognitive-based services in the community such as MTM and to develop new services. The shared faculty member is a resource for pharmacy students and staff pharmacists interested in providing more MTM type services in their pharmacy. Due to increased MTM opportunities, busy pharmacies are challenged with creating a process to complete these services in a uniform and timely way. This partnership is the first step in addressing the need to complete more MTM services and to train existing and future practitioners so that they can provide services as well. The objective is to discuss the details of developing and implementing a patient care center while creating worthwhile learning experiences for student pharmacists.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="section2-0897190012451927">
         <title>Practice Site</title>
         <p>A patient care center describes a space in a pharmacy that is dedicated to clinical pharmacy practice. These areas are typically adjacent to the pharmacy, exist separate from the dispensing operations which make it is possible to close the door for private one-on-one consultations. At this time, patient care centers are primarily used to provide immunizations to patients. These areas furnish necessary space to expand clinical counseling services due to accessibility to medications and privacy.</p>
         <p>The identification of a pharmacy to serve as the patient care center for this project was the first step. The Kroger Company of Michigan has 104 pharmacies located throughout the state. It was important to select a site based on patient demographics and eligibility of pharmacy services, pharmacy layout, proximity to Wayne State University, and willingness of pharmacy staff to assist in efforts to develop clinical services.</p>
         <p>Many of the pharmacies in close proximity to Wayne State were remodeled with new private patient counseling areas adjacent to the pharmacy. After visiting several of these pharmacies, one location provided several advantages. In addition to having a new counseling area, the pharmacy in Roseville Michigan displayed a furnished conference room which could be used to hold group education classes for patients and pharmacy students. This location also served diverse groups of patients with different educational and income levels. These factors led to selection of the Roseville as the place to develop the patient care center.</p>
         <sec id="section3-0897190012451927">
            <title>Clinical Services</title>
            <p>After selecting the Roseville site the next step involved setting up baseline clinical services. It is expected that services performed in the patient care center enhance services already provided by staff pharmacists. Baseline services offered by staff pharmacists include patient counseling while dispensing prescriptions and providing immunizations.</p>
            <p>To expand visibility of the patient care center, screening events were provided throughout the first several months of opening the patient care center. Published guidelines recommend routine screening and identification of patients at risk of developing cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes mellitus.<sup>
                  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0897190012451927">10</xref>
               </sup> The clinical pharmacist provided blood sugar and blood pressure screenings to Kroger customers. The screenings were done in areas distant from the pharmacy to reach individuals that did not use baseline pharmacy services. High-traffic areas for pharmacy screening events included locations near the bread aisle and the meat service counter. During the first 2 months, 83 individuals participated in the screenings and 4 participants were identified with elevated blood sugar or blood pressure readings which required immediate medical attention. The clinical pharmacist captured participants’ personal contact information so that the patient care center could follow-up with them to ensure resolution of identified problems. Due to identification of medical problems during the screening process, 2 participants followed up with their primary health care provider, received new prescriptions, and utilized the Roseville Pharmacy for dispensing and counseling services.</p>
            <p>The clinical pharmacist utilized Outcomes Pharmaceutical<sup>®</sup> and Mirixa<sup>®</sup> to provide MTM services.<sup>
                  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0897190012451927">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0897190012451927">11</xref>
               </sup> Each system required adequate training in order to complete all documentation and billing functions accurately. Initially only 15 patients were eligible for services but the patient list grew as more patients became eligible for MTM care after each month. Outcomes Pharmaceutical allows pharmacists to complete a yearly comprehensive medication review as well as other services throughout the year.<sup>
                  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0897190012451927">4</xref>
               </sup> Mirixa allow pharmacists to maximize patient care opportunities by completing appointments in person or over the phone.<sup>
                  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0897190012451927">11</xref>
               </sup> During the first 2 months, 5 MTM appointments were completed. The clinical pharmacist worked to complete 27 MTM cases assigned to other Kroger pharmacies in the area. This helped to decrease the percentage of cases neglected and maximized reimbursement from MTM services.</p>
            <p>The Kroger Company contracted with its insurance carriers to provide biometric screenings to Kroger employees. The insurance companies reimbursed the pharmacy to provide the screening program. The Roseville site along with other pharmacies throughout the state was selected to provide this service. Biometrics screenings involved utilizing point of care devices to gather cholesterol, blood sugar, blood pressure, and body mass index information from participants. Kroger employees were incentivized to complete a biometric screening for the year and utilized a computer database to schedule appointments. Results required fasting blood levels so the clinical pharmacist called to remind participants to fast 12 hours before scheduled appointments. Biometric screenings were performed by the clinical pharmacist and pharmacy manager. Over the course of the first 2 months, 30 Kroger employees completed biometric screenings at the Roseville patient care center.</p>
            <p>In addition to providing biometric screening services, the patient care center served as a resource center for area staff pharmacists. Staff pharmacists interested in clinical services reached out to the clinical pharmacist for training and advice in regard to MTM services. Drug information questions and concerns were also funneled to the clinical pharmacist who formulated a response. The clinical pharmacist also provided off-site immunizations to patients served in underserved clinics and self-insured employer groups.</p>

         <title>Pharmacy Student Experience</title>
         <p>The Joint Commission of Pharmacy Practitioners (JCPPs) yielded a consensus vision for the future of pharmacy practice that encourages community-based education and training through use of community practice models and practitioner–educator relationships and collaborations.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0897190012451927">12</xref>
            </sup> A goal for the patient care center was to create worthwhile learning experiences for PharmD students at all levels of the pharmacy curriculum. The initial focus began with patient care experiences for P4 students.</p>
         <p>Wayne State University has a unique Advanced Pharmacy Practice Experience (APPE) program which allows students to choose between 3 tracks. Students can choose the Longitudinal Advanced Pharmacy Practice (L-APP) track which allows them to complete all APPEs at 1 hospital health system. Students can choose the Traditional Advanced Pharmacy Practice (T-APP) track which allows them to perform rotations at many different sites. They can also perform the Community Advanced Pharmacy Practice (C-APP) track which allows students to complete an 18-week experience with 1 community pharmacy chain. If a student selects the C-APP program, the remaining experiences are completed in the T-APP program. This system gives students the opportunity to complete an extended APPE experience at 1 practice site. It has been shown that PharmD students provide increased level of patient care when involved with longitudinal APPE experiences compared to traditional rotations.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0897190012451927">13</xref>
            </sup>
         </p>
         <p>After selecting the Roseville location, the clinical pharmacist recruited for the Kroger C-APP program. Students started their experiences in the patient care center 2 months after the Roseville site was selected. The students were highly interested in clinical community work and expressed they did not learn much about providing services in the community setting during their didactic training. The focus included learning the Mirixa and Outcomes Pharmaceutical systems.</p>
         <p>Throughout the course of 18 weeks, 2 students performed 21 MTM consultations, 11 biometric screenings, and 38 glucose and blood pressure screenings under the direction of the clinical pharmacists. The students also made 21 patient recommendations and wrote 12 physician recommendations. The PharmD students developed medication action plans (MAPs) and used them to counsel patients. The nature of the C-APP program allowed students to follow-up with MTM patients to ensure adherence to recommendations. Students also had the opportunity to follow-up with prescribers by writing and faxing subjective, objective, assessment and plan (SOAP) notes describing the patient encounters.</p>

      <sec id="section5-0897190012451927">
         <title>Discussion</title>
         <p>Throughout the course of developing and implementing the patient care center, the clinical pharmacist ran into many challenges which created learning opportunities. Challenges included recruiting support from staff pharmacists and creating streams of revenue from clinical services.</p>
         <p>The willingness of pharmacy staff to help build the clinical branch of the pharmacy is essential. They are more familiar with the patients that visit the pharmacy and can identify patients that may need additional services due to drug therapy complications. In order to gain buy in from pharmacy staff, the clinical pharmacist must clearly explain the goals and objectives of the new pharmacy ventures. Pharmacy staff may also inquire about their involvement in clinical services offered to patients. The literature reports instances where pharmacists are excited but apprehensive to providing clinical pharmacy services in the community.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0897190012451927">6</xref>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0897190012451927"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0897190012451927">8</xref>
            </sup> It is important to share expertise and skills with staff pharmacists, so that they are comfortable providing advanced care in the community.</p>
         <p>There are many studies that document the benefit of clinical pharmacy services but reimbursement is still lacking.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0897190012451927">5</xref>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0897190012451927"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0897190012451927">7</xref>
            </sup> It takes many resources to develop and implement clinical services although reimbursement recovered from insurance companies and patients may not cover all expenses. Due to the lack of training, experience, and a process, Kroger pharmacists utilized 3 hours to complete 1 MTM case and reimbursement did not compensate for pharmacists' time. Pharmacies also are suffering from decreased revenue from product dispensing.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0897190012451927">14</xref>
            </sup> Decreasing revenue sparks interest in new initiatives and streams of revenue from pharmacy services. Recently, a few insurers increased reimbursement rates to address inadequate compensation for MTM services. In 2011, Mirixa increased their reimbursement from $60 to $120 for face-to-face appointments, while some plans contracted with Outcomes Pharmaceutical increased comprehensive medication review reimbursement from $50 to $75 beginning in 2012.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0897190012451927">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0897190012451927">11</xref>
            </sup> These modifications are helping to increase financial stability of MTM services at the patient care center. Future plans that may help enhance financial stability of these services include creating a process to conduct MTM services more efficiently, training pharmacists and students on how to provide these services, and piloting new services.</p>
