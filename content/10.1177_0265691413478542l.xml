<p>Contemporaneity ‘is the perception, shared by a number of human beings, of experiencing a particular event at more or less the same time’ (2). As this volume convincingly demonstrates, contemporaneity has a history dating back to the early modern period, when this perception joined individuals into ‘imagined communities’, tied together by a shared awareness of living the same ‘present’; the same ‘history’. The 13 essays of this collection, organized in four sections, plus an insightful introduction and a brief epilogue by the editor, thus aim to answer the crucial question of how people conceived of and constructed their present.</p>
<p>The first part concerns different transmission mechanisms and media ranging from letters and handwritten news-sheets to printed newspapers. Borreguero Beltran illustrates the communications infrastructures through which thousands of letters were gathered from all over the empire of Phillip II to create a ‘spider’s web’ of information essential to governing his state. Yet information was not only a governmental tool but also a commodity. As Infelise shows in his chapter, a rapidly growing news-market originated at the end of the fifteenth century, taking the material form of handwritten news-sheets. Production and commerce of newsletters were established on a network of relationships which connected Italy and Europe. Early printed gazettes were based on the same networks of information and on handwritten sources, as demonstrated by Weber’s essay on the origins of the early periodical <italic>German Newspaper</italic> (1605). The step from script to print cemented two characteristics of modern media: <italic>periodicity</italic> and <italic>accessibility</italic> to a large and undefined audience.</p>
<p>In the second part, four essays examine structures and networks joining time and space across Europe. In a fine essay, Dooley explores the Medici information network between the late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries, focusing on the fascinating figure of Giovanni de’Medici. Witness to crucial events like the failure of the Spanish Armada (1588) and the siege of Ostend (1602), this princely informer tried to make the Grand Duke present in the theatre of action, to share the moment with him, and to create a community beyond the Tuscan court. Maier and Vaugh analyse the circulation of hand-written and printed news regarding the false Messiah Sabbatai Sevi, which, stemming from Russia, reached Europe in 1665–67. News was disseminated through various channels (Jewish correspondence networks and Christian traders or diplomats), media (newsletters, pamphlets, newspapers), and languages (Hebrew and European idioms). The religious and commercial effect of this news on Christians and Jews reinforced both groups’ own sense of community.</p>
<p>Under the heading ‘Inter-European Spaces and Moments’, the third section offers four comparative case studies. Barbarics-Hermanik’s study of eight Central and South-Eastern European collections of handwritten newsletters shows how these regions were part of the cultural and information networks that connected the rest of Europe. Blome’s comparative survey of offices of intelligence illustrates how they fostered information exchange. As the political press expanded the mental horizon of the educated reader, the Offices of Intelligence did the same for everybody else, joining individuals into an ‘imagined community based on the principle of contemporaneity of everyday life and labour’ (222). Two essays surveying new methods and techniques to further this field of research close the collection. Brownlees employs media discourse analysis on English pre-Civil War corantos and newsbooks of the Civil War; Hardie, McEnery and Piao apply techniques from the corpus linguistic to study newsbooks.</p>
<p>A valuable aspect of the volume is the comparative dimension which draws attention to the cross-boundary transmission and reception of news. This approach also allows for the identification of some general pan-European trends. In particular, there emerges a common view that the standardization of printed news was both economically beneficial for professionals in information and politically beneficial for authorities. Printed newspapers were more easily controlled and ‘became an extraordinary means to shepherd and control the opinions of the subjects’ (67). This process is illustrated by Schultheiß-Heinz’s essay which compares three different types of <italic>Gazette</italic> in Paris, London and Nuremberg, all used by their publishers as organs ‘for legitimizing their governments’ policies’ (135).</p>
<p>This collection correctly highlights that in early modern Europe news was not disseminated only by print – a mistaken assumption which still dominates some histories of journalism adhering to the so-called ‘paradigm of modernization’. Rather, news continued to flow in manuscript well into the age of published newspapers. Histories of communication have deconstructed the equation ‘news equals print’ and printed news dissemination is now viewed in relation to handwritten transmission. Recent threads of research have also started to pay closer attention to oral divulgation of information; and precisely this importance of orality emerges in many contributions to this volume as one of the vectors of contemporaneity. In the book we find a visual representation of this phenomenon: an engraving by Giuseppe Maria Mitelli dedicated to ‘those who are passionate about the wars’ (1690), which represents a gathering of people talking about and commenting on a printed or manuscript news-sheet. Mitelli’s image ‘illustrates not just the origin and spread of news but the origin and spread of rumor’ (2); it also suggestively epitomizes the interaction of orality, print and manuscript in the circulation of news.</p>
<p>Despite some editorial inaccuracies (e.g. the actual distribution of the essays among the sections does not correspond to that described in the introduction), and the focus of some authors primarily on the dissemination of news rather than engaging with the issue of contemporaneity, taken as a whole, the collection provides an insightful analysis of this important theme and adds a new dimension to the research on media history. Nowadays the speed with which news circulates across time and space makes all humankind aware that we are part of a global community and that we all share a common present in ‘real time’ – one of the main achievements of this book is to remind us that it has not always been that way.</p>
