<p>Welcome to this month’s issue of the <italic>British Journal of Visual Impairment</italic>. As you will see from this issue, there is a very international feel to it with contributors from Canada, Uganda, the United Kingdom, and Egypt. The international interest that the journal is receiving is very interesting and encouraging. Not only do we discover what is happening in different countries, we can also take from these international articles, the research, ideas, and concepts and perhaps place the research into our own context and try to make the unfamiliar, familiar. By exploring what is happening around the world, we can utilise and share the experiences and research to develop our own understanding, which hopefully can inform our own research proposals and therefore increase the profile and the development of those researching in the (broad) field of visual impairment (VI).</p>
<p>Without doubt, the demand on low vision services is increasing, and we certainly see this within the United Kingdom, as well as within other countries, so it is important to evaluate and to understand how these vital services can respond to this growing demand and to approach support and help in different ways. The first article in this issue by Parkes et al. does exactly this. It looks at evaluating the feasibility of using telephone triage to assess the need for, and timing of, low vision follow-up appointments. With a total of 56 participants (36 completing all aspects of the study), some important results were found. Parkes et al. confirmed that a number of users of their service could be dealt with immediately and appropriately over the phone and did not require a follow-up clinic. What is interesting is that by using this simple method of calling, prompt follow-ups could be identified earlier and therefore as a whole, the service user (in this case, 32% of the participants) was getting better support than the previous system allowed. What I found really interesting within this article, and it is something that I did not expect when reading it, was the finding that while it was a limitation of the study, the authors did not estimate the prevalence of hearing impairment sufficient for exclusion from a telephone review, but that many of these patients with hearing impairment were able to deal with communication rather better over the telephone than when face to face, with the option of the ‘t-switch’ on their hearing aids, and thus they report that the telephone review also provides an opportunity for reducing the burden of hospital or community clinic visits that can otherwise be problematic for elderly relatives struggling with mobility and transport issues. Perhaps then, other low vision services should look at this article to do further work, and perhaps this could be seen as a start of embedding as a national process within such services.</p>
<p>Our second article provides us with a very interesting qualitative study of people who are receiving treatment for wet age-related macular degeneration (AMD) with ranibizumab. Again, we can see how an ever-increasing population is having an effect on health services, and although the medical model of support for people is getting better and better with each passing year, what can be neglected is the patients’ own views of the support/interventions they are receiving. The article by Thetford, Hodge, Harding, Taylor and Knox tries to readdress this by building on the work previously published by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0264619613489233">Beasley (2011)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0264619613489233">Tailor, Beasley, Yang and Narendran (2011)</xref>. They do this by using the Biographical Narrative Interpretive Method at two interval points to explore the expectations and experiences of people receiving AMD treatment. Rather than detail some of the findings here, I strongly recommend that one reads the article to hear the views of the participants as the study covers such areas from fear and anxiety to side effects to service delivery. The article finishes strongly with a series of recommendations that are broadly based around issues of communication and interaction with the health professional, which hopefully are taken up elsewhere.</p>
<p>Thurston, McLeod and Thurston give us a Hermeneutic Single Case Efficacy Design to investigate the effectiveness of counselling Silvia (aged 70 years) who had experienced an aneurysm lying on the optic nerve and after the operation to stabilise the aneurysm was left with no useful sight. The quoted transcripts of the sessions that are reported in the article are very interesting indeed and provide a detailed insight into the issues and thoughts of this person as she comes to terms with her sight loss and her associated fears and anxieties about this. As within the previous article, there are some interesting implications for practice that seem to result in a more positive attitude for Silvia within six sessions. I have to agree with Thurston that one of the interesting findings from this is the perception of Silvia about her counsellor who is registered blind, and this helped Silvia come to terms with her condition and develop a positive relationship with her counsellor. I very much liked the fact that Silvia was given a chance to comment on a draft version of the article, and these comments have been reported; this type of involvement of the participant especially on an article using this type of methodology is very much supported, and I look forward to seeing more of this.</p>
<p>Mobility and orientation is a common theme within this journal, and I am very pleased to have been able to publish an article by Fryer, Freeman, and Pring on a study comparing verbal descriptions of familiar routes recalled by sighted, partially sighted, and blind participants, which highlight differences in navigation strategies. This article actually sets the scene quite nicely for the Special Issue in January next year as Museums, Galleries, and Heritage sites are becoming visited more by people with sight loss, and the journal has already received several articles about access to the arts for blind and visually impaired people. Therefore, this article is timely in many ways. However, I did take note of the strong finding in this article about the differences in the way sighted participants and those with impaired vision reported landmarks – the difference being that landmarks and milestones were reported multimodally by blind and partially sighted participants, whereas the sighted participants reported unimodal information. Clearly, this alone (and there are many other interesting findings in the article) has very real implications for improving the type of verbal information provided to assist blind or partially sighted people.</p>
<p>As an editor of the journal, I am always pleased when a research article about deafblindness gets accepted for publication. In this issue, the article by Côté, Dubé, St-Onge, and Beauregard is no exception. The aim of this article is to investigate a group intervention programme, which is centred on managing personal goals for the eight participants who took part. (I did see that 14 participants were approached, which I thought was for deafblindness a good sample to draw upon.) What particularly interested me in this article is that the researchers took two standard measures of psychological well-being that I am familiar with, the ‘Meaning of Life’ subscale of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0264619613489233">Ryff’s (1989)</xref> Psychological Well-Being Scales, and the short version of the Serenity Scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0264619613489233">Roberts &amp; Aspy, 1993</xref>) and applied it to deafblind participants, which did change through the intervention. As a psychologist, I think quite a lot about what measures to use in my or my student’s research, and I see a lot of research developing or enhancing various quality-of-life scores, and it will be interesting to see this come through the journal in the next few years.</p>
<p>Our next article from Egypt addresses again psychological concepts where Amer investigates problem-solving orientation and attributional style as predictors of depressive symptoms in Egyptian adolescents with VI. With a participant sample of 91 adolescents aged from 12 to 17 years again using four standardised psychological instruments, the results (through regression analyses) showed that gender, negative general attributions, and negative problem-solving orientation were the strongest predictors of depressive symptoms in adolescents with VI, whereas negative internal attributions and avoidant problem-solving orientation were weak predictors. I think the author is quite right to stress the importance of gender in the results of the study and that this adds to the body of knowledge that is growing around the cognitive diathesis model of depression. A very interesting study.</p>
<p>Our final geographical journey of the VI world ends in a nice article that details the experiences of 12 teachers, who are visually impaired, and six sighted teachers in using audio-described education video materials. The research is set in Uganda, but what I really liked about this particular article is how relevant it is to all of us. The views expressed by the teachers regarding the materials really hit home. I am currently doing some work with audio description theatre presenters, and I have really begun to understand how difficult and what a complex art it is to do well, and this is born out in the views of these Ugandan teachers. This article not only has international appeal, but I think, it raises some important issues for teachers and student teachers and their students who rely on audio-transcribed education materials.</p>
