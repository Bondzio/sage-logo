<p>This interesting reflective piece combines political science and management thinking into an assessment of a key Presidential transition. The authors have used previous literature to create a useful framework for assessing leadership transition, in the special case of a U.S. President. Their assessment criteria includes (a) Nimble Governance, which involves prioritizing policy and program priorities to pursue, avoiding political mistakes, maneuvering successfully, and persuading and appeasing and (b) Shrewd Implementation, which includes announcing desired policies and programs early, lobbying desired policies and programs energetically, enacting priority policies and programs swiftly, and executing policies and programs boldly.</p>
<p>As it’s the U.S. Presidency, there are special characteristics to the transition, such as a 4-year term cycle, a large staffing component, various political issues, critical legislative agendas, and the fact that the transition follows a period of campaigning, promises, and often electoral mandates. In this analysis, for Bill Clinton’s inaugural year, the outcomes were not positive based on the framework. Yet, he was reelected and ended with a generally successful Presidency, suggesting that, while important, the transition can be overcome by other factors or that some other factors might outweigh or dominate ultimate success. However, the criteria for a successful transition are sound and could make or break some Presidencies.</p>
<p>It’s also interesting to consider how this framework might inform other high leadership transitions such as that of CEO’s. Although many of the characteristics are different, some similar conditions could exist. There could be opponents for the position (an opposition party), there could be strategic priorities to sell and implement, there can certainly be critical staff positions to fill, sometimes there is the need for public trust and support, and there can be political dynamics to navigate. So, the use of Nimble Governance and Shrewd Implementation criteria might be useful for any transitioning leader planning his or her first 90 days or 6 months.</p>
