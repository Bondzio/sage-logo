<body>
<p>Dear Editor:</p>
<p>This letter is in response to the editorial, “An Unanticipated Journey: Barriers to Effective Gun Control in the United States” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1078390313481671">Stein, 2013</xref>). Dr. Stein’s editorial about effective gun control saddens me as a nurse, a citizen, and National Rifle Association member. I specifically want to comment about her tone and assumptions in the editorial. All nursing education includes teaching about diversity, but her comments are not embracing of other thoughtful views. Dr. Stein asks for psychiatric nurses to become a force for change and advocate for gun control. I think we have a moral responsibility to advocate against gun control, and in this response I advocate for all nurses’ constitutional rights.</p>
<p>Dr. Stein may see no role for guns in her society. I suppose if an intruder comes into her home she has the right to call 911 and hide until the police come, but some of us know that response times are long or live in the country were law enforcement is miles away.</p>
<p>I really don’t think I should have to educate nurses on the Bill of Rights, but if so, I will. The Bill of Rights is a testament to God-given rights. The second amendment is the right to keep and bear arms. This is for personal safety and because a well-armed citizen can be a deterrent to unjust laws and government (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1078390313481671">The Charters of Freedom, 2013</xref>).</p>
<p>We can debate how limiting the government can be within our rights, and of course, I don’t think I need a machine gun (which is illegal) for protection, but think of this, do you want to limit first amendment rights and have the government tell you what is lawful speech. That’s right, the government class is trying to do this with political correctness, but some of us are putting up a good fight. OK, do you want the government to limit your religious views; I know the government is doing that now with the Catholic Church and birth control/abortifacient mandates but this will be found unconstitutional (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1078390313481671">United States Conference of Catholic Bishops, 2013</xref>).</p>
<p>Back to gun control. I am aware of patients who carry firearms, not legally, but because they live in rough neighborhoods and feel the need for protection. How is gun control going to stop them? If there is gun control, the only people with guns will be people who carry illegally, which they already do (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1078390313481671">Pendley, 2012</xref>). Do any of you know the Colorado shooter could have gone into a theatre much closer to his home, but he went out of his way to the only theatre that had a posted no weapons policy. It would be illegal to carry in that theatre, and so no law-abiding citizens had firearm that could have changed the outcome of that shooting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1078390313481671">Lott, 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>Dr. Stein is also concerned about the effects of children and exposure to guns. In all things there is healthy and unhealthy role modeling. When it comes to speech, calorie intake, smoking, alcohol consumption, and handling firearms, the parent should be aware of the effects on the children. Some parents are going to do this better than others; I certainly don’t want this legislated.</p>
<p>Here are my thoughts about gun violence.</p>
<list id="list1-1078390313481671" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>The government should not infringe on the second amendment but enforce existing gun laws to the strictest sentencing.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>We as psychiatric nurse professionals should speak out about safe gun use in the mentally ill.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>I don’t believe there should be a medical registry of mentally ill persons who should not be able to legally purchase firearm, because again, if outlawed, someone who wants a firearm will purchase it illegally.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Let’s work to change mental health funding to reach the most seriously ill. These are the people who are shooting our children. Right now National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI) is advocating increased federal funds for housing, medications, employment, and peer support. They are trying to advocate for the truly mentally ill (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1078390313481671">NAMI, 2013</xref>). Instead, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), the federal government agency for federal mental health funding is more focused on substance abuse. The website front topics are smoking, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, buprenorphine, and peer storytelling. The government should change the shift from substance abuse and allocate more funding for the seriously mentally ill who are short changed in this process. The recent shooters seem to have evidence of psychosis not addictions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1078390313481671">SAMSHA, 2013</xref>).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>We should as professionals educate patients who suffer from mental illness with delusional, angry, and homicidal ideation not to have firearms. Just as I tell a hunter who is suicidal to give his rifles to family or a friend for safety until he is healthy, I encourage a client with homicidal ideation to do the same.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Dr. Stein may live in a world very different than mine and see the world in a different way, but I won’t allow our profession and organizations to advocate for the loss of constitutional rights because of recent tragedies that involved gun use. We are smarter than this, and we can help shape legislation and how government funds are appropriated; we can be good clinicians and educators without losing our rights and responsibilities.</p>
