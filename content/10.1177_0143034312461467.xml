<abstract>
<p>Aggressive behaviors in schools and bullying behaviors amongst children are a serious problem in the school context. As a consequence of an aggressive atmosphere in the classroom, learning processes are disturbed and children are less likely to experience pleasure when attending school. Teachers face a big challenge as a result. As we know from previous research, teachers have different possibilities when handling incidents of aggressive behaviors and bullying in their classrooms. The present study sought to examine correlates (e.g. attitudes toward aggression) of ways of handling bullying in German teachers. Factor analysis indicated a two-factor solution with respect to ways of handling bullying (Factor 1: <italic>Ignoring vs</italic>. <italic>Taking Action</italic>, Factor 2: <italic>Attribution of Responsibility</italic>) and it was demonstrated that attitudes toward aggression and beliefs about the changeability of aggressive behaviors are correlates of the different strategies that teachers use. The implications for the school context and for teacher preparation are discussed.</p>

<body>
<p>Many parents, educators, or politicians recognize a significant increase in the number of problems with aggressive and externalizing behaviors in schools during the last few years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0143034312461467">Finze, 2007</xref>). According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0143034312461467">Olweus (1994)</xref> physically aggressive acts, verbal diminutions, and ostracizing can be subsumed under the label bullying behaviors. An aggressive behavior is termed bullying when the aggressive behavior is shown repeatedly over a long period of time and when an imbalance of power occurs between victim and bully. Research on bullying is not nationally limited, but it is a topic of international interest as many studies conducted in different countries demonstrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0143034312461467">McEachern, Kenny, Blake, &amp; Aluede, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0143034312461467">Pugh &amp; Chitiyo, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0143034312461467">Smith et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0143034312461467">Srabstein &amp; Leventhal, 2010</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0143034312461467">Dake, Price, and Telljohann (2003)</xref> compiled results on the prevalence rates of bullying behaviors from different studies that were conducted in various countries such as Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Canada, the USA, and others. They outlined an incidence varying from 11.3% in Finland to 49.8% in Ireland. For the USA, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0143034312461467">Pellegrini, Bartini, and Brooks (2001)</xref> reported a prevalence of 19% for elementary school children. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0143034312461467">Nansel et al. (2001)</xref> reported that nearly 30% of the adolescents in the USA are involved in bullying (13% as bullies, 10.6% as victims, and 6.3% as bully/victims). Approximately 12.7% of all children attending the fourth grade of German elementary schools were involved in aggressive acts at some time during the prior four weeks, according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0143034312461467">Baier, Pfeiffer, Simonson, Rabold, and Kappes (2010)</xref>. This is a quite impressive number as it comprises only children who <italic>hit</italic> or <italic>slapped</italic> another child; thus, all children involved in aggressive actions as victims are not included in this number. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0143034312461467">Von Marées and Petermann (2012a)</xref> assessed bullying among 550 children in German elementary schools and reported that 10% could be classified as bullies, 17.4% as victims, and 16.5% as bully/victims.</p>
<p>In previous research it has repeatedly been shown that bullying has many negative effects, such as poor health condition, physical symptoms like headaches and stomach problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0143034312461467">Bond, Carlin, Thomas, Rubin, &amp; Patton, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0143034312461467">Forero, McLellan, Rissel, &amp; Bauman, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0143034312461467">Rigby, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0143034312461467">Williams, Chambers, Logan, &amp; Robinson, 1996</xref>). Consequently, it is an important task for school personnel and communities to handle these bullying behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0143034312461467">Buckman, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0143034312461467">Fayne &amp; Matthews, 2010</xref>). Also in recent publications it has been argued that bullying phenomena require our full consideration and that it is important to develop preventive approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0143034312461467">Sairanen &amp; Pfeffer, 2011</xref>). Today, a broad repertoire of preventive approaches has emerged in the educational field, but not all programs are equally effective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0143034312461467">Gollwitzer, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0143034312461467">Smith, Schneider, Smith, &amp; Ananiadou, 2004</xref>). Preventive approaches and anti-bullying efforts require holistic approaches that also include children, parents, and teachers. As the present contribution puts a strong focus on the school context, the importance of teachers’ reactions to bullying will be outlined. The teacher, as the leader of the class, is responsible for maintaining a productive and positive environment in the class that enables the children to learn and to cooperate. From current research we know that teachers handle bullying in various ways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0143034312461467">Bauman, Rigby, &amp; Hoppa, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0143034312461467">Sairanen &amp; Pfeffer, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0143034312461467">Yoon, Bauman, Choi, &amp; Hutchinson, 2011</xref>). The teacher can implement basic techniques of classroom management to reduce the likelihood of bullying behaviors in the classroom before such behaviors occur (e.g. setting up rules, effectively organizing groups, managing misbehavior, and monitoring class events; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0143034312461467">Allen, 2010</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0143034312461467">Rigby (2003)</xref> developed a staff questionnaire to assess different ways to handle bullying. In his questionnaire he distinguishes five different possibilities. The measure assesses the extent to which: (a) the teacher ascribes responsibility to the victim; (b) the teacher ascribes responsibility to the bully; (c) the teacher ignores bullying; (d) the teacher tries to solve the problem of bullying proactively; and (e) the teacher minimizes the impact of cases of bullying and considers that they need not to be taken too seriously. Some of these strategies can be termed as more adaptive and functional than others (e.g. proactively trying to solve the problem of bullying). Knowing which strategies teachers use can help to develop better bullying prevention programs and it can help to avoid negative consequences for victims and bullies. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0143034312461467">Jacobson (2007)</xref> four different strategies with regard to actively solving bullying incidents in the school context are available for the teacher. The author distinguishes punitive strategies, information based strategies, skills mastery, and incentive strategies.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0143034312461467">Buckman (2011)</xref> compared secondary students’ and teachers’ perceptions of bullying prevention practices and demonstrated that the two groups of participants perceived the efforts differently. Students thought that class rules and the intervention of bystanders were most important, whereas teachers put more emphasis on class discussions. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0143034312461467">Espelage and Swearer (2008)</xref> noted that it is important that teachers are appropriately trained in order to identify bullying behaviors and to confidently deal with those behaviors. Moreover, the authors stated that teachers’ reactions may depend on their attitudes and personal characteristics. The major goal of the present contribution was to investigate the connections between teachers’ strategies to handle bullying in their classrooms and their individual characteristics to outline recommendations for school psychologists, teachers, and counselors working in schools.</p>
<p>As has already been outlined, the teacher is a person with a high level of responsibility in the classroom. Therefore, it is important to know which individual characteristics of teachers influence their ways of handling bullying. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0143034312461467">Byers, Caltabiano, and Caltabiano (2011)</xref> have also argued that it is important to look more closely at the teachers, because their individual characteristics might influence their responses in bullying cases. Moreover, reactions to actual bullying behaviors play a pivotal role for future bullying behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0143034312461467">De Wet, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0143034312461467">Yoon &amp; Kerber, 2003</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0143034312461467">Mishna, Scarcello, Pepler, and Wiener (2005)</xref> found that the way in which teachers interpreted a bullying incident was important for future bullying behaviors (e.g. as bullying or as normal childhood behavior). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0143034312461467">Sairanen and Pfeffer (2011)</xref> comment on the role of the teacher in a similar direction and they argue that attitudes and beliefs of teachers have an impact on the extent of bullying problems in the classroom. A belief of major importance may be the conviction that aggressive behaviors or bullying behaviors can either be changed or that they are stable over a long period of time. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0143034312461467">Boxer and Tisak (2005)</xref> conducted a study in which they measured children’s continuity beliefs. The authors hypothesized that the view of aggressive behaviors as either trait- or state-like might relate to the way in which interactions with aggressive peers are arranged. The same might be true for teachers and for that reason the correlation between strategies to handle bullying behaviors and beliefs about the changeability of aggressive behaviors was analysed in the present study. If a teacher assumes that bullying is the result of a stable trait-like disposition the teacher might be less motivated to use active problem solving strategies in cases of bullying or might be motivated to ascribe greater responsibility to either bully or victim.</p>
<p>From social psychological research we know that attitudes toward a certain construct or topic can shape people’s reactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0143034312461467">Kraus, 1995</xref>). Therefore, the correlation between attitudes toward aggression and strategies to handle bullying phenomena will also be a focus of the present contribution. Moreover, previous research with children highlighted that normative beliefs may affect emotional reactions to others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0143034312461467">Huesmann &amp; Guerra, 1997</xref>). Therefore, it was decided to assess teachers’ normative beliefs toward aggression in the present study.</p>

<sec id="sec2-0143034312461467"><title>Goals of the present contribution</title>
<p>The major goal of the present contribution was to investigate correlations of teachers’ strategies to handle bullying in their classrooms with their attitudes toward aggression, their normative beliefs, and their beliefs about the changeability of aggressive behaviors. It was hypothesized that teachers’ ways of handling bullying incidents in their classrooms would be correlated with their individual characteristics. Before we started to analyse the correlations between the constructs of interest, the factorial structure of the handling bullying questionnaire (HBQ; Rigby, 2003) was determined.</p>

<sec id="sec3-0143034312461467" sec-type="methods"><title>Method</title>
<p>An online questionnaire study was designed to gain an insight into teachers’ ways of handling bullying. In the same online questionnaire, we asked about prevention methods that are used in the schools and how these methods are evaluated. These results are presented in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0143034312461467">Grumm, Hein, and Fingerle (in press)</xref>.</p>
<sec id="sec4-0143034312461467"><title>Sample</title>
<p>A sample of 107 persons working in 85 different German schools participated in the study. For 97 persons we had complete datasets. The participants worked at the following school types: 89 persons worked at an elementary school, four persons were employed at a school for children with learning difficulties, and three worked at another school type (one person gave no information). The mean age of the participants was 43.97 years. The youngest participant was 26 years old and the oldest was 62 years old. Altogether 83 female and 13 male persons participated in the study; one person did not indicate their gender.</p>

<sec id="sec6-0143034312461467"><title>Attitudes toward aggression</title>
<p>To assess the teachers’ attitudes toward aggression we used a seven-point semantic differential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0143034312461467">Osgood, Suci, &amp; Tannenbaum, 1957</xref>) with three bipolar pairs of adjectives. The adjective pairs were the following: Effective vs. ineffective, harmless vs. dangerous and uncool vs. cool. The teachers indicated their attitude toward aggression on the seven-point scale between the adjective pairs. All answers were coded such that a higher value indicated a more negative attitude toward aggression.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec7-0143034312461467"><title>Normative beliefs about aggression</title>
<p>Teachers’ normative beliefs about aggression were measured with an adapted version of the Normative Beliefs about Aggression Scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0143034312461467">Huesmann &amp; Guerra, 1997</xref>). We only used the subscale ‘general beliefs about aggression’, which comprised eight items that had to be answered on a four-point Likertscale from 1 (No) to 4 (Yes).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec8-0143034312461467"><title>Beliefs about the changeability of aggression</title>
<p>Two stimulus vignettes (one male and one female) were used to assess teachers’ continuity beliefs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0143034312461467">Boxer &amp; Tisak, 2005</xref>). In the stimulus vignettes a child in elementary school age was described who displayed physically and verbally aggressive actions. Afterwards the teachers had to answer one question concerning the changeability of such behaviors. The answer had to be given on a four-point Likertscale from 1 (Clearly No) to 4 (Clearly Yes). As an indicator of the perceived changeability of aggressive behaviors the sum score of the two single answers was computed.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec9-0143034312461467"><title>Handling bullying strategies</title>
<p>All teachers completed the Handling Bullying Questionnaire (HBQ) developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0143034312461467">Rigby (2003)</xref>. We used the questionnaire in a version with 20 items. The questionnaire assesses five different strategies to handle bullying incidents (ascribing responsibility to the victim, ascribing responsibility to the bully, ignoring bullying, a smoothing approach, and problem solving). The items had to be answered on five-point Likert scales from 1 (I definitely would not) to 5 (I definitely would).</p>

<sec id="sec10-0143034312461467" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title>
<sec id="sec11-0143034312461467"><title>Factorial structure of the HBQ</title>
<p>In a first step, we analysed whether the factorial structure of the questionnaire that had been obtained in American samples would be replicable with the German sample. Therefore, we conducted a confirmatory factor analysis with the software Mplus (Version 6.11; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0143034312461467">Muthén &amp; Muthén, 2011</xref>) using a maximum likelihood estimation method. According to recommendations by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0143034312461467">Hu and Bentler (1998)</xref>, the values that we obtained for the goodness of fit indices were not satisfied; they indicated that the five-factor structure did not fit to our data: χ2 (160) = 373.62, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01, RMSEA = 0.113, 90%-CI = [0.098–0.128], CFI = 0.613, TLI = 0.540, SRMR = 0.103.</p>
<p>As the hypothesized model did not fit our data well we conducted an exploratory factor analysis (principle axis factor analysis using Varimax rotation) as the next step. The first analysis indicated that a five-factor solution did not fit the data well and did thus replicate the results of the confirmatory factor analysis; the emerging five factors could not be interpreted. According to the scree test criterion it was decided to use a forced two-factor solution in the next step. The values indicated that the first factor explained 15.67% of variance and that the second factor explained 9.65% of variance. Four items that did not clearly load on either factor were eliminated from further analyses. The factor loadings are displayed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0143034312461467">Table 1</xref>. The first factor was labelled as ‘Ignoring vs. taking action’ (11 items) and the second factor was labelled ‘Attribution of responsibility’ (6 items).

<p>To examine the main question of the present investigation, we computed correlations to determine the relationships between teachers’ strategies to handle bullying incidents and the teachers’ individual characteristics. We found a significant relation between the tendency to take action in an incident of bullying and the attitude toward aggression. The correlation was positive and statistically significant, <italic>r</italic> = 0.28, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01. The perceived changeability of aggressive behaviors as well as the normative beliefs of the teachers about the appropriateness of aggressive behaviors was not related to their tendency to take action in case of bullying.</p>
<p>With regard to the correlation between the individual perception of changeability of aggressive behaviors and the tendency to attribute responsibility in an incident of bullying we found a significant correlation in our sample, <italic>r </italic>= −0.20, <italic>p </italic>= 0.05. Attitudes toward aggression as well as the normative beliefs of the teachers were not related to their tendency to attribute responsibility to the children involved in bullying.</p>

<sec id="sec14-0143034312461467" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title>
<p>In the present study we analysed the ways in which teachers handle bullying incidents in their classrooms and the relations of these behaviors with attitudes toward aggressive behaviors, the perceived changeability of aggressive behaviors, and normative beliefs about aggression. We were able to demonstrate that the German version of the Handling Bullying Questionnaire has a different structure than the American one. In our sample we found two factors of handling bullying strategies that we labelled Ignoring vs. taking action and Attributing responsibility to the children involved in bullying incidents. Another study with Korean teachers has already demonstrated that the American five-factor structure was not applicable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0143034312461467">Yoon, Bauman, Choi, &amp; Hutchinson, 2011</xref>). In their study the authors also determined a two-factor structure. They labelled their factors as ‘Action’ and ‘Ignoring’. Thus, it seems that the Handling Bullying Questionnaire may have a different factor structure in different countries. This might be a consequence of population differences or cultural differences in the interpretation of the items. But we could also imagine that this is a consequence of different strategies to handle bullying behaviors as the differing prevalence rates in various countries indicate. The evidence that our solution does not completely conform to the Korean one might be a consequence of the different versions of the HBQ that were used throughout the two studies. In our study we employed the 20-item version, which is available on the Internet, whereas Yoon et al. used the 22-item version that was published by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0143034312461467">Bauman et al. (2008)</xref>. These two versions do slightly differ in regard to single items. However, our two-factor structure displays clearly the strategies that German teachers use to handle bullying incidents. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0143034312461467">Yoon et al. (2011)</xref> argue that we may find cultural differences due to cultural norms relating to competition, self-sufficiency, and individualism.</p>
<p>Teachers have a great deal of contact with children throughout the day and often act as role models and educators. Consequently, it can be claimed that the way in which a teacher reacts in cases of bullying is very important. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0143034312461467">Olweus (1993)</xref>, it is important that the teacher shows that bullying behaviors are not tolerated and that measures will be taken if bullying occurs. The two factors that we found reflect two different strategies. One that is more adaptive — acting vs. ignoring and one rather less adaptive — ascribing responsibility to either the victim or the bully. If a teacher would focus primarily on ascribing responsibility it is hardly imaginable that he or she will be able to create a positive and cooperative classroom environment and thus prevent future bullying. If, however, a teacher uses proactive problem solving approaches in cases of bullying behavior in the classroom then pupils will recognize this and it helps to restore a positive and cooperative classroom environment.</p>
<p>In the present study we were able to show that individual attitudes toward aggression are a correlate of the tendency to take action in case of bullying. The correlation demonstrates that teachers who hold more negative attitudes toward aggression are the ones who tend to react more actively. This correlation highlights that it might be fruitful to take individual teacher characteristics into account when trying to improve ways to handle bullying incidents in the classroom. It can be helpful to support negative attitudes towards aggression and to help teachers to critically reflect positive or neutral attitudes towards aggression. Moreover, we found a significant negative relation of teachers’ beliefs about the changeability of aggressive behaviors and their tendency to ascribe responsibility to victims or bullies. This correlation outlines that it is important to know what teachers think about the stability of aggressive behaviors in school aged children. If teachers sincerely believe that aggressive behaviors are stable over time and across various situations they are more likely to ascribe responsibility to the bully or the victim. However, if teachers are convinced that aggressive behaviors can be changed they ascribe less responsibility. Surprisingly, we found no relation of beliefs about changeability of aggressive behaviors and the tendency to take problem-solving actions in case of bullying. This result needs to be replicated in further studies.</p>
<p>A limitation of the present contribution might be the sample size. A larger sample would be desirable to draw more reliable conclusions. In addition, men and women were not equally distributed in the sample. This biased distribution is a consequence of the population of teachers at German elementary schools. In future studies it would be useful to study more male teachers in order to analyse gender differences.</p>
<p>The findings of the present study can be used in the discussion of preventing bullying behavior in schools. Bullying can be described as a group process involving at least a person who is bullied (victim) and a person committing the bullying behaviors (bully). In most cases, however, additional persons are involved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0143034312461467">Craig, Pepler, &amp; Blais, 2007</xref>). Quite often bullying behaviors occur in the presence of peers or teachers that can react helpfully, as bystanders or in other roles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0143034312461467">Richard, Schneider, &amp; Mallet, 2011</xref>). Due to the fact that bullying has to be understood as a group process the need for holistic prevention and intervention approaches is obvious. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0143034312461467">Richard et al. (2011)</xref>, many whole-school approaches have been implemented in the last two decades (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0143034312461467">Olweus, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0143034312461467">Smith et al., 2004</xref>). Unfortunately, the majority of outcome criteria of intervention and prevention programs did not evidence meaningful changes, either positive or negative ones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0143034312461467">Merrell, Gueldner, Ross, &amp; Isava, 2008</xref>). Although these findings are somewhat disappointing, they do also challenge researchers, school psychologists, and teachers to develop strategies or policies that are more effective. In the present contribution the focus was put on teachers’ strategies to handle incidents of bullying, because teachers are the persons who are in the immediate proximity of bullying behaviors in schools. Consequently, they are the persons who have to act. As we all know, teaching is a challenging task and teachers—experts as well as novices—have to manage their classroom to create a motivating learning environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0143034312461467">Allen, 2010</xref>). If individual characteristics of teachers correlate with the ways in which they handle bullying incidents, this has to be taken into account when thinking about handling bullying in schools. It is important for teachers to reflect their own attitudes, normative beliefs, and other convictions and school-psychologists might help them in doing this. Teachers have to be prepared to work with the students. For researchers who develop preventive approaches this means that training sessions and preparatory courses have to be conducted.</p>
<p>We were able to show correlations between teachers’ attitudes toward aggression and taking action in cases of bullying, and between teachers’ continuity beliefs and their tendency to take action in cases of bullying. Consequently, school psychologists should think about working with teachers right from the beginning of their preparation courses and with in-service teachers. Teachers should explore their attitudes, they should be guided to reflect their normative beliefs, and their convictions concerning the stability of aggressive behaviors of children and adolescents. Research has demonstrated that many teachers develop beliefs and perceptions about classroom management based on their own experiences as students at school or university and that these beliefs persist into their working lives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0143034312461467">Fajet, Bello, Leftwich, Mesler, &amp; Shaver, 2005</xref>). If teachers have developed ideas on classroom management that are not functional this will lead to problems in their class, an unhelpful class climate, and, in the worst case, support for students’ aggressive behaviors. If teachers fail to establish respectful communications and interactions in their classrooms this might foster bullying (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0143034312461467">Espelage &amp; Swearer, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>A further topic that is connected to teachers’ attitudes toward aggression is their knowledge about aggression. It is important that teachers can differentiate different forms of aggressive behaviors in their classrooms and that they are able to identify those behaviors in a reliable way. A recent study by Cheng, Chen, Ho, and Cheng (2012) examined the definitions of school bullying in a Taiwanese sample. The authors concluded that different groups (bullies, victims, teachers) outlined different aspects of bullying that are important when asked for a definition. In addition, Cheng et al. (2012) emphasized that there are cultural differences in definitions. Whereas the Taiwanese sample expressed the importance of the imbalance of power, participants from Western samples did this to a smaller extent. Finally, the authors concluded that even though teachers are able to identify bullying, their actions depend on their conceptions of severity and their relationships with students. This statement supports our argument of a need to foster teachers’ competencies in classroom management, to help them reflect on their attitudes and beliefs, and to support them in recognizing bullying behaviors. Information about all these aspects could provide valuable implications for the development of bullying prevention programs and preventive approaches. Bullying behaviors are much less likely if teachers are able to establish a positive psychosocial school environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0143034312461467">Meyer-Adams &amp; Conner, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Taken together the creation of a positive school environment can be influenced by the teacher and teachers should take their educational mission seriously. Psychologists and educators in preparatory courses can help teachers to reflect on their attitudes and beliefs and they can teach knowledge about bullying and demonstrate options regarding how to react in cases of bullying. If teachers start to act more effectively this could improve preventive efforts which could be a starting point for powerful and effective holistic approaches against bullying.</p>
<p>When thinking about bullying prevention in the school context we may also include findings from very recent research on cyberbullying. Cyberbullying is defined as an aggressive, intentional act from a group or individual against a victim. The particular feature distinguishing cyberbullying from traditional forms of bullying is the use of electronic forms of contact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0143034312461467">Smith et al., 2008</xref>). Although, cyberbullying phenomena were not in the scope of the present article, we might find important similarities in prevention and intervention strategies. And, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0143034312461467">Kowalski, Morgan, and Limber (2012)</xref> have illustrated, bullying may be a precursor of cyberbullying. If the two forms of bullying are closely related we might think of prevention strategies that tackle both forms at the same time. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0143034312461467">Von Marées and Petermann (2012b)</xref> have demonstrated that prevention should be included in school curricula and students as well as teachers should have knowledge about the phenomena. Taken together, this implies that supportive student-teacher-relationships and a positive school environment (positive classroom- and school-climate) can help to reduce or avoid bullying as well as cyberbullying. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0143034312461467">Von Marées and Petermann (2012b)</xref> have argued that many adults are still unaware of the risks that modern forms of communication (Internet, mobile phones) constitute for children and adolescents; consequently, more information should be included in teacher preparation. To conclude, teachers need to find adequate ways of handling bullying phenomena and they have to develop strategies to maintain a positive classroom-climate—because this can help to prevent bullying as well as cyberbullying phenomena.</p>
