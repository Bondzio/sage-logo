<abstract>
<p>The new president of Brazil, Dilma Rousseff, who resisted the civilian-military rule (1964–1985) in her youth, has been engaging civil society and congress in security and defence issues for the production of the first national defence white paper. Her performance in this area is a good indication of the state of democracy in post-transition Brazil. Using the literature on third wave democracy transition and consolidation, this piece examines how previous presidents dealt with the main security and defence issues in order to identify change and continuity early in the Rousseff administration and also what sort of challenges the new president must rise to. As part of Latin America, Brazil lies in a largely demilitarized, but at the same time extremely violent region of the world. As an emerging soft power, Brazil has recently made defence a bigger issue in the national political agenda but still struggles to deal with its dark history of human rights abuses in the civilian-military dictatorship. Rousseff has shown an awareness of civilian-military issues, but it is still unclear whether she has enough political capital and whether that will translate into the required political support to democratically define the role of the armed forces in Brazil.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>In spite of its position as the major military power in South America and one of the largest countries in the world, Brazil tends to be seen mostly as a soft power. The country has not engaged in traditional armed conflict with its neighbours for over a century, and has last engaged in war during the two world wars. On the other hand, it has for long been one of the top contributors of military personnel to UN peacekeeping operations and has led the military component of the UN mission in Haiti (MINUSTAH) since its inception in 2004. As Brazil takes on a new, more prominent role in world politics and aims at reforming the UN Security Council, the debate around a national security and defence policy has gained increased relevance.</p>
<p>The goal of this article is to explore the lines of initial continuity focusing on defence policy during the Dilma Rousseff administration, while also identifying any early changes with respect to the preceding civilian administrations. When a new president who has been a key member of the previous administration takes over, very few surprises are anticipated. Still, if Rousseff keeps or changes anything in security and defence matters early on, what does that mean, and what should we expect for the rest her term?</p>
<p>This article will start out by briefly looking at how the previous five civilian administrations have dealt with civil-military relations, including the two main challenges for the consolidation of democracy in Brazil: the <italic>demilitarization</italic> of the state and the <italic>depolitization</italic> of military affairs. The role of the military in a democratic Brazil underpins both challenges and this article shows how the armed forces are either involved or removed from distinct areas of governmental activity in a series of institutional reforms and security and defence policy documents produced after the end of the military rule. Since Rousseff was a key member of the Lula da Silva government in the position of his chief of staff, a more detailed analysis of the legacy of the Lula da Silva administration is naturally in order. The piece will highlight the decisions Rousseff has made as president-elect in agreement with Lula da Silva and the very first steps she has taken in security and defence issues on her own. I will conclude by pointing out the challenges President Rousseff must rise to in the area of security and defence, both in the short and in the longer term.</p>

<sec id="section2-0896920512441634">
<title>Civilian Control as a Means to Consolidate Democracy</title>
<p>The effort of establishing civilian authority over the military is twofold: as pointed out by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0896920512441634">Samuel Huntington (1957)</xref>, there must be <italic>demilitarization</italic> of the state and, in tandem, <italic>depolitization</italic> of the technical military issues. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0896920512441634">Alfred Stepan (1988)</xref> adds that civilians must acquire adequate knowledge of military issues to ensure decisions on the use of force are subject to the rule of law and the constitution. These must also be accountable, even when classified.</p>
<p>Even though there was political will to address both challenges, the military in Brazil were very well organized to prevent major changes and so civilians focused on other pressing concerns, such as economic stability. The Brazilian military stepped out of office before the debt crisis of the 1980s had peaked. In this way, they managed to be remembered for record GDP growth rather than for a major economic downturn. However, they had mixed success in calling the 1964 coup d’état a revolution, and the authoritarian regime that followed a democracy, just because unlike other regimes in the region, the Brazilian military rotated in power through elections and opposition was allowed to exist. Civilian presidents had a hard time implementing civilian authority over the military by removing them from key positions in government and introducing accountability mechanisms to their activities.</p>
<p>The first civilian president, José Sarney, was elected indirectly as vice-president, running with the party that supported military candidates during the dictatorship, and stepped in when Tancredo Neves, his running mate and then still president-elect, passed away. Sarney did very little in the way of removing military prerogatives over the government and besides presence (active duty or retired military officers held high-level posts in the governmental bureaucracy and state-owned companies), the military also held influence over the executive and the constitutional assembly that gathered in 1988 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0896920512441634">De Oliveira, 1994b</xref>). The armed forces actively promoted projects to improve military presence in remote areas of the country. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0896920512441634">Jorge Zaverucha (1994)</xref> and others claim the transition government was effectively under military tutelage.</p>
<p>It was President Fernando Collor de Mello, the first elected by popular vote in Brazil since 1960, who committed to implementing civilian control over the armed forces and decided to reduce military prerogatives dramatically by shutting down some of the agencies and bureaucracies that were mostly staffed by the military. This abrupt approach had its drawbacks and there was fear of a white coup. Early on in his term Collor de Mello removed ministerial status from two out of the six military figures then in the presidential cabinet, a turning point in history that moved the military away from the main decision-making loci in the executive power (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0896920512441634">De Oliveira, 1994a</xref>: 313). In less than three years he also shut down the most powerful military bureaucracies (<italic>Serviço Nacional de Informações</italic> [SNI] and <italic>Conselho de Seguranca Nacional –</italic> and also the several national security and information divisions within civil ministries that were linked to them), which had been the most infamous institutions of the authoritarian regime. However, the replacement agency Collor created to deal with both intelligence and defence issues lacked qualified civilian staff and generated a great deal of controversy.</p>
<p>Collor wanted to move as far as creating a Ministry of Defence headed by a civilian, but did not manage to do so before he resigned from office. Neither did he manage to design a clear security and defence policy for the country. His mixed success in terms of demilitarization of the state was coupled with the drafting of an ambitious program for protection and surveillance of the Amazon. Most of the Amazon forest is located in the North region, especially valued by the military (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0896920512441634">Martins Filho and Zirker, 2000</xref>). It was during military rule that the first major official efforts to make the state present and active there took place, and this might be one of the few regions in the country where the armed forces are the only presence of the state and can feel they play a professional role in defending the national territory against potential foreign aggression. The policies introduced by Collor de Mello to advance civilian control of the armed forces were, for the most part, reversed by his successor and former vice-president, Itamar Franco. President Franco nominated members of the armed forces to lead a staggering total of seven ministries, plus a couple of state-owned companies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0896920512441634">Saint Pierre and Mathias, 2001</xref>: 145).</p>
<p>If any generalization can be made about the first democratic decade following military rule, it could be the fact that for most of that period the presidents of the republic had originally been elected as vice-presidents. This feeling of instability certainly turned public attention to the armed forces, which still staffed key positions in the state bureaucracy and did not have a clear mission by then. A couple of scholars (for instance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0896920512441634">Stepan, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0896920512441634">Zaverucha, 1994</xref>) saw the influence the military had over Brazilian politics as limiting the process of consolidation of the new democracy, but <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0896920512441634">Wendy Hunter (1997)</xref> disagreed with the assumption that the military were extremely powerful political actors in Brazil. Her thesis is that increased popular support for elected politicians would prompt them to reduce military interference in politics (but see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0896920512441634">Martins Filho, 2001</xref>). I would rather argue that this might not hold true for the technical military areas in Brazil, at least for the first decade of the democratic period. My hypothesis is corroborated, for instance, by evidence of little civilian effort to elaborate documents outlining the security and defence policy of the country and the lack of public debate even about conscription, a basic civilian-military issue in democracies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0896920512441634">Bertazzo, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>The next democratic decade started with a smooth transition from Franco to Fernando Henrique Cardoso, who stepped in as president in 1995. Cardoso, introduced significant changes to the institutional placement of the armed forces, most of which were implemented after a re-election bill was passed, and he successfully ran for a second term as president. For instance, the creation of a Ministry of Defence headed by a civilian minister was a major change for the military, and much like the early years of democracy in Brazil, there were abrupt changes of minister early on (for details see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0896920512441634">De Oliveira, 2004</xref>). The inception of the Ministry of Defence in 1999 effectively removed ministerial status from each individual force and from the General Staff of the armed forces by placing a civilian between the military force commanders and the president. Created in the same year as the Ministry of Defence, the Brazilian Intelligence Agency consolidated the earlier proposal made by President Collor de Mello, which was a civilian information service with a career for civil servants. Therefore, the project for demilitarization of the state started by Collor de Mello in the early 1990s saw its completion with the reforms introduced by Cardoso at the end of that decade, when there was a considerably more stable political and economic environment in Brazil.</p>
<p>The following president, Luis Inácio Lula da Silva, also had trouble with his nominations for defence minister. His first minister, José Viegas, was a career diplomat whose authority was questioned by the military. This authority crisis peaked when the army released a (supposedly unauthorized) official press communiqué that praised the civilian-military regime of 1964–85. This was particularly sensitive because it came out on the anniversary of Vladimir Herzog’s death. Herzog, a journalist, died under unclear circumstances in an interrogation facility during the <italic>years of lead</italic>, i.e. the period of heaviest repression under authoritarian rule, from 1969 to 1974 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0896920512441634">Miyamoto and Bertazzo, 2008</xref>). Shortly after this incident, and even though the commander of the army published an apology, Minister Viegas resigned.</p>
<p>In a cautious move by President Lula da Silva, the vice-president of the republic, José de Alencar, was asked to step in and wear both hats from November 2004 until March 2006. The next defence minister, Waldir Pires, faced another major crisis. This time it was connected with the poor performance of civilian aviation, which was subordinated to the Ministry of Defence. Minister Pires was replaced in July 2007. Then Nelson Jobim, a former justice minister of the Cardoso government, took the job of defence minister and proposed major reforms to the Ministry of Defence that were approved by the National Congress in 2010. As part of the re-structuring of the Ministry of Defence, the reform effectively placed the defence minister as mediator between the president and the armed forces, in an effort to depoliticize the latter. The minister now effectively leads the individual force commanders, who are no longer granted exclusive meetings with the president. Acknowledging the current lack of civilian knowledge of military issues, Jobim re-introduced a higher status for the joint commander, on a par with the three force commanders. The joint force commander, a retired officer, has the role of advising the minister. This establishes a joint (rather than combined) framework for the activities of the army, navy and air force.</p>
<p>Hence, if the transition to democracy was criticized for having been a slow process largely controlled by the military, the <italic>demilitarization</italic> of the state is still not complete over 20 years on. One cannot say the military have fully lost control over the process, and as civilians increasingly reduced their prerogatives, the military found alternate ways to influence politics. A fine example of that is how they influence law making: each of the forces keeps dedicated staff to follow congress proposals and together they make up the most influential lobbying mechanisms. the most influential lobbying mechanisms in place at the Brazilian Congress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0896920512441634">Castro Santos, 2004</xref>: 140). As for the <italic>depolitization</italic> of military issues, it actually depends on more civilian knowledge of security and defence, which has not yet reached adequate levels in Brazil. A main question pervades the two previous tasks of <italic>depolitization</italic> and <italic>demilitarization</italic>: what should be the role of the military in Brazil? This has been a major issue for states all over the world since the end of the Cold War, when perceptions of threat and priorities of security have changed dramatically but are not yet fully configured.</p>

<sec id="section3-0896920512441634">
<title>Doctrine: From National Security to National Defence</title>
<p>The first post-war documents dealing with security policy in Brazil were included in the framework of the National Security and Development Doctrine (<italic>Doutrina de Segurança Nacional e Desenvolvimento</italic>), the equivalent of the US National Security Doctrine for the Cold War. Developed by the War College (<italic>Escola Superior de Guerra</italic>, ESG) after its inception in 1949, this policy was for the most part the brainchild of General Golbery do Couto e Silva, a key figure of the civilian-military rule in Brazil. The policy of containment and the link between security and development underpinned the teachings of the School of the Americas in Panama and of the ESG in Brazil, a think tank that remained the flagship national institution to provide education to civilians in military affairs. The doctrine produced by the ESG would become the national security law, incorporated in the first constitution enacted by the first military government following the 1964 coup d’état in Brazil.</p>
<p>After 1964, Brazil did not have another security policy document until the mid-1990s, at least not one named as such. The shadow of the civilian-military rule was very much present during the first couple of years of the democratization period and each of the forces was somewhat free to elaborate and publish their own views on security issues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0896920512441634">Bertazzo, 2007</xref>). The first effort to put together another white paper in the area of security and defence only came more than ten years after the first civilian president stepped in. It was titled National Defence Policy (<italic>Política de Defesa Nacional</italic>, PDN) and was elaborated in consultation with academics at the request of President Cardoso. The text was brief and laid out basic principles of foreign policy, together with a few general guidelines for the deployment of the armed forces that did not foresee engagement in conflicts.</p>
<p>The first update to the PDN, which partially responded to the criticism aimed at the original 1996 document, did not come before 2005. The Lula da Silva administration made the PDN a more consistent effort to incorporate not only the latest thinking in terms of security but also the directives for training and deployment of the armed forces. The PDN was complemented three years later by another, more robust set of policies, outlined in the <italic>National Strategy of Defence: Peace and Security for Brazil</italic> (NSD). For the first time since the transition to democracy, the word ‘security’ was used in such a document, even if in a subheading, thus breaking a long taboo that associated security with the authoritarian civilian-military rule. Also, for the first time such a document was published not only in Portuguese, but also in Spanish, French and English at the same time (following a trend already present in other countries in the region, such as Argentina).</p>
<p>The NSD differs from the PDN in that it clearly defines the major points for a reform of the armed forces, so as to meet future challenges arising from a more prominent role for Brazil in the international arena.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>The Plan focuses on middle and long term strategic actions, and aims at modernizing the national defence structure, acting upon three structuring axes: reorganization of the Armed Forces, the restructuring of the Brazilian defence industry, and the troop requirements policy for the Armed Forces. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0896920512441634">Brazil, 2008</xref>: 5)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Following a plan outlined by Lula da Silva, several ministries, groups in academia and the wider civil society were set to spend the whole year of 2011 involved in a major effort to put together the first National Defence White Paper (<italic>Livro Branco de Defesa Nacional</italic>, LBDN). By hosting open workshops across the country and bringing security and defence issues closer to the ordinary citizen, it was expected that the end result would be the most inclusive and democratic official defence document ever to be published by Brazil (for more details, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0896920512441634">Bertazzo, 2011</xref>). Other countries in the region such as Argentina, Chile, Colombia and Peru have had defence white papers for much longer.</p>
<p>With regard to security and defence issues, Rousseff has a greater challenge than Lula Da Silva or Fernando Henrique Cardoso did. The military were a potential problem for President Rousseff because of her past history of participation in the urban guerrilla movement, as part of a larger resistance and liberation movement that formed in Brazil during the <italic>years of lead</italic>. In her inauguration speech she implied she had no hard feelings regarding the torture and imprisonment she was subject to and explicitly paid homage to her comrades who fell during the fight for democracy. Dilma Rousseff is the first woman ever to play the role of commander-in-chief of the armed forces in Brazil. Along with former president of Chile Michele Bachelet, she is a member of a generation who fought against authoritarian rule as young women in the 1960s and 1970s. Both were arrested and imprisoned in their youth and later became the first female presidents in the history of their respective countries. Unlike Bachelet, however, Rousseff had not served as defence minister before running for president.</p>
<p>As outlined earlier, President Rousseff’s first challenge in the area of security and defence is to move forward in implementing civilian authority over the military, as Brazil consolidates its regained democratic regime. Secondly, and actually part of this first challenge, is a central task to all civilians that preceded her in the post: defining the role of the Brazilian military.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0896920512441634">
<title>Internal Role: The ‘Police-ization’ of the Military</title>
<p>Regarding the role of the armed forces, Itamar Franco started a trend that would not be abandoned by any other president that followed: deploying the armed forces to fight urban violence in Rio de Janeiro. Franco first called the armed forces to secure order in Rio in the framework of a special operation (codenamed Operation Rio), aimed at the slums, areas where the local military or civilian police capabilities were no match for those of criminals. In preparation for the Eco-92 World Conference (also known as Rio-92), their task was to fight crime lords that controlled access to most of the slums in Rio and regularly promoted violent outbreaks elsewhere in the city. They would be used in the same capacity once again by Franco two years later, in Operation Rio I, when about 1,500 soldiers occupied 50 slums in Rio and neighbouring Niteroi for two months.</p>
<p>The deployment against criminal operations connected with trafficking in drugs is implied in the PDN, where non-state armed actors from neighbouring countries in the Amazon and transnational organized crime are mentioned as security concerns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0896920512441634">Brazil, 1996</xref>). However, under Cardoso the constitution was amended to normalize the role of the military acting in support of police forces. This phenomenon has been described in the literature as the police-ization of the military (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0896920512441634">Dunlap, 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>The armed forces, especially the army, were often used during the Cardoso era, not only in Rio but also in other areas. While the national public security plan launched as a white paper in the first year of Lula da Silva’s first term in office also formalized a police role for the military, it contained indications of a goal to demilitarize police and fire brigades, then reserve forces of the army. Lula da Silva’s public security plan also proposes to transfer national firearms control from the armed forces to a civilian institution in a process to be coordinated by the National Congress. This was achieved by the end of 2003 with Law 10.826, which made the federal police, through the Ministry of Justice, the authority responsible for regulating small firearms trade and registration. However, security and defence policies introduced by President Lula da Silva confirmed the trend of increasingly turning to the armed forces when police capacity was overwhelmed or largely absent (as was repeatedly the case when state police forces went on strike). Six months before the end of his term, President Lula da Silva extended the power of arrest to members of all armed forces acting in a police capacity. This prerogative had already been given to the army in 2004, when the navy and air force were tasked with control and screening for illicit activities (trafficking in persons, drugs and arms).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0896920512441634">
<title>External Role: Leadership in the Region and in the Americas</title>
<p>In contrast with the increased institutionalization of the internal use of the armed forces, the Lula da Silva administration also established a strong external role for the armed forces, designed to match a growing prominence of Brazil in international affairs.</p>
<p>Since 2004 Brazil has had the largest force levels and hence the operational command of the United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti (MINUSTAH). This gives Brazil an unprecedented leadership role in security and defence issues and a valuable opportunity to display its military preparedness among its neighbours. Peacekeeping is a major goal in non-offensive preparation for warfare and at the same time it is a major confidence-building effort in the region.</p>
<p>The regional integration promoted by Lula da Silva through new economic and political cooperation mechanisms also had a security dimension spearheaded by Brazil. Building on previous arrangements such as the meetings of defence ministers of the Americas, Lula da Silva shifted his focus not only to economic integration but also to security issues in South America. Lula da Silva intended the Union of South American Nations (<italic>Unasur</italic>), a new regional organization whose charter was signed in Brasilia in 2008, to include a South American Defence Council (<italic>Conselho de Defesa Sul-Americano</italic>, CDS) from the start, but met with opposition from Colombia, the largest recipient of US military aid in the region.</p>
<p>Both Unasur and the CDS were, for the most part, brainchildren of the Lula da Silva administration and represented its pursuit of regional integration. South America was defined as the region in which Brazilian initiatives in economics, development and security would focus, and for the first time all 12 independent states of the sub-continent came together as a group. The CDS was established later in 2009, in no small part due to active campaigning by Defence Minister Jobim (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0896920512441634">Bertazzo, 2010</xref>). Its main stated objective is to share information on sensitive issues for confidence-building purposes and it has already set up its own defence studies centre (<italic>Centro de Estudios Estratégicos de la Defensa</italic>) in Buenos Aires. Although the ultimate stated goal of the CDS is to build a common view of security challenges that affect the region and integrated training of armed forces, no joint operational capability is envisaged.</p>

<sec id="section6-0896920512441634">
<title>A Preliminary Assessment: The Military under Dilma Rousseff</title>
<p>Rousseff spearheaded an initiative to revise the Amnesty Law,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0896920512441634">1</xref></sup> a proposal included in the Human Rights White Paper, while still serving as minister in the Casa Civil (equivalent to the White House Chief of Staff, but with more extensive powers) in Lula da Silva’s cabinet. Published in 2009, this white paper highlights the inter-ministerial approach to the issue of human rights policy in the foreword written by President Lula da Silva, which states that it is proposed by an unprecedented set of 31 ministries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0896920512441634">Brazil, 2009</xref>: 12). This level of interagency cooperation is indeed impressive since Lula da Silva did not have more than 40 ministries (including agencies with ministerial status) at any time in his two terms.</p>
<p>In spite of that level of consensus, the three military commanders and the minister of defence threatened to submit resignation letters if the several cases of human rights violations included in the 1979 Amnesty Law were re-opened for trial. On that occasion, Lula da Silva appeased the minister and commanders with an offer to review the text of the Human Rights White Paper. The military commanders and the defence minister also opposed a related proposal in the Human Rights White Paper which installed a truth commission in Brazil,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0896920512441634">2</xref></sup> albeit not as strongly as they opposed the review of the Amnesty Law. Rousseff kept the debate for a truth commission on the table as president and saw it approved by Congress in October 2011. Because the truth commission was established for a two-year term, Rousseff is likely to deal with the outcomes of investigations while still serving as President of the Republic.</p>
<p>As chief of staff, Rousseff had previously overseen the transfer of the civilian-military rule archives from the National Intelligence Agency (which up to 1999 was under the umbrella of the military) to the National Archives through the Reference Centre for Political Struggle in Brazil (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0896920512441634">Abrão and Torelly, 2011</xref>: 224). Both the archive and the centre were under the authority of the chief of staff, and while working in that capacity Rousseff signed the foreword to a website that publishes the information available from the government and calls on others to digitize their own archives. She personally oversaw the transfer of the National Archives to the structure of the Ministry of Justice by presidential decree 7.430, issued in her first few days in office. This was particularly important because the military had hitherto been able to keep these files out of public debate and reach.</p>
<p>In the international arena President Rousseff also made her views clear. In a call made to congratulate her on her election, Ban Ki-moon, Secretary General of the UN, heard from Rousseff that she intended to introduce discussions about security and development when Brazil took over the rotating presidency of the Security Council, in February 2011, and Moon welcomed her initiative. During that same month, Brazil met with the G4<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0896920512441634">3</xref></sup> at the UN, and the group issued a joint statement agreeing to put their motion forward in the 2011 session of the UN General Assembly.</p>
<sec id="section7-0896920512441634">
<title>Continuity: Nominations and Ongoing Operations</title>
<p>As president-elect and former chief of staff, the ‘unofficial prime-minister’ of Brazil, Dilma Rousseff made a very smooth transition to the presidency, one that has been marked by continuity. She promised continuity in on-going security task forces, and one month after the election she announced that roughly 2000 soldiers would be kept for another six months at one of the largest of the many Rio slums where they were supporting the Pacifying Police Unit (<italic>Unidade de Polícia Pacificadora</italic>, UPP). The Ministry of Defence had initially wanted to end the UPP operation.</p>
<p>Her second decision in the area of defence and security was to keep Nelson Jobim, Lula da Silva’s minister of defence, in his post. Out of her initial team of 37 ministers, 17 had worked with Lula da Silva as ministers or deputy ministers. Jobim’s name was announced in the third batch of appointments, in a press release issued on 15 December 2010. Rousseff also kept all four military commanders in their posts. She met privately with each of them to announce her decision during the transition period but is unlikely to grant each of the force commanders private meetings during her term, following reforms introduced by Lula da Silva and Jobim. She later had to remove Jobim, largely due to a series of criticisms of the Rousseff administration he made to the press. His successor was another minister who had served during the Lula da Silva administration, Celso Amorim. This was a safe choice because Amorim is still an ‘insider’ and largely seen as a nationalist, but the appointment still carried some risk because the only previous attempt of nominating a diplomat as defence minister had caused resistance among the military. This time, however, protest was minimal and Amorim even had a chance to side with force commanders early on, publicly vouching for a force commander facing corruption charges.</p>
<p>The fact that President Rousseff has kept most of the staff and structure left behind by Lula da Silva does not mean she has not changed the way armed forces operate. For instance, as a response to the floods that hit Rio de Janeiro and neighbouring cities early in January 2011, she signed a decree in early February that gave the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff specific powers to organize military cooperation with other agencies engaged in emergency relief in the event of a disaster. She also hinted at an eventual reduction of the role of the armed forces in public security. During her inauguration ceremony on the 1 January, Rousseff did not mention the armed forces directly except for their contribution to special public security operations in Rio: ‘The state of Rio de Janeiro has shown how important it is in resolving conflicts to have coordinated action from the security forces at the three levels of government, including – when necessary – the decisive participation of the armed forces’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0896920512441634">Rousseff, 2011a</xref>).</p>
<p>With that proviso President Rousseff places herself in agreement with the directives issued by military commanders and the 1988 Federal Constitution. Anyway, it is highly unlikely that Rousseff will be able to remove the military from a police role in the short term, especially when the country is set to host the football World Cup, a major international sports event, during her 4-year tenure of office. Also in her inauguration speech Rousseff reaffirmed what she calls ‘the classic values of the Brazilian diplomatic tradition’, namely, peace, non-intervention, human rights and multilateralism. She points out that ‘Our tradition of defending peace does not allow us to be indifferent to the existence of enormous nuclear arsenals, to nuclear proliferation, to terrorism and to transnational organized crime” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0896920512441634">Rousseff, 2011a</xref>). It is important to stress that President Rousseff subtly places the threat posed by the already existing warheads before that posed by nuclear proliferation. She then follows with a statement that Brazil will advocate reform in global governance mechanisms, especially the UN and its Security Council.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0896920512441634">
<title>Change: Advancing Civilian Control</title>
<p>Among the changes already introduced by President Rousseff in the area of security and defence, one of the most significant for the demilitarization of the state is the transfer of all civilian aviation agencies from the Ministry of Defence and more specifically the air force command, to a new, all-civilian secretariat with ministerial status. She announced this decision less than a month after winning the elections (hence even before she had nominated the defence minister). It was a campaign promise, and she effectively created the new agency in March 2011.</p>
<p>As noted by Fiona Macaulay in this special issue, Rousseff also transferred the Brazilian Intelligence Agency (<italic>Agência Brasileira de Inteligência</italic>, ABIN) to the Ministry of Justice. Even though already a civilian body, this agency was still subordinated to military agencies and reported to both the Ministry of Defence and the Institutional Security Office (<italic>Gabinete de Segurança Institucional</italic>, GSI), headed by an active-duty, high-ranking military officer (generally from the army).</p>
<p>Finally, under Rousseff there will be another change in the structure of the Ministry of Defence, announced early in January 2011 by the minister of defence. Minister Jobim declared that he would take in a special civilian adviser, and that he had invited the politician José Genoíno to assist him in that capacity during the Rousseff administration. Genoíno is a congressman of the same party as President Rousseff who has also served as party leader. Like Dilma Rousseff, José Genoíno fought against the authoritarian regime in Brazil during the <italic>years of lead</italic>. As a congressman, Genoíno was part of the Defence and Foreign Affairs Committee of the lower house and was recognized in military circles for his sound knowledge of defence issues.</p>
<p>The rapid policymaking in the areas of aviation and security is not only a signal that Rousseff is aware of the infrastructure bottlenecks that must be overcome before Brazil hosts the sports events of 2014 and 2016, but also a major step towards the <italic>depolitization</italic> of the military. Rousseff realized the military had not been effective in supervising the sector and during the Lula da Silva administration the civilian aviation and airport control agencies had been the loci of a major crisis.</p>
<p>The air force also suffered a delay imposed by President Rousseff on a major acquisition of fighter jets. Lula da Silva had left the decision up to his successor as he approached the end of his term, and Rousseff announced budget cuts across the board to meet macroeconomic targets. This budgetary constraint not only postponed the acquisition but also opened the way for three suppliers (Saab from Sweden, Dassault from France, and Boeing from the USA) to start efforts from scratch for this deal. The Swedish proposal was favoured in the technical report produced by the Brazilian air force. However, the president of France himself lobbied for Dassault on a visit to Brazil in 2010 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0896920512441634">Martins Filho, 2010</xref>). Finally, after Dilma Rousseff postponed her decision, US Senator John McCain was quick to visit her in Brazil, as early as 10 January 2011, to try and turn the tables in favour of Boeing. Logistics and mobilizations systems, planned not only in military directives but also in the human rights white paper, are still currently unavailable.</p>
<p>Viewing national security issues broadly, the rebirth of the national defence industry, outlined as a priority in the national strategy of defence, will have to rely on targeted scientific research. Perhaps with the exception of the military academy, few research centres in Brazil develop technology for military applications.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0896920512441634">
<title>A Message to the Armed Forces</title>
<p>A concrete gesture made by President Rousseff during her first year of government has a very important symbolic meaning for the <italic>depolitization</italic> of the military: she imposed a ban on commemorations of the civilian-military coup d’état, referred to by the military as a revolution. This date was in the calendar of the Brazilian army for official celebrations all through the military rule and also during the subsequent civilian governments.</p>
<p>Every 31 March until Dilma Rousseff was elected, high-profile speakers from within the army gathered to celebrate the glory of the ‘revolution that saved the country from communism’. Retired military clubs protested by commemorating the date in 2011, but the army quietly removed the date from its website in November 2010. Rousseff received the highest military decorations awarded to civilians by each of the three forces on the occasion of a ceremony for the promotion of officers to the post of general, only a week after she had vetoed the commemoration of the coup d’état.</p>
<p>In the speech she read on the occasion of her award, she shared her thoughts on the role of the armed forces with the audience, implicitly referring to the civilian-military rule as a wrong path: ‘A country, such as Brazil, that relies on armed forces characterized by a close attachment to their constitutional duties, is a country that has corrected its own ways and reached a high level of institutional maturity’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0896920512441634">Rousseff, 2011b</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0896920512441634">4</xref></sup> During that same speech, President Rousseff acknowledged that the traditional military role of national defence against military aggression should be enhanced because of the oil discovered in the Brazilian seabed. She called on the armed forces to support the new prominent role Brazil is playing in the international arena.</p>
<p>An example of that role is that Brazil takes on a new leadership position in peacekeeping, in addition to that of MINUSTAH. Since 24 February 2011 the Brazilian navy leads the Maritime Task Force (MTF) authorized within the mandate of UNFIL, the UN Interim Force in Lebanon. Since the MTF was set up in 2006, Brazil has been the first non-NATO country to hold command of the mission.</p>
<p>However, in addition to the traditional mission Rousseff called on the military to take an internal role in development programs:
<disp-quote>
<p>The fundamental priority of my government is, as you all know, to eliminate extreme poverty in Brazil. For this fight I count on the armed forces. Their wide experience in social work, carried out all across the homeland, reaching out to the furthermost and most remote regions is invaluable for us to achieve this essential goal. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0896920512441634">Rousseff, 2011b</xref>)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The challenge of making a developed country out of an emerging economy naturally goes beyond economics and through defence and security. Rousseff’s speeches indicate that she is aware of that, but the future budget for defence will demonstrate whether this is a consistent program or just lip service.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0896920512441634">
<title>Future Challenges</title>
<p>There is a great deal of continuity between Rousseff and Lula da Silva, which is indeed expected, but she has also made a difference early on in her term as president. The changes in the area of defence and security, however subtle, do matter. Most of the policies she has introduced deal with institutional aspects, those that always took the longest to change in Brazil. She has followed Lula da Silva and Cardoso’s inter-ministerial approach to undermine military resistance to change. Making civilian aviation genuinely civilian is a major step forward in civilian control, and no longer granting military commanders the informal status of ministers sent a firm message along the same lines. The transition period for the new agency will end in June 2012, leaving behind only shared responsibility with the military for air control. Military ministers will be forced to coordinate more, not only amongst themselves, but also with the defence minister.</p>
<p>In the realm of the identity crisis, banning a coup d’état commemoration, and moving the civilian-military rule archives from a secret service to the national archives are already major steps forward. An even bigger step forward is to supplement these efforts with a network of open access archive websites. All this was done when Rousseff was a minister under Lula da Silva and now her challenge is to keep up the momentum while president and improve access to information and justice to the victims of state violence. As of yet, it is a bold move. The actual impact of publishing national archives of the <italic>years of lead</italic> may be reduced as we approach 30 years since the transition to democracy. Rousseff also has to achieve consensus to build an amnesty memorial, as the controversy over the Amnesty Law is still unsettled, and a truth commission will start its work by mid- 2012. These are challenges Rousseff must rise to.</p>
<p>Among the vulnerabilities Rousseff will have to address as president is the uneven distribution of resources and staff across the force commands and the Ministry of Defence. This is related to poor coordination among the forces and insufficient civilian knowledge of security and defence issues, which allows for erratic acquisition of equipment and inadequate budgeting.</p>
<p>The need for civilian knowledge of military issues is required for civilian control of the armed forces and it was actually the last point mentioned by Rousseff in her first speech to officers promoted to rank of general. This is at the same time a challenge and a vulnerability that the president will have to face in order to make the process of writing up the Defence White Paper an inclusive endeavour.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>In a country such as Brazil, which is still socially unequal, the notion that the modernization and sizing of the armed forces would constitute an idle effort, at the expense of investment in other priority sectors, could seem tempting. This is a big mistake. The right judgment is that defence cannot be considered a minor element of the national agenda. It is also important that Brazilians as a whole realize the importance of their engagement in defence-related issues. Civil society must understand that defence topics are not exclusive to the military. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0896920512441634">Rousseff, 2011b</xref>)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This and other speeches indicate that Rousseff has an awareness of civilian-military issues but it is still unclear whether she has enough political capital and whether that will translate into the required political support to democratically define the role of the armed forces in Brazil. The effort lead by Rousseff, while still a member of the Lula da Silva government, to advance human rights and transitional justice agendas has met with a great deal of resistance not only among the military but also in the judiciary and congress. Even so, Rousseff has accumulated some achievements, such as the establishment of the truth commission and the ban on official commemorations of the military coup d’état. There is much more to be done, however, in terms of effectively implementing civilian control of the military and turning the Defence White Paper into actual policy.</p>
<p>President Rousseff has so far been able to defuse a series of foreseen crises regarding civilian-military issues. Although there was fear that a former member of the urban guerrilla movement who fought the civilian-military rule might generate a crisis of confidence among the military if elected president, both the President and the armed forces have shown great confidence in democracy. And much more confidence will be required if Rousseff goes further in her goal to confront the military with the past. Rousseff seems intent on including not only a new chapter in the future, but also another in the past history of her country; the military have a major part to play in both.</p>

<p>The Amnesty Law was passed by Congress in 1979 and approved by the last president of the civilian-military rule, General Figueiredo. The Amnesty Law prevented legal accountability for political crimes committed from 1961 to 1979, and marked the beginning of the long transition to democracy in Brazil. This legal instrument would be later complemented and modified by the creation of a commission to search for missing remains of politically persecuted Brazilians (in 1995) and another, the Amnesty Commission, which would establish a national reparations program and raise awareness through local initiatives.</p></fn>
