<p>“We must continually evaluate our results, correct our paths when wayward, and challenge the next generation to evolve our knowledge base.”</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>I am returning home from the AOFAS Annual Summer meeting energized for the discipline of foot and ankle surgery. I had the honor of serving this past year as the program chair for the AOFAS winter meeting in San Francisco and summer meeting in San Diego. Integrity, honesty, and a focus on the goal of advancing our profession is what I wrote as my personal mission statement a year ago as I embarked on this challenge.</p>
<p>I will let my colleagues decide on the final product but I rest comfortably knowing that I was able to uphold my mission statement while arbitrating a complex process.</p>
<p>The summer meeting had a record number of research abstracts submitted for consideration. My team and I reviewed 385 abstracts before settling in on 95 highly rated original research papers for presentation on the podium. There were 200 research projects that we selected as most appropriate for a different media communication, the e-poster. These research abstracts were reviewed in a blinded fashion with all committee members being blinded on the authors’ names, credentials, and affiliations until the final program was unveiled. This is what I am most proud of—research for research sake: The same founding principles of <italic>Foot &amp; Ankle Specialist</italic>.</p>
<p>The state of research in our discipline has never been stronger. Our meetings can no longer be informal social gatherings but rather an academic experience testing the limits of our creativity while always applying judicious skepticism. We must continually evaluate our results, correct our paths when wayward, and challenge the next generation to evolve our knowledge base. We all want to support those who are improving the lives of our patients while calling out those who are practicing outside their skill base.</p>
<p>This year has been a tremendous journey and learning experience. I hope that I have left the foot and ankle research community stronger than when I arrived a year ago. I did this for my friend, colleague, and AOFAS president Judy Baumhauer MD. I did this work for the AOFAS and for the foot and ankle community.</p>
<p>Let’s keep pushing the bar of education and research higher and higher.</p>
