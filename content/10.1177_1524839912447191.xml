<p><italic>Objectives</italic>. To obtain in-depth community input using qualitative and quantitative methods to guide development and marketing of a bike-share program in Chattanooga, Tennessee. Method. Focus groups and surveys assessed bicycling attitudes, beliefs, barriers, and behaviors of residents, workers, and university students. The authors completed nine focus groups (<italic>N</italic> = 56): five sessions with downtown workers, three with downtown residents, and one with university students. Results. Health, recreation and transportation benefits of bicycling were commonly identified. Concerns regarding bicycling in traffic are apparent because of lack of facilities and a need for public education on safe motorist and bicyclist behavior. Practical limitations can inhibit bicycling during the day, including shower access and personal hygiene concerns. <italic>Conclusions</italic>. Public desire for environmental, educational, and enforcement tactics to support safe bicycling was noted. Marketing tactics for bike-share usage should emphasize health, recreational, and transportation benefits. Worksites can reduce barriers related to bicycling and encourage bike-share use. Future studies should assess bike-share impact on perceptions and behavior, as well as the resulting policy and environmental changes.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Physical activity contributes to the prevention of many chronic diseases while simultaneously providing many psychological benefits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1524839912447191">Pate et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1524839912447191">U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 1996</xref>). In contrast, physical inactivity is a major contributor to the current obesity epidemic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1524839912447191">Hill &amp; Wyatt, 2005</xref>), leading states and communities to implement policy and environmental changes in order to increase physical activity in the effort to control and reduce current rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1524839912447191">Khan et al., 2009</xref>). By 2009, approximately two thirds of American states had adult obesity rates &gt;25% (body mass index ≥30 kg/m<sup>2</sup>); Tennessee was one of the eight states with obesity rates &gt;30% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1524839912447191">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC], 2009</xref>). In 2009, half of U.S. adults did not meet national guidelines for ≥150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic activity weekly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1524839912447191">CDC, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1524839912447191">U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2008</xref>); approximately 58% of adults in Chattanooga, Tennessee, failed to meet this standard (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1524839912447191">CDC, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Enhancing access to physical activity options and combining this with physical activity education is a recommended strategy for increasing physical activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1524839912447191">Kahn et al., 2002</xref>). Strategies that incorporate physical activity into daily living at multiple levels of influence (e.g., worksites, communities) may increase physical activity levels the most, providing options to fit preferences of a diverse population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1524839912447191">Sallis et al., 2006</xref>). Substitution of bicycling or walking in place of motorized vehicle transportation provides an immediate and realistic opportunity for increasing physical activity levels, especially given that half of all trips in metropolitan areas are ≤3 miles and 27% are ≤1 mile (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1524839912447191">U.S. Department of Transportation Federal Highway Administration, 2009</xref>). Importantly, bicycling for transportation has been reported to decrease mortality risk, even after adjusting for leisure time physical activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1524839912447191">Anderson, Schnohr, Schroll, &amp; Hein, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>Although certain negative consequences are associated with increased bicycling (e.g., exposure to air pollution and injury), recent research from the Netherlands indicates that the health benefits of increased physical activity through bicycling substantially outweigh the mortality effect of increased exposure to air pollution and risk for traffic crashes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1524839912447191">de Hartog, Boogaard, Nijland, &amp; Hoek, 2010</xref>). Also, contrary to the perception that increased bicycling leads to increased injury rates, multiple studies report that as bicycling activities increase, related injury rates decrease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1524839912447191">Elvik, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1524839912447191">Jacobsen, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1524839912447191">Robinson, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>In light of these challenges and benefits, the city of Chattanooga, Tennessee, is preparing for the installation of 30 stationary bike–share stations with 300 bicycles in different downtown locations in spring 2012. A bike-share program provides convenient access to bicycles for active transportation using an automated checkout system. America’s first bike-share system was launched in the District of Columbia in 2008. During the first 2 years, approximately 1,600 people joined this system (see Capital Bikeshare website: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.capitalbikeshare.com/">http://www.capitalbikeshare.com/</ext-link>). Such programs typically follow a membership protocol, with user costs ranging from $60 to $75 annually and additional fees based on trip duration. Although the evidence base for the impact of bike-sharing on public health is still developing, the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1524839912447191">U.S. Department of Transportation Federal Highway Administration (2010)</xref> recently recommended bike-share programs for public or municipal employees in a review of promising strategies for bicyclist safety and mobility.</p>
<p>The novelty of bike-sharing means that the behavior-, policy-, and environment-related factors associated with bike-sharing success are unknown. Usage patterns and conditions are unclear and may vary by a city’s population and culture. Metropolitan Chattanooga, Tennessee, with its population of approximately 169,000 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1524839912447191">U.S. Census Bureau, 2011</xref>), will be the smallest city in terms of population to implement an automated bike-share system as of 2011. To date, the authors are not aware of published research on a method for obtaining community input before implementation of a bike-share and how to use this input in the planning and implementation process. To prepare for future bicycle-sharing outreach activities in Chattanooga, a multimethod assessment of citizen attitudes, behaviors, and perspectives related to bicycling was conducted. The goal was to gather information particular to this and similar regions and to demonstrate a methodology that could be applied in other municipalities that may be considering a bicycle-sharing program.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1524839912447191" sec-type="methods">
<title>Method</title>
<p>Recognizing that there are multiple levels of influence on bicycling behaviors, an ecological perspective was used to obtain feedback on individual, interpersonal, organizational, community, and public policy influences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1524839912447191">Glanz, Rimer, &amp; Vinswanath, 2008</xref>). Focus groups were used to elicit responses in a social setting with peers, neighbors, or coworkers, facilitating the expression of perspectives with a greater focus on the environmental and policy contexts of bicycling behaviors, as well as social influences that might affect such behaviors. Surveys were used before and during the focus group meetings to allow for individual responses to structured questions about bicycling attitudes and behaviors.</p>
<p>Bicycling-related attitudes, beliefs, barriers, and behaviors were evaluated through the structured focus group protocol and accompanying survey. These elements were identified for measurement based on the health belief model, which describes individual behavior in terms of six constructs: perceived susceptibility, perceived severity, perceived barriers, perceived benefits, self-efficacy, and cues to action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1524839912447191">Glanz et al., 2008</xref>). Using these principles, questions were crafted to assess individual perceptions of bicycling’s benefits, barriers, and associated risks of injury. Respondents’ self-reported confidence in ability to safely ride a bicycle was also assessed. Finally, questions regarding bike-share program development and marketing options were included.</p>
<p>Because this was a practice-focused data collection for the benefit of the local Chattanooga population, targeted, nonrandom sampling of key informants was conducted. This strategy was necessary to ensure adequate representation of frequent and infrequent bicyclists who might use a bike-share system. Participants older than 18 years were recruited from among downtown residents, workers, and university students (the three primary user groups identified in this metropolitan area). With the permission of selected local employers and neighborhood organizations, recruitment flyers and e-mails were distributed. Most initial volunteers were likely to be interested in bicycling; as such, we encouraged all volunteers to “bring a buddy” who was not a regular bicyclist. In an effort to obtain sufficient community input from potential bike-share users, all volunteers were allowed to participate. Because this project was considered a public health evaluation or control effort, full participant informed consent was not required by the partnering university’s institutional review board. Participation was, however, entirely voluntary, and withdrawal was permitted at any time.</p>
<p>Focus groups lasted approximately 60 minutes and were facilitated by a professional trained in the design and management of focus groups. All focus groups were recorded and transcribed. A supplemental survey was administered immediately before the start of each focus group discussion. The data from this quantitative survey were analyzed using SPSS® Version 17. Five questions assessed respondents’ perceptions of safety while bicycling in the area and their perceived confidence in their abilities to ride safely. These questions, although in line with the tenets of social cognitive and self-efficacy theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1524839912447191">Bandura, 1977</xref>), were developed to probe more deeply into general comments that were elicited from participants in early-stage pilot testing of these methods and in informal discussions with pedestrian and bicycle riders on the Chattanooga riverfront recreational pathway. Responses related to the safety items (e.g., “How safe is the Chattanooga downtown for cyclists?”) were rated (1 = <italic>not at all</italic>, 2 = <italic>somewhat</italic>, 3 = <italic>moderately</italic>, 4 = <italic>very</italic>, 5 = <italic>completely</italic>). Combined, these items formed a perceived safety index score (Cronbach’s α = .81), with a higher score reflecting a stronger perception of bicycling safety.</p>
<p>All qualitative data gathered were content analyzed by considering all participants’ responses and identifying patterns and commonalities across these responses. From these commonalities, themes were developed, and all responses were then associated with the dominant themes. Responses with multiple components were separated into their constituent response elements, each of which could be separately coded to fit a theme. To facilitate prioritization of action steps in the ongoing planning for the implementation of this bike-share program, the prevalence or importance of particular themes was quantified by calculating the percentage of responses per each theme out of the total number of response elements to a given question. Thus, it is important to note that the sum of theme percentages may not be exactly 100% because of inconsistencies in responses to certain questions and a small number of responses to some questions that could not be meaningfully categorized. It is also important to note that responses were not linked to a particular respondent, so linkages to current bicycling behavior could not be made.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>During March-July 2010, nine focus groups were conducted (<italic>N</italic> = 56) with two to nine participants in each session; five sessions were conducted with downtown workers, three with downtown residents, and one with university students. A total of 54 surveys were received for a response rate of 96.4% of the total sample of focus group participants. From this information, we constructed a demographic profile of our participants. Most were female (63%); the average age was 35 years (<italic>SD</italic> = 12), ranging from 20 to 60 years. The majority of respondents were White (80%), followed by 18.3% Black and 2% Hispanic. To account for downtown workers who may reside outside of the metropolitan area, this sample approximately followed the Hamilton County racial distribution of 75.7% White, 20.1% Black, and 3.0% Hispanic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1524839912447191">U.S. Census Bureau, 2011</xref>). From self-reported residential postal zip code information, we determined that 78% of respondents resided within the Chattanooga metropolitan area. Nondowntown residents lived an average of 18.1 miles away from city center (<italic>SD</italic> = 13.91). Forty-four percent of respondents lived within 5 miles of the downtown, a practical bicycle commuting distance given no unreasonable environmental barriers.</p>
<p>The following subsections summarize the responses of participants to the focus group and survey questions regarding physical activity, personal bicycling behaviors, and perceptions of and reactions to the concept of a bicycle-sharing program.</p>
<sec id="section4-1524839912447191">
<title>Bicycling Behaviors and Perceived Benefits</title>
<p>When asked how they integrate physical activity into their life, the common responses were walking (20%), biking (20%), using the gym (14%), and running (11%). Survey results show that during a typical month, respondents reported taking an average of 7.56 bicycle rides (<italic>SD</italic> = 8.89). Half of the respondents reported ≥6 rides monthly. Nonbicyclists represented 26% of the participants. Respondents reported riding a bike for exercise (46%) and recreation or pleasure (28%), although a limited number rode for general transportation (15%). Perceived benefits of bicycling included health or exercise (28%), ease of transportation (22%), opportunities to socialize (11%), and feeling connected to the community (9%). Regarding bicycling outside of work hours, most responses indicated that bicycling in the Chattanooga area for recreation (20%) is not difficult, but a supportive bicycling infrastructure is lacking.</p>
<p>When asked to identify situations in which they might consider using a bicycle instead of their automobile, participants identified running errands (16%), commuting (11%), and going to or riding in a park (10%). In the survey, respondents rated the likelihood of riding a bicycle in different situations, and these results are summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1524839912447191">Figure 1</xref>.</p>

<title>Perceived Barriers to Bicycling</title>
<p>Barriers to bicycling during the workday were lack of shower access or difficulty maintaining hygiene (17%), traffic safety concerns (13%), time (11%), lack of bike racks or secure storage (10%), lack of confidence in ability to bicycle (8%), inclement weather risk (7%), difficulty carrying items (7%), and lack of infrastructure, including bike lanes (7%). When asked to identify reasons why bicycling in the area for work might be difficult, participants identified lack of or insufficient bicycling infrastructure (18%) and traffic safety (17%) as the most common reasons. Unsafe road conditions, construction, debris, and railroad tracks were also commonly identified as hazards (13%). Bicyclists not following the rules (7%) was a theme because of the negative impact this unpredictability has on motorists’ behaviors and perceptions. A final concern was the presence of steep hills creating difficult riding conditions (7%).</p>
<p>When asked what might make riding a bicycle in the downtown area easier, 27% of responses pertained to education of motorists, bicyclists, and the general public regarding safe interactions. The need for dedicated bicycling lanes was also evident (13%) and commonly the initial response from focus group participants. Identified bicycle routes (7%), traffic calming (6%), and separate bike facilities (6%) were also mentioned.</p>
<p>Survey results indicate that overall, respondents reported feeling somewhat to moderately safe while biking in the Chattanooga area (<italic>M</italic> = 2.72, <italic>SD</italic> = 0.71). Rider confidence was strong (<italic>M</italic> = 3.34, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.21). The safest areas for riding were perceived as residential areas versus surrounding nonresidential zones. The most common safety concerns for bicyclists were (a) a lack of a bike lane or shoulder (21%), (b) a lack of driver education on how to behave around bicyclists (13%), (c) driver distraction (12%), (d) difficult traffic flow (9%), and (e) unsafe road layout, including designated low-traffic bike routes, intersections, and tunnels (9%).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1524839912447191">
<title>Perceptions of Bicyclists</title>
<p>General perceptions of bicycle commuters were discussed, and most participants demonstrated a positive impression (30%). Others noted that their impressions were influenced by bicyclists’ behavior and failure to follow the rules of the road (18%). Some expressed fear for the bicyclists’ safety (9%) and a desire for them to be more visible (8%). When asked about personal reactions to bicyclists as a motorist, respondents indicated an initial attempt to give the bicyclist space (29%). Also expressed was the desire for the bicyclist to be predictable by following the rules of the road (19%) and irritation over bicyclists backing up traffic (13%). Again, the desire for bicyclists to be visible by wearing bright clothing or reflectors was discussed (11%). Some participants wanted bicyclists to stay in the bike lane or off the main road (5%).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1524839912447191">
<title>Bike-Share Development and Marketing</title>
<p>Assessment of pricing strategies and conditions for use help to gauge public value before implementation. In our survey, participants were given an explanation of a bike-share system as “stationary kiosks at locations around a city, where you can check out a bike for temporary use and then return it to any kiosk when you are finished.” Participants were then asked to rank their likelihood of using a bike-share system, given certain pricing conditions. Results are summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1524839912447191">Figure 2</xref>.</p>

<p>Participants designated the maximum price they might be willing to pay monthly in order to use a bike-share system. The average maximum amount was $20.89 (<italic>SD</italic> = 20.87, range: $5 to $100) monthly. Participants were asked whether they might consider using public transit to and from an established bike-sharing station, if a bike could be used to complete a portion of the trip. Most (69.4%) would consider using transit to and from a bike-sharing station. The remaining 30% that would not consider it specified reasons, of which the most common were lack of transit access (18%) and preference to use personal bike (18%).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Health, recreation, and transportation were the most frequently identified benefits of bicycling highlighted by focus group respondents, indicating that bike-share marketing might be most effective at attracting participants if it promoted these elements. Suggesting bike-share use for situations in which participants were most likely to use a bike may prompt the choice to choose this transportation mode instead of an automobile. Recreational rides in parks appear to be popular and can be an ideal way to get comfortable on a bike before riding in traffic.</p>
<p>Worksite support will play a major role in the success of bike-share programs. Employees provided additional physical and cultural supports for active transportation are more likely to walk or bike (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1524839912447191">Kaczynski, Bopp, &amp; Wittman, 2010</xref>). Our focus group and survey findings revealed practical limitations, including shower access and personal hygiene concerns, as barriers to bicycling during the day. Tangible worksite encouragement of active transportation by providing amenities might ease these barriers.</p>
<p>The perception that other coworkers use active transportation influences the likelihood of choosing walking or bicycling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1524839912447191">Wen, Kite, &amp; Rissel, 2010</xref>). Employees in workplaces that promote active travel are less likely to drive an automobile to work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1524839912447191">Wen et al., 2010</xref>). Therefore, internal promotion of the bike-share system by employers and employees can encourage use.</p>
<p>Traffic safety concerns were the second most frequently mentioned barrier to bicycling, and infrastructure and motorist behavior were cited as the top reasons that it is difficult to ride a bike. Negative perceptions of traffic are associated with less likelihood to walk or bike (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1524839912447191">Jacobsen, Racioppi, &amp; Rutter, 2009</xref>). Anxiety over riding a bike in traffic is not unfounded. In the United States in 2001, compared with motor vehicle occupants, pedestrians were 23 times more likely and bicyclists were 12 times more likely to be killed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1524839912447191">Pucher &amp; Dijkstra, 2003</xref>). Clearly marked bicycle-specific facilities reduce crashes and injuries among cyclists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1524839912447191">Reynolds, Harris, Teschke, Cripton, &amp; Winters, 2009</xref>). As of 2011, the Chattanooga metropolitan region has 90 miles of bike lanes, bike routes, and greenways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1524839912447191">Chattanooga-Hamilton County Regional Planning Agency, 2010</xref>), but these ride options are not efficiently connected to the downtown area and outlying residential areas in order to facilitate bicycle commuting. Focus group findings reveal that bike lanes and facilities are important, whether for perception of safety or for increasing separation from passing cars. Improved infrastructure for bicycling is recommended as a strategy to increase underrepresented population groups (e.g., women; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1524839912447191">Garrard, Rose, &amp; Lo, 2007</xref>). Bike-sharing may foster public demand and political will for bike lanes or bike facilities to separate bikes from cars.</p>
<p>A lack of motorist understanding of how to behave around bicyclists was expressed by participants. Tennessee’s driver’s license testing has not included extensive training on driving in close proximity with bicycles and pedestrians. In 2011, the Tennessee driver’s manual introduced language on sharing the road with bicyclists and pedestrians, which may serve as a basic education to new drivers on rules of the road. In the Netherlands and Germany, where bicycle and pedestrian injury rates are lower, driver training emphasizes the need to pay attention to walkers and cyclists to avoid crashes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1524839912447191">Pucher &amp; Dijkstra, 2003</xref>). Tennessee’s 3-foot law requires vehicles to leave not less than 3 feet of clearance until safely past the bicycle. Our focus group and survey responses indicate that this law is not well understood, observed, or enforced. This is not a Chattanooga-only problem; a recent report highlights that approximately half of U.S. cities demonstrate motorists’ failure to yield to bicyclists and pedestrians (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1524839912447191">Alliance for Biking and Walking, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Disobedience of traffic rules by bicyclists causes driver frustration, in turn negatively affecting the environment for bicyclists following traffic laws. Tennessee law requires bicyclists to ride with traffic, stop at stop signs and traffic signals, use lights at night, and ride as close to the right as is practical (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1524839912447191">Tennessee Traffic Safety Resource Service, 2011</xref>). Educating drivers and bicyclists on these laws and bicycling etiquette can enlighten both street users of what is allowed.</p>
<p>Capitalizing on the strong positive perceptions of bicycle commuters found in this study, even among noncommuters, is one tactic for raising public awareness of bicyclists. Personalizing commuter bicyclists might inspire nonbicyclists as they identify with their lifestyle and reasons for bicycling. Drivers might be more considerate of bicyclists if they recognize them as community members.</p>
<p>The bike-share system will be open to the public, meaning users do not have to demonstrate knowledge or skill before participation. Results reveal a lack of confidence and knowledge among inexperienced bicyclists, indicating a need for programs on bicycle safety and how to commute or run errands by bike. As discussed in the focus groups, organized bicycle groups can provide education and social support.</p>
<p>Regarding bike-share pricing, most participants favored the employer-funded option and seemed moderately likely to use the system, even with a per-use charge and annual fee. Incentives (e.g., a free helmet) might be necessary to garner initial involvement.</p>
<p>To decrease likelihood of bias in the results, assistance in the design and analysis of the focus groups and surveys was provided by an evaluation consultant from a local university. Although efforts were made to include a diverse set of focus groups, this study was limited to a convenience sample of those groups and persons interested in participation, thus introducing selection bias. Attracting nonbicyclists proved difficult because focus groups on bicycling tended to attract persons interested in bicycling. Results should be interpreted with caution in reference to minority populations, because only one focus group included Black participants, and only one Hispanic participant was included. Our results correspond with previous studies; however, our results might not be generalizable to other geographic areas. Although these limitations are of concern, the purpose of this project was not to research but to provide information on which to base local practice.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>This evaluation presents issues, challenges, and benefits associated with implementing a bike-share in a moderate-sized American city, along with a methodology that other cities could use to assess multiple levels of influence on bike-share participation. Insight into needs related to bicycling was provided, prompting ideas for promotion of the bike-share system. Concerns related to bicycling were raised, and future research on bike-share programs may assess whether the political will and culture to address these problems will be influenced. Bike-sharing stands to benefit from future research on tactics to market, use, and the impact of this novel approach to physical activity on the health and social circumstances of users.</p>
