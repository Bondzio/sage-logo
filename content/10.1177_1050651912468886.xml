            <p>This article reports the results of a qualitative study on the joint publication of research articles by a group of supervisors and graduate students in an Iranian university. The results indicate that the ministry-regulated incentive system for publication had increased the research output of the participants. It argues that material and credentialing incentives for supervisors can be regarded as symbolic violence in the exercise of disciplinary power, which required that the participants form local communities of practice and interconnect with international journal reviewers to get their articles published.</p>

      <p>English has long been the dominant lingua franca for academic publishing in various disciplines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1050651912468886">Hyland, 2006</xref>, pp. 25–27; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1050651912468886">Swales, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1050651912468886">Tardy, 2004</xref>, p. 250), which has had profound consequences for “periphery scholars” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1050651912468886">Canagarajah, 1996</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1050651912468886">2002</xref>). A primary cause of this dominance has been the imperialist status of English (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1050651912468886">Phillipson, 1992</xref>), resulting in the gradual extinction of local academic literacy in non-Anglophone countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1050651912468886">Swales, 1997</xref>). An important effect has been the push for periphery scholars to publish in English, often in journals that commercial publishers deem elite because of their <italic>impact factor</italic> (IF), an objective measurement of academic value. Calculated by one of the publishers, Thomson Reuters, a journal’s IF is the “quotient of the number of citations received in that year by papers published in that journal in the two preceding years and the number of ‘citable’ papers published in those two years” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1050651912468886">Ramsden, 2009</xref>, p. 139). In addition to previous criticisms leveled against this factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1050651912468886">Ramsden, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1050651912468886">Seglen, 1997</xref>), another criticism is that Thomson Reuters uses citations only to the journals it endorses, namely the journals that are indexed by the Institute for Scientific Information (ISI), part of the American-based Thompson Scientific.</p>
      <p>This culture of IF has led national higher education systems in peripheral countries to largely adopt an academic hegemony that has often pushed research into directions considered important by countries in the Anglophone center at the expense of those directions that may be more important to the development of nations, cultures, and economies beyond the Anglophone center. In fact, what the IF system considers prestigious research may not be the most useful, humane, or necessary research outside that center. For instance, the adoption of the IF system at the university in this study, which is regulated by the Iranian Higher Education system, has mostly led to the commodification of research, in which the currency is the IF of journals, exchangeable for monetary and credentialing rewards. This study, therefore, investigates the impact of the impact factor on the research lives of the least powerful players in this globalized system—the faculty and graduate students in a peripheral country.</p>
      <p>Within this context, I draw on three theoretical perspectives to understand the practice of joint publication by graduate students and their supervisors in an Iranian university: communities of practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1050651912468886">Lave &amp; Wenger, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1050651912468886">Wenger, 1998</xref>), sociopolitical dimensions of writing for scholarly publication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1050651912468886">Canagarajah, 1996</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1050651912468886">2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1050651912468886">Casanave, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1050651912468886">Lillis &amp; Curry, 2010</xref>), and the academic literacies tradition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1050651912468886">Lea &amp; Street, 1998</xref>). To pull together these perspectives, I use Foucault’s (1977) categorization of “disciplinary power,” which “derives . . . from the use of simple instruments; hierarchical observation, normalising judgement and their combination in a procedure that is specific to it, the examination” (p. 170). Although the original Foucauldian perspective concerned students, it can be extended to university professors. I argue that the incentive system at work in the university in this study included a sort of “hierarchical observation” by special committees, which enticed professors to perform in certain ways so that the committees would determine that they qualified for cash rewards and promotion. In turn, the professors, at a lower level of the institutional power hierarchy, formed local communities of practice and engaged their graduate students in research with the potential for publication.</p>
      <p>Quite relevant to this practice of joint publication is Bourdieu and Passeron’s (1990) concept of “symbolic violence,” which <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1050651912468886">Bourdieu (2001</xref>) defined as “a gentle violence, imperceptible and invisible even to its victims, exerted for the most part through the purely symbolic channels of communication and cognition” (pp. 1–2). The key feature of symbolic violence is “misrecognition,” or the “recognition [of domination] as legitimate” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1050651912468886">Bourdieu, 1991</xref>, p. 140). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1050651912468886">Webb, Schirato, and Danaher (2002</xref>) explained that misrecognition is a “form of forgetting,” in the sense that the dominated groups or individuals come to believe in the status quo as “natural” and “legitimate” and, often willingly, participate in the violence being exercised on them (p. 24). For instance, the professors in this study were led to act according to the university’s preferred modes of thinking and believing (i.e., publication in ISI-indexed journals) usually irrespective of their own modes of thinking and believing. In response to these institutional pressures, the professors exerted their own symbolic violence on their graduate students. In turn, the graduate students were led to regard joint publication of research articles with their supervisors as the legitimate mode for graduate education although, as I explain later, this was usually irrespective of their own competing beliefs regarding the genuine role of research to solve local problems. Thus, the exertion of disciplinary power and symbolic violence led the participants in this study, professors and students, to form local communities of practice and engage globally.</p>
      <p>I should emphasize, however, that I employ symbolic violence here as an analytic framework to understand how institutional power relations influence the conduct of less powerful people in a social context; I do not mean to imply a necessarily negative picture of the situation. Quite the reverse, I indicate that institutional power relations of domination might bring about good consequences—in this case, more research output. Nevertheless, the unparalleled weight given to the ISI-indexed publications in this context can be regarded as “misrecognition” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1050651912468886">Bourdieu, 1991</xref>, p. 140) because it led to a culture in which other indexing systems were given only marginal weight, if any, and the publications predominantly considered legitimate were those indexed in the ISI. Other indexing systems such as Education Resources Information Center (ERIC), Linguistics Abstracts, Sociological Abstracts, and Higher Education Abstracts were either totally ignored for earning “hard points” or were given only a lower rating in the point system at work in the university.</p>
      <p>In addition, the increase in research output did not seem to be associated with economic and social development “to overcome hunger [and] poverty,” contrary to what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1050651912468886">Salager-Meyer (2008</xref>, p. 122) believed. Nor did it seem to have much effect on the production of patents and significant new technologies—probably because researchers were primarily interested in getting published, and to get published, they needed to write on issues that were more relevant to the developed countries and of interest to center scholars (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1050651912468886">Lillis &amp; Curry, 2010</xref>, p. 5). This is in sharp contrast with the science and technology experts in Korea, who mainly consume and adapt “core knowledge [produced in western countries] to local practices” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1050651912468886">Hwang, 2005</xref>, p. 418). This lack of research resulting in patents and new technology has led some Iranian natural scientists to voice their concerns:</p>
      <disp-quote>
         <p>While probably two thirds of the research force in the industrial nations are engaged in developmental activities that lead to patents and new technologies, almost all of the researchers in developing countries . . . are merely doing research for its own sake [sic], thereby producing only scientific publications while rarely doing research with regard to innovative products or development of new technologies! (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1050651912468886">Mehrdad, Heydari, Sarbolouki, &amp; Etemad, 2004</xref>, p. 83)<sup>

            </sup>
         </p>
      </disp-quote>
      <p>In the following study, I argue that viewing the practice of joint publication through the analytic framework of symbolic violence will further add to our understanding of sociopolitical aspects of scholarly publication and contribute to our understanding of institutional power hierarchies within an academic literacies tradition.</p>

         <title>Theoretical Background</title>
         <p>The theory of communities of practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1050651912468886">Lave &amp; Wenger, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1050651912468886">Wenger, 1998</xref>) has attracted attention in many areas of inquiry, ranging from management (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1050651912468886">Handley, Sturdy, Fincham, &amp; Clark, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1050651912468886">Roberts, 2006</xref>) to education (see, e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1050651912468886">Flores, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1050651912468886">Fuller, Hodkinson, Hodkinson, &amp; Unwin, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1050651912468886">Hasrati, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1050651912468886">Hasrati &amp; Hashemi, 2011</xref>). Such studies investigated how communities of practice function in local contexts. This study, however, highlights the potential for geographically distributed communities of practice to interconnect. More specifically, this study reports how a group of graduate students and their supervisors in the fields of chemical engineering and chemistry in an Iranian university reacted to journal referees’ reviews of their submissions in a context of institutional disciplinary power and symbolic violence. Thus, this study also investigates the writing practices of academic writers for whom English is a foreign language.</p>
         <p>The concept of communities of practice was first introduced by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1050651912468886">Lave and Wenger (1991</xref>) in their ethnographic studies of groups of adults, including Vai and Gola tailors in Liberia, Yocatec Mayan midwives in Mexico, and nondrinking alcoholics participating in Alcoholics Anonymous. An important common feature of these studies was explained from the perspective of legitimate peripheral participation (LPP), which highlighted the situated nature of learning. Far from the individualistic orientation of behavioristic and cognitive perspectives, LPP underscores the social nature of learning. Newcomers to a community of practice are given peripheral tasks in primary stages of initiation into their respective communities in order to participate in social activities. Such peripheral participation endows legitimacy to newcomers, which can then lead to their participating in more important activities in their trajectories toward becoming established members.</p>
         <p>The LPP model is rooted in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1050651912468886">Vygotsky’s (1978)</xref> model of the zone of proximal development (ZPD), the focal point of which is the difference between what children can do alone and what they can do with assistance from adults or more capable peers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1050651912468886">Wood &amp; Wood, 1996</xref>). The ZPD was later translated into more concrete metaphors, such as <italic>apprenticeship</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1050651912468886">Duveen, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1050651912468886">Rogoff &amp; Lave, 1984</xref>) and <italic>scaffolding</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1050651912468886">Wood, Bruner, &amp; Ross, 1976</xref>). Thus, this idea applies to contexts in which older learners are involved, such as in Lave and Wenger’s (1991) study.</p>
         <p>The original LPP model was further unpacked by Wenger’s (1998) ethnographic investigation of a group of insurance claims processors. In this investigation, Wenger introduced three features of communities of practice: mutual engagement, joint enterprise, and a shared repertoire. He argued that members of a community of practice mutually engage, using a shared repertoire (tools, concepts, etc.) in pursuit of a joint enterprise.</p>
         <p>Although the original LPP model accounted for learning in “isolated groups” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1050651912468886">Kimble &amp; Hildreth, 2006</xref>, p. 328), Wenger’s (1998) later work provided a theoretical description of how separate communities of practice might interact through “constellations of practices” (p. 131). Nevertheless, researchers have mostly concentrated on communities of practice within single organizations or institutions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1050651912468886">Shaw, Baker, &amp; Edwards, 2006</xref>, p. 36). For instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1050651912468886">Simon-Maeda, Churchill, and Cornwall (2006)</xref> reported how eight PhD students in a Japanese university formed a community of practice through forums such as e-mail, focus groups, and editing workshops. Although these students had many features in common with the professors and students in the departments of chemistry and chemical engineering who participated in my study, such as being “periphery scholars” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1050651912468886">Canagarajah, 1996</xref>) and therefore not enjoying many of the benefits available to scholars in Anglophone academic centers, they showed an important difference. The Japanese students formed a local community of practice while the participants in my study, in addition to their local engagement, connected with mainstream communities of practice by submitting manuscripts reporting the results of their experiments to refereed international journals. In going beyond their local communities of practice, these participants were responding to the disciplinary power (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1050651912468886">Foucault, 1977</xref>) and symbolic violence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1050651912468886">Bourdieu &amp; Passeron, 1990</xref>) that was being exerted on them by the institution in which they worked, an institution that was itself regulated by ministerial pressures.</p>
         <p>Another area closely relevant to this study is the growing body of research on the sociopolitical nature of writing for scholarly publication by nonnative speakers of English (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1050651912468886">Canagarajah, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1050651912468886">Casanave, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1050651912468886">Lillis &amp; Curry, 2010</xref>). Along this line, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1050651912468886">Li and Flowerdew (2009</xref>) studied how a group of humanities and social sciences academics in Hong Kong published in English in internationally recognized journals as well as in Chinese. They concluded that publication in English was regarded as more prestigious because institutional policies attached more importance to internationally indexed journals. Also, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1050651912468886">Li (2006</xref>) investigated the process through which a PhD student in physics published an article, focusing on the “power-infused relationships” between the student, his supervisors, and journal gatekeepers.</p>
         <p>My study further contributes to this line of research by framing joint publication by PhD students and their supervisors in an Iranian university within a community of practice perspective, in a context of institutional disciplinary power and symbolic violence. The study will help us appreciate the “deeply social and political” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1050651912468886">Casanave, 2002</xref>, p. 30) situated activities of academic communities of practice. In addition, it will further highlight the need to study academic research cultures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1050651912468886">Deem &amp; Brehony, 2000</xref>) across the world.</p>
         <p>Finally, this study is also motivated by the academic literacies tradition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1050651912468886">Lea &amp; Street, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1050651912468886">Lillis, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1050651912468886">Turner, 1999</xref>), which regards writing as a social activity to be studied in social contexts. Such a perspective is different from the bulk of English for Academic Purposes (EAP) studies that focus on the textual and generic features of academic prose (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1050651912468886">Bhatia, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1050651912468886">Connor, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1050651912468886">dos Santos, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1050651912468886">Swales, 1990</xref>) and more in line with EAP research on nonlinguistic aspects of academic discourse communities (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1050651912468886">Hasrati &amp; Street, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1050651912468886">Hyland &amp; Hamp-Lyons, 2002</xref>). Viewing this study from the perspective of the academic literacies tradition enables us to understand the sociopolitical context of joint publication by situating this practice within the wider power-infused relationships between supervisors, graduate students, institutions, and ministerial bodies. The practice of joint publication by supervisors and graduate students, as we will later see, was largely regulated by institutional policies that provided financial and credentialing incentives for faculty to publish research articles. This finding supports previous research on the role of reward systems in the publication patterns of academics.</p>
         <p>For instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1050651912468886">Curry and Lillis (2004</xref>) reported how university reward systems at work in non–English-speaking countries affect the publication patterns of academics. They highlighted the point system at work in Spain, Hungary, and Slovakia and reported how the various carrot-and-stick systems affected academics’ publication practices. In Spain, the <italic>sexenio</italic> system required five publications over 6 years to qualify for a promotion though the unwritten rule required that two of the five publications be in English. In Hungary, publication in journals with a high IF was a key criterion in the university’s reward system to secure promotions and research grants. And in Slovakia, the annual review system would assess academics’ publication profiles. An unfavorable assessment could result in as much as a 30% decrease in the salary of an academic. In 2002, the government of Pakistan implemented a similar system that enabled researchers to quadruple their earnings by publishing in peer-reviewed journals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1050651912468886">Atta-ur-Rahman &amp; Nasim, 2004</xref>, p. 274).</p>

            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1050651912468886">Lillis and Curry (2010</xref>) extended their earlier analysis with ethnographic data from 50 scholars in four non-Anglophone contexts: Hungary, Slovakia, Spain, and Portugal, all based in Europe. My study adds to this area of research in various ways. It describes a non-Anglophone, non-European context. That is important because non-Anglophone European countries, which can be categorized within the “expanding circle” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1050651912468886">Kachru, 2001</xref>, p. 520), are privileged by their physical and traditional proximity to the English-speaking world whereas this is not necessarily true in an Iranian context. In addition, the four countries in Lillis and Curry’s study can be categorized as part of the center with regard to their economic positioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1050651912468886">Lillis &amp; Curry, 2010</xref>, p. 5) whereas Iran seems to be located on the periphery. My study also adds an “emic understanding” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1050651912468886">Pike, 1954</xref>), or a “voice from the inside,” to this area of inquiry specifically because it recounts a case of those at the lowest level of the power hierarchy of the incentive system in a country outside the Anglophone center, or even the European periphery.</p>

         <title>Academic and Financial Context</title>
         <p>As I have argued, an important factor in motivating the faculty in this study to connect with international journal referees seemed to be the financial and credentialing incentives that were regulated at the ministerial level and enforced by the university. To appreciate the impact of these incentives, we need to understand the payment and credentialing systems in Iranian universities.</p>
         <p>The payment system in Iranian universities is quite complicated. The faculty receive monthly payments for their teaching load: 8, 9, 10, and 12 hours per week for professors, associate professors, assistant professors, and lecturers, respectively. They receive extra payments for additional teaching and for supervising master’s or PhD students. Faculty also receive payments for their publications, which in some disciplines are often the result of a joint effort with their graduate students. These payments range from an equivalent of $200 to $700 per publication, depending on the journal in which the publication appears. Publications in ISI-indexed journals with the highest IF often reap the most remuneration, an equivalent of from $240 to $700, whereas those published in home-based research journals and in overseas non–ISI-indexed journals earn $240, and those published in home-based review journals earn $200.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1050651912468886">2</xref> 
            </sup>This payment system has sharply increased the number of publications by Iranian scientists in ISI-indexed journals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1050651912468886">King, 2004</xref>). As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1050651912468886">King (2004</xref>) reported, Iran’s total publications in ISI-indexed journals were 2,152 during the period from 1993 to 1997 and more than doubled to 4,813 in the following period from 1997 to 2003, which was the sharpest increase among the 31 countries in the study that produced over 98% of the world’s highly cited papers.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1050651912468886">3</xref>
            </sup> The cash reward was calculated by using a complicated formula in which journal IF and mean impact factor (MIF) were key elements. The higher the ratio of IF to MIF, the greater the reward would be for publication. As a result, some faculty in the study were quite selective regarding where they submitted their papers.</p>
         <p>The credentialing system in force at the time of the study required that faculty earn at least 10 hard points toward promotion to a higher academic position for publication of research papers in ISI-indexed journals.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1050651912468886">4</xref>
            </sup> Three different committees awarded points for each paper, and as in the payment system, points were allocated according to the journal’s IF and MIF and the beneficiary’s status within the order of the authors. Publications were weighted in the same order as in the payment system. The most points were allocated for publications in ISI-indexed journals whereas the least points were allocated for those in home-based review journals.</p>
         <p>This study’s finding that material and credentialing factors affect the publication patterns of faculty in all departments in the university can be certified by quantitative data over the 10-year period from 1999 to 2009 in which the reward system was enforced (see Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1050651912468886">1</xref>). Whereas the number of publications in each of the four journal categories (home-based research, home-based review, ISI-indexed, and overseas non–ISI-indexed) was more or less the same in 1999, the number of publications in ISI-indexed journals sharply increased in the 10-year period. Although I did not perform a statistical test of significance, the difference in the number of publications in each of the four categories indicates a complete correspondence to the weighting attached to each category in the payment and credentialing systems.</p>

         <title>Method</title>
         <p>This article reports part of a larger qualitative study of the academic literacy practices of faculty and graduate students in an Iranian university. The research started with different, though relevant, questions, and I arrived at the focus of this study gradually. A main objective of the initial project was to investigate the various writing practices of graduate students at the university in the study, among which the joint publication of research articles by graduate students and supervisors was a “rich point” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1050651912468886">Agar, 1996</xref>, p. 32) that proved to have certain features worthy of further investigation. Initial observations showed that joint publication of research articles by faculty and graduate students in the departments of chemistry and chemical engineering connected these participants as a local community of practice with international journal referees who belonged to other communities of practice. Thus, a main research question became, What are the driving forces behind joint publication? Or more specifically, How do material and credentialing factors influence the practice of joint publication?</p>
         <p>This study draws on a total of 13 interviews with four PhD students and three supervisors in the Department of Chemistry and one PhD student, three master’s students, and two supervisors in the Department of Chemical Engineering. In the Department of Chemistry, two of the supervisors were full professors with well over 100 publications, and the third was an associate professor with around 40 publications. In the Department of Chemical Engineering, one of the supervisors was a full professor with over 50 publications, and the second was an assistant professor with less than 10 publications. I conducted the interviews in Persian, and each lasted from 45 to 80 minutes.</p>
         <p>I interviewed faculty whom I personally knew, and these faculty subsequently referred me to their students. After conducting each interview, I transcribed and coded it in Persian. I then translated the coded parts into English. <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-1050651912468886">Appendix A</xref> lists a sample of the faculty version of the interview questions. (I reworded the questions for the students.) I validated the responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1050651912468886">Atkinson &amp; Hammersley, 2007</xref>, p. 181) by discussing a sample of interpretations with four participants: two PhD students and a faculty member in the Department of Chemistry and a master’s student of chemical engineering. In addition, I interviewed the participating professor at the Department of Chemical Engineering to check interpretations. I call these findings <italic>interpretations</italic> because they do not reflect objective realities but rather my interpretations resulting from my engagement with the data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1050651912468886">Charmaz, 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1050651912468886">2005</xref>). Furthermore, these findings cannot be generalized beyond the confines of the context. Nevertheless, this analysis may help us gain valuable insight into how institutional policies might affect joint publication.</p>
         <p>All participants used Persian as their first or official language. In addition, all courses were taught in Persian. The only activity conducted in English was joint publication. In addition, in the Department of Chemistry, theses were written in English by compiling already published joint articles. In the Department of Chemical Engineering, published joint articles were often first translated into Persian and then compiled as theses.</p>
         <p>I also analyzed the official course syllabi for master’s and PhD programs of chemistry and chemical engineering as provided by the Iranian Ministry of Science, Research, and Technology. Furthermore, I examined the “text histories” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1050651912468886">Lillis &amp; Curry, 2010</xref>) of four jointly written papers in these two departments, including all drafts, reviewers’ comments, and authors’ responses, as well as the official documents for tenure promotion and allocation of cash rewards for publication. The latter is a ministry-regulated guideline for paying faculty cash rewards for published papers. I also collected quantitative data on the publication patterns for faculty in all departments in the university over a 10-year period. My study was funded and approved by the Research Committee of an Iranian University. For ethical and confidentiality reasons, I do not refer to locations and individuals.</p>

         <title>Findings</title>
         <p>As I have already argued, material and credentialing incentives can be forms of “disciplinary power” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1050651912468886">Foucault, 1977</xref>) and “symbolic violence” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1050651912468886">Bourdieu &amp; Passeron, 1990</xref>), creating a context in which local academic communities of practice interconnect globally through their jointly produced papers. Within this perspective, joint publication can be regarded as a situated activity, affecting and being affected by various social forces at work in the academy while having important academic consequences that are useful to both supervisors and students. In this study, joint publication started when supervisors assigned their students cutting-edge research projects with the intention of getting the results published as research articles. The results of their laboratory projects were then written as article manuscripts and submitted to refereed journals. The journal reviewers’ comments were then employed to further revise the manuscripts and get them published. Finally, the already published research articles were compiled as theses.</p>
         <sec id="section5-1050651912468886">
            <title>Assigning Research Projects</title>
            <p>The process of joint publication started with supervisors assigning research projects to their students. During or immediately after the initial course work, students were inducted into a culture of working on separate and small-scale projects, referred to as <italic>works</italic>, and preparing the results of these works for publication. The supervisors often took a managerial role (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1050651912468886">Hawkins &amp; Shohet, 2006</xref>), helping students to focus on projects that had a high chance of being published. The supervisors seemed aware of the cutting edge of their professions, knowing “what winds [were] blowing in their intellectual zeitgeist” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1050651912468886">Berkenkotter &amp; Huckin, 1995</xref>, p. 3), and used this knowledge as a specific type of “cultural capital” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1050651912468886">Bourdieu &amp; Passeron, 1990</xref>), best described as intellectual capital, to lead their students in their projects and to fulfill their own credentialing needs. As one student commented, “getting papers published is important to supervisors. They never have you work on something that cannot be published” (PhD student 3, Chemistry).</p>
            <p>This point was reiterated by Professor 5 from chemical engineering, who explained that his main criterion for assigning a research topic was the publishability of its results. Professor 1 from chemistry believed that most students did not know the cutting edge of their profession, so he assigned them topics, but he was quick to add that publishing research papers was an important criterion in the process:</p>
            <disp-quote>
               <p>Most graduate students are not at a level to determine what counts as an up-to-date topic. That is why we assign them topics, and these should be in areas which can be later published.</p>
            </disp-quote>
            <p>The supervisors’ exceptional success in this managerial role was reinforced by their constant engagement with graduate students and recent publications. They seemed to have a system of identifying and recording the research gaps in their area of expertise, recognizing what research is doable, and using their graduate students as manpower to work on this research. They regularly updated this system through exposure to new publications, comments from journal reviewers, and their own writing.</p>
            <p>The research criterion of having scope for publication was mediated by available resources and “nondiscursive requirements” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1050651912468886">Canagarajah, 1996</xref>). Therefore, at the local level, the available chemicals and instruments were important factors affecting what could be done in the department, as Professor 2 in chemistry explained:</p>
            <disp-quote>
               <p>If we say this to our colleagues in universities in other countries, they might laugh at us, but this is the situation we find ourselves in at the moment. In fact, we tailor our students’ topics based on the chemicals we have in our laboratories.</p>
            </disp-quote>
         </sec>
         <sec id="section6-1050651912468886">
            <title>Submitting Papers</title>
            <p>After being assigned projects, the students spent most of their time in laboratories conducting the necessary experiments, collecting and analyzing data, and writing reports. To some degree, these tasks required their engagement as a local community of practice. The students often asked each other for help with laboratory equipment and regularly met in seminars chaired by their supervisors to present their works in progress. These “mutual engagements” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1050651912468886">Wenger, 1998</xref>) and interactions between senior and junior students indicated the local engagement that was ultimately aimed at getting these works published through global participation with journal reviewers.</p>
            <p>Once students had completed this laboratory work, their supervisors would ask them to organize their research within the framework of a target journal through modeling. The supervisors seemed to have a number of potential journals in mind when assigning topics, and depending on the quality of the work, they would focus on a specific journal at a later stage in the process. In other words, their choice of target journals was largely determined by the quality of the data and results of the work, on the one hand, and the IF of the journal, on the other hand. The higher quality works were often submitted to journals with higher IFs, a practice that can be traced to the university’s incentive system and that suggests the enactment of symbolic violence in the context.</p>
            <p>The students would then conduct a discourse analysis of different sections of articles published in their target journal and prepare a first draft of their own paper accordingly. This draft was often a brief text on their experiments, including procedures, findings, and, to some extent, interpretation of results. From this stage on, the supervisor took the lead by expanding on the brief text, making sure it was organized in the format of a research article and submitting them to a refereed journal.</p>
            <p>When the supervisors received comments from the journal referees, they would share these comments with the students, asking them to fix the methodological shortcomings in the paper; however, the supervisors would often revise theoretical aspects themselves. One PhD chemistry student said that the supervisor mostly acted as an intermediary between students and journal referees. He added that supervisors would often pass on referees’ comments and questions to students, asking them to provide answers, either in English or in Persian, which usually required more laboratory work and data collection. Supervisors then made sure these answers were technically and linguistically sound before sending the revised papers to the journal. As one student explained, “supervisors might answer the comments themselves, but this is very unlikely as they supervise many students and cannot remember details of what every student is doing” (PhD student 4, Chemistry).</p>
            <p>The corresponding author of such joint research papers was usually the supervisor because the institutional policy dictated that in order to receive cash rewards and credential points for a publication, the beneficiary must be cited as the corresponding author:</p>
            <disp-quote>
               <p>Journal reviewers’ comments go to the corresponding author, which is often the supervisor. When the supervisor receives this e-mail, he would forward it to me, and I will read the comments and answer all the comments. And like the initial submission, we then sit together, correct the paper, and it is finally resubmitted by my supervisor. (PhD student 8, Chemical Engineering)</p>
            </disp-quote>
            <p>This process was further confirmed by a supervisor:</p>
            <disp-quote>
               <p>Comments from journal reviewers are mostly about the quantity of the data. They, for example, say that the data is thin, and they ask you to collect more data. Or they ask you to do an experiment again. So when comments come in, you get in touch with the student and ask them to do the job. Once they have done so, they come to you with the data, and you will answer the reviewer comments. In fact, the student is the performer of your tasks. (Professor 3, Chemistry)</p>
            </disp-quote>
            <p>The reviewers’ feedback and authors’ responses could be regarded as virtual conversations between geographically distributed communities of practice. These conversations often involved extensive texts, with the longest including five reviews and around 3,700 words. The reviews contained various types of comments, such as requests to clarify methodological nuances, data interpretation, and grammatical points. The answers, which were also extensive, outlined the steps taken to collect further data, to clarify data collection procedures, and to improve the text. Such interactions had important academic consequences for the graduate students involved. As one student expressed, the reviewers’ comments enabled them to keep abreast with the cutting edge of their discipline and to evaluate their research:</p>
            <disp-quote>
               <p>In the same way that attending seminars helps us get familiar with different points of view, comments from foreign referees provide us with the opportunity to learn many different things. In fact, without international referees’ comments, we are in a closed space and cannot evaluate our work. (PhD student 1, Chemistry)</p>
            </disp-quote>
            <p>In addition, these virtual conversations with journal referees, though often intermediated by the supervisor, helped students address the gaps in their work and enrich their report:</p>
            <disp-quote>
               <p>You can easily understand [the educational value of comments by journal reviewers] by the amount of questions they put to you. One of the papers we submitted did not include much text, maybe 3 or 4 pages, and the rest were tables and diagrams, yet they had provided us with 4 pages of comments. This shows that they had read our work very carefully [and had asked us to do many things], like “do this,” “why didn’t you do that,” “how did you come up with this sort of result.” And we could get some ideas from their “why” questions. (MS student 7, Chemical Engineering)</p>
            </disp-quote>
            <p>In addition to supervising an average of seven graduate students, the supervisors participating in this study had various teaching commitments and administrative duties within the university and often at various other universities. Yet, they needed to prepare research papers and simultaneously help their students learn the research craft. Such joint publication was a productive strategy that not only materialized the publications that the supervisors needed but also largely compensated for their having little contact with students. In fact, in terms of publication, these two departments were among the most productive at the university, probably because the supervisors deliberately devised projects that were publishable and put themselves and their graduate students in interactions with referees of international journals. Such interactions with international journal referees enabled these scholars in a “peripheral country” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1050651912468886">Swales, 1990</xref>, p. 100; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1050651912468886">Canagarajah, 1996</xref>) to be part of the “network” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1050651912468886">Belcher, 2007</xref>, p. 2) in order to get their work published in international journals.</p>

            <title>From Articles to Theses</title>
            <p>In the Department of Chemistry, the last stage for students in the PhD process was to compile the joint research articles that had been published into a PhD thesis written in English, quite similar to a strategy referred to as the “article compilation theses/dissertations” (Council of Graduate Schools in the U.S. Report, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1050651912468886">1991</xref>, p. 20). In the Department of Chemical Engineering, though, the theses were often compiled in Persian:</p>
            <disp-quote>
               <p>When we finish each work, we write them as articles and send them for publication in international journals or for presentation in national seminars. For example, I now have 14 works, four of which I have published, and I have presented the other 10 in national seminars…. When the time comes for the oral exam, my supervisor would ask me to write the thesis, and he would outline its general framework, but he would also ask for my own views. (PhD student 3, Chemistry)</p>
            </disp-quote>
            <p>The thesis, however, would articulate the detailed research process, including the complex calculations and computer outputs that were not described in the research articles. In addition, the thesis would include an extended introduction and conclusion, providing a sense of completeness. Here is one student’s description of the thesis:</p>
            <disp-quote>
               <p>My thesis was in fact the collection of the reports I had submitted to the power plant [which had partly funded my project] together with some theoretical readings and also the computer simulations I had carried out. These, of course, were already published in joint papers with my supervisor. (MS student 6, Chemical Engineering)</p>
            </disp-quote>
            <p>The graduate education practices discussed here, including the assignment of topics, submission and publication of papers, and compilation of published articles as theses, can be regarded as “misrecognition” in that both the supervisors and the graduate students considered this process as doxa—the natural order of things—or as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1050651912468886">Bourdieu (1977</xref>) put it, “the universe of the undisputed” (p. 168), “which is beyond question and which each agent tacitly accords by the mere fact of acting in accord with social convention” (p. 169). These practices conform with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1050651912468886">Bourdieu and Wacquant’s (1992)</xref> assertion that “symbolic violence is the violence . . . which is exercised upon a social agent with his or her complicity” (p. 167).</p>
         </sec>
         <sec id="section8-1050651912468886">
            <title>Rewards and Prestige</title>
            <p>The practice of joint publication in this study was mainly regulated by institutional policies regarding material and credentialing benefits for publication. The university offered faculty the highest cash rewards for internationally published papers that were indexed in ISI. And as I explained previously, these cash rewards were in addition to faculty salaries and remuneration for extra teachings and supervision of theses.</p>
            <p>Although joint publication had material and credentialing benefits for the supervisors, the senior faculty were also conscious of their reputation, so they took on the responsibility of corresponding with journals and did not always relinquish this authority to their students, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1050651912468886">Blakeslee (1997</xref>) has also observed (p. 154). But the junior faculty in this context seemed differently oriented. They were more conscious of their need for promotion and seemed to prioritize quantity over quality.</p>
            <p>Although students did not share in the cash rewards, they also benefited from this process. Publication for master’s students increased their chances of continuing with their PhDs. It also enriched PhD students’ curriculum vitae so that they had better prospects of finding a job and making a career:</p>
            <disp-quote>
               <p>When a student wants to continue towards a PhD, or get employed, it’s an advantage to have publications. I had (an MSc) student who had published two papers in journals with high impact factors, and he was accepted to PhD courses in various universities. And this was partly due to his two published papers. (Professor 3, Chemistry)</p>
            </disp-quote>
            <p>The participants regarded publication in the ISI-indexed journals as highly prestigious, which indicates their “complicity” (Bourdieu &amp; Wacquant’s, 1992, p. 167) in undergoing symbolic violence. For the faculty, this prestige was associated with remuneration and promotion, and for the students, it was associated with enriching their curriculum vitae and finding a job. Nevertheless, some students were concerned that their research was primarily tailored toward being published rather than toward helping local practice, a situation contrary to that in Korea (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1050651912468886">Hwang, 2005</xref>, p. 418). One of the students voiced this concern by giving the following example:</p>
            <disp-quote>
               <p>Birjand University is accepting PhD students in analytic chemistry. Now in Birjand they don’t have healthy drinking water, and the primary responsibility of a chemist is to make this water healthy. So what will people get out of this research . . . if I can’t make this water drinkable. Life starts with water, instead of getting a PhD, I should work on the water . . . [Also] Kurdestan has huge gold resources, but why should foreigners work on them? So what’s the use of my analytic chemistry? (PhD student 4, Chemistry)</p>
            </disp-quote>
            <p>Thus, regardless of their complicity in the symbolic violence, the participants were often conscious of alternative modes of research that could be geared toward overcoming local problems rather than merely toward achieving publication in an ISI-indexed journal.</p>

         <title>Discussion and Conclusion</title>
         <p>In this study, I framed material and credentialing incentives as implicit in the disciplinary power (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1050651912468886">Foucault, 1977</xref>) being exerted in a hierarchical manner over university professors and graduate students. This power has led to the formation of local academic communities of practice that interconnect with journal reviewers. Bourdieu and Passeron’s (1990) concept of symbolic violence is another heuristic for understanding the role of institutional policies regarding rewards for publication. The concepts of disciplinary power and symbolic violence help us to understand the interplay of local engagement and global participation in academic communities of practice.</p>
         <p>
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1050651912468886">Wenger (1998</xref>) seemed to present communities of practice as self-contained organisms mostly regulated by internal forces and factors. I argue for a new understanding of communities of practice that takes into account external forces that could affect the formation and behavior of such communities. Wenger used the term <italic>mutual engagement</italic> to refer to the local connections between members of a community of practice and <italic>participation</italic> to refer to the global connections between related communities of practice in the same organization (p. 131). I build on Wenger’s distinction between the two terms to argue that the situation in this study is a “telling case” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1050651912468886">Mitchell, 1984</xref>, p. 239) that illustrates the interplay of local engagement and global participation in geographically distributed communities of practice.</p>
         <p>At the local level, graduate students and supervisors in the departments of chemistry and chemical engineering obviously displayed the three features of communities of practice. First, they had come together for a joint enterprise. Although they were not pursuing common personal objectives, they had decided that engaging in such joint activities in their respective departments could help them to achieve their individual objectives. Second, they mutually engaged as needed to make their practice tangible. And third, they resorted to a shared repertoire, including theories, experiments, techniques, and laboratory equipment. At the global level, they participated in virtual interactions with journal referees of internationally indexed journals in order to get their works published. My data suggest that joint publication in the departments of chemistry and chemical engineering was a productive strategy that linked peripheral communities of practice with Anglophone communities of practice to compensate for having a shortage of material resources and little access to supervisors.</p>
         <p>Thus, the graduate students in the study were provided with opportunities to learn through LPP not only at the local level but also at a global level. Their participation in the assigned topics, experiments, and coauthorship of joint papers provided them with legitimacy as newcomers to their academic communities of practice at the local level whereas their participation in the review process of international journals provided them with learning possibilities beyond their local communities of practice.</p>
         <p>I argue that the joint publication of papers by supervisors and graduate students in this study was largely affected by disciplinary power and symbolic violence exercised through material and credentialing incentives. The supervisors gained the credentials necessary for promotion and cash rewards for joint publications, and the students enriched their curriculum vitae for better prospects of finding a job.</p>
         <p>But interestingly, when I examined the course syllabi, I did not find any reference to this practice of joint publication (see, e.g., <xref ref-type="app" rid="app2-1050651912468886">Appendix B</xref>). Instead, the realities of the context—the financial incentives introduced by the university, the high teaching loads and supervisory commitments of the supervisors, and the significance that getting published had for academic staff and graduate students—provided for the situation described here. In other words, joint publication seemed to have its own hidden syllabus that was regulated by unwritten rules of conduct.</p>
         <p>There are still questions, though, that need to be answered. For instance, what disciplinary particulars made this strategy possible in chemistry and chemical engineering but not in other disciplines? Because research in chemistry is “firmly based upon one or more past scientific achievements” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1050651912468886">Kuhn, 1996</xref>, p. 10), the production of knowledge is seemingly equivalent to presenting the results of laboratory experiments in textual templates often borrowed from published research. In this context, in which primacy is given to the originality of science rather than language (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1050651912468886">Flowerdew &amp; Li, 2007</xref>, p. 461), nonnative-speaking natural scientists would seem to be better off than their nonnative-speaking colleagues in the social sciences and humanities. My initial examination of articles published by these participants seems to support this hypothesis although this needs to be further investigated. Also the incentive policies of various national systems should be compared and investigated to see how they influence research topics. And finally, further investigation is needed to explore the degree to which research geared toward appealing to center countries is beneficial for the periphery nations.</p>

                  <list-item>
                     <p>Objectives The doctorate in chemistry is the highest university course in this field which will lead to the award of a PhD in chemistry, and includes a coordinated set of education and research related activities. Amongst important objectives of this, in addition to train academic members of staff, is to train creative academics who can think independently and acquire advanced research methodologies and can develop expertise in one or more areas in chemistry. They should also be able to appreciate problems in the academic community and be able to provide solutions to such problems. In this course, innovation and expansion of knowledge is of special importance and forms the specific objective of graduates.</p>

                  <list-item>
                     <p>The Course The doctorate in chemistry includes educational and research-related modules: The Educational Module: This phase starts upon admittance of applicant to the course. The aim of this module is to rectify information deficits of the students, and through taking certain advanced courses, such deficits are rectifies. The module comes to an end by taking the comprehensive exam. The Research Module: This starts upon completion of the educational module and a pass mark in the comprehensive exam. The aim for this module is to acquaint the student with research methods and develop the necessary abilities to conduct research in one or more areas in chemistry which can lead to innovations in chemistry. This module comes to an end with the writing of a PhD thesis.</p>

               <p>While doing research for its own sake often has a positive connotation, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1050651912468886">Mehrdad, Heydari, Sarbolouki, and Etemad (2004</xref>) probably meant research to get published or research for publication, as the rest of the quotation makes evident.</p>

               <p>Although there are no clear definitions for research journals and review journals in the Iranian context, the former often publish papers based on original research and are therefore considered more prestigious.</p>

               <p>The qualitative evidence in my study, however, does not support a recent claim that relates the increase in Iranian scientists’ publications to Iran’s nuclear program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1050651912468886">Archambault, 2010</xref>).</p>

               <p>The points for publication were increased to a minimum of 15 points in a revision of the policy in 2010, but the emphasis on ISI-indexed publications was dropped. Although the effect of this policy change is yet to be seen, submissions to home-based journals are likely to increase. For instance, I published a paper in a home-based journal a few years ago, the whole process of which took around 3 months. In a recent correspondence with the same journal, I found that the same process would now take a minimum of 5 years.</p>
