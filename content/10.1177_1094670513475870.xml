<abstract>
<p>Remote services are often provided without customer-provider contact for remote diagnostics, repair, and maintenance purposes in business-to-business industries such as information technology, medical health care, and mechanical engineering. Two empirical studies (Studies 1 and 2) suggest that numerous characteristics of remote services are critical to customer satisfaction: (1) security, (2) reliability, (3) level of process integration, (4) economic benefit, (5) post-provision documentation, (6) exchange options, (7) individualization, and (8) support services. Study 3 revealed a paradox that complicates service provision—a situation in which customers experience ambivalent feelings toward service separation as associated with remote services. They express (i) a strong desire to be part of the remote service provision in order to maintain control over the process, while at the same time, (ii) for personal and contractual reasons they do not want to be integrated into the process. Satisfaction levels were found to vary depending on how customers assess physical and mental service separation. We identified service initiation as a situational factor influencing the shift from a positive to a negative assessment of service separation. To prevent customer dissatisfaction, service providers should integrate customers into service provision for provider-initiated services, whereas for customer-initiated services they should not bring the customer in.</p>

<p>During the last decade, service industries were subject to considerable changes with respect to the way services are conceived, provided, and delivered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1094670513475870">Curran and Meuter 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1094670513475870">Dabholkar 1994</xref>). The increasing employment of information technologies alters not only the nature of services and their delivery process' (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1094670513475870">Bitner, Brown, and Meuter 2000</xref>) but also the interaction at the interface between customers and service providers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1094670513475870">Zeithaml, Bitner, and Gremler 2006</xref>). Innovative technologies enable service transactions over the internet, and services are generated without establishing personal contact. In the business-to-business context, remote services constitute this emerging type of technology-mediated service. Contrasting self-services where the <italic>customer</italic> produces the service, independent of the involvement of a service provider employee (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1094670513475870">Meuter et al. 2000</xref>), remote services are defined as technology-mediated services that exclusively allow the <italic>service provider</italic> to access and modify connected service objects over long distances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1094670513475870">Schumann, Wünderlich, and von Wangenheim 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>Particularly in high-technology industries such as information technology (IT), medical health care, and mechanical engineering, remote services are established instruments that are often used for maintenance, diagnostics, and repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1094670513475870">Biehl, Prater, and McIntyre 2004</xref>). For example, medical equipment vendors complement their offerings for customers by providing remote services for the maintenance of high-tech equipment (e.g., computerized tomography [CT] scanners). Through use of IT infrastructure, customer’s machines and systems are remotely connected to the service provider. These connections allow permanent, real-time remote monitoring of the interconnected objects. When remote monitoring detects technical problems or system irregularities, the service provider is alerted. Immediately, a service provider engineer (often located overseas) remotely accesses the customer’s system—in this example, a CT scanner in a U.S. hospital—to diagnose and remotely repair system failures, without needing to involve the customer's technician or send local field-service engineer to the site. In numerous situations, problems can be solved remotely before they cause more serious damage, as in the example of intensifying the cooling of a machine before a technical device overheats.</p>
<p>Although remote services are currently an emerging type of technology-mediated service, they are predicted to become the fastest growing technology-driven IT service within the next few years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1094670513475870">DuBay 2009</xref>), and investments are forecasted to increase to US$350 billion in 2014 (Harbor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1094670513475870">Research 2010</xref>). Surprisingly, however, limited empirical research has been conducted to examine customer perceptions of the remote service technologies that are delivered from the provider, and how they are used by the customer to maintain production equipment in business-to-business settings. Remote services have the potential to be beneficial for both service providers and customers, particularly on the basis of the increased flexibility regarding delivery of service, the time saved in problem solving, and the reduction in costs related to unanticipated system failures and travel expenses for specialized technicians (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1094670513475870">Schumann, Wünderlich, and von Wangenheim 2012</xref>). Despite these potential advantages, the acceptance among customers remains fairly low (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1094670513475870">Wünderlich, von Wangenheim, and Bitner 2012</xref>), which underscores the importance of further investigation into these services.</p>
<p>Recently, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1094670513475870">Keh and Pang (2010</xref>) studied customers’ reactions to service separation—the customers’ absence from service production—which is often the case for remote services. Though increasing reliance on technology would suggest a need to better understand the conditions consequent to service separation, the literature provides little information. Except for the study from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1094670513475870">Keh and Pang (2010</xref>), previous research has neither elaborated on nor empirically examined the implications of service separation for customers. As a first study providing evidence for the impact of separation on the service experience, Keh and Pang explicitly recommend examining the effects of service separation on the five dimensions of service quality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1094670513475870">Parasuraman, Zeithaml, and Berry 1988</xref>). Motivated by this apparent gap in the literature, we focus our research on (a) the exploration of factors determining a satisfying service experience in business-to-business encounters and (b) empirically testing the role of different levels of service separation in service evaluation.</p>
<p>Against this background, the contribution of this article is two-fold First, we contribute to the literature by exploring the drivers of remote service satisfaction, including security in remote service encounters, reliability of remote services, economic benefits, exchange options between service provider and customer, post-provision documentation, individualization of delivered remote services, and supported service. Although extensive research has been conducted on e-services, and particularly on e-service quality, and though improved e-quality scales continue to be developed (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1094670513475870">Kaynama and Black 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1094670513475870">Loiacono, Watson, and Goddhue 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1094670513475870">Parasuraman, Zeithaml, and Malhotra 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1094670513475870">Yoo and Donthu 2001</xref>), most of the studies focus on B2C websites such as e-retailing and online banking, which have little in common with remote services. Due to the specific characteristics of remote services that are offered primarily in B2B settings, we identified two new drivers of remote service satisfaction (as well as several new attributes and subdimensions) that have not been examined in the previous research on e-service quality or in the related streams of literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1094670513475870">Keh and Pang 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1094670513475870">Wünderlich, von Wangenheim, and Bitner 2012</xref>). We develop measures that will enable managers to assess the satisfaction level of their customers, and to increase the adoption of remote services.</p>
<p>Second, our research reveals that different levels of service separation (or, conversely, levels of customer integration) complicate the creation of a satisfying customer experience. We identify the existence of a paradox that we refer to as the <italic>service separation/customer integration paradox</italic>. A key selling point of these remote services is that they are installed in order to reduce the contact between the customer and the provider. We found that customers experience ambivalent feelings towards these services. On one hand, they express a strong wish to be part of the remote service provision in order to retain control over the process. On the other hand, for personal and contractual reasons, they express a simultaneous—and paradoxical—desire to not be integrated into the process. Literature suggests that situational and contextual factors may influence the occurrence of these positive or negative feelings associated with technology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1094670513475870">Mick and Fournier 1998</xref>). We identified service initiation as a factor influencing the shift from positive to negative evaluations of service separation. Consequently, satisfaction levels were found to vary depending on whether customers viewed their integration level as positive or negative. More specifically, we found that for provider-initiated services, providers must involve customers in the service provision in order to prevent customer dissatisfaction, whereas for customer-initiated services, providers should keep the customer out of the process. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1094670513475870">Handy (1994</xref>) argues that the ability to manage paradoxes is key to corporate success in today’s high-tech world. Our study provides managers with a useful understanding of when to separate services and when to integrate the customer into the delivery process, enabling them to better market the remote services.</p>
<p>The remainder of this article is organized as follows. We first review prior research on the satisfaction drivers and e-service quality, and summarize prior research regarding the paradoxes of technology. Study 1 then details the methodology of our qualitative study, which enables us to identify the satisfaction drivers. In Study 2, we detail the quantitative research which we conducted to empirically test the impact of the remote satisfaction drivers. In Study 3, we present survey data collected from 118 remote services customers, allowing us to assess the service separation/customer integration paradox.</p>

<title>E-Service Quality and Customer Satisfaction</title>
<p>Although the antecedents to customer satisfaction are well documented in classical contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1094670513475870">Szymanski and Henard 2001</xref>), for self-services (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1094670513475870">Meuter et al. 2000</xref>), and for e- or online services (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1094670513475870">Holloway and Beatty 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1094670513475870">Zeithaml, Parasuraman, and Malhotra 2002</xref>), customer satisfaction in a remote services context has not been subjected to conceptual or empirical scrutiny. Although most research has been done on e-services, and on e-service quality and its dimensions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1094670513475870">Rust and Kannan 2003</xref>), the identified drivers of customer satisfaction<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1094670513475870">1</xref>
</sup> are assumed to be different due to the distinct characteristics of remote services.</p>
<p>Numerous scales and quality dimensions have been derived from traditional service quality research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1094670513475870">Parasuraman, Zeithaml, and Berry 1985</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1094670513475870">1988</xref>). The SERVQUAL scale serves as an assessment basis and has been extended to the measurement of e-service quality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1094670513475870">Parasuraman, Zeithaml, and Malhotra 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1094670513475870">Zeithaml, Parasuraman, and Malhotra 2002</xref>). Previously identified dimensions include site features and website design (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1094670513475870">Dabholkar 1996</xref>), security and privacy concerns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1094670513475870">Yoo and Donthu 2001</xref>), reliability of the website (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1094670513475870">Madu and Madu 2002</xref>), responsiveness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1094670513475870">Kaynama and Black 2000</xref>), communication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1094670513475870">Cox and Dale 2001</xref>), information provided on the website (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1094670513475870">Yang and Fang 2004</xref>), accessibility of the website (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1094670513475870">Zeithaml, Richards, and Richards 2002</xref>), delivery of the service (Loiacono, Watson, and Goodhue 2000), personalization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1094670513475870">Yoo and Donthu 2001</xref>), ease of use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1094670513475870">Dabholkar 1996</xref>), and customer support (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1094670513475870">Holloway and Beatty 2008</xref>). Most related studies conceptualize e-service quality for B2C websites, e-retailers, or online banks, which are different from remote services.</p>
<p>In addition to these studies on scales and dimensions, we investigated recent studies that examine the perception of smart interactive services (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1094670513475870">Wünderlich, von Wangenheim, and Bitner 2012</xref>). Smart interactive services are defined as services that are delivered to or through intelligent products (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1094670513475870">Allmendinger and Lombreglia 2005</xref>), but require a high level of interaction between customer and provider during the service delivery. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1094670513475870">Wünderlich, von Wangenheim, and Bitner (2012)</xref> show empirically that social presence, control, trustworthiness, and collaboration influence a user’s attitudinal and behavioral response to smart interactive services. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1094670513475870">Keh and Pang (2010</xref>) found, as well, that risk perception (psychological and performance risk), access convenience (contact options with providers), and benefit convenience (customer’s time and effort) are relevant to the assessment of separated services.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1094670513475870">
<title>The Paradoxes of Technology and Customer Satisfaction</title>
<p>A primary characteristic of the paradox is a simultaneous existence of opposite assumptions or statements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1094670513475870">Handy 1994</xref>). Research in this field suggests that individuals simultaneously experience conflicting positive and negative feelings regarding different components of an object or person (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1094670513475870">Cowles and Crosby 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1094670513475870">Ruth, Brunel, and Otnes 2002</xref>), creating a condition of behavioral paradox. In an application of paradox theory to the modern state of technology, the literature on interaction between people and technology suggests that customers simultaneously experience favorable and unfavorable views about technology-based products and services (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1094670513475870">Mick and Fournier 1998</xref>). On one hand, the technology infusion can lead to beneficial service-encounter outcomes for customers, but on the other hand, it can also be associated with several negative outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1094670513475870">Bitner 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1094670513475870">Bitner, Brown, and Meuter 2000</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1094670513475870">Mick and Fournier (1998</xref>) make specific connections to the concept of paradox in the context of humans and technology. They identified eight “paradoxes of technology” that can trigger both positive and negative feelings at the same time and that create complications for consumers. Their study shows that technology can lead to (1) control and chaos, (2) freedom and enslavement, (3) new and obsolete, (4) competence and incompetence, (5) efficiency and inefficiency, (6) fulfillment of needs and creation of needs, (7) assimilation and isolation, and (8) simultaneous engagement and disengagement. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1094670513475870">Johnson, Bardhi, and Dunn (2008</xref>) argue that in these conditions, the negative feelings have the potential to substantially undermine customer satisfaction, and their research provides evidence that some paradoxes can be linked with the satisfaction of self-service customers. Although positive and negative feelings about technology coexist, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1094670513475870">Mick and Fournier (1998</xref>) indicate that, as well, situational and contextual factors such as technology context, personal context, organizational context, and cultural context may influence the occurrence of these positive or negative feelings.</p>
<p>While extensive research has been conducted on the perception of technology in general, and the potential barriers to its successful implementation, little empirical research is available on the existence of the paradoxes of technology. Even less is known about situational factors influencing the shift from positive to negative service evaluations when a customer experiences ambivalent feelings towards a service technology.</p>

<title>Data Collection</title>
<p>We have chosen a qualitative exploratory research approach within the health care industry to develop a better understanding of the drivers of satisfaction with remote service technology. The examined global medical equipment provider produces high-tech equipment such as X-rays, CT scanners, and MRIs, and at the same time the provider offers remote services for the maintenance of this equipment. Using two online focus groups with participants from nine different hospitals, we gathered initial responses in order to gain insight into possible satisfaction drivers. Then, we conducted 25 in-depth interviews with 20 remote service customers<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1094670513475870">2</xref>
</sup> and with 10 employees of remote service providers at eleven different hospitals.</p>
<p>The interviews lasted from 60 to 120 minutes, and interviewers followed an informal interview guide. We used a critical incident technique style (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1094670513475870">Bitner et al. 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1094670513475870">Flanagan 1954</xref>) to ask questions about general satisfaction and perceived service performance. For the coding process, we followed an inductive approach for category development, allowing categories and patterns to emerge from the data without applying prior assumptions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1094670513475870">Patton 2009</xref>) by using the software program GABEK (Holistic Processing of Linguistic Complexity). The quality of the coded judgments was verified by the proportional reduction in loss (PRL) reliability measure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1094670513475870">Rust and Cooil 1994</xref>). In our study, the PRL is .93, which can be considered to be good because it is higher than the suggested minimum of .8. Then, we tested the identified categories in several steps and with different groups of participants following an iterative classification approach.<sup>

<title>Drivers of Remote Services Satisfaction</title>
<p>The following eight categories emerged from the in-depth interviews:
<list list-type="simple">
<list-item>
<p>
<italic>Security in remote service encounters </italic>refers to risk exposure associated with remote service technology. It includes customers’ security and privacy concerns about the technology-mediation of the service, their concerns about the providers’ free access to customer systems where confidential data is stored, and concerns about the limited customer control over provider activities.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>
<italic>Reliability of remote services </italic>refers to the accuracy and the continuous delivery of the maintaining service. This category includes reliability of the service technology and the fulfillment of agreed-upon actions.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>
<italic>Exchange options between service provider and customer </italic>subsumes channels of personal communication being offered to the customer. Onsite customer service refers to personal interaction, to the field service engineer for technical repair on site, and to the providers’ service center that handles inquiries by telephone or e-mail.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>
<italic>Economic benefit </italic>refers to the customer’s economic advantages from remote services, which are manifested in a number of forms: increased utilization capacity of the machines, greater availability and extended uptime of the systems, time benefits due to faster provider reactions, support and problem solving, cost benefits, and pricing of remote services.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>
<italic>Post-provision documentation </italic>refers to the documentation of provider activities after the service delivery, which is done to better evaluate the services that were provided. This includes the transparency of providers’ activities, as well as the recording of service actions to make the evidence understandable for the customer, as well as the notification about the service provision and the documentation of a service history.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>
<italic>Individualization of delivered remote service </italic>addresses the remote service providers’ efforts to give individual treatment to customers in the technology-based remote service encounters. Preferred support, particularly in emergency situations, as well as the use of specific knowledge during the service provision, are all aspects of the individualization of delivered remote service.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>
<italic>Level of process integration </italic>refers to the way remote service processes are integrated into the working procedures. This category includes the preparation phase, the maintenance phase, and the follow-up phase, which is carried out from the provider’s site, as well as the integration of service technology into the customer’s workflow.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>

<title>Equivalence of Dimensions and Perceptual Attributes</title>
<p>Comparing the dimensions of e-service quality developed from prior studies with the dimensions that participants discussed in the in-depth interviews provides several useful observations. Participants in the in-depth interviews frequently discussed the themes of security, reliability, economic benefit, and individualization, elements that are also key dimensions or subdimensions of e-service quality. While several perceptual attributes of remote service satisfaction remain the same as in e-service quality (e.g., economic benefit or reliability), some of the perceptual attributes of the economic benefit of remote services dealt with remote service-specific issues such as capacity utilization and uptime of machines, attributes not found in e-service quality scales. Similarly, we find differing attributes for individualization (e.g., prioritizing of customers in emergency situations or the use of customer-specific knowledge for individualized maintenance) and security (e.g., open access to confidential customer and patient data). Moreover, two new dimensions or subdimensions were discovered: the level of process integration and the support services.</p>
<p>The <italic>level of process integration</italic> can be regarded as a distinct result from our study that is particularly relevant for B2B services. The service delivery must be fully integrated into the providers’ processes, and also into the customers’ workflow, so that both sides can benefit from the technology-mediated service delivery. Machine maintenance can be scheduled at night, so that the machine is guaranteed to be available during working hours. A smooth remote maintenance also means that customers’ processes are not disturbed by the service delivery. Process integration failures lead to customer dissatisfaction regarding service technologies and might influence the future use of the technology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1094670513475870">Meuter et al. 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>
<italic>Support services </italic>are offered because of the customer’s expressed wish for specific training to properly understand the remote service processes. Based on the customer’s greatly enhanced experience level over time, the possibility for mutual learning with the goal of improving future service offerings is increased. Providers should offer regular round-table discussions and workshops to exchange ideas, as a way to advance systems and services that will benefit the customers and that have the possibility to be mutually beneficial to customers and service providers alike.</p>
<p>Because we are interested in comparing the relative impact of the eight drivers of overall satisfaction with remote services, we propose:
<list list-type="simple">
<list-item>
<p>
<italic>Hypothesis 1a–h:</italic> Satisfaction with remote services increases as perceptions of remote service (a) security, (b) reliability, (c) level of process integration, (d) economic benefit, (e) post-provision documentation, (f) exchange options, (g) individualization, and (h) support services become more positive, all else being equal.</p>

<title>Study 2</title>
<p>To validate the findings from the in-depth interviews, we decided to conduct an additional quantitative study to give further evidence for the proposed determinants of remote service satisfaction. We collected 47 questionnaires in a second industry, the IT industry, in which a software provider has established remote services to remotely maintain, diagnose, and repair failures for its B2B customers.</p>
<p>Overall satisfaction with remote services is measured by adapting three commonly employed measures of satisfaction: general satisfaction, confirmation of expectations, and the distance from the customer’s hypothetical ideal product (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1094670513475870">Fornell 1992</xref>). Measurement reliability of the reflective construct “overall satisfaction” was examined through a confirmatory factor analysis. It can be noted that the composite reliability (CR) for this construct exceeds .6, the generally recommended threshold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1094670513475870">Bagozzi and Yi 1988</xref>). The items for capturing the provider performance are grounded in our qualitative data. Most items were measured using 5-point Likert-type scales with anchors of 1 = <italic>poor job</italic> and 5 = <italic>excellent job</italic> (except overall satisfaction: 1 = <italic>strongly disagree</italic> and 5 = <italic>strongly agree</italic>). Although most prior studies conceptualize the dimensions using reflective measures, especially in the field of service quality (Loiacono, Watson, and Goodhue 2000), recent indicators have shown that the dimensions of many service quality scales are falsely assumed to be reflective rather than formative (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1094670513475870">Rossiter 2002</xref>). Therefore, we have chosen a formative measurement for the independent variables. We calculated the means across the formative items; we also tested the impact of the eight drivers on the customers’ levels of remote service satisfaction.<sup>

<p>The data show that each regression coefficient is statistically significant on a .01 level, and only one of the drivers is marginally significant on a .10 level. The sign of each independent variable also displays the expected direction. Furthermore, our results indicate that the economic benefit of the remote service (<italic>B</italic> = .661, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01), its reliability (<italic>B</italic> = .543, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01), and support services (<italic>B</italic> = .533, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01) have the greatest impact on remote service satisfaction. Moreover, we find level of process integration (<italic>B</italic> = .474, <italic>p </italic>&lt; .01), post-provision documentation (<italic>B</italic> = .473, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01), individualization of delivered RS (<italic>B</italic> = .449, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01), exchange options (<italic>B</italic> = .397, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01), and security in remote service encounters (<italic>B</italic> + .228, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .10) to display a moderate impact on remote service satisfaction.

<title>The Service Separation/Customer Integration Paradox</title>
<p>The qualitative in-depth interviews also indicate that customers are ambivalent about their experience with remote services. Based on the qualitative data, we assume the existence of a paradox–the simultaneous existence of opposite assumptions or statements (Handy 1994), that is exemplified by a situation in which the customer wants the service to be separated, and at the same time wants to be integrated into the service provision process. The participants in our study give evidence for both desires at the same time; approximately 76% of the individuals indicated that they simultaneously want the service to be offered as a separated service, and as an unseparated one. One customer explains, “I want to know every change they do to my system” [IC: C39]. Sometime later in the interview he says: “I don’t like it that when the service center calls me and tells me … oh [name changed] your scanner is running again (… ) I know when my scanner is up” [IC: C122]. By analyzing the qualitative data, we also find numerous statements indicating that each quality dimension is affected by service separation. </p>
<sec id="section11-1094670513475870">
<title>The Customer’s Desire for Service Integration</title>
<p>The customers indicated that they dislike service separation, and instead strongly wish to become part of the remote service delivery process in order to better understand the changes taking place in the maintained system, and to effectively supervise the provided service. “I want to know what is going on in my system ( … ) I have to understand what they are doing” [remote service customer IC: A25]. When defining service inseparability, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1094670513475870">Zeithaml, Bitner, and Gremler (2006</xref>, p. 21) argue that “… the customer is present while the service is being produced and thus views and may even take part in the production process.” Hence, the customer can be either (a) physically or (b) mentally involved in service provision. If the customer is involved, it is easier for the customer to evaluate the service provision because provider’s actions are more obvious and understandable. We have chosen the terms physical and mental integration based on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1094670513475870">Silpakit and Fisk’s (1985</xref>, p. 117) various types of the customer’s involvement in service provision. According to the authors, the customer’s involvement can be both “… mental and physical, necessary to participate in production and delivery of services.” <italic>Physical integration</italic> refers to the physical presence of the customer during service provision (e.g., the customer is positioned in front of a monitor and observes the remote maintenance/repair of the system; the service is either <italic>physically separated</italic> or <italic>physically unseparated </italic>and the customer is either <italic>physically integrated</italic> or <italic>physically not integrated</italic> in service provision). Similarly, <italic>mental integration</italic> refers to information being presented to the customer’s mind during service provision (e.g., the customer receives e-mails with maintenance plans or a phone call from the technician when accessing the system; the service is either <italic>mentally separated</italic> or <italic>mentally unseparated </italic>and the customer is either <italic>mentally integrated</italic> or <italic>mentally not integrated</italic> in service provision). “A simple phone call or e-mail saying we are doing this right now would be just fine” [remote service customer IC: K78]. Note that ex-ante information is different from the expected documentation after remote service delivery, because it refers to information about the current activities of the provider, whereas documentation refers to ex-post activities of the provider (e.g., the remote service provider sends the customer a monthly report about the undertaken changes summarizing all of its activities).</p>
<p>With respect to service quality and remote service satisfaction, we find indications that separation complicates the evaluation of remote services. One customer who is not regularly part of remote service provision noted, “Remote services are like a black box to me” [remote service customer IC: C4]. Respondents had difficulty expressing expectations regarding service quality and satisfaction, which is consistent with a key conclusion reached by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1094670513475870">Mick and Fournier (1995</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1094670513475870">1998</xref>), based on their in-depth probing of consumer reactions to new technologies: “In buying and owning technological products, an individual’s pre-consumption standards are often nonexistent, weak, inaccurate, or subject to change as life circumstances shift” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1094670513475870">Mick and Fournier 1995</xref>, p. 1). For unseparated services, customers are mentally or physically present at the service encounter, and even become co-producers by closely interacting with the remote service technicians (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1094670513475870">Bitner et al. 1997</xref>). Consequently, it is easier for them to predict the outcomes of the service process. When evaluating IT-related services, perceptions of a lack of understanding about the service processes are discussed as having significant importance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1094670513475870">Collier and Sherrell 2011</xref>). Numerous studies have recognized perceived understanding as necessary to connect humans and technology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1094670513475870">Bezjian-Avery, Calder, and Iacobucci 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1094670513475870">Guedj et al. 1980</xref>). Between 10 and 38 customer statements indicate that service separation is negatively linked to each service dimension. We find that for separated services, service performance is assessed as being of poorer for unseparated services, because the customer has problems in evaluating the quality of the service and is less aware of the expectations. “How should I know that remote services are good? I don’t even know what it is” [remote service customer IC: O65].</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-1094670513475870">
<title>The Customer’s Desire for Service Separation</title>
<p>At the same time, we find statements indicating that some individuals do not wish to be part of the service provision. The argument is that they have paid for the remote service and they perceive the provider to be responsible for service provision. “Why should I call them or push the button, I have paid a lot of money that they take care” [remote service customer IC: K51]. These customers want to gain the advantages of service separation, because they perceive remote services to be more convenient, faster, and more flexible than the traditional form of maintenance and repair in which a field service engineer visits the customer to provide the service on site. For example, the “24/7” support offered by remote service providers means that customers can easily get help by phone. When the service is provided, the remote service provider is expected to reduce the contact with the customer to a minimum. The customer does not want to be integrated into the service provision, either (a) physically or (b) mentally.</p>
<p>With respect to service quality and remote service satisfaction, we conclude that the customer is primarily interested in getting the system to work again as quickly and as conveniently as possible. “All I want is that my machines are running. I don’t care what they did” [remote service customer IC: L44]. Having already paid for the remote maintenance, received extensive information from the provider, and/or being involved, themselves, in service provision, cause the customer to consider that the provider may not be able to remotely repair the system as easily as was initially promised. “I don’t see that they fulfill our service contract” [remote service customer IC: N81]. Due to limited contact with the provider, the customer has fewer cues for evaluating the provider’s performance. Although services are, by nature, intangible performances, tangible attributes in service production were important for signaling service quality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1094670513475870">Bitner 1990</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1094670513475870">1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1094670513475870">Rapoport 1982</xref>). For instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1094670513475870">Rapoport (1982</xref>) finds that customers often use the tangible environment to judge a service provider’s capability and quality. Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1094670513475870">Bitner (1992</xref>) proposes that servicescapes influence numerous customer responses during the service encounter, including cognitive, affective, and physiological responses.</p>
<p>For separated services, customers’ absence from production means that they sense fewer tangible attributes of the service encounter, compared with their physical and mental presence during production of unseparated services. When being integrated, the customer might assess the quick help, the preparedness of the technician, or the provider’s easy access to the customer’s system, and use these cues to evaluate performance. When there are not enough cues, the customer might perceive information and integration activities of the provider as a cue about the provider’s lack of competence. The customer expects the provider to independently maintain the system, but instead of repairing it, the customer has to help solve the problem. Between 5 and 36 interview statements indicate that service separation is positively linked to each service dimension. We find that for unseparated services, service performance is assessed as being poorer than for separated services, since the customers interpret their involvement as a cue for the provider’s lack of competence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1094670513475870">Price, Arnould, and Deibler 1995</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section13-1094670513475870">
<title>The Role of Service Initiation in Service Evaluation</title>
<p>Individually, each of the above desires is incontestably true, but when juxtaposed against each other, they appear to be contradictory. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1094670513475870">Johnson, Bardhi, and Dunn (2008</xref>) argue that the negative feelings associated with paradoxes have the potential to substantially undermine customer satisfaction. Service separation has the potential to simultaneously impact service evaluations, both positively and negatively. In our study, we found <italic>service initiation</italic> to be such a factor, shifting the service evaluations from positive to negative. The service can be either requested by the customer and implemented by the provider’s technicians (= <italic>customer-initiated services</italic>), or the provider may find a malfunction in the system and then start remote service delivery (= <italic>provider-initiated services</italic>). Note that in both cases, the provider can decide to physically or mentally integrate the customer.</p>
<sec id="section14-1094670513475870">
<title>Provider-Initiated Services</title>
<p>In the case of provider-initiated services, we find the customer’s desire for physical and mental service integration dominates the desire for separation. Compared with customer-initiated services, provider-initiated services tend to be more difficult to assess. If the customer has no understanding about the problem that occurred, and cannot determine whether or not it is serious, the negative effect associated with service separation might exceed the positive ones. Because the customers have no knowledge of the changes in the system that will be necessary to make it work again, their wish to be integrated in the service delivery may dominate. With respect to service quality and remote service satisfaction, we assume that in the case of provider-initiated services, customer integration is not perceived as a cue for lacking competence of the provider, but instead, integration helps the customer to correctly evaluate the service and shape expectations. “The provider makes a quick note and tells me what he changed” [remote service customer IC: B23]. Consequently, physically and mentally separated services are evaluated as being poorer than unseparated services.</p>

<title>Customer-Initiated Services</title>
<p>In contrast, we find the opposite effect for customer-initiated services. The customers’ desire for physical and mental separation dominates their desire for integration. The customers have initiated the remote service delivery due to a concrete problem that they have experienced. “I call in and tell them what’s wrong here” [remote service customer IC: B11]. Therefore, already having an understanding about the problem to be solved, and the desire to make the system run again as quickly as possible, dominates the desire to observe the provider’s activities during maintenance. In the case of customer-initiated services, integration is indeed perceived as a cue for a lack of competence on the part of the provider that leads to poor service evaluations. Consequently, physically and mentally separated services are better evaluated than unseparated services are.</p>
<p>Summarizing the above discussion leads to an assumption of two interaction effects. The first interaction effect is between <italic>service initiation</italic> and <italic>physical separation</italic> on performance of remote service (Hypothesis 2a/b), while the second effect is between <italic>service initiation</italic> and <italic>mental separation</italic>, also on remote service performance rating (Hypothesis 3a/b). Hence, we formulate,
<list list-type="simple">
<list-item>
<p>
<italic>Hypothesis 2a–b:</italic> There is an interaction effect between service initiation and physical separation on performance ratings: In the case of (a) provider-initiated services, physically separated services are evaluated as being of poorer quality than physically unseparated services, whereas (b) in the case of customer-initiated services, physically separated services are evaluated as being of better quality than physically unseparated services.</p>
</list-item>

and

<list-item>
<p>
<italic>Hypothesis 3a–b</italic>: There is an interaction effect between service initiation and mental separation on performance ratings: In the case of (a) provider-initiated services, mentally separated services are evaluated as being of poorer quality than mentally unseparated services, whereas (b) in the case of customer-initiated services, mentally separated services are evaluated as being of better quality than mentally unseparated services.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<p>To empirically test the proposed interactions, we have collected data for a second quantitative study. We contacted customers of a large provider that sells robotized automation systems and receive different levels of remote services from the provider. Thereby, we ensure enough variation among the variables of interest: service initiation, physical, and mental separation. Based on the firm’s database, we invited every customer of that provider to participate in our online survey, resulting in 118 usable questionnaires. The respondents were, on average, 32 years old (<italic>SD</italic> = 9.34), and had experience with the remote service for about 2.76 years (<italic>SD</italic> =1.31). The sample is comparable to the population of all B2B customers of this remote service provider.</p>
<p>We measured service initiation by asking those customers who primarily initiates the received service in the case of malfunctions (provider vs. customer). Similarly, respondents had to evaluate physical integration (physically unseparated vs. physically separated) and mental integration (mentally unseparated vs. mentally separated). Among the respondents, 64% had to initiate the remote service provision themselves, while in 35% of cases the provider initiates the remote service provision. Furthermore, 46% of respondents are regularly physically involved in the service provision process, while 54% are not. Finally, 58% are informed during service provision and thereby are mentally involved in the service provision, while 42% are not. The items for measuring the performance of remote services are identical to the items employed in the first quantitative study. We also make use of 5-point Likert-type scales with anchors of 1 = <italic>poor job</italic> and 5 = <italic>excellent job</italic>. Again, we chose formative measures to assess the satisfaction drivers and averaged the items for every construct.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>To empirically test whether the proposed interactions suggested by our research Hypotheses 2a/b and 3a/b are significant, we employed analysis of variance (ANOVA) with performance as dependent variable and physical/mental separation as independent variables. With respect to the service initiation–physical separation interactions (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1094670513475870">Figure 1</xref>), we find a significant interaction effect for level of process integration (<italic>F</italic> = 2.86, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .10, η<sup>2</sup> = 3%), post-provision documentation (<italic>F</italic> = 5.15, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05, η<sup>2</sup> = 4%), exchange options (<italic>F</italic> = 7.24, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01, η<sup>2</sup> = 6%), and individualization of delivered RS (<italic>F</italic> = 3.97, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05, η<sup>2</sup> = 3%). In line with Hypothesis 2a, for five of the eight tested dependent variables, provider-initiated and physically separated services are evaluated as being of poorer quality than provider-initiated and physically unseparated services, due to the dominance of the customer’s desire for integration. Contrary to Hypothesis 2b, however, customer-initiated and physically unseparated services are not evaluated as being better than physically customer-initiated and separated services. Hence, Hypothesis 2a is partially supported, while Hypothesis 2b has to be rejected. In addition to the interaction effects, we find a direct effect of service separation on support services (<italic>F</italic> = 8.64, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01, η<sup>2</sup> = 7%).</p>

<p>With respect to the service initiation-mental separation interactions, results are in line with Hypotheses 3a/b (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1094670513475870">Figure 2</xref>). For seven of the eight examined dependent variables, we find significant interaction effects and identical patterns for security in remote service encounters (<italic>F</italic> = 7.79, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01, η<sup>2</sup> = 6%), reliability of the remote service (<italic>F</italic> = 2.93, p &lt; .10, η<sup>2</sup> = 3%), level of process integration (<italic>F</italic> = 9.52, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01, η<sup>2</sup> = 11%), economic benefit of RS (<italic>F</italic> = 2.90, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .10, η<sup>2</sup> = 3%), post-provision documentation (<italic>F</italic> = 6.63, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05, η<sup>2</sup> = 6%), exchange options (<italic>F</italic> = 4.66, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05, η<sup>2</sup> = 4%), and individualization of delivered RS (<italic>F</italic> = 7.37, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01, η<sup>2</sup> = 6%). Consistent with Hypothesis 3a, provider-initiated and mentally separated services are evaluated as being of poorer quality than provider-initiated and mentally unseparated services. Moreover, in line with Hypothesis 3b, customer-initiated and mentally separated services are evaluated as being of better quality than customer-initiated and mentally unseparated services. Hence, both Hypotheses 3a and b are supported by our findings.</p>

<p>We tested the stability of our findings by including control variables in the additionally conducted analyses of covariance. Following indications by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1094670513475870">Keh and Pang (2010</xref>), we speculate that variables related to trust in the provider, as well as experience with remote services (or with IT in general) affect the stability of our results. However, even when controlling for the impact of relationship duration, IT involvement, or age and experience of the respondents, the results of our study remain consistent.</p>

<title>General Discussion</title>
<p>Despite its importance, service inseparability is not well understood in the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1094670513475870">Keh and Pang 2010</xref>). Therefore, this research examines the impact that service separation associated with remote services provision has on service satisfaction. We conducted one qualitative and two quantitative studies to (a) identify factors leading to remote service satisfaction and (b) empirically test the impact of physical and mental service separation on satisfaction assessment, giving evidence for a paradox associated with service separation.</p>
<sec id="section19-1094670513475870">
<title>Contribution to Research on IT-Related Services</title>
<p>We contribute to the literature by exploring the satisfaction drivers of remote services—a type of technology-mediated services that has received little attention in the service literature to date (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1094670513475870">Wünderlich, von Wangenheim, and Bitner 2012</xref>). In Studies 1 and 2, we found the themes of security in remote service encounters, reliability, economic benefit, and individualization to be frequently mentioned by the participants in our in-depth interviews, which identified them as key dimensions or subdimensions of e-service quality. While several perceptual attributes of remote service satisfaction are the same as in e-service quality, some of the perceptual attributes of the economic benefit of remote services deal with remote service-specific issues such as capacity utilization and uptime of machines, which are attributes that cannot be found in e-service quality scales. Particularly, we found two dimensions—level of process integration and support services—to be important drivers of satisfaction that are not in the categories of the scales against which we compared our findings. As our validation study indicates, these categories represent important gaps that should be considered for the scale incorporated here. Because not only were these two dimensions distinct compared to related studies, but some of the perceptual attributes were also. Scale designers in the field of industrial technology mediated services may wish to capture these elements of service quality. Interestingly, Study 3 also indicates that satisfaction levels depend on physical and mental service separation, which complicates service provision in technology-mediated services settings such as remote services. Despite the separability claim for some services, previous research has neither sufficiently elaborated on nor empirically examined its implications for customers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1094670513475870">Keh and Pang 2010</xref>). This is surprising, because the technology infusion leads to greater service separation and it often physically and mentally disconnects service customers and providers. Against this background, we followed the suggestion of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1094670513475870">Keh and Pang (2010</xref>) and empirically tested the impact of service separation on service quality. The qualitative interviews indicate a paradox: Customers wish to be integrated into the service provision process, and at the same time they do not wish to be integrated. Depending on the customer’s view of service separation, service quality assessments will differ. Thereby, we add a further paradox that we refer to as the service separation/customer integration paradox to the eight paradoxes of technology that have been identified by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1094670513475870">Mick and Fournier (1998</xref>). We contribute to this stream of literature by additionally identifying service initiation as a new situational characteristic that leads to a dominance of either the positive or the negative evaluation of technology. With respect, particularly, to the remote services literature, we find service initiation to be a critical factor for designing remote services, because it leads to varied service evaluations.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section20-1094670513475870">
<title>Managerial Implications</title>
<p>These findings suggest a number of managerial implications for remote service providers. First, services managers who are responsible for marketing remote services can use our findings to improve their operations and, with the help of the developed measurement, to assess customer satisfaction with their operations. Our scales may also be used to benchmark the provider’s performance against competing providers of remote services. With respect to the newly identified satisfaction dimensions, our study indicates that remote service providers should pay special attention to the <italic>level of process integration</italic>. Our qualitative interviews indicate that remote service providers should advance their process efficiency through seamless operations and quick responses to customer problems.</p>
<p>Similarly, customers expect that <italic>support services</italic> will be offered, which represents an important area for improvement. Some customers are highly motivated to learn more about the benefits of remote service, and how to get the most of it. This is particularly true because many customers of remote services are themselves technicians, and having the responsibility for seeing that the machines and systems run without problems, they prefer to expand their knowledge of remote services and how best to guarantee system availability. Special skills and expertise are necessary to make use of the technology and, consequently, customers expressed a desire to receive proper training on the remote technology. On the basis of this idea, customers suggest initiating regular round-table meetings with various stakeholders for the remote technology, as well as with involved persons from the provider’s organization, to jointly review the service performance and develop strategies for future improvements.</p>
<p>Second, remote services are designed to reduce personal contact between the service provider and the customer, and to deliver the service without integrating the customer in service provision. By identifying the paradox, we provide management with stronger support for ensuring a satisfying service experience when service separation is an issue. In the case of <italic>provider-initiated services</italic>, providers are recommended to (a) mentally integrate customers into the service process by informing them about the planned maintenance and the corrections to the system and (b) to physically integrate customers into the provision process. When the provider does not involve or even inform customers, problems arise on the customer’s side for the correct assessment of whether or not the remote service is beneficial.</p>
<p>a. In the case of <italic>customer-initiated services</italic>, our results indicate that customer should not be integrated in the service provision process since it is interpreted as a cue that the remote service provider lacks competence. In the case of customer-initiated services rather than physical integration, we find that mental integration alone backfires. We conclude that the customer develops an understanding of why the integration of the customer may indeed be necessary, following that physical integration is not interpreted as a cue for a lack of expertise on the part of the provider.</p>

<sec id="section21-1094670513475870">
<title>Limitations and Further Research</title>
<p>This study has like most studies several limitations that should be addressed in further research. First, after identifying the determinants of remote service satisfaction, the literature lacks a quantitative large-scale assessment of the determinants. In addition to examining overall satisfaction as a dependent variable, future research might examine the impact of remote service satisfaction on outcomes such as word-of-mouth, customer loyalty, and customer complaints.</p>
<p>Second, with respect to the service separation/customer integration paradox, we suggest development of research that will deepen our understanding for which technology-mediated services the paradox exists, and those services for which it does not. In this light, it is easy to speculate that for credence services, the paradox is more likely to exist than it is for experience services, due to the customer’s greater difficulties in understanding service provision.</p>
<p>Third, studying whether the paradox is stable over time might also be of value. Our study controlled for the customer’s expertise and relationship duration, but it would be interesting to study whether the paradox is inherently unstable or ever-changing. If so, then strategies designed to increase satisfaction levels must also have a dynamic component. Longitudinal research is called for to examine such issues.</p>
<p>Fourth, our study has revealed several interaction effects between service initiation and (physical and mental) service separation. Therefore, it is important for future studies to identify the provider activities for which integration is more important than separation. Service initiation was a first situational factor, but one can speculate that further factors exist, impacting the shift from positive to negative evaluations of service separation. For instance, factors such as time pressure or dependence from the provider might also impact the customer’s desire for either service integration or for service separation.</p>

<p>We developed a questionnaire and asked service experts to sort the provided items to the main categories. After the first round the expert classification resulted in an interjudge agreement rate of 86%. We used ideas and suggestions of the experts and slightly modified the definitions of the main categories. In a second round, we asked two parallel groups; one consisting of service experts and one of practitioners using remote service at their organization, to categorize the items again using the modified schema. The resulting interjudge agreement increased to 92% (service experts) and 97% (practitioners). In the final phase, the two original judges reviewed the categories and subcategories and made some minor improvements to the definitions. In the end, we identified 8 main categories and 25 subcategories.</p>
