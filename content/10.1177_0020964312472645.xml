<p>LAMENTATIONS IS UNIQUE AMONG ALL OTHER BOOKS within the biblical canon, as it opens with a cry of pain and grief. Just as the prophet Jeremiah warned, the once mighty and proud city of Jerusalem has fallen. The city and its inhabitants have been taken into captivity by the Babylonians, and the people are greatly distressed, scared, and confused. Daughter Zion laments, “Look, O Lord, and see how worthless I have become” (Lam 1:11c), and “the Lord handed me over” (Lam 1:14d). The Hebrew people believe that God has struck them with misery, and the once chosen people of God had lost divine favor.</p>
<p>With chapter 1’s raw emotions bleeding out like an open wound, preachers are forced to face this brutal suffering head-on. While it can be tempting to gloss over the pain in this text and jump to the grace and hope of Christ, there can be great therapeutic and spiritual nourishment in a preacher courageously and honestly exploring Lamentations. The sentiment and tone of the book is very much a part of the universal human condition. The lament of this conquered community can be heard in the cries of grieving parents who have lost children, a town devastated by the forces of Mother Nature, a child who is bullied daily, or an elderly person who has been left and forgotten in a skilled nursing facility.</p>
<p>Modern fictional literature and films, such as <italic>The Hunger Games</italic> series, <italic>Gran Torino</italic>, or the <italic>Book of Eli</italic>, can provide illustrations for the preacher to bring the ancient suffering into the present imagination. However, our world is filled with real pain and grief, and the preacher does not need to look to fiction to show how the bitter despair of Lamentations is experienced today. Recent historical events, such as the horrors of the Holocaust during World War II, the 1994 genocide in Rwanda, the 1999 Columbine shootings, or 9/11 terrorist attacks and subsequent wars, could be used to illustrate the times a community has suffered and mourned together.</p>
<p>The preacher may realize in her or his own context that individual and particular tragedies and sufferings, rather than large-scale communal ones, might be at forefront of the average parishioner’s mind. Most every person in the pew knows first-hand what it was like for Jerusalem when “she weeps bitterly in the night, with tears on her cheeks” (Lam 1:2a). It is important for a congregation to know that worship is a safe place to recognize suffering and that faith does not ignore the reality of pain.</p>
<p>One member of my congregation recently told me the story of her first day in our church. After the death of her mother, she was hungry for spiritual nourishment and comfort. On the Sunday after she returned home from burying her mother, she decided to visit the small Presbyterian church just down the road from her house. Immediately upon hearing the old familiar sounds of the organ announcing the start of worship, her spirit opened to her raw pain and deep grief, and she began to sob. A woman sitting on the pew behind her tapped her on the shoulder and introduced herself. Initially embarrassed by her uncontrollable emotions, the visitor explained her situation to the stranger. Upon hearing of her loss, the member embraced her and said, “Oh honey! You just come sit back here with me, and we’ll cry together.” The visitor moved from her seat and the two women embraced and let their tears flow freely through the rest of service.</p>
<p>This first chapter of Lamentations is a place in our Scripture where we can cry together. Chapter 1 may be an appropriate text selection for a Sunday after a tragedy in the congregation or community, during Lent, or in a service of healing. Only vv. 1–6 appear in the <italic>Revised Common Lectionary</italic> in Year C, Proper 22, but the whole of ch. 1 can effectively be read and proclaimed if we acknowledge the various speakers. Two voices, Daughter Zion (Lam 1:9c, 11c–16, 18–22) and a witness (Lam 1:1–9b, 10–11b, 17), are speaking, not to each other, but over and next to one another in this chapter. This literary device opens up an opportunity for the preacher to bring this text to life in a dramatic reading. To highlight the two voices in this chapter for the congregation, consider having two separate readers present the text.</p>
<p>The original acrostic literary effect, which provided a certain order and message to the Hebrew audience, is lost in translation, but the spirit of lament is strong. To help convey this tone, consider reading from Eugene Peterson’s translation, <italic>The Message</italic>, as it employs colloquialisms and idiomatic expressions of contemporary English speakers. <italic>The Message</italic> translation gives this ancient text new life. For example, Lam 1:16 in <italic>The Message</italic> is, “For all this I weep, weep buckets of tears.”</p>
<p>It is important to recognize that the voice of God is absent in this text. These are the words of those who are suffering and those who are a witness to suffering. This passage gives the reader a companion who has known their present-day misery, but it does not give God’s response to those feelings of abandonment and perception of God’s wrath. Although the preacher must be faithful to this text and be careful not to skip too quickly to the Christ event, one cannot ignore the promise of Jesus that assures us that suffering does not have the final word. Although pain is very real, our Christian story offers hope. A preacher may choose to punctuate the end of the sermon with this message, or may, like the Book of Lamentations, let it rest somewhere in the middle. Either way, the grace many may find in this first chapter is permission to weep and grieve and to wonder how or why God would allow or cause such anguish. There are times when hearing the cries of Daughter Zion who says, “Groaning in pain, body and soul, I’ve had all I can take” (<italic>The Message</italic>, Lam 1:22c), may bring more healing and grace to a congregation than a thousand Hallelujahs and Amens. Daughter Zion laments that she has no one to comfort her, but the difference for us is that as the body of Christ, we need to be that safe and loving community that can sit and cry together.</p>
