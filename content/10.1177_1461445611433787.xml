<abstract>
<p>The conversation analytic view of context is often critiqued as being too narrow. In this article, we join the ongoing debate regarding conversation analysis (CA) and context by 1) synthesizing existing scholarly attempts at either conceptualizing or exploring the possibilities of combining CA and ethnography and 2) giving further considerations to whether or how resorting to talk-extrinsic data may be beneficial. We do so by providing four illustrative cases, with increasing complexity, from four different settings. In each case, an initial CA analysis is followed up with an informal ethnographic interview with the participants. By offering some specificity to this ongoing methodological controversy regarding talk-extrinsic data, we aim to begin building a useful framework within which further discussions on analysis, context, and cross-fertilization may proceed.</p>

<p>With regard to context, conversation analysts insist on demonstrating in the details of talk that a particular aspect of context 1) is treated as relevant by the participants themselves (i.e. ‘demonstrable relevance’) and 2) that it proves to be consequential for how the interaction unfolds (i.e. ‘procedural consequentiality’) (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1461445611433787">Schegloff, 1987</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1461445611433787">1991</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1461445611433787">1992</xref>). In other words, the evidence of context needs to be located in the text. This view of context is often critiqued as being too narrow, which has remained an issue of great controversy among scholars (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1461445611433787">Billig, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1461445611433787">McHoul et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1461445611433787">Nelson, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1461445611433787">Pomerantz, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1461445611433787">Schegloff, 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1461445611433787">1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1461445611433787">1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1461445611433787">Van Dijk, 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1461445611433787">2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1461445611433787">Wetherell, 1998</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1461445611433787">Van Dijk (2009)</xref>, for example, posits that contextual knowledge would allow us to arrive at ‘more complete, more detailed, and better grounded analyses’ (p. 108). For the various positions on CA and context, interested readers should consult the special issues of <italic>Research on Language and Social Interaction</italic> (1990/1991 and 1998), <italic>Discourse &amp; Society</italic> (1997–9), and <italic>Journal of Pragmatics</italic> (2008). The crux of the question appears to be: to go or not to go outside the talk itself? Or, do we gain any analytic leverage by bringing in contextual information not manifested in the details of talk? Going outside the talk typically entails the use of ethnographic data or what may be referred to as talk-extrinsic data. More than two decades ago, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1461445611433787">Moerman (1988)</xref> proposed to combine CA with ethnography, creating what he calls culturally contexted conversation analysis (CCCA). The argument was for incorporating talk-extrinsic data to enrich analysis. Only a very small number of empirical endeavors have followed suit, however, to allow for a fuller appreciation of the precise ways in which such enrichment may take shape. This article contributes to the ongoing discussion on CA and context by 1) synthesizing existing scholarly attempts at either conceptualizing or exploring the possibilities of combining CA and ethnography and 2) giving further considerations, with a set of illustrative cases, to the relationship between CA and talk-extrinsic data. Before we proceed, it is important to note that, given the multiplicity in our understanding of context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1461445611433787">Pomerantz, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1461445611433787">Van Dijk, 2008</xref>), the context to be dealt with in our discussion involves properties of immediate interactional situations rather than those of broader social, political, and cultural situations.</p>
<sec id="section1-1461445611433787">
<title>Prior work on CA and ethnography</title>
<p>Illuminating discussions on the relationship between CA and ethnography can be found in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1461445611433787">Maynard (2003)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1461445611433787">Pomerantz (2005)</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1461445611433787">Silverman (1999)</xref>. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1461445611433787">Silverman (1999)</xref>, for example, advocates for a division of labor between CA and ethnography, with the former answering the question of <italic>how</italic> and the latter the question of <italic>why</italic>. He also stresses the importance of ‘beginning with the question of ‘‘how’’’ so as to ‘fruitfully move on to ‘‘why’’ questions about institutional and cultural constraints’ (p. 407). Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1461445611433787">Maynard (2003)</xref> argues for a ‘limited affinity’ between the two approaches, where ethnography complements conversation analysis in describing settings and identities, clarifying unfamiliar references or courses of action, and explaining ‘curious’ patterns revealed by the sequential analysis (p. 73). Like <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1461445611433787">Silverman (1999)</xref>, Maynard also insists on using ethnographic data <italic>after</italic> an initial conversation analytic treatment (also see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1461445611433787">Schegloff, 1998</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1461445611433787">Pomerantz (2005)</xref> offers perhaps the most comprehensive discussion to date on the potential benefits of using participants’ video stimulated comments to complement analyses of interactional practices: 1) serve as suggestion of places for close investigation; 2) help us understand the bases of puzzling patterns of conduct; 3) serve as correctives of inferences; 4) serve as confirmatory evidence for claims about discourse; 5) lead us to investigate possible instances of conduct standing in place of possibly withheld actions (p. 112).</p>
<p>Only in a small number of empirical studies has the combined methodology of CA and ethnography been put to practice. One way in which talk-extrinsic data appears to complement CA analysis is by providing confirmatory evidence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1461445611433787">Lutfey and Maynard, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1461445611433787">Pomerantz et al., 1997</xref>). In <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1461445611433787">Lutfey and Maynard’s (1998)</xref> study of the talk about dying in oncology, for example, the doctor is shown to have great difficulty getting the patient to talk about issues of dying, and this is confirmed in the post hoc interview where the doctor explicitly voiced his interpretation that the patient wanted to ‘avoid talking about what I wanted to talk about’ (pp. 329–30).</p>
<p>Talk-extrinsic data can also become useful in explaining the interactional patterns uncovered in a CA analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1461445611433787">Gafaranga and Britten, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1461445611433787">Kinnell and Maynard, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1461445611433787">Moerman, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1461445611433787">Waring and Hruska, 2011a</xref>). The classic example would be the ‘lepper’ instance in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1461445611433787">Moerman’s (1988)</xref> data from a Tahi-Lue village, where the official and the anthropologist along with some villagers were talking about the singer of Lue folk songs. At one point, just as the singer N is about to be referred to as ‘the lepper’, someone interrupts with the formulation ‘He is sort of sick.’ As it turns out, this person knows that the townsmen have complained about the singer to the official, who could have him removed to a leper colony. The interruption is thus done, according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1461445611433787">Moerman (1988)</xref>, to pre-empt the mention of ‘lepper’ in front of the district official and downgrade the seriousness of the singer’s condition (pp. 20–22). In other words, while CA shows that the alternative formulation is done interruptively, ethnography provides insights into the motivations behind such interruption and this particular formulation.</p>
<p>Moreover, talk-extrinsic data may yield insights not made evident in CA’s sequential analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1461445611433787">Lutfey and Maynard, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1461445611433787">Pomerantz et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1461445611433787">Waring and Hruska, 2011a</xref>). In <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1461445611433787">Pomerantz et al.’s (1997)</xref> study of medical interactions, for example, the participants in their interviews remark on the importance of the desk chair as a locus for physician authority, which is an aspect of interaction overlooked in the CA analysis. During the interviews, the interns also expressed annoyance – a stance not displayed in the actual interaction – at preceptors re-asking the questions they had already asked. Finally, there are cases where serious attempts were made to collect a large amount of in-depth ethnographic data, but any substantive connections between these data and the analysis of interactional practices remained elusive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1461445611433787">Vinkhuyzen and Szymanski, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1461445611433787">Waite, 1993</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1461445611433787">1995</xref>). There are also cases where the talk-extrinsic data do not contribute to the CA analysis per se, but shed light on the interpretations of the initial analysis. In particular, a rich ethnographic background may allow us to 1) assess the extent to which a particular practice is representative of similar activities among similar participants and 2) pinpoint the practical implications of particular CA findings in a particular institutional context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1461445611433787">Waring and Hruska, 2011a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1461445611433787">2011b</xref>).</p>
<p>In sum, among the existing studies that have made explicit the connections between CA and ethnography, talk-extrinsic data appear to complement CA analyses in three ways: 1) confirm CA analysis, 2) explain CA analysis, and 3) uncover what is not made evident in the initial CA analysis. These findings offer useful ways of conceptualizing the various relationships between CA and ethnography. Still, there may be certain ambiguities in these conceptualizations that prevent us from a firmer grasp of the intricate links. For example, explaining certain conduct would naturally presuppose confirming that conduct, and uncovering what was left hidden in the initial CA analysis would often amount to some sort of explanation. In the remainder of this article, we explore further the empirical connections between CA and talk-extrinsic data in the hope of achieving some specificity to our existing understandings of these connections.</p>

<title>Further explorations of CA and talk-extrinsic data</title>
<p>In what follows, we discuss four illustrative extracts, with increasing complexity, from four different settings (see <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-1461445611433787">Appendix</xref> for transcription notations). In each case, an initial CA analysis was followed up with an informal ethnographic interview with the participants who offered additional contextual information. The first three extracts come from a class assignment for a graduate course entitled ‘Advanced Conversation Analysis’, that involved mostly doctoral students in an applied linguistics program, where students were instructed to pick an extract from the data they collected, perform a CA analysis, and conduct an ethnographic interview with the participants after the analysis. The three extracts that represented the gamut of findings from the assignments were selected to be included in this article. The fourth extract was taken from the course instructor’s own data set. Some interviews were conducted soon after the CA analysis (Extracts 2 and 3), and some four years after the initial data were collected (Extracts 1 and 4). In each case, the participants were shown both the video and the transcript and were asked to comment on a notable (e.g. unexpected, interesting, ambiguous) aspect of the interaction uncovered from the initial CA analysis. Follow-up questions were asked contingent upon the initial responses from the participants.</p>
<p>In what follows, we present each extract in the same order as that of the data analysis: with the CA analysis preceding the participants’ reports. We also briefly summarize the relationship between the two before proceeding to each next extract. As we work through these examples, we hope to incrementally build up our understanding of the relationship between CA and talk-extrinsic data, which will then be summarized and discussed as we conclude the article.</p>
<p>The first excerpt comes from a tutoring session between Judy the tutor and Frank the tutee at a university undergraduate writing center. In lines 01–10, Judy offers two consecutive suggestions regarding a comma and a possessive, both of which are accepted by Frank immediately both verbally and nonverbally. Note that by using ‘either’, Judy links her second suggestion to her first, thus implicitly weaving these isolated mistakes into a unified and patterned problem:</p>
<p>(1) [Writing Center Data]</p>
<graphic id="img1-1461445611433787" position="anchor" xlink:href="10.1177_1461445611433787-img1.tif"/>
<p>Note that Frank’s acceptance in line 10 is immediately followed up with a self-deprecating assessment: ‘I know I’m bad at those.’ By using ‘those’, Frank also orients to Judy’s corrections so far as indexing a larger problem. Frank’s assessment makes conditionally relevant a second pair-part in the form of an agreement or disagreement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1461445611433787">Schegloff, 2007</xref>). In particular, self-deprecation prefers disagreement, at least in ordinary conversations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1461445611433787">Pomerantz, 1984</xref>). In lines 14–15, by asking a question addressed to an editing technique (i.e. ‘read it out loud’), Judy specifically does not attend to the self-deprecating nature of Frank’s statement, and this dis-attending is upgraded by the transitional overlap in which her question is launched (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1461445611433787">Jefferson, 1983</xref>). By not letting Frank bring his turn to its full completion then, Judy minimizes the import of his turn and intensifies the urgency of her own. As can be seen, Judy’s question in lines 14–15 becomes a pre-sequence to her upcoming advice, which gets explicitly stated, elaborated upon, and accounted for after Frank’s go-ahead in line 16. By admitting to not utilizing the technique (‘Not really.’), Frank makes it possible for Judy to launch into her advice, which he agrees to immediately (lines 18–19). Thus, the CA analysis shows that throughout the sequence, both Judy and Frank orient to the event as one of advice-giving and -receiving. In particular, Judy in lines 14–15 disregards Frank’s self-deprecation and pursues instead advice-giving. We may, therefore, infer that like that in oral proficiency interviews (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1461445611433787">Lazaraton, 1997</xref>), the preference structure in writing center interaction is also adapted to its specific institutional context. More specifically, in prioritizing advice giving, the tutor may be orienting to the institutional goal of socializing the tutee into the discourse of academic writing, or ‘doing pedagogy’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1461445611433787">Waring, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>In an interview conducted after the analysis, Judy reported that Frank was a regular student of hers who frequently made the same mistakes but also frequently caught them on his own. She felt that Frank lacked self-confidence, which prevented him from doing any self-editing. According to Judy, her question in lines 14–15 was designed to check that hunch and to segue into instilling in him the confidence to edit papers without her assistance. As she said, Frank was ‘very bright’ and should not use the writing center ‘as an excuse not to edit his papers’.</p>
<p>Addressing the lack of confidence, as one might argue, is part of implementing the larger institutional goal of helping the tutee become a better writer – an orientation inferable from the initial CA analysis. In other words, the ethnographic finding does not contradict or overturn the earlier analysis on a broader scale. However, the specific concern for the tutee’s self-confidence as reported to have governed the tutor’s discursive choice definitely did not surface in the CA analysis. Even if we go back to the data for a second look armed with what we know now, it is still difficult to see how that concern is displayed in the data. We have a situation, therefore, where the participant’s concern is broadly inferable but not specifically displayed in the CA data and only comes to light in a subsequent interview. In this case, then, the talk-extrinsic data serve to specify what is broadly inferable from the initial CA analysis.</p>
<p>In the next example, Claire is a five-year old girl and Anna an educator who specializes in one-on-one encounters. They are playing math games together, using poker chips and dice. Throughout the sequence, Anna proposes to categorize the chips by color, and Claire attempts to do so by size:</p>
<p>(2) [Toddler Tutoring Data]</p>
<graphic id="img2-1461445611433787" position="anchor" xlink:href="10.1177_1461445611433787-img2.tif"/>
<p>In lines 04–07, Anna proposes to categorize the chips by color, which does not receive any immediate acceptance from Claire, who notes, before Anna’s turn comes to its full completion, ‘the same size’ (line 08). The noticing of size makes relevant a potentially competing criterion for categorizing the chips, thereby a possible obstacle to Anna’s proposal (although Anna herself starts with size in lines 01–02). In line 09, Anna latches onto Claire’s comment with a confirmation, which treats that comment as a simple noticing without entertaining its potential as a competing criterion. After a brief gap in line 10, Claire resumes her earlier activity of gathering the chips by color. Note that ‘here’s a lo:t of red ones.’ (line 11) amounts to a continuation and upgrade of her earlier ‘‘‘Here’s ↓red o:nes,’’ (lines 05–06).</p>
<p>Just as Anna stays the course in her pursuit of color, so does Claire in her pursuit of size. What may have been implicitly suggested in her earlier mention of ‘a:nd the same size’ (line 08) is now crystallized into an explicit proposal (lines 12–16). Size as a criterion is now officially on the table, and Claire begins implementing that proposal by starting to picks up chips of different colors but the same size (lines 12 and 15).</p>
<p>In line 17, Anna could yield to Claire’s agenda of size or continue her pursuit of color. She does the latter, but does so in a manner that maximizes her alignment with Claire without compromising her own goal. She begins by copying, almost word for word, Claire’s previous turn. By withholding the pitch drop at the first possible completion point after ‘sizes’, she enters her second turn-constructional unit (TCU) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1461445611433787">Sacks et al., 1974</xref>) with a contrastive marker ‘but’ that introduces her own proposal. She uses the inclusive imperative ‘let’s collect them’, but replaces ‘let’s’ with Claire’s phrasing ‘we could’. The emphasis on both ‘color’ and ‘too’ is also a powerful illustration of the delicate balance Anna appears to be striking between promoting her own agenda and validating that of Claire’s. In her third TCU, Anna recontextualizes the broad suggestion of ‘collect by color’ as the concrete action of ‘making piles of each color’, and she continues to use Claire’s wording (i.e. ‘we could’). As can be seen, the ‘fight’ for color versus size continues in the rest of the segment as Claire announces her preference for her ‘own little pile’ and Anna struggles to morph that ‘own little pile’ into ‘a pile of red ones’ (lines 22–27). In short, the CA analysis makes evident the competing agendas between Anna and Claire as well as Anna’s delicate management of that competition. In addition, Anna’s insistence on the color categorization appears to suggest the importance of this task in her pedagogical agenda, although it is not clear at this point what that agenda might be.</p>
<p>Interestingly, Anna did remember that very episode and described it as one of a few times during the session when she and Claire were ‘jockeying’ for control. Anna said that she wanted to categorize the chips by color in order to prepare for a math game she had planned. At the same time, she didn’t want to ‘disenfranchise’ Claire or sound ‘authoritative’, so she purposefully used Claire’s exact phrasing, including the word ‘collect’ (instead of ‘gather’, which would have been her own choice). She also chose to frame what could have been an order as a communal activity, using ‘let’s’. Thus, Anna’s version of what happened matches what was revealed in the initial CA analysis: what is displayed is also what is intended. In addition, Anna’s commentary also reveals the specific agenda that motivates her persistence on the sorting by color. Thus, in this case, the talk-extrinsic data serve to both 1) confirm the initial CA analysis in terms of what was going on and 2) specifies, as in the case of the prior extract, the agenda that motivates Anna’s conduct, which was only broadly inferable from the initial CA analysis.</p>
<p>Our third extract comes from a dinner gathering of three friends. Mike has asked about Rachael’s boyfriend, and Rachael begins her telling in lines 01–03:</p>
<p>(3) [Dinner Data]</p>
<graphic id="img3-1461445611433787" position="anchor" xlink:href="10.1177_1461445611433787-img3.tif"/>
<p>In line 04, by proposing ‘phone number’ as part of the girl’s signing, Mike upgrades the potential severity of the infringement (i.e. the flirtatious nature of the girl’s signature) – from simple expression of affection to active pursuit of the teacher. Note that this more ‘severe’ version of the event is immediately rejected by Rachael in laughter (line 05). Interruptively in line 06, Mike offers a negative assessment despite Rachael’s rejection and the joking manner in which her rejection is done.</p>
<p>In lines 07–13, Rachael maintains her jocular stance as she tells a second story that involves another girl behaving ‘inappropriately’ with her teaching assistant (TA) – Rachael’s boyfriend. Note that Rachael’s turn is specifically designed to display her own lighthearted stance toward these anecdotes. Observe the inserted evaluation ‘I don’t think this is necessarily like hitting on him’, her characterization of the behavior as ‘really cute’, as well as her laughter that ends the turn. It is during this laughter that Mike repeats his assessment almost verbatim and does so without any laughter, thus specifically treating the story as not laughable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1461445611433787">Glenn, 2003</xref>) despite Rachael’s continuing display of a lighthearted stance. The very repetition of the same assessment within this particular sequential context brings into relief Mike’s ongoing resistance to Rachael’s contrasting take on the events. In fact, Mike’s repeated assessment is hearable as carrying a very subtle emphasis on ‘That’, which, along with the pronunciation of ‘cool’ in its citation form (as opposed to the earlier reduced version), intensifies the opposing stance he continues to express. As can be seen, Rachael responds to Mike’s second assessment with further laughter and a post-expansion that emphasizes her non-serious stance. Thus, the CA analysis showcases Rachael and Mike’s competing stances towards the same events, as well as Mike’s persistence in treating the reported conduct as ‘not cool’ despite Rachael’s position otherwise. It appears to suggest that Rachael and Mike orient to differing standards for what constitutes inappropriate behavior. It may even appear that Mike is being rather protective of Rachael and her relationship with Aiden.</p>
<p>When interviewed about this conversation, Mike emphatically repeated his assessment of the reported behavior as inappropriate and ‘not cool’. When asked whether he viewed the second action described (lines 08–12) as a more serious offense, he was very clear: ‘Oh, yeah, that’s much worse, totally!’ As it turns out, Mike has understood the two stories as involving the same girl, when in fact Rachel has intended to convey that they were different girls (see line 07, ‘some gi:rl’). Once this was explained to Mike, he admitted that if it was a different girl, it could have been ‘innocent’ and not part of an inappropriate attempt to flirt with her TA. On the other hand, Rachael reported having a long-standing friendship with Mike, where Mike has been acting as a confidant throughout her relationships and taken on a rather protective role in these situations. Rachael also characterizes Mike as someone who is ‘very opinionated about things like this and who likes to sort of take on the role of friendly counselor or evaluating his friends’ lives and relationships’.</p>
<p>Thus, like Anna in the prior extract, Mike reports a version of the events that matched what was revealed in the initial CA analysis. Unlike what we gathered from the prior extract, however, Mike’s account does not specify, but serves as a corrective to, what was broadly inferable from the initial CA analysis. As it turns out, it is not Mike’s ‘higher standard’, but his misunderstanding of the events that explicates his conduct of persisting misalignment. Rachael’s account, on the other hand, does contribute to specifying Mike’s ‘higher standard’ as well as his protective stance by referencing his ‘opinionated’ personality and his role as her relationship confidant over the years. Thus, in this case, the talk extrinsic data serve to again 1) confirm the initial CA analysis with regard to what transpired and 2) both specify and correct an inference grounded in the initial CA analysis.</p>
<p>In the final segment, the class co-taught by T1 and T2 is talking about the kinds of discussion topics the students have posted online. As it emerges in lines 01–07, one topic is labeled Americanizing or Americanization, both of which involve the lexical process of derivational affixation, that is, adding a derivational morpheme to create a new word or a new part of speech of the same word. The alternatives appear to be narrowed down to ‘Americanization’ by lines 06–07:</p>

<p>In line 08, Nina offers an item that roughly fits in the ‘-tion’ category but no longer constitutes a response to the ‘What were the other topics?’ inquiry. What Nina does then may be a type of what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1461445611433787">Cook (1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1461445611433787">2000</xref>) calls form play, that is, playing with the rhyming of words. By producing ‘Californication’ in a smiley voice with laugh tokens, Nina herself also orients to the mention as playful and humorous. In line 09, T1 aligns with Nina’s stance by producing yet another ‘-ation’ item in a smiley voice along with laugh tokens, thereby sustaining the form play initiated by Nina. By prefacing the item with the preposition ‘like’, T1 also specifically categorizes her item as of the same kind with that of Nina’s. Meanwhile, however, the item is prosodically marked as a contrast by the stress and loud volume with which ‘ZA’ – the key syllable that differentiates between the two words – is delivered. Because of the prosodic contrast, it seems possible that T1’s utterance is produced as a correction although it need not be. One can highlight the contrast for the simple reason of marking the item as very similar but with a slight difference, and there is no evidence that Nina is treating it as an error correction as no space is left for any uptake from Nina while T1 simply proceeds with further form play with the two co-teachers’ first names. In short, we cannot pinpoint what T1’s ‘CaliforniZAtion’ is doing based on how it is produced or received. As analysts, we are faced with an ambiguity, which could have been an ambiguity for the participants as well. And as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1461445611433787">Van Dijk (2009)</xref> notes, participant understandings ‘need not be noticeably expressed in next turns of talk’ (p. 108).</p>
<p>But there is more. As someone familiar with the HBO TV series <italic>Californication</italic>, which blends ‘California’ with ‘fornication’, the analyst recognized Nina’s production as not simply a form play but also a cultural reference. But in searching for further information on the show, she discovered that this HBO series had not yet premiered by the time of the data collection and that <italic>Californication</italic> is also the title of a commercially successful studio album by the American rock band Red Hot Chili Peppers and of a song in that album, which features various sexual innuendos commonly associated with the band. With that knowledge, the analysis of what Nina does in line 08 changed. What she treats as playful and humorous is not simply the form play, but also the reference to popular music. With this new understanding, we also see that T1’s next turn clearly does not attend to this cultural reference. However, not <italic>displaying</italic> recognition is not the same as not recognizing. Did she not recognize the reference? Did she recognize the reference but decided to sidestep its sexual innuendos? This is yet another ambiguity of the exchange, and again, perhaps an ambiguity for the participants as well.</p>
<p>Moreover, the analyst’s knowledge also sheds some light on T1’s use of personal names in her word play (lines 11–12). As mentioned earlier, immediately after ‘CaliforniZAtion’, T1 turns to a play on the teachers’ personal names, switching the suffix from ‘-ation’ to ‘-ized’. This shift from a state name to personal names and from ‘-ation’ to ‘-ized’ seems rather uneventful, but with the analyst’s knowledge of T1 being a native of California, what has otherwise looked like a simple listing of word play items is now understood to be differently motivated.</p>
<p>Subsequent interviews with both Nina and the teachers confirm that Nina was indeed referencing the song and that T1 was definitely not aware of the music reference (and neither was T2). T1 also believed that she was doing error correction. On the other hand, Nina believed that T1 ‘would know the song since it was famous’. So from her perspective, T1 could not be doing an error correction.</p>
<p>Thus, what complicates this extract is that the talk-extrinsic data involve not just the participants’ commentaries, but also the analyst’s (accidental) knowledge. Instead of confirming or specifying the CA analysis, such data 1) correct an initial CA analysis with regard to what is being done (e.g. ‘Californication’ as more than a form play) or what might be inferred (e.g. shift to personal names as coincidental), and 2) disambiguate what is being done (e.g. error correction or offering a comparable item in a list) or whether a certain understanding is withheld or simply absent (i.e. avoiding or not recognizing).</p>

<sec id="section3-1461445611433787">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In sum, both CA and talk-extrinsic data address the <italic>what</italic> (i.e. what is done) and the <italic>why</italic> (i.e. why X is done). While the CA analysis primarily documents conduct – the <italic>what</italic>, we can often infer <italic>why</italic> from that conduct. For example, by showing the different ways compliment responses are done in American English, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1461445611433787">Pomerantz (1978)</xref> infers the competing preference for both agreement and avoiding self-praise. In other words, these preferences explain why the compliments are done in their particular ways (e.g. praise downgrade or referent shift). In the toddler tutoring example, we could perhaps infer that Anna’s persistence in sorting by color is governed by a planned activity she has in mind (as is the case in most pedagogical situations). In the writing center example, we noted that Judy’s advice-giving in lieu of attending to Frank’s self-deprecation may be artifact of the institutional goal of helping tutees become better writers. In the dinner example, the misalignment between Rachael and Mike appears to indicate their different criteria for what constitutes inappropriate behavior. In the English as a Second Language (ESL) classroom example, the teacher’s conduct of not attending to the culture reference in Nina’s ‘Californication’ may be attributed to her either avoiding or not knowing the reference. Thus, what is inferable from the CA analysis typically addresses the <italic>why</italic> question.</p>
<p>Although the value of talk-extrinsic data is often conceptualized as answering the <italic>why</italic> question, they <italic>can</italic> provide vital insights into the <italic>what</italic> as well. In the toddler tutoring example, Ana reports experiencing ‘jostling for control’ as well as her effort to not sound ‘authoritative’ and not to ‘disenfranchise’ Claire. In the dinner example, Mike reaffirms his negative assessment of the girl’s inappropriate conduct. In the ESL classroom example, both the analyst’s knowledge and the participant’s report lead to the analysis of ‘Californication’ as a cultural reference. In addition, T1 reports that she was doing an error correction with ‘CaliforniZAtion’.</p>
<p>The two sets of answers to <italic>what</italic> and <italic>why</italic> can exhibit various relationships with each other. Taken together, talk-extrinsic data appear to complement CA analyses in four ways: confirm, specify, disambiguate, and correct (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1461445611433787">Figure 1</xref>). First, talk-extrinsic data can confirm the CA analysis in the sense that what is displayed is also what is experienced or intended. In the toddler tutoring example, the tension between color and size is confirmed in Anna’s report, and her conduct of doing alignment is also confirmed in her intention to not sound authoritative or disenfranchise Claire. Second, talk-extrinsic data can specify the answer to <italic>why</italic> inferred from the CA analysis. For example, Anna’s pre-set agenda is specified as a math game, and Judy’s orientation to the institutional goal is specified as helping Frank build confidence. Third, talk-extrinsic data can disambiguate an earlier CA analysis (e.g. whether ‘CaliforniZAtion’ is done as an error correction or whether T1 is not recognizing or not displaying recognition). Finally, talk-extrinsic data can correct an initial CA analysis (e.g. ‘Californication’ is not a simple instance of word play). Mike’s adamant negative assessment, for example, is in part due to his misunderstanding of Rachael’s report. We believe that these findings also provide further dimensions or specificity to what has been proposed so far. What is generally understood as ‘confirming CA analysis’, for example, may involve confirming both the <italic>what</italic> and specifying the <italic>why</italic>, and what is glossed as ‘explain CA analysis’ may involve specifying, correcting, or disambiguating a CA analysis.</p>

</fig>
<p>Before we close, three notes of caution are in order. First, in the interest of highlighting how talk-extrinsic data complement CA analyses, we have neglected to indicate what CA does uniquely that talk-extrinsic data typically do not offer. That is, describing <italic>how</italic> particular activities are accomplished in the details of talk. We see, for example, in great detail, how Judy socializes her tutee, how Anna balances the conflicting goals, and how Rachael and Mike display competing stances. Second, it is important to note that in the end, CA and talk-extrinsic data do not answer exactly the same questions. Although both are broadly addressed to the ‘what’ question, for example, CA uncovers what is done as displayed and oriented to by the participants themselves in the moment-by-moment interaction, and talk-extrinsic data (in the form of participant commentaries) reveal what is done as reported by the participants. In particular, these reports may represent a version of events that the participants would like to have their recipients see. When the two converge, we reach the understanding that what is displayed is also what is intended. It is an understanding we would not have achieved relying on only one data source. This convergence, however, does not strengthen our finding of either, just as any disconfirmation would not weaken the finding of either. In other words, the findings from different data sources do not validate or invalidate one another, but together, they do grant us greater access to a more complex picture of what transpired. Third, it is important to keep in mind that, ultimately, the nature of individual research projects with their specific research questions would determine what methods would be most appropriate, be it CA, ethnography, or a combination of the two. What we have done here is purely a methodological exercise that explores methods for the sake of methods. For certain projects, for example, disambiguating what remains ambiguous for the participants in the interaction (as in the case of ‘Californication’) may be entirely inconsequential. We are aware that we might have raised more questions than provided answers. We hope, however, that by offering some specificity to the ongoing debate on CA and context, we have made a small contribution to the existing literature on this methodological controversy. In particular, we hope to have at least begun to build a useful framework within which further discussions on analysis, context, and cross-fertilization may proceed.</p>
