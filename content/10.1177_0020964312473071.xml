<p>L<sc>eslie</sc> A<sc>llen is</sc> well known as a commentator who has spent decades working through the text of the Old Testament, giving painstaking attention to each verse and offering carefully considered judgments on textual, structural, and historical issues. Allen’s work as a hospital chaplain offering pastoral care to countless patients and their families for over a decade is less well known. The confluence of these two roles makes him uniquely qualified to write a pastoral commentary on Lamentations. In both roles, Allen is an attentive listener to the voices of grief and suffering that often go unheard in the church. He thus functions as both a witness to the experience of those grieving and a role model for those offering pastoral care.</p>
<p>Allen understands Lamentations to be “the script of liturgy intended as a therapeutic ritual” (p. 8) performed at the ruined temple by the survivors of the destruction of Jerusalem in 586 B.C.E. Throughout this commentary, he demonstrates how the lament poetry validates the suffering of the community, allows them to express their emotions in tears and talk, and encourages them to wait patiently while time heals their wounds. The therapeutic value of time, tears, and talk is amply illustrated by numerous stories from Allen’s chaplaincy as well as his extensive reading in the literature of grief.</p>
<p>At times, the emphasis on the therapeutic value for the community threatens to obscure the fact that the primary audience of Lamentations is YHWH. The laments, or complaints, resolve into piercing prayers designed to provoke YHWH to sympathy for the plight of YHWH’s suffering people and action on their behalf. As prayer, the book constitutes what George Hebert calls an “engine against the Almighty.” The book’s harsh depictions of YHWH’s judgments are not primarily designed to convince the congregation that they are just, but to convince YHWH that they are excessive. The lack of resolution in the grieving process that Allen observes is an aspect of the plea for YHWH to bring resolution by ending the suffering. Allen attends to the way the book engages God in his exposition of the final poem, which he interprets as a prayer of the congregation. The delayed emphasis on prayer, which has some grounding in the contours of the book, may reflect sage advice drawn from Allen’s experience as a chaplain: attentive, sympathetic listening must precede spiritual guidance. Allen’s pastoral commentary offers both.</p>

<body>
<p>T<sc>hese commentaries on</sc> the books of Lamentations and the Song of Songs are part of a series that invites professional theologians (rather than biblical scholars) to reflect on the theological importance of Scripture for the church today. Harvey Cox begins his commentary on Lamentations by linking the book to his own experiences of ruined cities as a way of introducing the book’s relevance for the church today. Then, after a very quick overview of the historical setting of Lamentations and some of the book’s literary features, Cox engages Lamentations around thematic issues identified from various passages in Lamentations. He offers 16 essays concerned with theological issues (God’s absence, memory, and evil); ethical issues (rape, torture, exile, starvation and cannibalism, humiliation, and pornography and war); and what he calls interrogations—questions that linger after reading Lamentations (e.g., about vengeance or the significance of Jerusalem today).</p>
<p>Stephanie Paulsell’s approach to the Song of Songs is more like a traditional commentary in that her discussion follows the text sequentially, giving considerable attention to the literary dynamics of the book. As she does so, she works to hold together a reading of the Song as erotic poetry, the readings of early Jewish and Christian interpreters (which were often allegorical), and ways for the church to read the book today.</p>
<p>Cox’s essays integrate theology, social analysis, poetry, movies, drama, and paintings. They are rich, stimulating, and reflect the intellectual breadth of a skilled theologian. His reflections are challenging, rewarding, often eloquent, and merit rereading. However, as he addresses issues identified from various scattered passages in Lamentations, it is not always clear how the perspectives he offers on them reflect perspectives of the Book of Lamentations itself.</p>
<p>Paulsell’s engagement of the Song of Songs creatively holds together what are often perceived as discordant ways of reading this book. She is attentive to the plain sense of the text as erotic poetry. However, after discussing the sense of the poetry, she is able to show how early Jewish and Christian interpreters, who often read the Song allegorically, had important theological insights. Finally, Paulsell skillfully draws out the implications of the Song for Christians today as a resource for both theological reflection and prayer.</p>

<body>
<p>T<sc>o see</sc> G<sc>enesis</sc> with new eyes, Miguel De La Torre invites the reader to view it as the story of refugees and migrants who live in a world in which God is present in surprising and sometimes disturbing ways. He reads Genesis from a liberationist perspective and listens to what the narratives say to those who live on the margins of the dominant social, political, and economic culture of the West. He treats the narratives in Genesis as testimonies by the biblical figures to their experiences of God. These witnesses to God and to human experience can be troubling, perplexing, oppressive, and liberating. De La Torre brings sound biblical scholarship to his work, but his greater interest is drawing from the narratives theological and ethical reflections that become a word of liberation and hope to those who are marginalized by social injustice.</p>
<p>As De La Torre reads Genesis from the perspective of immigrants, women, persons of color, and other oppressed groups, he discusses such critical issues as threats to ethnic identity, violence in the pursuit of justice, xenophobia, sexual abuse, and women’s identity. An interesting aspect is his ongoing discussion about the character of God. Is God the source of evil that seems so pervasive and destructive? Does God condone violence, genocide, and oppressive social structures? What is the relationship between God’s judgment and God’s grace? What does it mean to have God’s blessing? Appropriately, the reader is left with more questions than answers. Yet, De La Torre affirms that God can even use evil to bring about good. The greatest blessing is God’s presence with those who are sojourners on the earth.</p>
<p>The strength of this commentary is the clear way in which De La Torre sets forth his purpose of reading Genesis from the perspective of liberation theology and ethics. It provides a challenging approach to familiar narratives. According to his own words, he wrestles with Scripture in the same way that Jacob wrestles with God. He desires for the reader to come away from the encounter as he did: limping, blessed, and changed. This strength of the commentary is also its limitation. Some of the breadth, depth, and power of Genesis is lost because it cannot be seen through a single lens. At times, De La Torre’s application tends toward sweeping generalizations. One commentary cannot “do it all,” but bringing in other viewpoints, perspectives, and insights would enrich this good work.</p>

<body>
<p>R<sc>oy</sc> H<sc>eller’s concise</sc> volume features interpretation of the book of Judges and is part of an Anglican series of biblical commentaries. His interpretation proves insightful and challenging, as he analyzes the stories of this biblical book both with scholarly precision and with the perspective of the faithful in view. The book’s purpose is to see how the Book of Judges has “value for the reader individually and for the whole church generally” (p. 6), and Heller pursues that purpose by first examining what the book says and means. In ch.1, he begins with a long discussion of how oft-ignored Judges has been in the history of interpretation, and asserts that if the book is read as a tragedy, much may be gleaned from it. He then presents a thorough and articulate analysis, primarily literary-critical, of the content of Judges (chs. 2–5). He closes in ch. 6 by identifying two approaches for reading Judges and three main themes that he finds most compelling, and by posing multiple questions for readers to consider in their own lives of faith. Such questions illumine the complexity of the whole of Judges and its evocation for modern readers of “a more mature insight into the God in whom we live and move and have our being” (p. 113).</p>
<p>A major strength is that Heller presents a comprehensive commentary in a concise volume on arguably one of the more colorful of biblical books. Also, throughout, his analysis is cogent. Yet some may take issue with a few matters. Heller claims that Judges is “one of the most clearly organized books in Hebrew scripture” (p. 11). But numerous scholars continue to debate the redaction history of Judges, and while its final form may be less contested, this issue does not receive adequate attention. Readers also may wonder how Heller understands the impact of the themes he identifies in Judges, as he leaves multiple questions for readers instead of articulating interpretive conclusions. I find such questions refreshing, but others may feel differently.</p>

<body>
<p>A <sc>sequel to</sc> G<sc>ordon</sc> Wenham’s <italic>Story as Torah: Reading Old Testament Narrative Ethically</italic> (Baker Academic, 2004), this volume is intended to address a “scholarly blind spot” by attempting “to demonstrate the importance of the psalms particularly in molding Christian ethics and to offer an initial exploration of the ethics of the psalms” (p. xi). A major platform in Wenham’s argument is his conclusion that the psalms were meant to be memorized. This, plus the fact that worshipers would have recited and/or sung the psalms publicly, would have given the psalms particular power in shaping behavior. Such “prayed ethics” (p. 58) meant that worshipers would have adopted the psalmists’ first-person voice as their own, an act of self-involvement that would have encouraged adoption also of the perspectives and values of the psalms (which often bespeak God’s perspectives and values). Thus, the Psalter would have functioned as Torah, “instruction,” a function reinforced by the shape of the Psalter.</p>
<p>In terms of specific ethical teaching, Wenham puts the psalms in conversation with the Decalogue, and with other legal and narrative material in the Pentateuch. An important and timely conclusion of this investigation is Wenham’s claim that God’s establishment of justice for the poor is a “central theme of the Psalter [that] has its roots in the pentateuchal law” (p. 116). Continuing this direction, Wenham helpfully points out that the psalms most people consider the most ethically objectionable—the imprecatory psalms in which the psalmists ask God for help against their oppressors—actually present a profoundly ethical invitation and challenge. As he concludes, “The cry of the poor, which resounds from one end of the Psalter to the other, reaches its highest pitch in these psalms and challenges all who take them upon their own lips to identify with them and with their creator” (p. 179). The theme of God’s ultimate establishment of justice continues into the New Testament, as Wenham points out in a careful analysis that emphasizes the influence of the psalms in Romans, Hebrews, and Revelation.</p>
<p>While the discernment of ethical dimensions and implications in the psalms may not be as big a “blind spot” as Wenham thinks, he has certainly performed the valuable service of approaching the Psalter with ethics specifically in mind. I hope his concluding wish comes true: “May this book encourage many to incorporate the psalms into their own prayer life and into the life of the wider church” (p. 207).</p>

<body>
<p>I<sc>n this slim companion</sc> to Amos, John Barton provides a wide-ranging discussion of the prophetic book and its history of consequences. The study begins with a chapter on the prophetic book’s history of composition, wherein Barton argues that the study of the book’s theology cannot proceed without some sense of the text’s historical development. In two following chapters, Barton reconstructs the theological milieu against which the historical prophet seems to react and the theology of the prophet and of his “circle” (i.e., the school or group who first assembled and preserved his works). Drawing from the results of the first chapter, Barton then traces the themes found in the book’s editorial “additions.” A fifth chapter synthesizes and moves beyond the preceding two, suggesting approaches to a holistic reading of the book and deploying three variant methods: redaction-, literary-, and canonical-criticisms. This analysis yields three different readings of the book. The two final chapters discuss the history of Amos’ consequences in Jewish and Christian exegesis and the ability of the book to speak to religious communities today.</p>
<p>Throughout, Barton portrays the historical Amos as a theological innovator, whose eponymous book has irrevocably influenced Christian and Jewish theology, even if it is now inconsistent with many perspectives of modern interpreters. One point that may evoke some additional interest from readers is Barton’s reading of Amos’ stance towards ritual; Barton argues, contrary to many readings, that Amos stood firmly against sacrificial ritual, but softens this position at other points, clarifying that Amos criticized “the offering of physical objects . . . as though these were <italic>substitutes</italic> for behaving rightly toward other people” (p. 92).</p>
<p>Barton’s discussion is accessible for a broad audience, even if basic for most specialists. The book is conceivably of most use in the seminary classroom and in confessional book studies. Its clear, concise descriptions of scholarly theories of Amos’ development and redaction provides a valuable survey of recent approaches suitable for secular universities as well. The book handles theological motifs and questions with aplomb and should prove especially helpful for members of devotional communities dedicated to working through this biblical book in a critical, self-reflective manner.</p>

<body>
<p>A<sc>ccording to general</sc> editors Mikael Parsons and Charles Talbert, the purpose of the Paideia commentary series is “to comment on the final form of the New Testament text in a way that pays due attention both to the cultural, literary, and theological settings in which the text took form and to the interests of the contemporary readers to whom the commentaries are addressed” (p. ix). Mary Ann Beavis meets these goals by drawing on a career of substantial work on the Gospel of Mark and an impressive familiarity with other scholarly works in the field. Beavis follows her own translation of Mark and provides a number of helpful text insets by which readers can explore related topics (e.g., “Synagogue,” “Slavery in the Bible”), including excerpts from primary texts.</p>
<p>The great strength of this commentary is its effective integration at two main levels. The first is the level of scholarly opinion. Given the relatively brief space with which she must work, Beavis does a remarkable job describing a spectrum of perspectives on the major interpretive issues, but without compromising the coherence of her own exegetical voice. The second level of integration pertains to Mark’s cultural background, at once both Jewish and Greco-Roman. Beavis rightly draws more heavily on Mark’s Jewish background, situating Jesus within his 1st-century Palestinian milieu and highlighting scriptural echoes (consistent appeal to an Elijah-Elisha typology is somewhat distinctive). But her work in Greco-Roman literature and culture produces many insights as well, such as the likening of Jesus’ “triumphal entry” into Jerusalem (Mark 11:1–11) to the <italic>hyporche  ma</italic> (dance song) of a Greek tragedy.</p>
<p>Pastors and lay leaders can trust that this commentary represents mainstream scholarship quite well. It advances a “low” Christology reading of Mark that I see as oversimplifying the narrative but that, at the end of the day, remains the standard scholarly view. Beavis’ reflections on “theological issues” (following each section of commentary) discern some interesting and thought-provoking intersections between Mark and contemporary culture. This is “theology” in the sense of “application” or general relevance more than it is reflection on the character of God from the Markan perspective or an engagement with the Christian theological tradition. For this reason, the commentary could also work well in courses within a more secular academic department.</p>

<body>
<p>W<sc>hile there are</sc> numerous introductions to the apostle Paul available to students, Patrick Gray focuses particularly on Paul as letter-writer and answers the question, what does it mean to interpret the Pauline writings <italic>as letters</italic>? The book’s chapters cover the following subjects: “Paul’s Cultural Contexts” (ch. 1), “Letter Genres” (ch. 2), “How Paul Writes: Organizing a Letter and Making an Argument” (ch. 3), “Paul’s Audiences” (ch. 4), “How Paul Reads the Old Testament” (ch. 5), and “Pseudonymity: Did Paul Write Paul’s Letters?” (ch. 6).</p>
<p>Gray is transparent regarding his purpose: “Identification of genre is absolutely essential when attempting to make sense of a text, and Paul’s letters are no exception. . . . Once a genre is known, it is easier to gauge the relative importance of questions about the author’s identity, purpose, and so forth” (p. 10). He goes on to say that genres give the reader expectations. Thus, we can look at what Paul does in view of “distinctive conventions, forms, and purposes” (p. 13). Gray argues that Paul would have been familiar with the letter “types” of his day, generally speaking, and knew their conventions, but he also admits that none of his letters fit one “letter type” perfectly. He also recognizes that ancient rhetorical techniques are found in Paul’s letters, resembling speech transcripts, and cautions readers against rigid identification of any particular letter as only one type of rhetorical speech.</p>
<p>Gray is a very capable writer and offers his discussion of historical, literary, and hermeneutical matters with clarity and wit. I found particularly valuable the many anecdotes and modern illustrations of concepts. There are also helpful sidebars offering definitions and additional information. Each chapter ends with discussion questions and a short topical bibliography.</p>
<p>These strengths notwithstanding, I noticed a couple of weaknesses or omissions in the book. The role of letter-carriers was barely touched upon. Also, it would have been helpful to have more examples of real ancient letters compared to Paul’s letters. But this book will serve its purposes well, especially for students who want to understand Paul’s letters in their historical and literary contexts.</p>

<p>I<sc>renaeus</sc>, A<sc>quinas</sc>, Kant, Barth, and the Wesleys rarely appear in books on the Letter to the Hebrews. No doubt this is mainly because systematic theologians today rarely write biblical commentaries. The series in which this volume is included seeks to offer theologically focused commentary that considers the relevance of the text for contemporary readers. Stephen Long, a Methodist who teaches at Marquette, realizes that this is a tall task because the epistle’s “relevance is found precisely in its irrelevance” (p. 1). Given the theological aims of the series, Long is under no obligation to cover every angle to the myriad historical-critical questions the text raises. He nevertheless does due exegetical diligence even as he interjects a dozen or so multi-page excurses (“Further Reflections”) on such varied topics as “Explicit Faith, Pagano-Papalism, and Infant Baptism,” “Protestant Gnosticism and Modernity,” and “Enchanted Spaces and the Death of God.”</p>
<p>Long writes eloquently and makes consistently insightful observations that are found in no other commentary on Hebrews. He pays special attention to the Trinitarian implications of the argument, to the nuances of “perfection” language, and to the meaning of faith, focusing more closely on the terminology (<italic>hypostasis</italic>) employed in the famous definition at Heb 11:1 than to the individual heroes of Jewish history praised throughout the rest of the chapter. Due to the emphasis of Hebrews on blood sacrifice, Long is justified in the extended treatment he gives to its contribution to longstanding debates about the atonement. On a few occasions, the discussion takes turns that lay readers may have difficulty following and that biblical scholars may find beside the point, as when he parses the differences between Derrida and Žižek in their approaches to apocalypticism. But these are exceptions. Rather than settling for general statements about the importance of endurance or fidelity, Long rightly probes into the specifics of the “confession” to which the audience is told to “hold fast” and “pay attention” (e.g., 2:1; 3:1, 6, 14), all the more so since Hebrews “boldly proclaims that we do know something about who God is and what he has done . . . and we are not to have some false humility about it” (p. 242). Long and the biblical author are kindred spirits who want to help their readers see through “the flat, nominalistic modern world that blinds us from the odd reality Hebrews calls us to see” (p. 121).</p>

<p>H<sc>ere is a scholarly</sc> study of crucial real-world relevance to the 21st century church. Thomas Yoder Neufeld engages in a detailed exegetical study of the motif of “violence” as reflected within New Testament texts ranging from the Sermon on the Mount to Pauline writings to the Apocalypse of John. His stated goal is “to wrestle with how such ‘texts of trouble’ might, ironically, have the potential to subvert the very violence that troubles us in them” (p. x).</p>
<p>Neufeld opens (ch. 1) with an assessment of the terms “violence” and “New Testament” and their divergent usage within biblical scholarship, identifying his own hermeneutical stance as that of one who is committed to “active non-violence” and who reads the NT both “as Scripture, and thus as revelatory and normative” and “as good news—‘gospel’” (p. 14). In the following chapters, Neufeld then explores central NT texts/themes associated with “violence”: non-retaliation and love of enemies (ch. 2); the parable of the unforgiving slave (ch. 3); the cleansing of the temple (ch. 4); the death of Jesus and its atoning significance (ch. 5); subordination to authority (ch. 6); and divine warfare (ch. 7). Neufeld’s conclusions confirm the ironic potential identified as the goal of his study:
<disp-quote>
<p>In various ways and in a variety of contexts the writers of the New Testament insist that the ministry, teaching, death and resurrection of Jesus, and the deliberate, defiant and creative vulnerability of his followers, are the victory <italic>over</italic> and not <italic>of</italic> violence.” (p. 150)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>A significant strength of Neufeld’s work is the candor and courage with which he approaches his task. Neufeld clearly names the challenges inherent in the texts that he discusses, and lays out the broad spectrum of scholarly viewpoints on the “violence” associated with these texts. He then reads the texts carefully and canonically, raises pointed and insightful questions, and lays out conclusions firmly grounded at every level—exegetical, theological, and ecclesial. Most striking and courageous, perhaps, is Neufeld’s sturdy insistence that Jesus clearly portrays God as “judge” (p. 52), that God’s “judgment” is accordingly more than simply “the inexorable consequences of sin” (p. 53), and that God’s “mercy, grace, and forgiveness only make sense within [such] a conceptual framework” (p. 54). Neufeld’s book is a rich tool for pastors and academics alike.</p>

<p>I <sc>eagerly welcomed</sc> the opportunity to read and review this encyclopedic work in preparation for teaching a seminary course in New Testament Ethics. The dictionary did not disappoint; I found it to be a rich and informative resource for thinking about the questions that arise in the interface between Bible and contemporary ethics. Three introductory essays (by Allen Verhey, Charles Cosgrove, and Bruce Birch) orient readers to the volume and to interdisciplinary research on Scripture and Christian ethics. The 490 articles that follow explore a wide range of topics, some arising from within biblical books and texts and others from the history of inquiry and debate in Christian ethics (or moral theology). Many articles explicitly connect the two domains, while others focus almost exclusively on the content of the ancient writings or on the contemporary ethical concern or field of inquiry. The 234 contributing authors (with notice of terminal academic degree, current employment status, and entries written) are listed on pp. vii–xiv. An alphabetical listing of the entries appears on pp. 857–60.</p>
<p>In an ambitious collaborative project of this magnitude, with so many contributing authors and such an array of topics, it is unsurprising that the articles exhibit some unevenness in scope, depth, and quality, and in the balance they strike between treatment of biblical materials and discussion of contemporary contexts and moral concerns. Many essays give thoughtful attention to the connections, as well as the cultural and perspectival distance, between ancient text and contemporary context. Some entries present only the author’s view, while others orient readers to a spectrum of views on the subject. (And while most articles provide bibliographical pointers for further reading on the topic, a few neglect to do so.) There are gaps. To mention a few: the “Accountability” entry neglects Jesus’ servant parables in the Gospels, notably the parables of the talents and pounds; that on “Acts” does not discuss the ethical challenge posed by Luke’s sketch of the emerging church in relation to Judaism; likewise, the entry on “Hebrews” does not address the potential for anti-Jewish readings of that book (noted briefly in the essay on “Supersessionism”); and that on “Land” omits consideration of the seemingly intractable problem the land of Palestine in particular poses for biblical ethics. In a volume that reflects the editors’ obvious commitment to including diverse denominational and cultural perspectives, the relatively limited representation of Asian and Pacific Rim voices is unexpected. On the other hand, there is occasional redundancy, as separate articles show substantial overlap (e.g., the separate entries on “Human Rights” and “Rights” cover much the same ground). These quibbles notwithstanding, this volume, edited by a team of highly respected scholars, offers a wealth of insight and information from a host of excellent contemporary biblical scholars, theologians, and ethicists. It will be an invaluable resource to fund the study and preparation for teaching and preaching on the part of pastors and educators who take seriously the difficult, complicated challenge of engaging biblical texts from contemporary contexts and cultures, and of engaging contemporary ethical challenges from the perspectives provided by Scripture.</p>

<p>I<sc>n contrast to studies</sc> that anachronistically still frame Jesus largely in religious terms, Douglas Oakman argues that Jesus’ “typical concerns” were political and engaged with 1st-century power and politics. With a selective debt to Reimarus, Oakman locates Jesus’ activity in Herod Antipas’ Galilee, accessed through archaeology, social-science models, and studies of Roman Galilee and the wider empire (chs. 2–3). Jesus emerges as a “world-engaged” peasant artisan associated with a group understanding itself in terms of fictive kinship, practicing reciprocity of resources, focused on the kingdom of God (“The Power”) and on God as father and king. God is a patron of whose liberating/Passover power and healing benefits Jesus was a broker. Jesus’ resistance to Roman agrarian practices centered on political-economic matters such as open table fellowship with tax collectors and sinners/debtors, tax resistance, and debt relief leading to subsistence sufficiency marked by reciprocity. For this agenda Jesus is crucified.</p>
<p>Subsequently, the NT writings mostly engage in a significant reformulation that embraced eschatological and cosmological schemes, depoliticized presentations of Jesus, created a Greco-Roman religious cultus, forgot rural peasants, and fostered an urban, “quietistic, domestic religion” (p. 133) separated from Judaism. Reimarus was right, in Oakman’s view, at least in positing a significant discontinuity between the political Jesus and his followers who depoliticized his memory.</p>
<p>Oakman offers an insightful reconstruction of Jesus that takes seriously imperial Galilean and Judean realities. While some aspects of his reconstruction will be debated—the usefulness of “peasant” classifications, the nature of Herod Antipas’ rule, a non-eschatological Jesus who did not found a movement—he persuasively locates Jesus in Galilean imperial contexts. Yet, Oakman’s reconstruction of early Christianity as marked by a progression toward a Christ cult and a thorough-going depoliticalization of Jesus is questionable. Recent work on the NT and the Roman empire has clearly demonstrated that no such monolithic stance can be posited, that diverse forms of imperial engagement are evident, and that numerous NT documents are not nearly as forgetful of Jesus’ political action as Oakman alleges.</p>
<p>This important book offers a perspective and draws together a wealth of material not often engaged in historical-Jesus work. It identifies its agenda, methods, and arguments clearly. For college and seminary courses, and for church groups that like to read, this is an accessible and insightful book.</p>

<p>T<sc>his book consists</sc> of 15 essays by a roster of the most distinguished among Jewish biblical interpreters. The book is of interest and importance for two reasons. First and foremost, because it has been published and exists. It is a long-standing truism that, in the words of Jon Levenson, “Jews are not interested in Biblical Theology.” The compelling reason for that lack of interest is that “Biblical Theology” has been singularly a Christian enterprise that was intuitively and uncritically christological and intrinsically supersessionist. This volume indicates a happy change in that reality, both because Christian interpreters have been slowly reeducated by the insistence of Jews, and because a newer generation of Jewish scholars (on exhibit here) has been willing to enter that interpretive conversation.</p>
<p>Two things are clear in these suggestive probes into Jewish biblical theology. First, these authors, in studying biblical texts, regularly appeal to the ongoing post-biblical tradition of interpretation. The biblical text cannot be taken alone, but is always accompanied by that tradition of interpretation about which most Christian interpreters know nothing. Second, it is clear that these Jewish interpreters have one eye on parallel interpretive practices among Christians, so that an effort is made to voice the singular claims of Judaism, as distinct from Christian claims. Given that recurring habit, it is especially important to notice the judgment of Marc Brettler:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>What I and others believe to be a core element of Jewish biblical theology is not uniquely Jewish, and may indeed reflect the direction in which general biblical theology is moving. Thus, even as Jewish biblical theology begins to emerge as a separate field, it is time to wonder how truly distinct it will remain. I do not mean to imply that Jewish biblical theology will totally lose its identity—after all, its interest in showing continuity with postbiblical <italic>Jewish</italic> tradition . . . will keep it somewhat distinct, but we should not be surprised if many points of significant overlap between Christian and Jewish biblical theology begin to develop. (p. 197)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The second reason the book is interesting and important is that the specific essays provide rich and suggestive material for interpretive reflection. The late doyen of Jewish interpretation, Moshe Greenberg, offers two essays, one on the human dimension of the prophets and one on the honest piety of Job. The most programmatic essay is that of Marvin Sweeney, who situates the prophetic corpus in dialogue with the other canons of the Hebrew Bible. These essays invite engagement by Christian interpreters who will find companion interpreters sharing the same task, but in a quite distinct and non-negotiable cadence.</p>

<p>T<sc>his collection of</sc> previous lectures and essays has been reworked and integrated by Todd Billings around the emerging rubric of “theological retrieval” (as described by John Webster), in order to show how a classically Reformed “theology of union with Christ can give us new eyes, changing not only the [contemporary] theological conversation but the way that we live into the Christian life and ministry” (p. 173). Billings is Associate Professor of Theology at Western Theological Seminary in Holland, Michigan.</p>
<p>Five substantive chapters draw primarily on Scripture and the writings of John Calvin, amplified and revised with ideas drawn from the likes of Augustine, Franciscus Junius, Herman Bavinck, the Belhar Confession, and Karl Barth. Each chapter tackles an area that Billings considers important to contemporary theology and ministry, in light of a classic Reformed understanding of “union with Christ.” His goal in each case is to address the “cultural captivity” of our time from an historical vantage point that can help us “recognize the reality that truth is always perceived from a particular perspective shaped by many social, historical, and cultural factors” (p. 4).</p>
<p>This retrieval method yields some very interesting insights. An initial chapter on “Salvation as Adoption in Christ” does much to clarify a Christian alternative to our culture’s obsessive groping for “identity,” though here Billings might profitably have focused more intentionally on baptism as an organizing rubric. The chapter discussing total depravity helpfully dispatches common stereotypes of Reformed views of human nature rooted in the TULIP acronym, arguing that our complete reliance on God’s grace is the necessary prerequisite for a coherent and convincing theology of union with Christ. Junius and Bavinck loom large in a chapter that uses Calvin’s category of accommodation to correlate divine incomprehensibility with the possibility of divine communion. In what is perhaps the strongest chapter in the book, Billings springboards from the Belhar Confession to a broader and more authentically Reformed reconstrual of the Christian call to justice drawn from Calvin’s understandings of the Law, our obligations to our neighbors, and the call of the Lord’s Supper to communion with all. In a final discussion that is insightful but unnecessarily confrontative, Billings proposes the theme of “participation in Christ” as a more adequate theological motivation for youth ministry, evangelism, and cross-cultural mission, in contrast to frequent evangelical reliance upon so-called “incarnational theology.” The book’s chief strength is its ability to articulate clearly the relevance of classic Reformed theological sources for contemporary theological and pastoral challenges. It will be helpful to theologians and pastors alike.</p>

<p>T<sc>he</sc> P<sc>resbyterian</sc> C<sc>hurch’s</sc> “Brief Statement of Faith” declares that “the Spirit gives us courage . . . to unmask idolatries in Church and culture.” Courageously taking up the suggestion by former National Rifle Association executive Warren Cassidy that “You would get a far better understanding of the NRA if you were approaching us as one of the great religions of the world,” retired Presbyterian minister Jim Atwood, a 30-year veteran of the struggle to enact sensible gun-control laws, explores America’s obsession with guns as a form of idolatry. “Gun violence is not so much a political or social problem,” he writes, “as it is a <italic>spiritual</italic> problem, and God’s people must be in the lead of the moral and ethical struggle for the soul of America” (p. xvii). Following Walter Wink, he concludes that the real problem in America is that violence is our true god. This devotion, Atwood suggests, is deeply intertwined with our Puritan heritage and peculiarly American notions about manifest destiny, the conviction that we have been uniquely appointed by God as “the trustees of the world’s progress.” Sadly, he concludes, “using violence when necessary in support of these righteous causes is not only justified, it is a moral obligation” (p. 56).</p>
<p>In the short span of months since this book was published, we have experienced the mass shootings in Aurora, Colorado and Oak Creek, Wisconsin, as well as the sentencing of Jared Lee Loughner for the Tucson shooting in 2011 that injured congresswoman Gabriel Giffords and killed six others. Yet, politicians across the political spectrum agree there are unlikely to be any changes to our gun control laws. With biblical and theological insight, Atwood delves deeply into the culture of the “Gun Empire,” which uses fear and deceit to inspire trust in our weaponry to provide security for our homes and family, despite all evidence to the contrary. This blind trust can only be described as a form of faith. Atwood concedes that he has had only a few fleeting exchanges with those who believe “guns save lives.” He is hopeful that the faith community, speaking the truth in love, can initiate a national dialogue that might lead to fair and balanced gun laws that protect the rights of gun ownership while keeping handguns and assault weapons off the street. Let us hope he is right.</p>

<body>
<p>T<sc>his intellectual/cultural</sc> history by Gary Scott Smith discusses heaven and the afterlife, as it is imagined by various Americans, ranging from preachers and theologians to novelists and filmmakers, from the 17th century to the present day. The book is organized chronologically, dealing with the concept of heaven as it developed during different phases of American history (such as the time of the Puritans, the Victorian age, and the “Roaring Twenties to the Fabulous Fifties”).</p>
<p>Readers should not be surprised to learn that changing American conceptions of the afterlife reflected changing temperaments of different historical eras. The Puritans depicted a theocentric heaven in which redeemed saints perpetually adore the triune God. Victorian-era proponents of the “cult of domesticity” depicted the “heavenly home” as a happy family reunion. Progressive thinkers of the industrial age imagined an afterlife that involved productive labor and creative achievement. Novelists in our current therapeutic society imagine a heaven in which inhabitants work out unresolved emotional issues of their earthly lives.</p>
<p>What is surprising is the remarkable unity of concerns related to the afterlife that Americans express over the decades. Similar questions arise: Is there a heaven? What is it like? How does one get there? Will we recognize our friends and loved ones in heaven? Will they recognize us? What about hell? This thematic unity is partly the result of Smith’s decision to focus on these questions, and to focus on the religious communities that habitually concern themselves with them—mostly Christian, and more specifically Protestant. However, Smith makes a good case that his choices are justified by textual and demographic data, and he does pay some attention to groups outside these boundaries.</p>
<p>This book is interesting as a historical tour through the changing and diverse conceptions of the afterlife in America, but it is even more valuable theologically. It takes the various conceptions seriously, exploring them in depth, and comparing and contrasting them with each other. Smith does not give his own views about heaven and the afterlife, but he stresses the importance of the topic, both as a theme of the Christian tradition and an issue raised by reflection on human experience. In so doing, he challenges readers to come to terms with the question of the afterlife for themselves.</p>

<p>I<sc>n this second volume</sc> in Wiley-Blackwell’s “Global Christianity” series, Daniel Bays has done what few people could do, or should try to do: summarize in about 200 pages the 1,400 year history of Christianity in China. He does it well, giving a brief overview of the Persian period of Christianity (“Nestorian,” an improper title Bays still uses) and the Mongol missions followed by the early Jesuit period. Chapters 3–6 then cover 1800 to 1950, and in Bays’ view, represent the heart of the book. Two final chapters concisely discuss the development of Christianity in the post-missionary era with an eye to the unique development of Chinese Christianity as part of a global movement. Only someone who has been dealing with this material since the opening of China to Christian scholarship (nearly 25 years ago) could attempt such a scholarly feat. Only someone as wise, gracious, and experienced as Daniel Bays could do it well.</p>
<p>There is much to commend in this book, but in this brief review I will lift up only a few strengths. The complex relationship between the state and churches and individual believers is explained with empathy, clarity, and charity. Bays knows both church leaders and government officials who oversee religion in China, and thus his discussions are well informed and very helpful for non-China specialists. Discussions about the difference between rural and urban Christianity, folk religions and Christianity, and the influence of millennialism and materialism are enlightening. One of the great contributions for Western Christians trying to grasp the reality of church and state in China is the historical perspective the book provides on Chinese rule, rulers, and religions. Speaking of the New China in the 1950s, Bays notes,
<disp-quote>
<p>The repeated historical experience of sectarian popular religious movements . . . turning into anti-dynastic rebellions was sufficient to make all central governments instinctively vigilant of religion. The new government of the People’s Republic of China inherited this default attitude from the imperial past. (p. 159)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>It is not so much communism that influences the Chinese government’s response to religion as it is 4,000 years of dynastic rule. China has ancient patterns of dealing with religions that are mostly “other-worldly” and that at the same time resent the rule and rulers in “this world.” This careful discussion of a major theme in Chinese Christian history—that of the relationship of the church and state—is among the finest I have read. Christians in the West need to learn from this wise Sinologist how to think contextually and empathetically about global Christianity in each place.</p>
<p>If you read only one volume on Chinese Christianity, this is it. However, in an otherwise excellent introductory volume I found the ending a little disappointing. There is a nearly tedious discussion at the end about how American Christians misunderstand the situation in China, and thus some (the “China lobby”) continue to promote propaganda about how Christians are severely persecuted in China and still need Bibles. Bays did not need to criticize these people directly because his fine volume already neutralizes their “alarmist rhetoric” with reasoned, balanced, and gracious scholarship.</p>

<p>J<sc>ohn</sc> P<sc>aul</sc> H<sc>eil’s</sc> <italic>Worship in the Letter to the Hebrews</italic> follows on the heels of his <italic>The Letters of Paul as Rituals of Worship</italic> (Cascade, 2011) in which he argued for the central significance of worship in the 13 letters of the apostle. With this text-centered exegesis of the Letter to the Hebrews, Heil again seeks to convince his audience that the topic of worship “provides the major concern and thrust that embraces Hebrews from start to finish” (p. 1). Hebrews, therefore, is able to “deepen, enrich, and inspire” (p. 275) Christian liturgical and ethical worship today as surely as it originally did in the second half of the 1st century.</p>
<p>For those familiar with Heil’s earlier, self-described “literary-rhetorical, audience-oriented” monographs on the epistles (Ephesians, Philippians, Colossians), which he also analyzed by means of their chiastic structural patterns, this book will not surprise, but it will impress. Heil has demonstrated a remarkable facility and fluency with the biblical text of Hebrews (for which he provides his own translation). Here, Heil has revised his recent, more comprehensive study on chiastic structures in Hebrews for a more general audience. He retains the same macrochiastic levels that he identified there, and uses concentric parallelism consistently to identify worship as the central focus throughout the letter. By presenting a structure comprised of 33 chiastic units, Heil argues that Hebrews is a systematic, logical, and coherent word of exhortation that, despite its complexity, would have been readily grasped by the implied audience.</p>
<p>Heil has ably identified important themes and issues in Hebrews using his chiastic analysis. That worship should figure so prominently as a theme in epistles or homilies that circulated among religious communities apparently does not surprise me so much as it does Heil. He may not always convince, but he nevertheless presents a thought-provoking look at Hebrews that can supplement more accessible commentaries. His approach also provides fresh insights into some of the interpretive cruxes in Hebrews. Although the puzzle of the structure of Hebrews will continue to perplex, Heil has presented a compelling and fascinating study. It is complicated and slow going, but it had me returning time and again to the text itself, which is a good thing.</p>

<body>
<p>I<sc>n this thematic</sc> collection of essays and presentations, Michael Budde challenges the church to live out its primary vocation of forming disciples whose primary identity and allegiance is grounded in their baptismal vows and life together as followers of Jesus Christ. Budde, Professor of Political Science and Catholic Studies at DePaul University, presents this challenge in contrast to national, economic, political, racial, and other claims on our identity. Budde’s indictment of the church, particularly in the West, is equally aimed at his own Roman Catholic church as well as at mainline Protestant, evangelical, and Orthodox Christian ecclesial bodies.</p>
<p>In an era of globalization, Budde calls on Christian communities to recognize the power of practicing ecclesial solidarity with fellow disciples around the world. Here, the task of living into the demands of the gospel causes Christians to re-evaluate their willing complicity with the claims of the nation-state (especially in relationship to the military industrial complex) and the modern capitalist market (particularly as it is connected to and promoted by the advertising and entertainment industry). Adequate and life-long formation in Christian faith prompts Christians to “push against interpretive frameworks not rooted in the word become flesh” (p. 123). In this struggle, the church must begin by teaching its own members “what it means to think, feel, and desire as a Christian” (p. 152).</p>
<p>As a collection of essays, this volume presents a series of snapshots rather than a sustained argument. As a liturgical theologian, I longed for an analysis of where and how the baptismal liturgy can more clearly mark us and make the claim that our first identity is to Jesus Christ. Budde simply alludes to the difficulty of this task as one that cannot be accomplished with a program or curriculum. In this regard, the book is a compelling diagnosis of the malady and dysfunctionality of the church, which continues to cede ground to other powers and principalities. The book is missing the development of suggestive ways that the church can reclaim its role, both in terms of forming and nurturing people in the faith as well as celebrating their growth through its ritual life. Nevertheless, this is an important and worthwhile book for pastors and church leaders in this post-Christian age.</p>

<body>
<p>T<sc>he image of the</sc> preacher as a “fool for Christ” (1 Cor 4:10) has a long heritage, beginning with the itinerant preaching ministries of Paul and Jesus. The multifaceted fool is pervasive in literature, ritual, theater, visual art, and film in such roles as jester, trickster, clown, scapegoat, ironist, or satirist. In <italic>Preaching Fools: The Gospel as a Rhetoric of Folly</italic>, Charles Campbell and Johan Cilliers bring together fools from all of these arenas and place them into the service of articulating a theological ethic for preaching. The book concludes that ethical preaching should be interruptive, transgressive, and subversive. The proclamation of the cross is a fools-game, disrupting the world’s understandings of power and wisdom, while always opening up a new vision grounded in God’s love, justice, and peace.</p>
<p>While reading the book, one can overhear conversations between Campbell, a North American teacher of preaching, and Cilliers, who teaches homiletics in the South African context. As a result, the book engages a distinctly global range of theologians, artists, novelists, dramatists, cartoonists, theorists of language, aestheticians, religionists, and cultural theorists. The authors do not simply leave us with a well-articulated theology and an appreciation of the meaning of various historical manifestations of the “fool.” They also turn directly toward the task of preaching and provide a broad range of rhetorical forms that can function to enhance the folly of preaching as an ethical practice. The goal of these rhetorical forms is to generate a rhetorical experience characterized as “1) bivocal, 2) disruptive, 3) transgressive, and 4) ambiguous and indirect” (p. 184).</p>
<p>Although the biblical concept of the preaching fool is central throughout, Campbell and Cilliers want the reader to find the fool under nearly every rock—to experience how this concept is pervasive within Western aesthetic, ritual, and religious practice. For this reason, the book may be useful in classrooms and intellectual discussions about theological aesthetics that reach beyond the homiletics classroom.</p>
<p>The writers are energetic (dare one say homiletical?) about their subject matter. However, occasional flourishes of exhortation and declaration do not detract from either the quality of research or the range and depth of this book. Campbell and Cilliers have moved the conversation about ethical preaching to the next level, and working pastors and scholars will find this book both challenging and immensely helpful.</p>

<body>
<p>F<sc>or scholars of</sc> homiletics, what generally classifies as testimony is also preaching in the literal sense, but current scholarship in the field commonly plays on the similarities between the two. In <italic>I Believe I’ll Testify</italic>, Cleophus LaRue seems to blur the distinctions even more by synthesizing this collection of essays on trends in Christian preaching and American homiletics around the act of testifying. This is demonstrated primarily in the way the book is structured, but also implicitly in the way testimony influences LaRue’s assessment of what is wrong with preaching today and what needs to be done to ensure its future relevance.</p>
<p>Contrary to the subtitle, the scope of the book is not limited to the context of African-American preaching. This ethnic marker more accurately signifies LaRue’s point of departure into discussions on a range of topics that cut across cultures—from the contextual nature of preaching to the role of imagination in moving from text to sermon; from the browning of Christianity throughout the world to the challenges predominantly white seminaries and divinity schools face in adequately preparing people of color for ministry.</p>
<p>While the contents of the book vary in subject and intended audience—some essays are meant for preachers (both novice and seasoned) and others for academics—the concept of testimony links the nine essays together like “pearls on a string” (p. 26). In testimony-like fashion, LaRue establishes his arguments using mostly autobiographical anecdotes drawn from his experiences “growing up in Texas in the 1950s” (p. xi). There is something refreshing about reading an author who takes seriously the importance of locating himself culturally and implicating the context that informs his views. Readers from other cultural backgrounds may find this postmodern approach fruitful for authentic intercultural dialogue.</p>
<p>LaRue, however, is not the only one testifying. In the act of preaching, God, Scripture, the preacher, culture, and even “artful rhetoric [testify]” (p. xiv). LaRue implies that the absence of a genuine interplay of these testimonies is at the root of the problems with preaching, namely, insipid sermons and trends toward “pulpits without purpose” (p. 37). The implication left me wondering: how important are the distinctions between testimony and preaching, especially since testimony comprises much of what is recommended to make preaching better? This query strikes me as a rich topic for conversation, one that LaRue’s book has opened up.</p>

<body>
<p>D<sc>eath and dying</sc> are two subjects most of us avoid at all costs. But as the authors of these two books point out, we do so at our own peril.</p>
<p><italic>Speaking of Dying</italic> cites the stories of ten different churches whose pastors suffered from terminal illnesses. The stories demonstrate how the avoidance of death and dying impoverishes not only those who are dying but also the members of their churches as well. This book urges the church to step up to the problem by reclaiming its rightful place alongside the dying rather than outsourcing the dying to other, less qualified, caretakers. It persuasively argues that the church is uniquely qualified to help people die well because the defining narrative of the church is found in the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ—an unparalleled narrative of hope and healing. Having challenged the church to take up this important work, the three authors also offer a number of very helpful suggestions for doing so.</p>
<p><italic>Dem Dry Bones</italic> serves as a helpful reminder that hope and healing can only be had when one tackles death and dying head on. Written as a rejoinder to the so-called prosperity gospel emanating from many of today’s pulpits, Luke Powery argues for a gospel that engages the real world, where suffering and death is all too commonplace. Like Craddock and company, Powery says that these realities must be given a voice if there is to be any hope for new life. The genius of this book is its extended exegesis of Ezekiel 37—the valley of dry bones—and a sampling of African-American spirituals which, by first giving voice to death, are then in a position to give voice to the hope that comes in and through death. Preachers will also find in this book an inspired and inspiring spiritual hermeneutic for addressing these and other weighty matters.</p>
<p>Pastors and other caregivers should not let the subject matter keep them from buying and reading these two books! In their own distinctive ways, they faithfully remind the church that it has a story to tell that is unlike any other, one that takes life seriously enough to take on that old nemesis—death.</p>

<body>
<p>P<sc>astoral care with</sc> those working to recover bodies at Ground Zero required a model of care that far exceeded a mere adjustment of notions of empathy or of the classical pastoral shepherding functions. It required a thorough examination of the theological and psychological foundations that formed that very care. Storm Swain offers this examination in her “Earth-making,” “Pain-bearing,” and “Life-Giving” Trinitarian model of pastoral care, which she found in the pastoral practices of the 9/11 Temporary Mortuary (T. Mort.) chaplains at Ground Zero. Using a critical correlational method, Swain draws on Augustine’s notion of the Trinity (an image of an active God and a theological anthropology of the <italic>imago Dei</italic>) and Winnicott’s notion of holding spaces to provide a basis for a transformational model of care in the face of a catastrophic trauma. She provides a rich examination of this Earth-Making, Pain-Bearing, Life-Giving pastoral model, intertwining theological and psychoanalytic concepts with the voices of the chaplains who worked with the New York Fire Department, Emergency Medical Technicians, the New York Police Department, and medical examiners to recover bodies at Ground Zero.</p>
<p>The immediate relevancy and care with which Swain offers this pastoral model is found in her use of the chaplains’ voices and testimonials. The often visceral descriptions of the T. Mort chaplains’ responses allows the reader to connect affectively with them in order to understand their resilience, post-traumatic growth, and dependence on a mutually caring community. Swain names a theological or psychological point and then allows a chaplain’s voice to give life to the concept. Her solid grounding in both the love and economy of God and the transforming dimensions of a good-enough holding environment creates a frame that can hold the rawness of the details. The details are reasonably unsettling—e.g., a chaplain is told to look for “something sharp (bone fragments), something soft (flesh) or something stinky (decay)” (p. 49)—and yet this Trinitarian model of care is generative enough to allow them to remain simultaneously raw and transformed. This work will be relevant for a variety of audiences: those interested in Augustine’s Trinitarian concepts of God’s love or in Winnicott’s theory of holding spaces, those looking for a strong example of a pastoral theological method, and those who want a critical exploration of pastoral theology and practice in the midst of catastrophic trauma.</p>

<p>P<sc>resident</sc> B<sc>arack</sc> O<sc>bama</sc>, like so many of his predecessors, is a confessing Christian who believes that it is sometimes justifiable for the United States to go to war. A great majority of American Christians—Protestant and Catholic, clergy and laity—agrees with the president on this issue. And all of them together, whether they know it or not, stand opposed to the teachings of early church leaders.</p>
<p>Ronald J. Sider, professor of theology, holistic ministry, and public policy at Palmer Theological Seminary, has given us the definitive sourcebook of the early church’s views on war, capital punishment, and abortion. Using early church texts, Roman writings, and archaeological data, Sider offers a two-part conclusion: 1) “every extant Christian statement on killing and war up until the time of Constantine says Christians must not kill, even in war”; and 2) “a growing number of Christians, especially in the late and early fourth centuries, acted contrary to that teaching” (p. 194). Although this conclusion is not altogether new, it has never been so carefully argued, sturdily buttressed, and comprehensively presented. A first-rate historian, Sider mines extant sources with remarkable precision and restraint, studiously avoiding the faulty generalizations of scholars who have suggested that just war thinking has deep roots in the early church.</p>
<p>The early church matters so much, according to Sider, because “it seems plausible to suppose that Christians much closer to the time of Jesus”—long before Constantine embraced Christianity—“would be more likely to understand Jesus’ teaching on enemies than those who lived centuries later” (p. 13). In this view, the early church writers are far more credible as moral sources than, say, Augustine or Aquinas, both of whom offered theological justification for killing under certain circumstances. As for the early church leaders, they would have none of it: killing in war, capital punishment, and abortion are all prohibited for religious and ethical reasons. That was a peculiar and prophetic message in a culture that celebrated wars and easily justified capital punishment and abortions.</p>
<p>We no longer live in the time of the early church, of course, and it would be irresponsible of us to apply its teachings uncritically, as if our own context does not matter in making moral decisions about life and death. But we do live in an “Age of Terror,” and God knows that we are in desperate need of credible moral sources. Thanks to Sider’s meticulous scholarship, we now have easy access to some of the best sources in our faith—the wise words and courageous witness of the early church.</p>

<p>F<sc>ollowing his 2003</sc> best-seller <italic>Presbyterian Questions, Presbyterian Answers</italic> (Geneva Press), Donald McKim offers more answers to questions being raised by Presbyterians. With a strong nod to the Reformed tradition, and with the expressed intent of developing a deeper understanding among Presbyterians and non-Presbyterians regarding what it means to be Christian the Presbyterian way, McKim touches on a wide range of questions related to such topics as: Presbyterian history, theology and worship; ways Presbyterians live the Christian life; how Presbyterians address social and ethical issues; and what Presbyterians think about the future.</p>
<p>Although the book (by McKim’s own admission) does not go into detailed answers for each question, it does provide an excellent primer for those curious about, or new to, Presbyterianism. It also serves as a good refresher for “dyed-in-the-wool” Presbyterians. McKim offers the reader a useful resource that is biblically informed, theologically astute, deeply confessional, and thoroughly Presbyterian, whether breaking down the meaning of certain articles/phrases in The Apostle’s Creed; identifying the great ends of the church; discussing the liturgical calendar; reviewing the different types of prayer; or wrestling with the age-old question, “Will all people be saved?” To this inquiry, McKim answers, “God is free to choose whom God saves . . . and by whatever means God chooses . . . If it is possible for all to be saved, what Christian would not want this? If we do not, where is our love?” (p. 103).</p>
<p>While I was reading the book and thinking about the ways it might be used in the local church, several venues came to mind. Confirmands and their class leaders would benefit from its basic contents. People attending New Member/Inquirers Classes, especially those coming from other denominations or those with limited or no church involvement, would find it an excellent introduction to Presbyterianism. Officers training for both elders and deacons is another context where the question and answer format (accompanied by a handy study guide in the back of the book) could lead to rich and lively discussion and quality learning. The same would be true for an adult Sunday School class. I hope readers who strive to make Christian faith the Presbyterian way intelligible to Christians and non-Christians alike will find ways to use McKim’s book for the glory of God, the good of the church, and the salvation of humankind.</p>

<p>P<sc>eople wonder about</sc> religion. In a pluralistic society, do followers of a particular religion have a right to shape the common life according to their religious vision? Can they do this while respecting others whose visions differ? How should Christians engage public life? In this superb book, Miroslav Volf answers these urgent, vexing questions. Writing from within the particularity of the Christian tradition, he outlines a third way between a secularism that would banish religion from public life and a totalizing approach that would absorb the public sphere into religion.</p>
<p>According to Volf, the main gift Christians offer the world is their distinctive vision of human flourishing. Since this is a vision of the truly human life, it has universal implications, even as it inevitably overlaps with, differs from, and sometimes contradicts other visions. He affirms that Christians are called to mend the world by sharing their wisdom and that this vocation necessarily involves every sphere of life, including political and public life.</p>
<p>Of course, Christians do not always properly engage the world. Volf blames these failures on malfunctions of ascent and return. Malfunctions of ascent involve the prophetic encounter with God and the vision of human flourishing. Malfunctions of return involve inactivity or overactivity. To cure slothful idleness, he prescribes a faith that can undergird a sense of vocation and give meaning to life’s successes and brokenness. To cure coercive, even violent faith, he recommends not less faith, but faith attuned to its internal resources to prevent overreaching and aggression. Volf offers helpful insight into Christian identity in a pluralistic world and outlines ways Christians can share their wisdom.</p>
<p>The questions Volf addresses in this wise book puzzle pastors, parishioners, and the public. He is particularly adept at poking holes in popular but overly simplistic solutions to the question of religion and public life. Though it is much more than this, the book may be read as a sort of apologetic directed at those who dismiss religion as the problem. Pastors will find it an encouraging, illuminating, and helpful resource for preaching. The clarity of Volf’s writing and the accessibility of his thought recommend it for a lay book study or Sunday School class. Theologians, ethicists, and anyone who struggles with questions of religion and public life will find this an excellent statement of why and how Christians ought to be working to mend the world.</p>
