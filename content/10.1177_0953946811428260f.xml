<p>Much of the talk within theology and sexuality over the last decades, contends health care ethicist Geoffrey Rees, has been about protesting innocence. In textual-apologetic approaches to homosexuality in particular, theologians have often rehearsed the argument that same-sex relationships have the potential to be just as legitimate, just as redemptive, just as sacramental as opposite-sex ones. However, this account is, protests Rees, flawed. It is a romance, a story. Rees’ central argument is as follows: it is not that same-sex relationships are just as ‘innocent’ as opposite-sex marriages, and that theologians and ethicists should therefore ‘welcome’ homosexual couples into the sanctified ‘fold’. Rather, because <italic>all</italic> of us, and all of our sexuality, is tainted by original sin (which reads, in Rees, as a strikingly democratising phenomenon), not even ‘blessed’ and ‘sacramental’ modes of marriage as set out in theological accounts of the ‘ideal’ heterosexual relationship are enough to redeem us. Homosexuality should therefore not even try to be recognised as innocent or legitimate: to do so is to chase a false innocence and legitimacy and unwittingly to reinforce the idea that heterosexuality is somehow sanctifying in the first place.</p>
<p>Drawing on Butlerian and Foucauldian accounts of melancholy, Rees holds that humans have indeed lost our ‘unity of self’ in God via sin, but that it is delusion to suppose that heterosexual marriage, of all things, can be a means of conferring grace and making us whole again. Marriage, in fact, at least in theological accounts of it, becomes, ironically, a way to anaesthetise us to our loss, a way to refuse the continuity of that loss—a refusal which Rees understands not as righteous anger and indignation, but as delusion. The unitive power of marriage has become so over-stated in theologies of sexuality that it is endowed with an almost soteriological potency. Those who promote marriage consider it a location for the exercise of innocent sexuality, so that any extra-marital sex (even, and perhaps especially, between those who cannot marry in certain jurisdictions) can be figured as illicit. ‘Progressive’ arguments in favour of same-sex marriage therefore miss the point: same-sex couples are <italic>not</italic> being excluded from marriage’s power to grace and remake humans into wholeness, because that supposed power is itself a fiction, a romance. Understanding heterosexuality as in any way sacramental is absurd.</p>
<p>Rees believes, after Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick and others, that ‘innocent’ sexuality must always be figured over against a guilty party. To draw same-sex marriage into the ‘innocent’ fold, then, will only happen at the cost of scapegoating or excluding something else: ‘It is not possible … to seek to enrol homosexuality within the ranks of innocence and marriage without also conscripting some figure to embody visibly the remainder of sin, which helps chart the fuzzy boundary on the other side of which homosexuality becomes queer’ (p. 66). Indeed, he asks, is this not precisely what happens when ‘good’, ‘monogamous’ homosexuals are contrasted with ‘promiscuous’ homosexuals in certain Christian ethical accounts?</p>
<p>Rees fears that expanding the conceptual bounds of the ‘innocent’ fold simply repeats the cycle of shifting culpability and exclusion elsewhere, rather than recognising the extent to which all human beings, and by association all human sexualities, are in the same boat. The ‘nakedness’ of Adam and Eve in the Genesis account is nothing less than the ‘nakedness’ of us all at the moment when we recognise our captivity to original sin and realise the inadequacy of our theological discourse about sex. Protesting about the supposed sin of others is a desperate attempt to grasp at fig-leaves to cover up our own, but, in the act, we expose our lack of grace and our lack of ability to recognise one another’s full personhood.</p>
<p>Much of the book comprises a re-reading of Augustine’s account of human fallenness. Augustine’s great turn to fig-leaves, to original sin, as an explanation for our brokenness is so vast and overblown an explanation for the human condition that Rees muses that it is a kind of elaborate joke. It is so unlikely that the act of one human being should have come to affect all; it is so improbable that the sexual act should be its method of transmission; and it is so ridiculous that even babies should therefore be understood as immured in sin, that the whole idea is almost laughable. ‘It takes some humor’, he says, ‘especially given the cultural associations of childhood with innocence, and a particular form of marital relationship as curator of that innocence, to accept as implication of the Augustinian association of sexuality and sin ... that to bear a child—by whatever means and in whatever context—is to enlarge the community of responsibility for sin’ (p. 9). Admittedly, he owns, this is a dark kind of humour, that can point to tiny children as great and culpable sinners. Yet, if humour is understood in Foucauldian terms, it becomes a way of highlighting ‘distressing truths about the self’ (p. 7), for which we should not blame others but rather come to take responsibility. In Foucault, uncovering the genealogy of humour is to uncover the genealogy of identity formation itself. It prompts individuals and groups to re-examine their expectations and preconceptions and, as a result, to deride and undo their ‘infatuations’ with their own ostensibly stable and essential subjectivities. In humour we are forced to face up to ourselves as we are, and to interrogate on precisely what grounds and assumptions we claim our power.</p>
<p>In a surprising move, Rees rejects aligning himself with the theology of Eugene F. Rogers, despite the fact that, as he admits, Rogers has made one of the most theologically sophisticated extant arguments for same-sex marriage. Nonetheless, claims Rees, Rogers falls into the same old trap of seeing marriage as redemptive, a way to ‘narrate a stably sexed self who can enjoy the ultimate pleasures of relationship with God’ (p. 115). But this is, in short, protests Rees, to assume <italic>too much</italic> about what marriage is and can do. Rogers wants to say that those who exclude same-sex marriage from the possibility of being redemptive are thereby shutting themselves out of communities of redemption; Rees disagrees, because he believes Rogers himself is reinscribing a kind of exclusion (since to bring same-sex marriage into the redemptive fold must mean something else is characterised as excluded and deathly). This is a large step which Rees does not quite do enough to justify.</p>
<p>By way of intertextual readings of Dickens’ <italic>David Copperfield</italic> and the Bible’s King David (in which Uriah Heep and Uriah the Hittite are figured as two of a type), and engagements with other nineteenth-century novels such as Trollope’s <italic>Sir Harry Hotspur of Humblethwaite</italic> and <italic>Lord Oakburn’s Daughters</italic> by Mrs Henry Wood, Rees arrives at an account of sexuality which can call itself ‘queer’ whilst at the same time absolutely refusing to be an apologetic for the legitimacy of same-sex desire. <italic>No</italic> sexuality is legitimate; all sexuality is broken.</p>
<p>The account of original sin as a joke of cosmic proportions on Augustine’s part, a way of expressing the absurdity of the universality of the human tendency to alienation and inadequacy, is theologically interesting and undeniably clever. Nonetheless, I have the same kind of reservations about it as I do about the Pub Landlord, a character invented by the comedian Al Murray. The Pub Landlord is unapologetically racist, xenophobic, and coarse, played so deadpan that many of Murray’s audience do not realise that, in the act of laughing along, they are incriminating themselves and their own attitudes. The Pub Landlord is supposed to be a joke at the expense of those who share the character’s opinions, in which the audience laughs not at casual racism but at racists. However, if the character is so well done that it allows someone to laugh at the racist jokes with no sense that Murray is mocking people who are racist—that is, with no way to distinguish between people who are laughing for different reasons—then there is a sense in which it ceases to be incisive and condemnatory, and merely becomes one of the means by which it remains acceptable to say such things in public.</p>
<p>In Rees’ account, the fact that some people believe that their own sexuality is <italic>not</italic> broken or inadequate, that it <italic>does</italic> have the power to remake shattered selves, is laughable. The fact that every single person on earth is affected by original sin (and that its reach is so all-encompassing that it might as well be something as ubiquitous as the mode of our conception that has done it—how unlikely! how absurd!) is all part of the humour. I wonder, however, whether, as with the Pub Landlord, it matters that some (most?) people do not realise the ‘joke’ is a joke. Some Christians, surely, are still saying ‘Yes, of course we’re all sinners—but your (homosexual) kind of sexuality is still worse than my (heterosexual) kind, because look, the Bible says so. And even if my sexuality isn’t perfect, it <italic>participates in</italic> and <italic>gestures toward</italic> a perfect kind of sexuality, because look, the bishops say so—but <italic>yours</italic> is objectively disordered!’ Recognising that we are <italic>all</italic> (original) sinners, that <italic>each</italic> of us operates with shattered psyches and broken sexualities is beneficial, but still, I suspect, something of a red herring: it elides the ethical imperative for heterosexual people to acknowledge the ways in which our own attitudes and behaviours might in fact be <italic>more</italic> damaging and <italic>more</italic> morally culpable than those of homosexuals. Rees might be right to claim that it is missing the point for homosexual people to say they have an ‘innocent’ sexuality, since it is a romance to suppose this is true for any of us. My question is whether it is simply <italic>too soon</italic> for the kind of project Rees puts forward to occur: is it not still the case that there is value in queer people seeking queer ancestors and queer affirmation in the texts of what has often been an unfriendly tradition—in short, in ‘protesting their innocence’? Is there not some value in consciously over-compensating for the historical and contemporary writing-out from the Christian story that homosexual people have often faced? Many gay people still do have to protest their ‘innocence’, precisely because their detractors have not yet moved past driving home their guilt.</p>
<p>It seems to be treading on thin ice, too, to claim that Augustine’s statement, ‘Such a tiny child! Such a great sinner!’ operates (even in Foucault’s specific terms) as humour, since theological history has shown itself to be spectacularly unaware that this statement is an absurdist one. Humour can expose for us the instability of our own subjectivity and the way in which in-and-out demarcations are actually built on shaky foundations: well and good. Nonetheless, too many abused children, rape victims and furtive masturbators have been mentally and emotionally shattered (by having it driven home to them by parents, teachers, clergy and others that they are dirty and disgusting) for it to be justifiable to maintain the association of sexuality with the transmission of original sin.</p>
<p>Rees’ book deserves wide reading, both for its theological zippiness and its extraordinarily lucid style. I hope theological ethicists will engage seriously with his account of anthropology and its implications for sexual ethics. Nonetheless, I still fear Rees attempts too much, too soon in terms of reading original sin as an essentially undamaging leveller. Humour is sometimes too costly a luxury; some jokes are, perhaps, just a little too sick to be rehabilitated.</p>
