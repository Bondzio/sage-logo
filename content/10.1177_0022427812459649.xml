<title>Objectives:</title>
<p>This study examines the prevalence of overconfidence in the perceived risk of committing crime and whether such overconfidence is related to criminal behavior.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Methods:</title>
<p>Two samples were used—a sample of high school students who committed minor offenses and a sample of serious juvenile offenders most with felony arrests. Overconfidence in risk was estimated as the difference between the perceived risk of arrest for one’s self and for a generalized other. The proportion of over- and underconfident persons were estimated in both samples, while pooled and random effects logit models were used to estimate the effect of risk on both self-reported offending and arrest within the sample of serious offenders.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Results:</title>
<p>A large proportion of youth were found to be overconfident with respect to their perceived risk, with a higher prevalence in the conventional high school sample. Within the sample of serious juvenile offenders, being overconfident about one’s own risk was found to be related to both self-reported offending and arrest, net of a base rate measure of others’ risk.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Conclusions:</title>
<p>We outline a theory of the relationship between overconfidence and crime that links overconfidence with a self-attribution bias and biased updating of perceived risk with new information.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>According to rational choice theory, in order for a person to commit a crime the perceived outcomes of committing a criminal offense, weighted by the probability of those outcomes, must be greater than the perceived outcomes of not offending, weighted by the subjective probability of those legal outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0022427812459649">Cornish and Clarke 1986</xref>). Lower perceived probabilities of getting caught for committing an offense would, therefore, increase the risk that the person would choose the illegal over the legal action. The perception of the certainty of apprehension is affected by, among other things, the level of objective risk, the individual’s experiences with crime and noncrime, second-hand information from criminal and noncriminal others, and exposure to the media (Lochner 2007; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0022427812459649">Matsueda, Kreager, and Huizinga 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0022427812459649">Paternoster 2010</xref>). A line of research focused on perceptual deterrence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0022427812459649">Paternoster 1987</xref>) has generally found a negative but weak association between individual risk perceptions and offending, leading some to wonder how closely perceived risk are tied to actual risks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29a-0022427812459649">Nagin 1998</xref>). </p>
<p>Although subsequent work has proposed ideas as to why this weak relationship between objective and subjective risk exists, few have considered the issue of the meaning of the risk measure itself. For instance, while this literature typically recognizes important nuances in measuring offending to ensure validity (e.g., using self-reports instead of official arrest measures), less attention has traditionally been paid to the potential validity issues with the risk perception measures.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0022427812459649">1</xref>
</sup> There is a potentially important difference between one’s subjective belief that an <italic>average person</italic> will be apprehended for committing a certain crime (or what might be thought of as their perception of the base rate of detection) versus their subjective belief that they <italic>themselves</italic> would be apprehended for the same crime. </p>
<p>This distinction was first raised by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0022427812459649">Waldo and Chiricos (1972)</xref>, who found that risk perceptions “appear most viable as a deterrent when they involve the potential criminal's estimate of his <italic>own chances</italic> for arrest and harsh penalties for a particular crime—independent of the chances for any ‘generalized other’” (p. 537, emphasis original). Waldo and Chiricos argued that while perceptions of the base rate of detection are related to offending, one’s subjective beliefs about their own risks of getting caught should effectively supersede this, implying that one’s belief about their own chances of getting caught is the more important deterrence mechanism. Unfortunately, subsequent research on perceptions has mostly ignored pursing this distinction, and as a result risk perceptions are generally operationalized as a more ubiquitous concept, perhaps leading scholars to obfuscate important relationships with offending. </p>
<p>Herein, we explore this distinction between what we refer to as <italic>self-risk</italic> (i.e. one’s subjective belief that she or he will get caught) versus <italic>other risk</italic> (or the subjective belief that the average person will get caught) across multiple samples and types of crime. Further, we advance a theoretical framework which argues that the disparity between these two subjective quantities is itself related to subsequent offending in the form of a self-serving bias, or overconfidence (OC) in the belief that one is better than the “average” offender.  </p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0022427812459649">
<title>Self versus Other Disparties: Perceived Skill or OC</title>
<p>Having a self-risk perception different than one’s other risk perception implies that an individual perceives she or he has either a better or a worse chance of being detected for a crime than the average offender. For instance, if one’s perceived self-risk is lower than his or her other risk, this means that the individual feels he or she is less likely than the average person to get caught for a specific crime. There are two ways by which this difference can be reasoned. The first is that such a difference between self-risk and other risk is a measure of how skilled the offender perceives himself or herself to be. Of course, since the rate of detection of the average offender—that is, other risk—is also a subjective belief, then this difference between self and other is itself a subjective quantity, meaning that there is essentially no objective benchmark against which to judge one’s own belief. </p>
<p>While this difference may certainly reflect one’s skill to a degree, arguments can be posited to imply it is not necessarily an unbiased measure of skill. First, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0022427812459649">Zimring and Hawkins (1973)</xref> observed early on that neither incarcerated offenders nor citizens accurately perceive the base rate of detection. More importantly, based on results from both criminology and psychology, a result where a potential offender perceives himself or herself to be “better than average” is not unexpected. For instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0022427812459649">Dunning (2005</xref>) argued that accurate self-assessment is highly difficult and provided a comprehensive overview of how self-assessment is flawed across multiple domains and instances where individuals tend to routinely overrate themselves, including with respect to intelligence and academic skill (e.g., Chemers, Hu, and Garcia 2001), driving (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0022427812459649">Rutter, Quine, and Albery 1998</xref>) and, interestingly enough, our own ability to accurately assess ourselves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0022427812459649">Pronin, Lin, and Ross 2002</xref>).<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0022427812459649">2</xref>
</sup> </p>
<p>It is natural then to suspect this type of flawed self-assessment to carry over to offender decision making.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0022427812459649">3</xref>
</sup> Indeed, qualitative accounts of offender risk perceptions reinforce very high and likely flawed self-assessment of their own abilities to escape detection. For example, when probing armed robbers about how they handled the threat of legal consequences, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0022427812459649">Wright and Decker (1997</xref>) interviewed one robber who said (p. 119), “I try to keep [thoughts about getting caught] out of my mind. I look at it more on a positive side: getting away. A lot of times it enters my head about getting caught, but I try to kill that thought by saying I can do it; have confidence in pulling the job off. (No. 01).” A similar theme comes from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0022427812459649">Tunnell’s (1992)</xref> interview with a 33-year-old burglar serving his third prison sentence. When asked whether he worried much about getting caught while he was doing them, he replied “No…No-o-o. I didn’t give a damn. And the police couldn’t catch a damn cold if it wasn’t for the snitches” (p. 89). It is, therefore, difficult to believe an observed self-versus-other discrepancy is purely a measure of true skill in favor of a biased perception of one’s own skill.</p>
<p>A second way to think of this difference between self- and other risk is that these offenders are perhaps <italic>overconfident</italic> in their own abilities. OC in one’s ability has been shown to be a pervasive human characteristic that affects decision making in diverse life domains including business and finance, athletics, medicine, and meteorology (Thaler 1998). In many instances, decision makers’ feelings of OC lead them to make unwise decisions in the sense that the decisions produce undesired rather than desired outcomes.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0022427812459649">4</xref>
</sup> It is likely then that while an observed disparity in self-risk perceptions and other risk perceptions may be some combination of accurate skill perceptions and OC, there is likely some form of a self-serving bias that helps to generate such perceptions. Our interest is to investigate whether and how such a self-serving bias is itself determinate of increases in offending and arrest. </p>

<title>The Connection Between OC and Crime: Self-Attribution Bias and Bayesian Updating</title>
<sec id="section4-0022427812459649">
<title>OC, Unwise Decisions, and Crime</title>
<p>While criminologists have investigated the role of other stable individual differences in the deterrence process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0022427812459649">Nagin and Paternoster 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0022427812459649">Piquero and Tibbetts 1996</xref>), they have not explicitly concerned themselves with OC. However, behavioral economists and psychologists have devoted considerable research and theoretical attention to this issue. Their empirical studies have found, as is the case with criminal offending, that males (particularly single men) are significantly more overconfident than females, and younger people are more overconfident than those who are older (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0022427812459649">Lenny 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0022427812459649">Lundeberg, Fox, and Punćochaŕ 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0022427812459649">Pan and Statman 2010</xref>). Also, OC is most likely to develop for outcomes with low rather than high probabilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19b-0022427812459649">Lichtenstein, Fischhoff, and Phillips 1982</xref>), and OC is most likely for outcomes lacking fast and clear feedback (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0022427812459649">Fischhoff, Slovic, and Lichtenstein 1977</xref>). Finally, OC frequently leads to the making of unwise decisions and undesirable and unwanted outcomes rather than desired outcomes. The requisite context for the development of feelings of OC would seem to provide a good description of criminal behaviors. The probability of detection is objectively very low for most offenses, punishment rarely comes fast, and very little about the feedback can be said to be clear. We would expect, therefore, that the decision to commit criminal offenses would breed OC which in turn would drive additional crime. That OC may in the long run result in behaviors that are at odds with one’s self-interest is also characteristic of crime, as is the fact that OC, like crime, appears to be more characteristic of men than women and of the younger more than the older. </p>
<p>While there is a literature with respect to the role of OC in bad, risky, or imprudent business decisions (Ben-David, Graham, and Harvey 2007; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0022427812459649">Heaton 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0022427812459649">Malmendier and Tate 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0022427812459649">2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0022427812459649">Puri and Robinson 2005</xref>), to our knowledge there has been only one direct empirical study of the relationship between OC and crime, and not surprisingly it is in the area of corporate finance decisions. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0022427812459649">Schrand and Zechman (2008</xref>) argued that in any one period a failure to meet expected earnings by a company is easily ignored or may go undetected. They further argue that an overconfident financial manager is more likely than one less confident to have unrealistic beliefs about an eventual improvement in future earnings performance that are underperforming in the present. These overconfident managers will find themselves falling further behind earnings expectations to the point that earnings shortfalls become increasingly more difficult to hide and the manager is forced to “start down the slippery slope to fraud” as the only way to continue the earnings ruse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0022427812459649">Schrand and Zechman 2008</xref>:2). </p>
<p>While it might be clear that feelings of OC are related to bad investment and other financial decisions, it might not yet be entirely convincing why we would expect feelings of OC to be related to offending. Drawing heavily from an explanation of investor OC proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0022427812459649">Gervais and Odean (2001</xref>), we next link OC in criminal decision making to perceived criminal abilities and to a type of self-serving bias that occurs in the process of Bayesian updating of perceived sanction threats to explain why we hypothesize that those who are overconfident with respect to their criminal abilities will commit more crimes. </p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0022427812459649">
<title>Perception Formation: Self-Attribution Bias and Bayesian Updating</title>
<p>Our argument is that persons are initially unsure of their ability to successfully commit crimes. They are not initially overconfident, in fact it is quite possible that many may underestimate their criminal ability and overstate the risks of offending relative to others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0022427812459649">Jensen 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0022427812459649">Tittle 1980</xref>)—they may be “chicken” —and according to Bayes’ rule they may overestimate their prior for the risk of apprehension. Many, if not most, persons do, however, overcome what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0022427812459649">Matza (1964</xref>) referred to as the “apprehensiveness component” and begin to offend. Maybe initially these are acts that “stretch” the law (smoking cigarettes, skipping school, drinking alcohol) then maybe they begin to commit minor crimes (stealing from stores, vandalizing). But offenses are committed, and offenders learn about their absolute and relative ability to offend by committing crimes, observing the consequences of those crimes (both to themselves and others), and then adjusting their prior perceptions of their own risk based on those consequences. </p>
<p>According to the Bayesian updating model developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0022427812459649">Anwar and Loughran (2011</xref>), offenders receive signals about their ability to commit crime by either getting away with it or getting caught, and they modify their prior perception of risk on the basis of this signal. In Bayes’ rule, the rational subject updates his or her prior beliefs based on new information with the new beliefs consisting of a weighted function of the prior belief and the new information. If the updating is unbiased then the weight assigned to a successful crime would be comparable to the weight assigned to an unsuccessful crime and the rational person would also consider how much information any one signal should provide. So, for example, a person who commits one criminal act during time period <italic>t</italic> and gets away with it might not assign this signal that much weight since it was only one consequence, waiting for additional information provided by a subsequent time period before gradually updating his or her prior. </p>
<p>But suppose that persons are not unbiased with respect to the signals provided by their behaviors? How would this bias affect their use of Bayes’ rule? One consistent finding in cognitive psychology is that people tend to take too much credit for their successes and too little responsibility for their failures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0022427812459649">Fiske and Taylor 2007</xref>). This self-enhancing attribution bias leads us to persistently believe that our successes (like getting away with a crime) are due to our own ability and effort, while our failures (like getting caught) are attributed to external sources or chance. In the presence of this attribution bias, whose magnitude would very likely vary across persons, several things can occur that are relevant to the connection between the processes of Bayesian updating that goes on in response to signals about one’s ability to successfully commit crimes. </p>
<p>First, when initially committing a criminal act with success during period <italic>t</italic>, a person with a high self-enhancing attribution bias could easily (1) believe that this success was due to his or her own skills and ability rather than chance and (2) suddenly rather than gradually update his or her perception of his or her own ability by overweighting his or her success. He or she would then jump to the conclusion that he or she is a high-ability offender rather than waiting for additional information from another, subsequent time period to more gradually update his or her beliefs. The latter point is a reminder that a less perceptually biased person might wait for additional information before updating the perception of their ability upward if their success continues, or downward if actions are met with failure. One with a strong self-enhancing attribution bias, however, will become overly confident with initial success, believing that success is a true signal of their abilities and will subsequently overweight their successes and underweight their failures when applying Bayes’ rule to update their beliefs. A biased perception of the information provided by one’s successes and failures, therefore, leads to OC with respect to one’s criminal abilities with the result that more crime is committed. </p>
<p>As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0022427812459649">Gervais and Odean (2001</xref>) explain with respect to stock traders, the implication of this is that offenders would be expected to be more overconfident early in their careers. Not starting out overconfident, but perhaps even underconfident, initial success for one with high self-enhancing attribution bias will lead to a dramatic updating of one’s abilities and, in turn, more crime. In the short run, therefore, the rate of success that one has may be greater than one’s actual criminal ability. If that real ability is less than the perceived ability, the person is likely going to meet with more failures and unless the attribution bias is particularly acute it will eventually force a convergence between the offender’s perceived and real ability. Though initially successful and overconfident in the short term, over the long term an offender’s rate of success will eventually conform to his or her real abilities and most offenders will eventually “learn” that they are not so skilled. The implication of this, of course, is that in the long run many if not most offenders will eventually realize they are of limited criminal ability or at least of less ability than they once thought and begin to desist from crime. This expectation is quite consistent with the ethnographic literature on “delayed deterrence” or the eventual “aging out” of crime (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0022427812459649">Shover 1983</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0022427812459649">1996</xref>). </p>
<p>There are a number of implications that flow from this explanation. For example, we would predict that two individual traits should be positively related—the tendency to be overconfident and having a self-serving attribution bias. We have also alluded to the fact that self-confidence among all but the most biased of offenders should decline over time—offenders should be overly confident early in their careers but such OC is likely to be corrected in the long run as perceived and real abilities begin to converge. Another implication is that the greater the self-attribution bias, the longer it will take for OC to be corrected, and that when this bias is particularly severe it may never get corrected (as among persistent offenders). We think that our linking of the self-attribution bias, OC, Bayesian updating, and criminal decision making not only holds promise of explaining a great many empirical regularities in criminology but offers a rich, potentially productive, and exciting research agenda.</p>

<title>Current Focus</title>
<p>This article investigates several questions related to a discrepancy between self and other offending perceptions and the consequences of such OC for offending. First, we explore the prevalence of OC in offending risk across two unique samples—a sample of serious juvenile offenders and a sample of high school students. In both samples, respondents were asked about their own perceived certainty of apprehension and that for a generalized other—for serious offenses (e.g., stealing, assault) in the juvenile offender sample and more common offenses (e.g., shoplifting, underage drinking) in the conventional sample. Second, within the serious offending sample, we are also interested in the association between OC and offending. Specifically, we explore descriptively whether OC is associated with a higher probability of self-reported offending (SRO), both overall, and by certain specific crime types. Third and most importantly, given that we know OC is a function of the risk for generalized others, and thus positively correlated, we would also like to know whether there is an independent association between offending and OC, once we control for an individual’s perception of others’ risk. This would address the question “conditional on a baseline assessment of risk (the risk to a generalized other which has been repeatedly shown to associate negatively with offending; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0022427812459649">Nagin 1998</xref>), is there an additional relationship between OC for one’s self and offending?” Finally, we consider some implications of these results for deterrence and criminal decision making, and identify directions for future research.</p>

<title>Data</title>
<p>We investigate OC in offending risk perceptions in two unique samples—one sample of primarily nonoffending high school students who reveal perceptions about minor offenses as well as the second sample of serious offending juveniles, from whom we learn about perceptions regarding more serious offense types. The benefits of using multiple samples are threefold as it allows us to (1) explore OC in multiple types of offending perceptions, ranging from relative minor to very serious offense types; (2) compare the prevalence of OC between offenders and a group of mainly nonoffenders; and (3) internally replicate findings with independent samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0022427812459649">Firebaugh 2008</xref>). We now briefly describe each sample. Descriptive information for both samples is provided in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0022427812459649">Table 1</xref>. </p>

<title>High School Sample</title>
<p>Data are from a cohort of high school-aged youth in Columbia, South Carolina (SC), which were used in previous studies of perceptual deterrence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0022427812459649">Paternoster et al. 1983</xref>). Surveys were conducted in three consecutive years in nine local high schools. Students were interviewed for the first time at the beginning of their sophomore year. An identical questionnaire was given to the same students when they were in the 11th and 12th grades. Our study uses questions measuring respondents' perceived certainty of punishment toward four crimes: shoplifting, property damage (i.e., vandalism), underage drinking, and underage smoking.</p>

<title>Self and Other Risk Perception Measures</title>
<p>In this SC sample, individuals are asked how likely it is (range 0–100) they think <italic>they</italic> would be caught for committing each of the four offenses at each period, which represents an individual’s self-risk perception. The respondents were also asked, of the <italic>next 100 individuals</italic> who commit each of the four offenses, how many they think will be caught (range 0–100).

<title>Offending Sample</title>
<p>These data are taken from the Pathways to Desistance study, a longitudinal investigation of serious adolescent offenders transitioning from adolescence to young adulthood. Participants are young males who were found guilty of a serious offense (almost entirely felony offenses) in the juvenile or adult court systems of Maricopa County, AZ, or Philadelphia County, PA. These youth were of age 14 to 17 at the time of the study. A total of 1,354 adolescents are enrolled in the study, representing approximately one in three adolescents adjudicated on the enumerated charges in each locale during the recruitment period (November 2000–January 2003). The study sample is predominantly comprised of minorities (41.3 percent African American and 33.5 percent Hispanic) and males (86.4 percent). </p>
<p>The data analyzed here were collected at six consecutive observational periods of six-month follow-up interviews over the first 36 months of the study. Follow-up rates at each subsequent observation period exceed 90 percent, suggesting very low sample attrition. Information regarding the rationale and overall design of the study can be found in Mulvey et al. (2004), while details regarding recruitment, a description of the full sample, and the study methodology are discussed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0022427812459649">Schubert et al.

<sec id="section11-0022427812459649">
<title>Self and Other Risk Perception Measures</title>
<p>There are seven unique crimes for which risk perceptions are elicited: breaking in, stealing, theft, and robbery (classified as income-generating crimes), as well as vandalism, fighting, and stabbing (classified as aggressive crimes). Individuals were asked at each observation period how likely it is that <italic>they</italic> would be caught and arrested for each of the seven crimes. Responses ranged from 0 (<italic>no chance</italic>) to 10 (<italic>absolutely certain to be caught</italic>). The mean (either overall or for each offense category) was then calculated from these responses. This constituted the individual’s self-risk. Similarly, each individual was also asked how likely they thought it is that <italic>someone else</italic> would be caught and arrested for each of the seven crimes, again on the 0–10 scale. The mean responses for this question represent an individual’s other risk perception. </p>

<sec id="section12-0022427812459649">
<title>SRO Measures</title>
<p>This measure is a revised version of a common self-reported delinquency measure of the number of crimes committed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0022427812459649">Huizinga et al. 1991</xref>). It includes 17 offenses that were divided into aggressive and income-generating categories. In each period, an individual is asked whether they committed each of these 17 crimes in the past 6 months. A binary measure of SRO was then created to identify individuals who committed at least one offense during the period in either crime category. The probabilities of offending by crime class over time, along with mean self- and other risk perceptions for this sample are reported in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0022427812459649">Table 3</xref>.</p>

<title>Arrests</title>
<p>The measure of an individual's arrests in each period he or she is under 18 is based on reports of petitions to juvenile court recorded in the Juvenile Online Legal Tracking System (JOLTS) used in Maricopa County and the juvenile court database in Philadelphia County. Probation violations before the age of 18 were excluded since they do not necessarily represent a new offense and may indicate local practices as much as adolescent behavior. Arrests after the age of 18 were based on merging the court record information from each jurisdiction with nationwide Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) arrest records. We match the arrests to the specific period in which they occurred. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0022427812459649">Table 3</xref> shows that about 16 percent of the individuals are arrested at least once during the first six month period in the sample.</p>

<p>This measure is attractive in that it is quite simple and intuitive. For example, suppose a certain individual perceives that if he or she steals a car, there is a 30 percent chance they would get caught (i.e., self), and this same individual thinks if another random individual steals a car, there is a 30 percent chance that this person would be apprehended (i.e., other). Clearly, the individual feels that he or she has the same likelihood of arrest as would the “average” offender. In this case, the original individual reveals no OC, and OC<italic>
<sub>i</sub>
</italic> = 0. Now suppose instead that the same individual, who believed that there was a 30 percent chance he or she would be apprehended for stealing a car, believed that another individual would probably be caught 50 percent of the time for stealing a car. Now the individual perceives that he or she are actually <italic>less likely</italic> than the average offender to get caught for stealing a car, and this is reflected in the measure OC<italic>
<sub>i</sub>
</italic> = 20. Further, the larger the value of OC<italic>
<sub>i</sub>
</italic> is, the greater the discrepancy of one’s self and other perceptions, and as a result, the more overconfident this individual would be.<sup>

<title>The Association of OC and Offending</title>
<p>As described above, we are interested in the association between OC and offending. In general, a test of the bivariate association between these two factors would be sufficient, yet such a simplistic model fails to capture the importance of self-risk and other risk perceptions when deriving OC in the first place. Specifically, the magnitude of an individual’s OC is dependent on his or her perception of others’ risk, that is, to be overconfident, an individual’s risk perception for generalized others must exceed his or her self-risk. Further, there is a well-documented negative association between perceived risk for self and offending (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0022427812459649">Nagin 1998</xref>) which must be accounted for since OC is derived from risk, and as such these two are likely correlated. Therefore, it is important to test for an additional association between OC and offending, controlling for the risk for generalized others. Such a model would be:<disp-formula id="disp-formula2-0022427812459649">

<p>This simply means that in order to test for the incremental of association of OC conditional on risk we can simply regress SRO on self and other risk. In this reduced form model, we would expect to find π<sub>2</sub> = −β<sub>2</sub> &lt; 0, which would demonstrate an OC effect, and since π<sub>1</sub> = (β<sub>1</sub> + β<sub>2</sub>), then β<sub>1</sub> = π<sub>1</sub> − β<sub>2</sub>, or β<sub>1</sub> = π<sub>1</sub> + π<sub>2</sub> &lt; 0 would be evidence of a negative risk-offending association. </p>

Recalling the key measurement fact that OC is measured as the difference between self- and other-risk, this standard deviation can be thought of as a description of the amount of variability in the difference between these two risk perceptions. For example, at the first time period, OC, or the discrepancy between self- and other-risk, for shoplifting has a standard deviation of 31.57 percent, which is quite large in terms of describing the differences in these perceptions for the same individual. The smallest standard deviation in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0022427812459649">Table 3</xref> is for drinking in the second time period, 21.99 percent, which still indicates a great deal of variability. In addition to the variation in OC, we can also look at the percentage of individuals who are overconfident, that is, those individuals who report lower self-risk than other risk. Crimes that we think of as merely “stretching the law,” specifically drinking and smoking, have the highest percentage of individuals who are overconfident, near or exceeding 50 percent of individuals in either case. Furthermore, these percentages of overconfident individuals show little, if any, decline over time, meaning that for these offenses, individuals tend not to lose their OC beliefs over the short term. For shoplifting and vandalism, crimes we might think of a more serious yet still minor, the percentage of OC is smaller, and it exhibits some decline over time. Yet generally, all of these percentages are relatively stable over a relatively short time period.</p>

</sup> First, notice that there are only slight differences between income-generating crimes and aggressive crimes in terms of the variability and percentage of overconfident individuals. Second, note that as opposed to the offenses queried in the high school sample which could be thought of as more minor and more common (e.g., smoking, drinking), the more serious offenses considered here tend to have a lower percentage of overconfident individuals. Also, in each case in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0022427812459649">Table 5</xref>, the percentage of overconfident individuals starts out high (∼ 45–46 percent) but over time diminishes somewhat. These patterns for OC associated with more serious crimes are clearly different than the pattern for less serious crimes described in the nonoffending sample, although the reason for this difference—be it due to offense-specific or offender-specific reasons—is difficult to untangle, and outside the scope of this analysis. What is clear, however, is that whatever belief-updating process which is necessary to reveal such a changing pattern over time is consistent with some sort of experience-dependent learning process, either Bayesian or other. </p>

<title>Linking OC to Subsequent Offending and Arrest</title>
<p>We now explore the association between OC and subsequent offending outcomes. We begin exploring the issue of measurement validity of OC, first by showing that self-risk and other risk are separately associated with future offending outcomes, and second that the magnitude of the self-risk/offending relationship remains after controlling for other risk.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0022427812459649">8</xref>
</sup> This would imply that self-risk and the discrepancy between self- and other risk is both operating in this specification, as implied by <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula3-0022427812459649">equation (3)</xref>. Importantly, our purpose is to merely demonstrate that an association between OC and future offending exists, and thus we do not speculate on a causal model, given that there is likely a large amount of bidirectionality in determining the levels of either quantity for any individual. We do, however, speculate on some such ideas later.</p>

Recall that when estimating <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula3-0022427812459649">equation (3)</xref>, the coefficient on self-risk is the opposite of the coefficient on OC in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula2-0022427812459649">equation (2)</xref>.

<xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0022427812459649">Table 6</xref>, panel B, reports analog results this time with arrest in period <italic>t</italic> + 1 as the outcome. In this case, columns I and II show that similar to the offending outcome, both self-risk and other risk are separately associated with a higher probability of arrest. Further, column III shows that self-risk remains negatively associated with the probability of arrest even after controlling for other risk, demonstrating an association between OC and later arrest. That the coefficient on other risk in this model is effectively zero is irrelevant, and we can still reasonably conclude that the sum of the self-risk and other risk coefficients is less than zero, implying a negative risk–arrest relationship. </p>
<p>Taken together, these descriptive results demonstrate an as of yet undocumented association between OC and contemporaneous offending. Further, by linking this to the subsequent arrest, which unlike offending can be thought of as an <italic>unfavorable</italic> outcome from the offender’s perspective, the results suggest that, as detected in studies from other disciplines, OC leads to unwise decisions with bad results on the part of the decision maker.  </p>

<title>Quantifying the Magnitude of the OC-Offending Link</title>
<p>We now consider a 2 × 2 matrix of Self-Risk and Other Risk, where each is delineated by splitting those individuals who fall above and below the median of each (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0022427812459649">Figure 1</xref>).<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0022427812459649">10</xref>
</sup>  Individuals who fall into the first quadrant can be thought of as having low other risk but high self-risk (which we denote as LOHS, for low other high self). Overall, this group contains 11.42 percent of the pooled observations. Those falling in the second quadrant are both low other risk and low self-risk (LOLS), which contains about 38.18 percent of the observations. The third quadrant represents individuals with high other risk but low self-risk (HOLS), about 10.28 percent of the observations. The fourth quadrant is populated by those with both high other risk and high self-risk (HOHS). This is the largest group with 40.12 percent of the pooled observations. Individuals who fall into the HOLS classification can be thought of as being overconfident, that is, their own perceptions are less than that of their other perceptions. Similarly, those classified as LOHS might be thought of as underconfident. In the context of this matrix scheme, the LOLS and HOHS groups are neither over- nor underconfident.</p>

<p>Although we have spoken of and measured OC as a continuous variable (see <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula1-0022427812459649">equation (1)</xref>), we conceptualize it here in categorical terms for the following reasons: (1) it is easier to grasp the probabilities on the “other” margin than in a continuous framework, (2) the probabilities in the categorical cases are more straightforward to interpret for changes in rates as opposed to marginal effects, and (3) the results are confirmed when we used OC as a continuous variable. This formulation allows us to frame the magnitude of the OC association in terms of straightforward odds ratios.</p>
<p>Again, we condition on other risk in assessing the role of OC. Specifically, an OC effect is demonstrated if given individuals with high other risk, the probability of offending is larger for those with low self-risk as compared to high self-risk. This can be represented as <italic>P</italic>(offend | HOLS) &gt; <italic>P</italic>(offend | HOHS). Similarly, a suppression effect of underconfidence would be demonstrated by showing that, conditional on low other risk, those with high self-risk are less likely to offend than those with low self-risk. This can be written as <italic>P</italic>(offend | LOHS) &lt; <italic>P</italic>(offend | LOLS).<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0022427812459649">11</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>We test this possibility by including indicators for membership in each of these conditions, as reported in period <italic>t</italic>, in a logit model using offending in <italic>t</italic> + 1 as the outcome. Also included are controls for age, race, and gender. We begin with a simple pooled cross-sectional logit model with standard errors cluster corrected at the individual level. We then fit a two-level random effects logit model. This strategy is designed to account for the relative similarity of multiple observations made on the same individual and better capitalize on the utility of the longitudinal data.</p>

<title>OC and Future Offending</title>
<p>The first column of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table7-0022427812459649">Table 7</xref>, panel A, reports estimates for the pooled logit model using the HOHS group as the base category. Each of the other categories shows a higher probability of offending, ranging from a 30 percent to 70 percent increase, which is expected since the HOHS represents the highest risk perceptions of any group and thus most likely to be deterred. Yet, of considerable interest in this case is the comparison conditional on an individual having a high other risk perception, that is, the coefficient on HOLS, that is, the overconfident group. This coefficient and odds ratio implies that conditional on having high other risk, the odds of offending for individuals who also have low self-risk are about 55 percent higher than those with high self-risk. This means that even for those would-be offenders who feel that the base rate of detection is high for the average offender, those with a high degree of OC in their own criminal ability are considerably more likely to offend.  </p>

<p>We next fit a random effect logit model that is intended to capture the relative similarity of observations made on individual <italic>i</italic>. The second set of coefficients in panel A report such results using HOHS as the base category. Notice that these results now represent subject-specific coefficients, and each are smaller in magnitude than the pooled cross-section coefficients, yet are in the same direction and achieve comparable levels of significance. Again, consider the coefficient on HOLS, the overconfident group. This ratio can be interpreted as that the odds of offending are about 30 percent higher when individual <italic>i</italic> falls into the HOLS category relative to when the same subject falls into the HOHS category. Again, while this random effects estimate is smaller in magnitude, it still confirms an OC effect.</p>
<p>If we condition on those with low other risk (i.e., those with a low perceived base rate of detection), we can also explore underconfidence. The first column of panel B in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-0022427812459649">Table 7</xref> reports the same pooled logit results this time using LOLS as the base category. The important coefficient in this panel is the negative coefficient on LOHS. Specifically, this means that, conditional on perceiving low other risk, the odds of offending for those who have a high self-risk are about 13 percent <italic>lower</italic> than for those who also perceive low self-risk. In other words, for those who perceive a lower base rate of detection, there is a suppression effect on offending for being underconfident.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0022427812459649">12</xref>
</sup> Similarly, the results from the second set of coefficients in panel B are the random effects estimates using LOLS as the base category. Again, the main coefficient of interest is for LOHS. This ratio can be interpreted that the odds of offending are about 11 percent lower when individual <italic>i</italic> falls into the LOHS category relative to when the same subject falls into the LOLS category, again, suggesting a reduction effect of being underconfident. In summary, while the random effects estimates are generally smaller in magnitude, they generally confirm the pooled logit results in each case. </p>

<title>OC and Future Arrest</title>
<p>
<xref ref-type="table" rid="table8-0022427812459649">Table 8</xref> reports similar analyses as above but instead uses arrest in period <italic>t</italic> + 1 as the outcome. Panel A reports results using HOHS as the base category. Again, the main coefficient of interest is that of HOLS (i.e., the overconfident). This odds ratio implies that, conditional on having high other risk, the odds of getting arrested for individuals who also have low self-risk are about 24 percent <italic>higher</italic> than those with high self-risk. This implies that for offenders who feel that the base rate of detection is high for the average offender, those who are overconfident in their own criminal ability are more likely to be arrested. Like the overconfident stock trader, then, the price of OC for the offender is an unfavorable outcome in the long term. This result is confirmed by the random effects logit results reported in panel A. Note that the subject-specific estimates change very little from the pooled estimates in this case—the odds of offending are about 23 percent higher when individual <italic>i</italic> falls into the HOLS category relative to when the same subject falls into the HOHS category, which once again yields an OC effect.</p>

<p>Panel B of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table7-0022427812459649">Table 8</xref> shows results for the arrest outcome when LOLS is used as the base category. Again the coefficient of interest here is LOHS—if the coefficient is negative, this would imply that the probability of underconfident individuals being arrested would be less. Notice however that both the pooled logit and random effect logit coefficients on LOHS are quite small in magnitude—representing 5 percent and 8 percent increases, respectively—and neither remotely approach conventional statistical significance. This absence of difference between LOLS and LOHS suggests that underconfidence, while associated with lower offending, does not appear to be associated with lower arrest.</p>
<p>Our results confirm that OC is associated with both higher likelihood of future offending and a higher likelihood of future arrest. Underconfidence is associated with a lower probability of future offending, yet is not associated with any differences in the likelihood of arrest. This null result of an inability to link underconfidence to arrest actually enhances the strong result linking OC to arrest, as it suggests that some of the increased offending on the part of overconfident decision makers is perhaps unwise and too risky, and reflective of a possible self-attribution bias. We would like to note, however, that as always with observational data some caution should be taken in our estimates because of the ever-present possibility of omitted variable bias.<sup>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>If the decision to offend is based upon a consideration of the outcomes (both positive and negative) of the act, and the perceived probability of those outcomes occurring, it is reasonable to think that these probabilities could be substantially biased by feelings of OC. If one thinks that they are better than others at avoiding apprehension, they would be likely to think that they have more ability in successfully committing crimes and would on average commit more crimes. The overconfident, therefore, would be at greater risk at committing crimes than the less confident. </p>
<p>While we could not test all of the empirical implications of our theory sketched here, we could test perhaps its central hypotheses—that OC is general and that there is a relationship between overconfidence and involvement in crime. Using both a conventional sample of high school students and a sample of serious juvenile offenders we found that being overconfident about one’s perceived risk, measured as the difference between the perceived probability of apprehension between the risk to one’s self and to a generalized other, was pervasive for both common and serious crime. For the high school sample, the proportion identified as overconfident was higher for acts that were minor offenses (near 50 percent for drinking and smoking) than for more serious ones (near 40 percent for shoplifting and vandalism). In this conventional sample, the proportion that was overconfident was generally stable across a two-year time period. For the sample of more serious offenders, the proportion that was overconfident was lower than in the high school sample, but this proportion declined over a longer time period (three and one-half years). This is consistent with our theoretical conjecture that overtime OC in risk perceptions would decline and become more in line with actual ability as it was corrected by experience.</p>
<p>We also found in the serious offender sample that perceptions of OC were significantly related to SRO even after controlling for the level of risk. More specifically, while the coefficient for the relationship between risk perceptions and crime had the negative sign expected from deterrence and rational choice theory, net of that the coefficient for being overconfident had the positive sign we hypothesized. We also found that not only are overly confident persons more likely to offend, they are more likely to offend unwisely, resulting in a higher probability of being arrested.</p>
<p>At the outset, we tried to situate our interest in OC in a broader rational choice–based theory that links individual differences like OC and a self-serving attribution bias to the Bayesian updating of risk perceptions that offenders have repeatedly been shown to do. We have taken one small but important implication of our theory and subjected that to empirical test. Having found that being overconfident is positively related to offending, we invite the field to investigate the other empirical implications of our theory. Among specific inquires we would encourage is whether there is a relationship between OC and a self-serving attribution bias, whether there is a relationship between OC and impulsivity more generally, whether in updating their perceptions of sanction risk those with a high self-serving bias overweight their successes and underweight their failures, whether this differential updating changes over time, and whether there are gender differences in self-confidence and how it relates to crime. A final and particularly interesting line of research would be to investigate whether OC in risk perceptions is more characteristic of younger, male offenders (we speculated early in the article that it would be), and the extent to which desistance in crime is related to “maturation” in this OC (we again speculated that it would be). We would encourage, then, comparable work with mixed-aged offenders with sufficient longitudinal data to permit a study of desistance and persistence. Previous work in criminology has suggested that theories of individual differences can add a great deal to rational choice models of crime (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0022427812459649">Nagin and Paternoster 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0022427812459649">Piquero et al. 2011</xref>), and more generally work in cognitive psychology has added a great deal to and substantially modified the classical economic model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0022427812459649">Camerer, Loewenstein, and Rabin 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0022427812459649">Vohs, Baumeister, and Loewenstein 2007</xref>). We would like to encourage this very kind of multidisciplinary study of offender decision making (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0022427812459649">Nagin 2007</xref>). </p>

<p>Note, however, that many studies do consider one specific dimension of measurement validity by employing crime-specific risk perceptions (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0022427812459649">Anwar and Loughran 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0022427812459649">Paternoster 1987</xref>).</p>

<p>As one reviewer noted, the qualitative literature on offender decision making suggests that supreme OC is almost a prerequisite for offenders. As he or she points out, “How else could you go into a house to burgle or pull a gun on a stranger unless you were sure you were going to get away with it, knowing the legal penalties and possibility of violence?” Empirical analysis of active offenders further shows that they (a) are aware of and affected by the risk of arrest and the chances of increased gain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0022427812459649">Decker, Wright, and Logie 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0022427812459649">Piquero and Rengert 1999</xref>) and (b) possess and use specialist knowledge in selecting and recalling targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0022427812459649">Wright, Logie, and Decker 1995</xref>)—which is likely used in their decision-making process.</p>

<p>For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0022427812459649">Roll (1986</xref>) and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0022427812459649">Ben-David et al. (2010</xref>) found that overconfident business executives were more likely to pay more than what firms were worth in corporate takeovers (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0022427812459649">Thaler 1988</xref> for the “winner’s curse”), OC leads those with insufficient business experience to create start-up companies, most of which fail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0022427812459649">Camerer and Lovallo 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19a-0022427812459649">Koellinger, Minniti, and Schade 2007</xref>), and OC has been shown to be related to excessive trading of stocks and a below average rate of return (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0022427812459649">Barber and Odean 2001</xref>).</p>

<p>Ideally, we would have examined the association between OC and offending in this high school sample, as we do in the serious offending sample. However, given extremely large amounts of missing data (mainly from item nonresponse) on survey questions dealing with offending, any such analysis would be extremely problematic and ultimately futile. For instance, nearly one-third of the sample failed to answer the questions about engagement in any offending activity at the first interview. Given such problematic data limitations with the offending questions, we restrict our analysis of the high school sample strictly to descriptions of OC in risk perceptions. </p>

<p>Similarly, a negative score on this measure is also meaningful. Consider another individual who believes there is a 30 percent chance he or she would be apprehended for stealing a car but thinks that there is only a 10 percent chance that another random individual would get caught for stealing a car. Here, OC<italic>

</italic> = −20 displays underconfidence.</p>

<p>Note that in the nonoffending sample, risk perceptions were measured on a 100-point scale, while in the offending sample, perceptions were measured on a 10-point scale, and as such, the standard deviations differ by a factor of 10. Otherwise, they have similar interpretations. </p>

<p>Three points on estimation are important to note. First, we use ordinary least squares (OLS) as it is convenient to compare the magnitudes of the coefficients across different model specifications. The results remain unchanged with logit. Second, all standard errors are cluster corrected at the individual level. Finally, the decision to lag the risk variables results in the loss of one period of data (meaning we now consider only <italic>t</italic> = 5 periods instead of 6), since we now are able to only use risk from the first 5 periods and offending and arrest data from the last 5 periods.</p>

<p>Readers may wonder why we choose not to compare probabilities at the margins as well. We note that this comparison, which yields overwhelming evidence that <italic>P</italic>(offend | LS) &gt; <italic>P</italic>(offend | HS) and <italic>P</italic>(offend | LO) &gt; P(offend | HO) is merely demonstrative of an oft-discussed certainty effect in the deterrence literature and has been demonstrated in prior studies using these data. </p>

<p>We can also compute probabilities from these values to better illustrate the pooled logit results in panels A and B. Specifically, <italic>P</italic>(offend | HOLS) = .422 &gt; <italic>P</italic>(offend | HOHS) = .304, or in other words, <italic>P</italic>(offend) is about .12 higher for overconfident individuals. Similarly, <italic>P</italic>(offend | LOHS) = .384 &lt; <italic>P</italic>(offend | LOLS) = .443, or <italic>P</italic>(offend) is about .06 lower for underconfident individuals.</p>
