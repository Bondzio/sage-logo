<abstract>
<p>This study aimed to identify the age at first concern and age at referral for rehabilitation services in children with developmental disabilities in India. Two hundred fifty-nine children were included and data were collected from the parents. In children with developmental disabilities (excluding autism spectrum disorders), median age at initial concern was 7 months and age at referral for rehabilitation services was 13 months. In children with autism spectrum disorders, median age at initial concern was 24 months and age at referral was 42 months. Physician’s recognition of the condition, single child, institutional delivery and neonatal admission ≥4 days were associated with early referral. The common reasons cited by the parents for delay in services were reassurance by physicians or family members and nonreferral by the physicians. Thus, routine screening for developmental problems (including autism) and improving the awareness of these conditions among physicians and society would lead to early referral.</p>

<p>Developmental disabilities like cerebral palsy, mental retardation, autism, etc, are lifelong conditions that significantly affect individual functioning as well as family functioning as a whole. Timely identification of developmental disabilities and early intervention gives the best chance for effective developmental change, when the nervous system is malleable and responsive. It also enables the child and the family to more effectively cope with disability, facilitating optimal use of the child’s functions and abilities, and alleviating parental guilt and anxiety.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0883073812447685">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0883073812447685"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0883073812447685"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0883073812447685"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0883073812447685">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>The time at which developmental disabilities are identified and intervention is started depends on many factors. In third world countries, although developmental problems are suspected in many cases shortly after birth because of prematurity or other problems during birth, most of these children are not immediately referred for rehabilitation. In other cases, the child is normal at birth and later discovered to have a disability. In this group, both caregivers and primary care physicians play a major role in identification of the disability and referral.</p>
<p>The timing at which families of children with disabilities become concerned about their child and seek medical advice depends on the type of disability, awareness of the problem, the socioeconomic status of the family, and the resources available in the community. The primary care physicians are expected to screen children for developmental problems at well baby visits or during visits for minor illnesses. They are also supposed to address the concerns of the caregivers and appropriately refer the child for developmental evaluation and rehabilitation.</p>
<p>The aim of this study was to identify the age at which the initial concern about the problem was raised in children with developmental disabilities in India and the age at referral for rehabilitation services. Also studied were the factors associated with the age at referral and reasons for delay in getting rehabilitation services.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<sec id="section2-0883073812447685">
<title>Study Setting</title>
<p>The study was conducted at the Child Development Center of a tertiary care hospital located at New Delhi, India, from June 2010 to December 2010. This is a referral center for children with developmental and behavioral disorders, where cases are referred from various hospitals of New Delhi and surrounding states. The Child Development Center has a team of developmental pediatricians, clinical psychologists, special educators, speech therapists, and occupational therapists and provides comprehensive care to children with developmental disabilities. The clinical diagnosis of various Developmental Disabilities is made by a team after thorough evaluation, as per standard clinical criteria. The waiting period for services at this center is around 1 to 2 months, although high-risk neonates are generally started on early intervention within a week of referral.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0883073812447685">
<title>Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria</title>
<p>For this study, all children referred to the Child Development Center during the study period or during the preceding 3 months were eligible. Children diagnosed with a developmental disability with history of either antenatal or neonatal insult or those without any apparent risk factors were included (children with history of head injury, central nervous system infections, or other neurologic insult occurring after the neonatal period were not included). Also included were those children who were referred for early intervention in view of their high-risk status, without being diagnosed with a developmental disability.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0883073812447685">
<title>Data Collection</title>
<p>A proforma was designed for this study and modified after pretesting on 10 patients. After obtaining an informed consent, the proforma was filled by the developmental pediatrician in charge of the case at the time of enrollment or during follow-up visits in case the child was enrolled in the previous 3 months. Besides sociodemographic characteristics, the parents were interviewed regarding the age at which first concern about their child’s development was raised, which person or professional first raised concern, age of referral for rehabilitation services, and age at which rehabilitation services were started. Information was checked with the previous medical records (when available). Among the cases where the concerns were first raised by the family members or friends, the parents were also interviewed regarding the age at which first referral for this problem was sought by them and the age at which a diagnosis of developmental disability was conveyed to the parents. All the ages were recorded in completed months. In cases in which the time lag between age at concern and age at referral for rehabilitation services was more than 6 months, the primary reason for this delay was sought from the parents.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0883073812447685">
<title>Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>The data were transferred to a Microsoft Excel sheet and analyzed using Epi Info, version 3.2. Median and interquartile ranges were reported for continuous variables and proportions for categorical variables. Mann-Whitney U test was used for comparison of medians between the 2 groups, and Kruskal-Wallis test for comparison of medians between 3 groups. Statistical significance was set at <italic>P</italic> value ≤.05.</p>
</sec>

<sec id="section6-0883073812447685">
<title>Results</title>
<p>During the study period, 259 cases satisfied the criteria for inclusion. None of the parents denied consent for participation. The mean age (standard deviation) of the sample was 35.7 (33.0) months. The sociodemographic profile and other characteristics of the study sample are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0883073812447685">Table 1</xref>. More than 50% of the families were staying at a distance greater than 20 km from the clinic. Only 18 (6.9%) mothers were earning income; the rest were housewives. The developmental diagnosis of the study sample is shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0883073812447685">Table 2</xref>. In 5 (1.9%) high-risk cases enrolled at our Child Development Center, no definitive diagnosis was made at the time of study. Many cases, especially those with cerebral palsy had other associated comorbidities.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study shows that in Indian children with developmental disabilities (excluding autism spectrum disorders), the initial concern is raised at a reasonably early age of 7 months, with a gap of only 4 months between age at initial concern and age at referral for rehabilitation services. Physician’s recognition of the condition and history of neonatal admission are associated with early age at concern and early age at referral for rehabilitation. In children with autism spectrum disorders, the median age at initial concern is 24 months, with a long gap of 14 months between the age at initial concern and age at referral for rehabilitation services.</p>
<p>These issues have been addressed by only a few authors from developed countries. In a study from Montreal, Canada, on children with neuromotor problems, the average age at concern was 1 year and the age at referral to the rehabilitation center was 2.6 years. Early age of recognition was associated with the physician’s recognition of the problem and female sex. The age at initial concern was associated with the age at referral for rehabilitation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0883073812447685">6</xref></sup> In another study from Montreal, Canada, done on referrals to the subspeciality clinics for suspected developmental delays, the mean age at parental concern was 22.86 months, and the mean age at specialty assessment was 38.23 months.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0883073812447685">7</xref></sup> A study from the United States described the first experiences of parents of young children with or risk of disability, who had recently entered into an early intervention program. Overall, the first concerns were expressed at an average age of 7.4 months, the first diagnosis was at 8.8 months, and referral to early intervention was at 14 months. In the subgroup of children with developmental delays, the first concerns were expressed at the age of 11 months.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0883073812447685">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>As compared with the present study, the later age at concern in the studies from Canada might be related to the fact that the majority of children in these studies had milder problems, as evident from their clinical profile. In the first study, 52% of children had mild neuromotor problems, as depicted by their WeeFIM (Functional Independence Measure for Children) scores.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0883073812447685">6</xref></sup> In the second study, almost one-third of the cases had developmental language disorder, where the concerns are likely to be delayed. Also the number of cases with cerebral palsy was very small.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0883073812447685">7</xref></sup> The long gap in these studies between age at concern and referral might be due to long waiting periods for diagnostic and rehabilitative services in that state.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0883073812447685">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0883073812447685">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>Even though routine developmental screening is not being done in India, the age at concern and referral were earlier in this study as compared with other studies. This could be because many neonates with severe perinatal insults are referred by physicians to this center from other hospitals, which constitutes a significant population of the study. The other major group being children with severe developmental problems that can be readily identified by parents or physicians. This was also reflected in the clinical profile of patients from this center in a previous study.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0883073812447685">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>In children with autism spectrum disorders, studies show a declining trend in the age at diagnosis; nevertheless, the age at concern has been the same. In a large study done in the late nineties in the United Kingdom, the mean age at diagnosis was 6 years, whereas the mean age at which parents felt that something is wrong was 18 months.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0883073812447685">11</xref></sup> Among the studies done in the last decade, in the study from Canada by Shevell et al, the mean age at concern in children with autism was 18.92 months, and the mean age at specialty assessment was 39.30 months.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0883073812447685">7</xref></sup> In a study done in Italy among toddlers with autism, the average age of parental concern was 19.1 months, and first professional opinion was sought at 24.1 months.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0883073812447685">12</xref></sup> In a study from United States, the mean age at diagnosis of autism was 3.1 years.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0883073812447685">13</xref></sup> These findings are comparable with those of the present study.</p>
<p>As in the present study, other studies have also shown that sociodemographic variables do not influence the age at which initial concerns are raised; however, the age at diagnosis and referral for rehabilitation are associated with sociodemographic variables.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0883073812447685">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0883073812447685">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0883073812447685">14</xref></sup> Physicians’ recognition of the condition has been shown to expedite the age at concern and referral, as in the present study.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0883073812447685">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>One of the important outcomes of the present study was the reasons for delay in services cited by the parents, namely, “reassurance by the physicians,” “reassurance by the family members,” and “nonreferral by the physicians.” This indicates the poor understanding of these conditions by the primary care physicians and society, pertaining to both diagnosis as well as the results of intervention. Some of the reasons for delay in referral and entry into rehabilitation that have been suggested by other authors include long waiting periods for referral to specialists, lack of co-ordination among various agencies involved in early intervention, parental perceptions and anxieties, physicians’ reluctance to refer younger children and those with less severe delays and, physicians’ diagnostic uncertainty and wrong beliefs regarding efficacy of therapy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0883073812447685">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0883073812447685">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0883073812447685">16</xref></sup></p>
<p>Certain limitations of this study need to be taken into account. Parental reports of age at initial concern and referral are subject to recall bias. This study being based on a single center may not be representative of the entire population. Also being a referral center–based study, it only looked at the cases that were referred and enrolled for rehabilitation services. Families who are not aware of their child’s problems, those who were never referred for services, and those who were not able to access services are not represented in this study.</p>
<p>This study brings forth some important issues relating to the status of children with developmental disabilities in India. The need for the hour is establishing a system for routine screening for developmental problems, improving the awareness of these conditions in society as well as among physicians, especially about the benefits of early intervention. With the establishment of routine screening, strengthening of the early intervention services would also be required. Measures to prevent these conditions by improving the antenatal and perinatal services are another important area of concern. All these measures if taken effectively will go a long way in reducing the ultimate burden of disability in the society.</p>
