<p>There is now an increasing emphasis on asking teachers to reflect on their professional understanding of teaching and learning. Often this reflection is intuitive, but good teachers are good because they understand the dynamics of keeping a class of learners interested, enthusiastic and motivated.</p>
<p>John Loughran’s book adds substance to teachers’ intuitive understandings. He reinforces the fact that outstanding teachers do know what they are doing!</p>
<p>And he encourages such teachers to speak up loudly and clearly, sharing and discussing their best practice with other teachers. He says:<disp-quote>
<p>teachers’ professional knowledge encapsulates the essence of being an accomplished practitioner. (Preface)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>The book begins with reminding teachers how skilled they are at managing teaching and learning. This is a refreshing change from the many ‘dictates’ that have come from government bodies in the last years, which have sought to diminish teachers’ confidence in their own creativity and professional understanding.</p>
<p>Of course there will always be some schools that need great improvement – but there have always been many schools that are functioning well because of the high levels of leadership and daily commitment of the teachers.</p>
<p>The text continues by extending and developing a series of procedures of ‘best practice’ together with the underlying rationale that provides the essential theoretical support. The main messages are about how to engage students in learning in order to create a real desire to learn and a willingness to accept responsibility for their own learning.</p>
<p>John Loughran’s book has a wealth of ideas to develop best practice of teaching and learning. I recommend it to teachers as an extension of their professional understanding.<disp-quote>
<p>Pedagogical expertise involves … creating ways for students to manipulate the important ideas of a subject; to think about how to use that content in similar or different situations … Teaching is clearly complex when meaningful learning is the goal. It is, of course, much easier to deliver information than purposefully develop learners’ engagement with the content. It is much easier to measure retention of information as opposed to assess meaningful understanding. (p. 219) </p>
