<abstract>
<p>This article examines tensions in the egalitarianism of J. S. Mill and R. H. Tawney alongside national education systems to develop a critical theory of democratic equality. Mill and Tawney advanced strong conceptions of democratic equality but with meritocratic elements that foreshadowed liberal governmental practices that have reconciled substantial inequalities in modern capitalist democracies with official commitments to the moral equality of persons. These practices include IQ testing, educational tracking, Taylorism, and the deployment by social scientists of the “underclass” category. While Mill and Tawney partly prefigured liberal governmentality, they also offered the basis for a compelling democratic egalitarian response.</p>

<p>The idea of equality has a pivotal and yet elusive place in contemporary liberal democratic states. These states manage and justify substantial inequalities intrinsic to capitalism as compatible with official (liberal democratic) commitments to the moral equality of persons. In the name of equality they have employed various practices of liberal governmental rationality, in Michel Foucault’s sense, to construct and rationalize deep class (and related) inequalities. A basic concern of liberal governmental rationality, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1065912911421014">Graham Burchell (1991</xref>, 144) notes, has been “to establish a scheme in which [the] different modes of integrating individuals within society and its englobing political order can be co-ordinated . . . [and rendered] <italic>governable.</italic>”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1065912911421014">1</xref></sup> As a <italic>liberal</italic> governmental rationality, the subjects “are individuals whose freedom, liberty, and rights are to be respected” while they are subjected to a range of practices that regulate individuality in various ways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-1065912911421014">Rose 1996</xref>, 45). Liberal governmentality does not entail a particular program of state intervention in civil society (e.g., the economy or family life). Political forces are mobilized not just through authoritative state agencies, but also by utilizing “forms of authority other than those of ‘the State’ in order to govern . . . ‘at a distance’” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-1065912911421014">Rose 1996</xref>, 46; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1065912911421014">Foucault 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Pursuing liberal governmental rationality, liberal democratic societies have managed inequalities in part through practices such as Taylorism (or scientific workplace management), IQ and achievement testing, educational tracking, and social science categories like the underclass. In many cases these practices distinguish supposedly “normal,” “deserving,” and “competent” citizens (counted as full-fledged participants in social interaction) from those defined as “deficient,” “undeserving,” and “incompetent” (thus unfit for full and equal participation; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1065912911421014">Carlson 2005</xref>). In other cases, they establish gradations of putative individual productivity, competence, or merit. Such practices enable these states to affirm equality—by insisting that each individual is treated according to her or his abilities—while sustaining enormous inequalities of opportunities, income, wealth, and power. Thus, rather than establish educational, political, and economic institutions that would maximize democratic equality and freedom for all, liberal states typically have offered class-divided practices of education, equality, and freedom that render most people governable but in many respects unfree and unequal.</p>
<p>In what follows, I focus on the role of national education systems in the class stratified governance of equality in liberal “democratic” capitalist societies. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1065912911421014">Ross McKibbin (2008)</xref> says, “Education is central to the way modern society organizes itself and to our conception of the good society.” National education systems are central to the governance of class-based inequalities of educational opportunity and educational achievement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1065912911421014">Bowles 1977</xref>, 137-53; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1065912911421014">Bourdieu 1977</xref>, 487-511; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1065912911421014">Hochschild and Scovronick 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1065912911421014">Manzur 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1065912911421014">Jenkins, Micklewright, and Schnepf 2008</xref>). And existing inequalities of educational achievement are widely used, in turn, to neutralize and justify class divisions generated by capitalism—particularly, the division between those who direct economic enterprises and those who work for wages and salaries but lack directive economic power.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1065912911421014">2</xref></sup> Marxist and neo-Marxist scholars have long raised related questions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1065912911421014">Gramsci 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1065912911421014">Bowles 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-1065912911421014">Ollman 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1065912911421014">McClaren and Farahmandpur 2006</xref>). Yet a Foucauldian approach adds unique insights. From this perspective, the role of schooling in the production and reproduction of class (and related) inequalities cannot be adequately understood solely in terms a dominant ideology, the logic of capital, or the role of the state. It is just as important to understand how these inequalities have been shaped and rationalized through the production of new forms of knowledge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1065912911421014">Hunter 1996</xref>, 144, 160).</p>
<p>To address these issues I return to tensions in the works of the nineteenth-century radical liberal J. S. Mill (1806–73) and the twentieth-century democratic socialist R. H. Tawney (1880–1962). I do this to offer a genealogy of the prevailing governance of equality in relation to the class-based inequalities in liberal democratic capitalist societies and to recover a compelling democratic egalitarian path not taken. My aim is to contribute to a critical theory of democratic equality more than to provide a new account of Mill’s and Tawney’s views.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1065912911421014">3</xref></sup> They both offered robust conceptions of democratic equality; simultaneously, they both combined strong baseline notions of democratic equality with meritocratic elements that prefigured how liberal states have managed inequalities in the name of equality.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1065912911421014">4</xref></sup> Neither Mill nor Tawney was a simple egalitarian; yet both emphasized a roughly equal voice or equal power for all persons to share in shaping the major structures of power and authority that govern their lives—that is, equality in self-governance.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1065912911421014">5</xref></sup> They each sought to reorganize democratically key power relationships and institutions—educational, economic, and political (and in Mill’s case, gender and family relations)—that govern social and political life, distribute income, wealth, and resources, and structure individual choices.</p>
<p>In so doing, their democratic egalitarianism confronts class stratification and economic power more boldly than the egalitarianism of contemporary liberals such as John Rawls and Ronald Dworkin. This is partly the result of how Mill and Tawney engaged socialism. When contemporary liberal egalitarians, like Rawls, offer some support for liberal socialism, they typically do so to achieve distributive justice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-1065912911421014">Rawls 2001</xref>, 138-40, 175-78; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1065912911421014">Barry 2005</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1065912911421014">6</xref></sup> They have been relatively uninterested in extending democratic equality to the governance of economic relations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr96-1065912911421014">Shapiro 1999</xref>, chap. 6). Even the tradition of critical theory has largely abandoned the project of extending democratic equality to the governance of economic firms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1065912911421014">Honneth 1995</xref>, 43-48).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1065912911421014">7</xref></sup> By contrast, Mill and Tawney advocated forms of liberal democratic socialism chiefly to democratize social power, level class hierarchies, maximize freedom, and reconcile freedom and equality; by achieving these goals, distributive justice would follow.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the way that Mill and Tawney incorporated meritocratic considerations into their strong notions of democratic equality is instructive for rethinking the current governance of (in)equality. Mill acknowledged that individuals differ in abilities but insisted that only “wretched social arrangements” prevented virtually everyone from exercising capacities for self-government in citizenship, marriage, and industry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-1065912911421014">Mill 1985</xref>, 215). He qualified his democratic egalitarianism, however, with reference to a subclass of working people whose “low moral qualities” leave them unfit for such self-government (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1065912911421014">Mill 1965</xref>, 769). For Tawney, democratic equality involved more than “equal opportunities of becoming unequal” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr100-1065912911421014">Tawney 1964b</xref>, 178). Yet Tawney also was impressed by efforts of educational psychologists to develop measures of human intelligence that could guide differential schooling for students with different abilities. This idea lends some support for practices of educational tracking or streaming in light of the findings of intelligence testing as well as for “merited” inequalities.</p>
<p>The radically democratic aspects of Mill’s and Tawney’s political theories largely have been left aside by contemporary liberal states, but their qualifications of democratic equality have had wide resonance.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-1065912911421014">8</xref></sup> Consequently, the prevailing liberal and neoliberal notions of freedom, equality, and achievement mark a regrettable retreat from the radical democratic and egalitarian implications of Mill’s liberalism and Tawney’s democratic socialism. But in two ways Mill’s and Tawney’s qualifications of democratic equality foreshadowed <italic>inegalitarian</italic> tendencies of subsequent liberal democratic governmentality. First, their respective commitments to merit as a justification for some inequalities (e.g., of income and authority) opened the door to liberal governmental practices that justify sharp inequalities of social and political power in terms of competence or merit. Indeed, regarding political power, Mill himself declared in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1065912911421014">1859</xref>, “The claims of different people to such power differ as much as their qualifications for exercising it beneficially” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1065912911421014">Mill 1977d</xref>, 323). Second, Tawney in particular placed excessive faith in social science to distinguish competent from incompetent persons and merited from unmerited inequalities; Mill’s position on this matter was more ambiguous.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-1065912911421014">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>Regarding equality, I am not so concerned with the distributive justice debate over “equality of what?” (e.g., resources, opportunities, capacities, etc.). Instead, my analysis builds on Christoph Menke’s reflections on how competing practices of equal treatment of persons involve competing conceptions of the person, implying different ways to regard persons as equals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1065912911421014">Menke 2006</xref>, 20, 27).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-1065912911421014">10</xref></sup> I build also on John Schaar’s observation that the inequality resulting from the meritocratic view of equality as equality of opportunity, including sharp inequalities of power to command large institutions, debases “a genuinely democratic understanding of equality” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr94-1065912911421014">Schaar 1967</xref>, 236). The prevailing liberal democratic ethos hinges on a conception of the person according to which virtually all adult members of democratic societies are entitled to equal political rights and equality under the law. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1065912911421014">Robert Dahl (1998</xref>, 10) calls this the “logic of equality” whereby members of a community consider themselves “about equal in being well qualified to have a say in governing the group” or community. While this principle is widely embraced in avowedly democratic states, it is usually joined to a conception of the person that justifies sharp inequalities of economic rewards and of directive economic power.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-1065912911421014">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>For present purposes I leave aside Lockean arguments that defend unequal economic power in terms of the right of individuals to accumulate unequal property holdings as the products of their labor.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-1065912911421014">12</xref></sup> I focus on claims that some people deserve greater economic power and authority than others because of their supposedly superior knowledge or intelligence, and the presumption that such differences in people’s cognitive abilities preclude economic democratization.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-1065912911421014">13</xref></sup> As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1065912911421014">Dahl (1985</xref>, 117; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr94-1065912911421014">Schaar 1967</xref>, 237-38) says, “Because of the overwhelming weight of existing institutions and ideologies, probably most people . . . will find it hard to believe that employees are qualified to govern the enterprises in which they work.” Here my genealogical critique aims to unsettle how liberal governmental rationality reconciles commitments to equality with the idea that ordinary citizens are neither competent nor entitled to share democratically in governing their economic lives. More constructively, I reclaim from Mill and Tawney a robust conception of democratic equality that, despite their own qualifications, offers a compelling response to the liberal governmental rationality that has undercut strong notions of democratic equality.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-1065912911421014">14</xref></sup> Economic democracy in this view entails both a form of democratic equality and a practice of freedom. It challenges the idea that there is a necessary trade-off between equality and freedom in complex modern societies.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-1065912911421014">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>In sections I and II, I summarize how Mill and Tawney joined ideas of democratic equality, popular education, and socialism. Section III completes my brief genealogy of liberal governmental rationality. I start with intimations of it in Mill’s and Tawney’s thought and then examine refinements of liberal governmental rationality in three sets of theories and practices through which liberal states have constructed and manage class-structured economic inequalities: IQ testing, educational tracking and Taylorism, and “underclass” theories. Finally (section IV), I summarize the lessons of this analysis for a critical theory of democratic equality.</p>

<title>I. Millian Democratic Equality</title>
<p>Mill’s thinking about freedom, education, equality, and industrial relations offers a good lens into dilemmas of democratic equality. Amid struggles concerning capitalist development and political democracy in nineteenth-century England, Mill put forward conceptions of freedom and equality that extend liberalism in radical directions. He supported democratic political reform, equality between the sexes, and a form of worker self-managed market socialism. During Mill’s lifetime the newly enfranchised classes and disenfranchised working class had little practical experience in popular politics and little formal schooling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-1065912911421014">Parry 1994</xref>, 54). Debates over popular political democracy were closely connected to debates about popular education.</p>
<p>Before the 1860s, leading educational theorists and policy makers in England were chiefly concerned to adapt “school practices to the specific class characteristics of the children” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1065912911421014">K. Jones and Williamson 1979</xref>, 91). For the working class, they promoted “an education that suited the working class child and also the life that child was to lead” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1065912911421014">K. Jones and Williamson 1979</xref>, 94). In the 1860s, opinion leaders held that reading, writing, and arithmetic were prerequisites for individuals to participate effectively in major social institutions. Compulsory primary education increasingly was construed as a right of individuals and an obligation of the state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1065912911421014">K. Jones and Williamson 1979</xref>, 98-102). Near the end of Mill’s life, the Education Act of 1870 established the basis of a national system of primary education in England;<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-1065912911421014">16</xref></sup> and tax-supported compulsory systems of public education were established in France, Germany, England, the United States, the British dominions, Japan, and elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1065912911421014">K. Jones and Williamson 1979</xref>, 42-54; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1065912911421014">A. Green 1990</xref>).</p>
<p>Mill pinned his hopes for comprehensive democratic reform on educating the masses for self-government. Writing mostly before the Parliamentary Reform Act of 1867, which reduced property requirements for suffrage, Mill declined to support unconditionally an equal voice for all persons in representative government regardless of their educational qualifications.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-1065912911421014">17</xref></sup> Some commentators therefore regard him as an elitist with weak democratic egalitarian credentials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1065912911421014">Macpherson 1977</xref>, 50-64; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-1065912911421014">Riley 2007</xref>, 221-49). This view is misleading, however, given Mill’s historical context, his calls for universal education, and the larger democratic and socialist arc of his thought (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr93-1065912911421014">Sarvasy 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1065912911421014">Ashcraft 1989</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1065912911421014">1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr101-1065912911421014">Ten 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1065912911421014">Baum 2000</xref>, 221-45).</p>
<p>Mill developed a broad-ranging theory of education to empower virtually all men and women for self-determination with respect to individual liberty, marital relations, industrial relations, and democratic politics. He held that virtually every person has the potential to become an autonomous, self-governing individual (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1065912911421014">Baum 2003</xref>). The capacity for such “nobler feelings” as the love of freedom is “a very tender plant, easily killed, not only by hostile influences, but mere want of sustenance” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-1065912911421014">Mill 1985</xref>, 213). What stood in the way of “almost all” people attaining the “mental cultivation” to be fully self-governing was “the present wretched education, and wretched social arrangements” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-1065912911421014">Mill 1985</xref>, 215).</p>
<p>Mill outlined the basic educational conditions of freedom with regard to both formal schooling and education “in its largest acceptation.” The latter encompassed “even the indirect effects produced on the character and on the human faculties . . . by laws, by the forms of government, by the industrial arts, by modes of social life” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1065912911421014">Mill 1984</xref>, 217). Concerning formal education, Mill emphasized “certain primary elements and means of knowledge . . . that all human beings . . . should be able to acquire during childhood” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1065912911421014">Mill 1965</xref>, 948). Because of their lack of basic education, English working people were deficient “in the power of reasoning and calculation” and “insensible to their own direct personal interests” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1065912911421014">Mill 1973</xref>, 202). Education would “convert” them “into rational beings . . . accessible to reasons” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1065912911421014">Mill 1973</xref>, 204).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-1065912911421014">18</xref></sup></p>
<p>The radical democratic side of Mill’s educational theory is evident in his view of education in the larger sense. Democratic reform of families, economic enterprises, and representative government would produce an education for freedom in “the [wider] circumstances which surround the grown man or woman” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1065912911421014">Mill 1973</xref>, 204). This idea informs his response to capitalism’s class divisions. Mill challenged the view that the work lives of laborers “should be regulated <italic>for</italic> them, not <italic>by</italic> them” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1065912911421014">Mill 1965</xref>, 759, emphasis original). In capitalist firms, working people were not encouraged to “give to their own reflection or forecast an influential voice in the determination of their destiny” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1065912911421014">Mill 1965</xref>, 759). This hierarchical structure of work dominated their practical education. Employers exercised their faculties by managing enterprises, but laborers found little in their jobs to nurture their capacities for self-government.</p>
<p>Mill’s democratic ideal would reverse this situation. He generally opposed situations in which some people possessed unaccountable “power over others,” maintaining that the only “solid security” for the freedom of each person was “the equal freedom of the rest” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1065912911421014">Mill 1977a</xref>, 610).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-1065912911421014">19</xref></sup> Conditional on progress in popular education, Mill advanced a democratic conception of equality that included and went beyond what Fred Berger calls his “baseline” conception of equality. He accepted as just some inequalities of incomes and political power, but only insofar as these inequalities were justified by differences of merit and compatible with the equal moral status of all persons as free agents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1065912911421014">Berger 1984</xref>, 199).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-1065912911421014">20</xref></sup> He criticized existing capitalism, existing restrictions on voting rights in England, and the subordinate status of women because these social arrangements systematically undermined the free and equal status of many members of society; and his qualification of the right of all adults members of society to a strictly “equal voice” in their government (see above) was consistent with baseline equality. As an advocate of democratic equality, Mill sought, in tandem with advances in popular education, to extend democratic self-government into the economic enterprises that governed people’s work lives and distributed resources and opportunities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-1065912911421014">Morales 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1065912911421014">Ashcraft 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1065912911421014">Baum 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Ultimately, Mill rejected the theory of “dependence and protection” manifest in the class divisions in capitalist firms between the employing class and the laboring classes. “[T]he many who do the work are mere servants under the command of the one who supplies the funds” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1065912911421014">Mill 1965</xref>, 767-69). Mill countered that with continuing education of the working classes this dependence increasingly would become intolerable to most workers. That is, with improved education working people could be governed, and increasingly would demand to be governed, as self-governing beings. In “the industrial department,” the realization of this demand for self-government would be a postcapitalist market economy based mainly on worker self-managed cooperatives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1065912911421014">Mill 1965</xref>, 793; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-1065912911421014">Riley 1996</xref>, 39-71). The dependence of workers on capitalists would be replaced by “the association of the labourers themselves on terms of equality, collectively owning the capital with which they carry on their operations, and working under managers elected and removable by themselves” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1065912911421014">Mill 1965</xref>, 775). Cooperatives would “effac[e] all social distinctions but those fairly earned by personal services and exertions” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1065912911421014">Mill 1965</xref>, 793).</p>
<p>In one notable way, however, which recapitulated his hesitancy about giving all members of society a strictly equal voice in state governance, Mill lent support to the eclipse of his preferred democratic-cooperative horizon: while insisting on the prior educational “improvement” of working people, he qualified the reach of the cooperative ideal by specifying a subclass of working people who might not be suited for it. He claimed that “the <italic>status</italic> of hired labourers will gradually tend to confine itself to the description of workpeople whose <italic>low moral qualities render them unfit for anything more independent</italic>”—those with “too little understanding, too little virtue,” to be fully self-governing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1065912911421014">Mill 1965</xref>, 769, 793, emphasis added).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-1065912911421014">21</xref></sup> It is not clear that Mill thought that economic self-governance would inevitably remain beyond these people’s reach. Nonetheless, his tempering of strict equality in economic self-governance was significant: freedom would be best served <italic>for most workers</italic> through democratic cooperative production; the remainder—those with “low moral qualities”—would be relegated to the kind of undemocratic work relations that characterized unreformed capitalism.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-1065912911421014">22</xref></sup></p>
<p>In effect, Mill introduced at the margins of his theory a proto-underclass that prefigured later “underclass” notions employed in modern capitalist societies: a subclass of poor people whose intrinsic properties would tend to exclude them from the “normal” achievements of a maximally free, “improving” society.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-1065912911421014">23</xref></sup> This proto-underclass notion is questionable in light of his view that “the present wretched education, and wretched social arrangements” are what prevent “almost all” from becoming equipped for self-government; and, as I have said, it is unclear how deeply Mill was committed to the idea. Nonetheless, the way that Mill qualified his commitment to a strong notion of democratic equality, with stipulations about who does and who does not merit it, is symptomatic of a pervasive inegalitarian feature of subsequent liberal democratic governmentality. Contemporary democratic states now routinely affirm formal political equality—that is, one person, one vote—but in relation to conceptions of the person that permit sharp inequalities of economic rewards and directive economic power in the name of equality.</p>

<title>II. Tawney, Education, and Democratic Socialism</title>
<p>While Mill’s educational thinking was punctuated by England’s 1867 Reform Act and the Education Act of 1870, Tawney’s educational thought was framed by the development of educational psychology, the rise of the British Labour Party (for which Tawney was a key educational theorist; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1065912911421014">Brooks 1988</xref>, ix-xi; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr108-1065912911421014">Wooldridge 1994</xref>, 65, 199-200), and the English Education Act of 1944. The latter established a universal system of secondary education, abolished fees in all but a small minority of secondary schools, and fixed the age of fifteen as the minimum age to quit compulsory schooling (with the prospect that this soon would be raised to sixteen; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr100-1065912911421014">Tawney 1964b</xref>, 146).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-1065912911421014">24</xref></sup> Like Mill, Tawney envisioned improvements in popular education along with a democratic socialist reorganization of economic life to reconcile freedom and equality. He challenged the existing organization of English education “upon lines of social class,” with working-class children being trained to be obedient servants and children of the middle and upper classes (professionals, capitalists, aristocrats) destined to become the ruling class—those who direct government and major economic enterprises (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr99-1065912911421014">Tawney 1964a</xref>, 142-43; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr100-1065912911421014">Tawney 1964b</xref>, 47-69; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr108-1065912911421014">Wooldridge 1994</xref>, 194-95).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-1065912911421014">25</xref></sup> Unlike Mill, who addressed gendered inequality (and to some extent racialized inequality), Tawney focused almost exclusively on “class gradations” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr99-1065912911421014">Tawney 1964a</xref>, 57; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1065912911421014">Dennis and Halsey 1988</xref>, 213, 259).</p>
<p>Two strands of Tawney’s educational thought are especially salient to democratic equality and liberal governmental rationality, his interest in new efforts to measure human intelligence, and his call for a system of secondary education to prepare all persons for democratic self-government.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-1065912911421014">26</xref></sup></p>
<sec id="section3-1065912911421014">
<title>Intelligence and Education</title>
<p>Tawney’s egalitarian approach to education was informed by new measurements of human intelligence (IQ testing) championed by the controversial psychometrician Cyril Burt among others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1065912911421014">Brooks 1988</xref>, xiii; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr108-1065912911421014">Wooldridge 1994</xref>, 3-5, 23, 199). “Mental measurement” research was becoming influential in England, the United States, and elsewhere. It captivated eugenicists, who aimed to “improve” human stock scientifically, egalitarians like Tawney and G. D. H Cole, who thought that England could better mobilize “the abilities of its population,” and meritocrats, who hoped “to construct an educational machine capable of training children according to their innate abilities” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr97-1065912911421014">Tawney 1922</xref>, 31; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr108-1065912911421014">Wooldridge 1994</xref>, 4, 189, 244-52). Tawney maintained that the new educational psychology laid bare “the manner in which nature deals with the young” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr98-1065912911421014">Tawney 1938</xref>, 21). It indicated that people were not equal in the sense of being “very similar in their natural endowments of character and intelligence” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr99-1065912911421014">Tawney 1964a</xref>, 46). Citing Burt’s “admirable studies of the distribution of educational abilities among school-children,” Tawney concluded that “individuals differ widely in their natural endowments, and in their capacity to develop them by education.” Yet this realization “makes a smaller breach in equalitarian doctrines than is sometimes supposed” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr99-1065912911421014">Tawney 1964a</xref>, 47).</p>
<p>Tawney sought to square the findings of educational psychology with his view that all people were “equally entitled . . . to consideration and respect” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr99-1065912911421014">Tawney 1964a</xref>, 46, 50). He supported equality not “of capacity or attainment, but of circumstances, institutions, and manner of life” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr99-1065912911421014">Tawney 1964a</xref>, 48-49). On this view, “social institutions—property rights, and the organization of industry, and the systems of health and education—should be planned, as far as possible, to emphasize and strengthen, not the class differences which divide, but the common humanity which unites [people].” Beyond the basics of health and education, people have “different requirements” that demand “varying forms of provision.” Equality of provision would be achieved “by devoting equal care to ensuring that [different needs] are met in the different ways most appropriate to them, as is done by . . . a teacher who develops different types of intelligence by different curricula” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr99-1065912911421014">Tawney 1964a</xref>, 49-50).</p>
<p>The implications of Tawney’s thought run in two directions: for equality of opportunity, understood as substantial “equality of circumstances,” <italic>and</italic> for the distribution of <italic>certain</italic> rewards and social positions according to merit. Concerning equal opportunity, he rejected the idea that it is advisable “to spend less liberally on the education of the slow than on that of the intelligent; or . . . to show less respect for the poor than for the rich” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr99-1065912911421014">Tawney 1964a</xref>, 50). Real equality of opportunity requires “an equal start.” This means “equal chances of using to the full [our] natural endowments of physique, of character, and of intelligence,” and it demands considerable “practical equality,” or equality of material circumstances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr99-1065912911421014">Tawney 1964a</xref>, 104, 106-7).</p>
<p>Agreeing partially with those who defend “equal opportunities of becoming unequal,” Tawney held that exceptional people “should be free to exercise their exceptional powers” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr100-1065912911421014">Tawney 1964b</xref>, 178; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr99-1065912911421014">Tawney 1964a</xref>, 103, 108). This would promote “the upward movement of ability.” But the doctrine of “individual advancement” was flawed when it suggested “that opportunities to rise, which can . . . be seized only by the few, are a substitute for a general diffusion of the means of civilization, which are needed by all men” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr99-1065912911421014">Tawney 1964a</xref>, 108-9). Moreover, Tawney rejected the idea that due appreciation for individual achievement, or merit, justified significantly unequal accumulations by individuals of land, capital, and power.</p>
<p>Programmatically, he sought to overcome the class segmentation of England’s education system, which, before the Education Act of 1944, produced a class of masters and a class of subordinate wage laborers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr99-1065912911421014">Tawney 1964a</xref>, 141-45). Secondary education had been restricted largely to upper-class children and a small number of working-class scholarship students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1065912911421014">Lawson and Silver 1973</xref>, 394-95).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn27-1065912911421014">27</xref></sup> Tawney wrote in 1922, “In place . . . of ‘elementary’ education for nine-tenths of the children and ‘secondary’ education for the exceptionally fortunate or the exceptionally able, we need to envisage education as two stages in a single course which will embrace the whole development of childhood and adolescence up to sixteen, and obliterate the vulgar irrelevances of class inequality and economic pressure” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr97-1065912911421014">Tawney 1922</xref>, 19, 64). The English education system enabled “a favoured minority” to “cultivate their powers till manhood” and compelled “the great majority of children” to accept low-paying, low-status work under the direction of others. The system “poisoned” the souls of working-class children with “a blight of social inferiority” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr99-1065912911421014">Tawney 1964a</xref>, 117, 142).</p>
<p>Quality secondary education for all would “develop the faculties” and “lay broad foundations for general knowledge” rather than cultivate technical skills (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr97-1065912911421014">Tawney 1922</xref>, 29; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1065912911421014">Brown 1990</xref>, 69). The appropriate “measure of success” for elementary and secondary education was “heightened human capacity” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr97-1065912911421014">Tawney 1922</xref>, 63). Provided that these goals were satisfied, “the greater the variety among secondary schools the better for education” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr97-1065912911421014">Tawney 1922</xref>, 30, 65). Justice would be achieved with “facilities . . . at once various in type and equal in quality” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr97-1065912911421014">Tawney 1922</xref>, 146).</p>

<sec id="section4-1065912911421014">
<title>Economic Democracy</title>
<p>Tawney linked democratizing reform of English education to a wider democratization of economic and political power. He said in <italic>Secondary Education for All</italic>, “Organised Labour has fought many battles against the odious doctrine of class domination in the world of industry. . . . But, if it is to liberate . . . the rising generation, it must also emancipate their minds. It must lay the foundations of a democratic society not only in the workshop and in Parliament, but in schools” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr97-1065912911421014">Tawney 1922</xref>, 33). He called for redistributive taxation, inheritance taxes, and public investments to redress England’s grossly unequal distribution of resources and opportunities and to provide equal educational opportunities for all persons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr99-1065912911421014">Tawney 1964a</xref>, chaps. 4, 7). Like Mill, Tawney held that a democratic socialist reorganization of economic power was needed to achieve freedom, justice, and equality.</p>
<p>In capitalist societies, concentrated private ownership “enables a minority of property-owners to control the lives of the unpropertied many.” There are “classes which are ends, and classes which are instruments.” Formal equality of rights between employers and wage earners obscures a “relationship of mastery and subordination” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr99-1065912911421014">Tawney 1964a</xref>, 167, 110-11; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr100-1065912911421014">Tawney 1964b</xref>, 178). Consequently, “the mass of mankind pass their working lives under the direction of a hierarchy, whose heads define, as they think profitable, the lines on which common enterprise is to proceed” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr99-1065912911421014">Tawney 1964a</xref>, 158, 161). Class differences must be addressed not just through redistribution of “leisure and enjoyment,” but also by upending the unequal power separating the few who manage industry from the many who “perform its routine work” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr99-1065912911421014">Tawney 1964a</xref>, 64, 69). Tawney’s goal was to democratize major economic and political institutions. Freedom and equality for all would best be realized in an economy “in which all men are fellow-servants” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr99-1065912911421014">Tawney 1964a</xref>, 166).</p>
<p>The details of Tawney’s economic reform proposals are less important than his basic idea.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn28-1065912911421014">28</xref></sup> Wisely, he did not advocate a simple conception of democratic equality such that all people would “perform identical functions or wield the same degree of power.” Economic freedom required “equality in action” but not in the sense that all persons equally would “initiate, plan, direct, manage, or administer.” All persons would be “protected against the abuse of power”—economic and political—and would be “equally entitled to ensure that power shall be used . . . for the general advantage” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr99-1065912911421014">Tawney 1964a</xref>, 168, 166). An egalitarian society would not reject “power and inequality” per se, but “capricious inequality and irresponsible power.” It would permit “[g]radations of authority and income derived from differences of office and function” that were fairly earned within a democratic framework (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr99-1065912911421014">Tawney 1964a</xref>, 114).</p>

<title>III. Inegalitarian Liberal Governmentality</title>
<p>Liberal states rarely have affirmed the kind of democratic equality that Mill and Tawney advanced. Meanwhile, the ways that Mill and Tawney qualified their egalitarianism with meritocratic stipulations anticipated a pervasive exclusionary liberal governmental rationality that liberal states have refined and extended through various governmental practices. These practices have worked—ideologically and practically—to enable liberal states to produce and manage class-structured economic inequalities while asserting egalitarian moral commitments with respect to equal citizenship rights and “equality of opportunity.”</p>
<p>In Mill’s case, his proto-underclass resembles the pattern of politically shaped social scientific analysis that Michel Foucault locates in the specification of “delinquency” in nineteenth century France. Tawney’s interest in “mental measurement” replicates how, according to Foucault, the school examination “linked to a certain type of the formation of knowledge in a certain form of the exercise of power” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1065912911421014">Foucault 1979</xref>, 187). Both the concept of delinquency and the school examination operate through what Foucault calls “normalizing judgment” where power is exercised through “comparative measures that have the ‘norm’ as [their] reference” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1065912911421014">Foucault 1979</xref>, 193). Thus, although “delinquency” is related to criminality more generally, Foucault contends that the discourse surrounding delinquency construes it more as a breach of the <italic>norm</italic> than as a violation of the <italic>law</italic>. While ordinary criminals are distinguished by their illegal acts, delinquents are “to be found in quasi-natural classes, each endowed with its own characteristics” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1065912911421014">Foucault 1979</xref>, 253). Delinquents are defined more by what they supposedly <italic>are</italic> than by what they <italic>do</italic>; they are persons with “dangerous proclivities” who are resistant to “correction” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1065912911421014">Foucault 1979</xref>, 252, 264-77).</p>
<p>Foucault contends that the social scientific specification of “delinquents” represents a political “success” of the modern prison system. When the problems of “delinquents” are attributed to <italic>what they are</italic>, the concept deflects criticism from how class structures marginalize “delinquents” along with other poor people (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1065912911421014">Foucault 1979</xref>, 63, 277-78, 287). In fact, when “delinquency” was named in the mid-nineteenth century, French working-class newspapers, Fourierists, and anarchists explained its origins in terms of oppressive social conditions.</p>
<p>Power and politics are involved, then, both in the practice of defining “delinquency” and in how a society controls its “delinquents.” This insight illuminates the exclusionary politics entailed in Mill’s specification of a subclass of “unfit” workers who presumably are resistant to civilizing “improvement.” Mill never explicitly theorized his proto-underclass in a manner comparable to how other nineteenth-century thinkers specified delinquency or how twentieth-century social scientists used the “underclass” concept. Even so, despite his view of the virtually “unlimited possibility of improving . . . mankind by education” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1065912911421014">Mill 1981</xref>, 109, 111), he discussed this subclass in a way that foreshadows a wider inegalitarian pattern of liberal governmental rationality. In short, the exclusion of some groups would be justified according to presumably objective measures of unfitness.</p>
<p>Likewise, the school examination, a “mechanism of objectification,” is “a new modality of power in which each individual receives as his own status his own individuality” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1065912911421014">Foucault 1979</xref>, 192). The examination establishes “the fixing, at once ritual and ‘scientific,’ of individual differences” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1065912911421014">Foucault 1979</xref>, 187, 192). To each student her or his own score; yet each individual and her or his score is assessed against the norm—the average score, percentile rankings, the bell curve distribution of scores. This establishes a “whole field of knowledge” about individuals that shapes the exercise of power in the governance of educational (and other) institutions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1065912911421014">Foucault 1979</xref>, 186). This exercise of power is hidden behind a veneer of objectification: each individual, it seems, simply is treated according to her or his abilities.</p>
<p>Turning back to Tawney, his views of education, intelligence testing, and equality contain notable tensions. He proposed a quality education for all and observed, reasonably, that with their “diversities of gifts” different children require “diversities of treatment,” in teaching methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr97-1065912911421014">Tawney 1922</xref>, 29, 66; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr99-1065912911421014">Tawney 1964a</xref>, 49-50, 146). Yet his faith in “the development of more exact measurements of intelligence” gives a potentially ominous meaning to his idea that children with different abilities require “varying forms of provision” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr99-1065912911421014">Tawney 1964a</xref>, 49). Thus, in <italic>Secondary Education</italic>, Tawney accepted uncritically the estimate from “the most recent expert inquiry . . . that seventy-five percent are intellectually capable of profiting by full-time education” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr97-1065912911421014">Tawney 1922</xref>, 28, 56, 66). This meant that 25 percent presumably were <italic>incapable</italic> of profiting from such education. Tawney probably would have reconsidered this estimate in light of evidence to the contrary. Nonetheless, this approach to intelligence could support just the kind of exclusionary secondary education policy that he rejected: that some people are not “worth educating” to develop their minds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr97-1065912911421014">Tawney 1922</xref>, 66). This would make many working-class students mere “cannon fodder” for industry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr97-1065912911421014">Tawney 1922</xref>, 63).</p>
<p>Based on Tawney’s ideas about differences in innate ability and differential schooling, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr108-1065912911421014">Adrian Wooldridge (1994</xref>, 199) calls him a meritocrat who “argued that society ought to be stratified on the basis of innate abilities, rather than . . . family fortunes or family connections.” This summation misses the radical democratic gist of Tawney’s political thought: that the egalitarian goal should be to equalize opportunities for all people to lead a good life while making all concentrations of power, including economic power, democratically accountable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr100-1065912911421014">Tawney 1964b</xref>, 178; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr99-1065912911421014">1964a</xref>, 167-71, 228-30). That said, Tawney’s quasi-meritocratic justification for gradations of income and authority that derive from differences of innate ability readily could be turned against his democratic egalitarianism.</p>
<p>The exclusionary logic with which Mill and Tawney qualified their egalitarianism has been manifest in liberal governmental rationality in two interrelated ways. First, in a manner that stiffens Mill’s exclusionary move, some liberal governmental practices, buttressed by social scientific theories (e.g., scientific racism and eugenics, English Victorian theories of “the residuum,” late twentieth century “underclass” theories), have specified selectively the proper subjects of equality. These theories and practices delineate <italic>which</italic> members of society are fit to share fully in citizenship rights and in self-government. Second, in the manner of Foucault’s concerns about examinations and Tawney’s ideas about intelligence, an array of theories and practices have refined this exclusionary logic. They have fostered a more detailed sorting of people by supposed <italic>degrees</italic> of “fitness” or “merit.” These practices are both class structured and class structuring. To elucidate this wider liberal governmental rationality, I briefly examine three sets of theories and practices that liberal states have employed to construct and manage class-structured economic inequalities: IQ testing, educational tracking and Taylorism (Frederick Winslow Taylor’s theory of efficient labor relations), and “underclass” theories.</p>
<sec id="section6-1065912911421014">
<title>IQ Testing</title>
<p>While Tawney saw great promise in intelligence testing he did not go far in considering its dangers. French psychologist Alfred Binet, who in 1905 published the first standardized test to measure human intelligence, had humanitarian concerns. Binet hoped to help identify “public school students who needed extra help in learning” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1065912911421014">Lemann 1999</xref>, 83; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1065912911421014">Kamin 1995</xref>). Intelligence testing generally has worked, however, to buttress social hierarchies and inequalities in the name of equal opportunity for all (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1065912911421014">Karier 1976</xref>, 339-73).</p>
<p>Stanford University psychologist Lewis Terman conceived the specific concept of “IQ”—or “intelligence quotient”—by dividing “a test takers ‘mental age,’ as revealed by [his or her test] score, by his or her chronological age” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1065912911421014">Lemann 1999</xref>, 83). The impetus for IQ testing can be traced back to nineteenth-century theories of intelligence. Particularly significant was Francis Galton’s view, basic to the eugenics movement, that intelligence was the most worthy human trait. Eugenicists sought to improve society by discouraging intellectually deficient people from reproducing and a number of early pioneers of IQ testing, including Terman, promoted eugenic ideas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1065912911421014">Lemann 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1065912911421014">Kamin 1995</xref>). Proponents saw IQ tests as a means to identify people with “defective intellects” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1065912911421014">Carlson 2005</xref>, 145-46).</p>
<p>Terman believed that IQ testing would facilitate scientific sorting of populations “so that young people would be assigned on the basis of their scores to particular levels in the school system, which would lead to corresponding socioeconomic destinations in adult life” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1065912911421014">Lemann 1999</xref>, 83). He envisioned the promise of his Stanford-Binet intelligence test of 1916 as follows: “[I]n the near future intelligence tests will bring tens of thousands of high-grade defectives under the surveillance and protection of society. This will ultimately result in curtailing the reproduction of feeble-mindedness and in the elimination of an enormous amount of crime, pauperism, and industrial inefficiency” (Terman, quoted in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1065912911421014">Kamin 1995</xref>, 477). Terman also believed that intelligence testing would reveal “significant racial differences in general intelligence” (quoted in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1065912911421014">Kamin 1995</xref>, 478). In the United States, such racist eugenic ideas were used to endorse racially exclusionary immigration laws in 1917 and 1924.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn29-1065912911421014">29</xref></sup> Henry Goddard, who began using Binet’s test in 1908, extended this line of thought into a full-blown theory of naturally graded inequality. In response to socialists, who aimed to undo the inequalities faced by workers, he said, “Now the fact is, that workman may have a ten year intelligence while you may have a twenty. . . . The different levels of intelligence have different interests and require different treatment to make them happy” (quoted in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1065912911421014">Kamin 1995</xref>, 480).</p>
<p>Later social scientists, such as Arthur Jensen, Richard Herrnstein, and Charles Murray, have updated this view of intelligence. These thinkers insist that the biases of past researchers do not invalidate the achievement of more recent psychometrists. In an influential 1971 article on “IQ,” Herrnstein—who later coauthored <italic>The Bell Curve</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1065912911421014">1994</xref>) with Murray—summarized the perspective of IQ hereditarians: “We are not . . . on the verge of Galton’s vision of eugenics, even though we have the mental test that he thought was the crucial prerequisite. . . . No sensible person would want to entrust state-run human breeding to those who control today’s states. There are, however, practical corollaries of this knowledge, more humble than eugenics, but even more salient as the growing complexity of human society makes acute the shortage of high-grade intelligence” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1065912911421014">Herrnstein 1995</xref>, 609). Herrnstein claimed that significant, heritable differences in innate intelligence would limit any efforts to equalize social standing in modern societies. To the extent that equality of opportunity was achieved, individuals increasingly would attain different levels of social standing because of their different inherited “mental abilities” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1065912911421014">Herrnstein 1995</xref>, 612).</p>
<p>For writers like Herrnstein and Murray, IQ testing objectively quantifies “general intelligence” (or <italic>g</italic>), which they regard as the unifying factor behind various intellectual abilities, such as verbal, spatial, and mathematical ability. They contend that general intelligence is naturally distributed along a “normal distribution,” or “bell curve,” like the distribution of IQ scores. On this view, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1065912911421014">Philip Green (1976</xref>, 402) says, the distribution of IQ scores is not “a mere statistical artifact but the reflection of an underlying genetic reality.” Furthermore, IQ tests are designed to yield scores that are distributed along a bell curve with a particular character: a score of 100 is fixed as the middle point of the curve—the mean, median, and modal score—with one standard deviation from the mean (in each direction) being 15 points. Consequently, 68 percent of all scores fall equally within one standard deviation, plus or minus, from 100 (i.e., 34 percent from 85 to 100; 34 percent from 100 to 115) and the next 27 percent of the scores fall between 15 and 30 points above or below the mean, or plus or minus two standard deviations (scores of 70–85 and 115–130). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1065912911421014">Green (1976</xref>, 402, 404) explains, “[T]he extensiveness of the range enables us to make very fine comparisons among these apparently ‘innate’ values, comparisons that seem to carry their own aura of reality to them.” It gives the impression of substantial cognitive “inequality” between, say, someone with an IQ of 85 and someone with a 130 IQ, or even between someone with a 100 IQ and someone with a 120 IQ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1065912911421014">P. Green 1976</xref>, 404).</p>
<p>Moreover, the whole practice presumes that—as Tawney thought—IQ scores represent “our innate intellectual capacities.” This involves a theoretical slight of hand: psychometrists present the tests as an “objective” measure of an underlying reality, as if the scores—85, 100, 130, and so on—simply mirrored the precise distribution of innate human intelligence. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1065912911421014">Green (1976</xref>, 405, 404) observes, “Those particular values exist as they do only because the early psychometrists wanted to create a body of ‘data’ that would justify ranking people <italic>very much</italic> above or below each other.” The IQ measure also implies questionably that intelligence is a one-dimensional thing.</p>
<p>In sum, IQ testing does not reveal the range, character, and distribution of innate intellectuals capacities as they exist independently of it; rather, it is a politically shaped scientific practice through which psychometrists have constructed a partisan representation of human intelligence. It presumes a dubious, starkly inegalitarian view of human capabilities that serves to justify existing social inequalities of income, wealth, and power (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1065912911421014">P.

<title>Taylorism and Educational Tracking</title>
<p>Taylorism, an early-twentieth-century theory of in labor–management relations, and educational tracking both have affinities to Tawney’s qualifications of democratic equality. The development of Taylorism exemplified broader changes in capitalist economies during the past century, particularly the partial separation of ownership and control of economic enterprises and the rise of a professional managerial class (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1065912911421014">Aronowitz 2003</xref>). This is especially so in the United States, where, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr104-1065912911421014">Sean Wilentz (1997</xref>, 32) observes, even with firms that employ flexible work arrangements, “Taylor’s basic division of responsibility between expert managers and worker-drones survives.” To maximize efficiency, Taylor proposed to subdivide every task on the shop floor into its basic elements and link wages to productivity. Most importantly,<disp-quote>
<p>[P]roduction should be administered exclusively by “efficiency experts” . . . who would determine the “one best way” to run their employers’ factories. Thus, as a result of what Taylor described a “a deliberate gathering in by management,” most of the technical knowledge that had been the monopoly of highly skilled workers . . . would now be taken over by their employers’ agents, the efficiency engineers. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr104-1065912911421014">Wilentz 1997</xref>, 32)<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn31-1065912911421014">31</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Taylor sought “to revolutionize labor relations by giving employers complete authority over production.” He envisioned a “complete mental revolution” that would end both material scarcity and the conflict between workers and bosses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr104-1065912911421014">Wilentz 1997</xref>, 32).</p>
<p>Taylorism and its relatives mark a sharp turn away from the basic Mill–Tawney vision of a democratic reordering of labor relations. Taylorism finds some support in Tawney’s view that economic liberty does not imply that all persons equally “shall initiate, plan, direct, manage, or administer”; yet Tawney envisioned “gradations of authority” in the context of economic democracy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr99-1065912911421014">Tawney 1964a</xref>, 114). Where economic democracy would require educating all members of society for the freedom and responsibility of self-government and assumes that virtually all members of society are capable of this, Taylorism requires only that capitalists and expert managers be educated for the freedom and authority to govern economic enterprises.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn32-1065912911421014">32</xref></sup></p>
<p>Schooling in most liberal capitalist societies follows a similarly stratified pattern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1065912911421014">Manzer 2003</xref>, chaps. 2-5; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1065912911421014">Jenkins, Micklewright, and Schnepf 2008</xref>). It is now mandatory and “universal,” but the idea of educating everyone for self-government in the Mill–Tawney sense is not seriously entertained. In a manner analogous to how the prison, as Foucault says, was charged with “producing individuals mechanized according to the norms of industrial society,” schools face constant pressures to prepare students to be productive employees in light of prevailing market forces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1065912911421014">Foucault 1979</xref>, 242; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1065912911421014">Manzer 2003</xref>, chap. 6).</p>
<p>In Europe and North America various forms of educational tracking have become standard. This practice effectively restricts a substantive education for freedom (exemplified in a “liberal arts” education) to those (relatively) few students who pursue elite college or university educations. In the United States—and in other Western liberal states, to varying degrees—a considerable proportion of the population now pursues university educations, and even graduate degrees. Even larger percentages of the populations in these countries, however, do not pursue such educations, and perhaps never seriously consider enrolling for various reasons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr105-1065912911421014">Willis 1981</xref>, 3). Tracking mechanisms differ across countries, but the practice of sorting students into academic and vocational tracks is present in all (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1065912911421014">Manzer 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Clearly, a number of factors enter into this segmented approach to “universal” compulsory education in liberal democratic capitalist societies, including pressure by many parents for public schools to teach their children “marketable” skills. Central among these factors is the hegemony of hierarchical Taylorist and “human relations” approaches to labor relations combined with the way that tracking and inequalities of educational achievement tend to follow broader class, racialized, and gendered inequalities. Superficially, there appears to be democratic self-selection in how students are tracked into university and “vocational” paths; such individual “choices” are conditioned, however, by social and economic inequalities rooted in class divisions and related differences of racialized identity, ethnicity, and gender that structure the contexts in which these “choices” are made (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1065912911421014">Gramsci 1971</xref>, 40; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr105-1065912911421014">Willis 1981</xref>, 1; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-1065912911421014">Rattansi 2007</xref>). In addition, school administrators employ various institutionalized mechanisms—notably, standardized tests—to sort students into different educational “tracks” or “ability groups” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1065912911421014">Karier 1976</xref>, 357-60; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1065912911421014">Lemann 1995</xref>). Together, these circumstances engender an illusion of “equality of educational opportunity” and rewards according to merit (or individual achievement) that occludes widespread awareness of the exclusionary and antiegalitarian (and antidemocratic) processes at work. In the prevailing meritocratic view, since virtually every member of these societies has access to primary and secondary education, those persons who work their way most effectively through these educational “structures of success” are regarded simply as the most intelligent, capable, and deserving (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1065912911421014">Lemann 1995</xref>).</p>

<title>Underclass Theory</title>
<p>Finally, the “underclass” concept was coined in 1962 by economist Gunner Myrdal with reference to some of those who founder in contemporary capitalist societies. Myrdal, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1065912911421014">Herbert Gans (1998</xref>, 67) explains, “used the word as a purely descriptive concept, to describe the chronically unemployed, underemployed, and underemployables being created by what we now call the post-industrial economy.” For Myrdal, the concept was meant to identify an economic problem that called for economic reform rather than call for punishing its victims. In the United States, where the concept came into wide use between the late 1970s and early 1990s, it has been used to signify what was thought to be a new urban social pathology. “The word underclass,” <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1065912911421014">Michael Katz (1993</xref>, 3-4) notes, “conjured up a mysterious wilderness in the heart of America’s cities; . . . a collectivity outside politics and social structure.” A 1977 <italic>Time</italic> magazine article on “The American Underclass” brought the term into popular discourse. It declared, “Behind the [ghetto’s] crumbling walls lives a large group of people who are more intractable, more socially alien and more hostile than almost anyone had imagined” (quoted in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1065912911421014">Katz 1993</xref>, 4).</p>
<p>Yet the “underclass” concept is part of a long history of attempts to “divide poor people into categories and to distinguish invidiously among them” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1065912911421014">Katz 1993</xref>, 6). In the United States, nineteenth-century writers recast an older distinction between the “able-bodied” and “impotent” poor as a moralized distinction between the “deserving and undeserving.” Commentators in the United States and England used the terms <italic>pauper, pauperism</italic>, and <italic>dangerous classes</italic> to identify those among the poor and working classes whom they regarded as “undeserving” and prone to antisocial conduct; these persons were considered largely responsible for their own hardships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1065912911421014">Katz 1993</xref>, 6; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1065912911421014">K. Jones and Williamson 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1065912911421014">Buckley 1991</xref>, 260-61).</p>
<p>The concept of the “residuum,” used by English Victorian writers in the generation following Mill, was a precursor to the underclass concept. English liberals, including economist Alfred Marshall, tended to share Mill’s faith that education and economic progress would make the working class “more rational” and more “like a middle class in working class dress” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1065912911421014">G. Jones 1976</xref>, 9). These writers generally rejected the idea that working people were trapped by “Malthusian” pressures whereby their tendency to procreate invariably outstripped society’s need for labor. They conceived the “residuum” (or “casual poor”) in relation to a sense of widespread material and moral progress that left a “minority of the still unregenerate poor” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1065912911421014">G. Jones 1976</xref>, 9). The “residuum,” Marshall maintained, was composed of “those who have a poor physique and a weak character—those who are limp in body and mind.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn33-1065912911421014">33</xref></sup> Their problem was not systemic poverty but “pauperism with its attendant vices, drunkenness, improvidence, mendicancy, bad language, filthy habits, gambling, low amusements, and ignorance” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1065912911421014">G. Jones 1976</xref>, 11).</p>
<p>In the United States, the “underclass” concept establishes similar invidious distinctions among the poor with a racial dimension rooted in the country’s racialized class divisions.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn34-1065912911421014">34</xref></sup> It has operated as “a racial codeword that subtly hides anti-black and anti-Hispanic feelings” among whites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1065912911421014">Gans 1998</xref>, 69). Underclass status often has been regarded in the United States as a pathological condition especially prevalent among African Americans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1065912911421014">Glasgow 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr106-1065912911421014">Wilson 2006</xref>). This view has supported a tendency, especially among white people, to regard as <italic>racial</italic> problems—that is, as problems of a supposedly inferior “race” (or “races”)—problems actually resulting from systemic social and political forces such as racism, economic restructuring, and the recent retrenchment of the welfare state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1065912911421014">Lipsitz 1998</xref>, 18).</p>
<p>While the “underclass” concept found a particularly fertile soil in the United States, the kind of economic marginalization that Myrdal used it to describe is evident in most wealthy liberal capitalist societies. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr103-1065912911421014">Loïc Wacquant (1996</xref>, 123) calls this phenomenon “advanced marginality” and says that it involves “realities of extreme poverty and social destitution, ethnoracial divisions (linked to colonial history) and public violence, and their accumulation in distressed urban areas.” These new forms of social exclusion and marginalization “have arisen, or intensified, in the post-Fordist metropolis as a result . . . of uneven, disarticulating, mutations of the <italic>most advanced sectors</italic> of Western societies and economies.” Wacquant emphasizes the social forces that have generated this new marginality. The danger is that other social scientists and nonmarginalized citizens—those John Kenneth Galbraith calls the “contented majority”—will see those subject to advanced marginality as a new “residuum.” In this view, “the underclass is deemed the sources of its own succor or well-being” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1065912911421014">Galbraith 1992</xref>, 40-41).</p>

<title>IV. Democratic Equality</title>
<p>In light of this genealogy of the governance of equality and inequality in liberal democratic capitalist societies, a critical theory of democratic equality must work on two tracks. First, it must reveal the ways in which liberal governmental practices construct and reproduce inequalities in the name of equality. Second, it must advance a compelling egalitarian response to these issues. In their more considered views, Mill and Tawney offer the basis for a democratic egalitarian response to existing inequalities even as, in their departures from democratic equality, they laid down intimations of inegalitarian liberal governmental rationality.</p>
<p>Focusing on English education before compulsory universal secondary education, Tawney highlighted a vicious circle of systemic inequalities in education and the wider class stratification produced by capitalism. England’s class stratified education system was “at once a system, an effect, and a cause of the control of the lives of the mass of men and women by a privileged minority” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr97-1065912911421014">Tawney 1922</xref>, 33). This tendency has held true since England and other welfare state capitalist societies established compulsory secondary education. Unequal material resources across classes tend to produce unequal educational achievement for children of different class backgrounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1065912911421014">Brown 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1065912911421014">Hochschild and Scovronick 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1065912911421014">Jenkins, Micklewright, and Schnepf 2008</xref>). And inequalities across classes in the cultural capital that fosters educational achievement also get passed across generations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1065912911421014">Gramsci 1971</xref>, 31; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1065912911421014">Bourdieu 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr105-1065912911421014">Willis 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1065912911421014">Barry 2005</xref>). These considerations call into question the extent to which inequalities in scholastic achievement and its fruits are the result of differences of individual talent, effort, and initiative.</p>
<p>Faced with class-based inequalities of income, wealth, and power, Mill and Tawney extended liberal principles in democratic socialist directions. In place of education that trains most people merely for employment and subservience, they would have us educate all citizens for democratic self-government. “[A]ny education which aims at making human beings other than machines,” <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1065912911421014">Mill (1977b</xref>, 410) said, “in the long run makes them claim to have the control of their own actions.” Class inequalities would be ameliorated not by merely redistributing resources and opportunities through redistributive taxation and state-supported public schooling, but by extending democratic self-government to major economic enterprises.</p>
<p>Lately, such appeals to equality have had little popular resonance in the United States, Canada, Britain, France, Germany, and elsewhere; Latin America is a partial exception to this trend. Writing soon after the fall of the Soviet Union and before the rise of New Labour in England, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-1065912911421014">Alan Ryan (1992</xref>, 471-72) wondered “whether socialists need to talk about equality.” (This was, in a way, to wonder if there is any hope left for distinctly democratic socialist ideas.) He observed that when citizens support egalitarian policies, such as public spending on education and health care, typically this is “not because they value equality.”</p>
<p>Tawney foresaw this turn in the politics of equality. The working-class movement’s idea of social justice, he said, was a corrective to “the exaggerated emphasis on individual advancement through the acquisition of wealth.” Yet the movement was “liable . . . to forget its mission” to seek an egalitarian social order. The danger was that “a considerable number among those to whom it appeals are too easily contented—too ready to forget fundamental issues and be bought off with an advance in wages, too willing to accept the moral premises of their masters” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr99-1065912911421014">Tawney 1964a</xref>, 41). In the post-WWII era, this scenario transpired in a widespread way. The terrain of economic contestation for equality and freedom has shifted away from earlier struggles between workers and employers for control over the production process to a more diffuse struggle—evident in the workplace and in public policy making—to secure safe working conditions and a just distribution of the produce of the labor process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1065912911421014">Bauman 1988</xref>, 6-7). Consequently, beyond minimal ideas about equal respect for persons and equal rights, equality is now widely construed in terms of presumptively equal opportunities for individual achievement and access to material consumption rather than in terms of democratic power sharing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr102-1065912911421014">Therborn 2006</xref>). This sort of equality, however, leaves people starkly unequal with respect to directing the political and economic institutions that govern their lives.</p>
<p>Here Tawney’s alternative makes good sense. A just conception of democratic equality should include some acknowledgment of individual talents, exertions, and achievements. Yet to allocate fairly rewards according to merit would require what he calls substantial “practical equality,” that is, “equal chances of using to the full [our] natural endowments” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr99-1065912911421014">Tawney 1964a</xref>, 106-7). At the same time, individuals arguably do not deserve inherited or innate advantages or disadvantages since they just happen to <italic>have</italic> these things (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1065912911421014">Barry 2005</xref>, 109-27). Moreover, if we accept <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr99-1065912911421014">Tawney’s (1964a</xref>, 46, 50) principle that all people are “equally entitled as human beings to consideration and respect,” then we also should affirm his radical democratic proposition: that inequalities of intelligence or merit, however construed, do not justify stark, democratically unaccountable inequalities of power and authority in political or economic life. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1065912911421014">Clarence Karier (1976</xref>, 356) says, even if we accept the hereditarian view of innate, inherited intellectual differences, there is “no inherent logic” that dictates “that differences in intellectual ability necessarily should mean differences in social power.” While a good case can be made for some allocation of rewards proportionate to merit, it is another matter to claim that some people deserve more social and political power than others.</p>
<p>To follow Mill and Tawney would not necessitate abandoning completely the idea of allocating rewards according to merit, assuming that we could agree on what constitutes merit; and it would not require that we abandon all divisions of labor and levels of authority in the governance of states and economic enterprises. A commitment to democratic equality, in brief, would allow for some distribution of rewards according to merit but not for <italic>meritocracy</italic>, where merit is the guiding criterion in allocating incomes, offices, power, and authority (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr110-1065912911421014">Young 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1065912911421014">Daniels 1991</xref>). The use of merit, then, would be subordinated to democratic equality as the overarching principle. This would mean that some inequalities of income, offices, and authority, based on considerations of merit, would be allowable <italic>insofar as they were compatible with democratic governance of the major social and political institutions</italic>.</p>
<p>This democratic horizon is not unworkable. Just as mediating institutions of representative government can be compatible with democratic equality in the governance of democratic states, democratic equality in the governance of economic enterprises, as Tawney insisted, does not demand a leveling of all economic gradations of authority and specialization. Rather, in the form of economic democracy, democratic equality would require that every worker would have an equal voice (or at least an equal vote) in determining the basic authority structure of large firms and other major economic institutions.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1065912911421014">Dahl (1998</xref>, 76) states this idea of democratic equality in a more positive form with respect to the governance of states, with an apt caveat: “Except on a very strong showing to the contrary in rare circumstances, protected by law, every adult subject to the laws of the state should be considered to be sufficiently well qualified to participate in the democratic process of governing the state.” Elsewhere he extends this principle to the governance of economic enterprises (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1065912911421014">Dahl 1985</xref>, 57-83). My analysis supports this principle but indicates a need for caution about what would count as a “very strong showing to the contrary” that would disqualify some persons from equal participation in democratic governance.</p>
<p>Regarding the ideological politics of equality, my analysis indicates further reasons for the current political success of neoliberal conceptions of individual achievement and the equal opportunity to become unequal. The liberal governmental rationality intimated by Mill and Tawney and refined in various practices of liberal governmentality (e.g., IQ and achievement testing, Taylorism, educational tracking, and “underclass” theories) obscures the undemocratic effects of class structured economic inequality in two ways. First, these practices lend credence to the dubious view that existing democratic capitalism comes close to realizing equality of opportunity and a distribution of rewards according to merit. They encourage contented electoral majorities to evade Tawney’s insight that real equality of opportunity requires “an equal start” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr99-1065912911421014">Tawney 1964a</xref>, 106; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1065912911421014">Barry 2005</xref>, 37-69). This blind spot of contented majorities has been exacerbated in various national contexts by racism. In particular, working-class members of dominant racialized groups typically gain certain material, psychological, and social status advantages within racialized status hierarchies that insulate them from the worse effects of class inequality. For instance, they often have privileged access to labor and housing markets, educational opportunities, and social welfare policies compared to working-class members of subaltern racialized groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-1065912911421014">Roediger 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr107-1065912911421014">Winant 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>There is a larger theoretical and practical issue here. As my discussion of IQ testing and the underclass concept indicates, the governance of class inequalities in many liberal capitalist societies has been bound up with the politics of racism and racialized inequalities. Liberal governmental practices such as the deployment of the underclass concept, educational tracking, and IQ and achievement testing in schools have typically been shaped by “race” ideas and racism as well as by the class divisions in capitalist societies. This has been evident in such things as modern racialized slavery, European and U.S. colonialism, immigration politics, labor market segmentation, racially exclusionary labor unions, and racially exclusionary or unequal access to educational opportunities and housing markets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1065912911421014">Miles 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1065912911421014">Lipsitz 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-1065912911421014">Roediger 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr107-1065912911421014">Winant 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-1065912911421014">Rattansi 2007</xref>). In the history of intelligence testing, for instance, some scholars and commentators have used the results of intelligence tests to claim that different “racial” groups, on average, possess different levels of innate intelligence or cognitive ability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1065912911421014">Kamin 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1065912911421014">Lewontin 1996</xref>).</p>
<p>Second, this liberal governmental rationality shields the meritocratic ideal itself from democratic critique. The associated liberal governmental practices reinforce the idea that once “democratic” capitalism is joined with compulsory universal elementary and secondary schooling the resulting inequalities of income and wealth, economic positions and economic power are “natural” and just expressions of fundamental differences (i.e., “inequalities”) among people in talent, intelligence, initiative, and effort. In this theory, the rich are rich because, generally speaking, they possess greater talent, inventiveness, and drive than most other people; middle-class and working-class people have earned their economic status, nothing more, nothing less; and the “underclasses” have only their own “deficiencies” to blame for their plight. This meritocratic ethos reinforces the undemocratic view that employees are neither competent nor entitled to govern the enterprises in which they work.</p>
<p>Accordingly, democratic egalitarians still have some grounds for optimism concerning the <italic>possibility</italic> of building more fully democratic societies. To approach this goal a society would have to strive, following the more persistent arguments of Mill and Tawney, to create broad systems of education that cultivate in all persons, as much as possible, capacities for critical reflection and self-government. This would involve a decisive shift away from current tendencies to educate different individuals according to their “scholastic aptitude” as measured by standardized tests and away from what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1065912911421014">Doris Lessing (1981</xref>, xv) calls the tendency to regard people’s talents “as commodities with a value in the success-stakes.” The more ambitious element of this democratic project would be a continuing push for democratic worker and community control of major economic as well as political institutions. This task increasingly is complicated by global markets of labor and capital and how class divisions cut unevenly across the North–South global divide.</p>
<p>My account of democratic equality has a somewhat utopian character, pointing beyond the horizon of what currently is “realistic” politically. Radical democrats must not entirely abandon such utopian thinking, however, since “goals unattainable now will never be reached unless they are articulated when they are still unattainable” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1065912911421014">Kolakowski 1968</xref>, 70). In our era of transnational corporate power and diverse noneconomic (or not strictly economic) sources of political struggle, economic democratization may be harder than ever to realize. However, ever-expanding concentrations of economic and political power around the world give the idea of inclusive democratic equality continuing relevance.</p>
