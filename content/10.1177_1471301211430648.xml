<abstract>
<p>Within the social psychological understanding of dementia, individuals’ personhood is central. A respect for personhood has been linked to successful person-centred care, yet research exploring subjective personhood in dementia is scarce. This study aimed to understand personhood by exploring the subjective experiences of those with dementia. Seven individuals with dementia were interviewed and interpretative phenomenological analysis was used to identify themes across accounts. Themes identified were: (1) working out the system and adapting in order to survive it – the ‘peoplehood’ of the system; (2) using past and future roles and experiences to manage the present – the transient nature of personhood; (3) being both an individual and a member of a group − the conflict of a dual role. The themes highlighted showed that individuals with dementia supported their personhood by drawing on their own, others’ and the system’s resources. The findings are discussed and links with existing literature and clinical implications are considered.</p>

<sec id="sec1-1471301211430648" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>The shift from a biomedical view of dementia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1471301211430648">American Psychiatric Association, 1994</xref>) to a focus on individuals’ interactions and social context (e.g. Hughes, Louw, &amp; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1471301211430648">Sabat, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1471301211430648">Kitwood, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1471301211430648">Sabat &amp; Harre, 1992</xref>) has emphasised that dementia care and research cannot be solely based upon the view that dementia concerns ‘a… person whose brain is failing’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1471301211430648">Kitwood &amp; Bredin, 1992</xref>, p. 273) and should encompass the needs of the person (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1471301211430648">Goyder, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1471301211430648">Kitwood, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1471301211430648">Wilkinson, 2002</xref>). Furthermore, in adopting this holistic and individually focused understanding, promoting the now well-established concept of personhood (1997) appears pivotal.</p>
<p>In <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1471301211430648">Kitwood’s (1997)</xref> terms, a failure of relationships to be truly mutual would, inevitably, affect the quality of the individual with dementia’s experience of care and he coined diminishing encounters as malignant social psychology (MSP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1471301211430648">Kitwood, 1990</xref>),</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1471301211430648">Sabat and Harre’s (1992)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1471301211430648">Sabat’s (2006)</xref> stances do not explicitly label the concept as personhood. Their social constructionist understanding illustrates the need to understand all elements around the person with dementia and the person as an individual to relate successfully to the person with dementia. Offering care for people with dementia by considering them as a ‘person with dementia’ in isolation means that that whole notion of individuals’ ‘selves’, or how people present themselves and are seen by others, is overlooked. This fails to recognise that individuals are only able to be ‘a person through others’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1471301211430648">Sabat, 2006</xref>, p. 287). The effects of dementia are not purely seen as a result of the condition itself but, moreover, as a result of the positioning of individuals with dementia by others, which can contribute to the apparent ‘deterioration’ seen in those with dementia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1471301211430648">Sabat &amp; Harre, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1471301211430648">Sabat, 2006</xref>). Placing individuals in a position that is malignant to their self (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1471301211430648">Sabat, 2006</xref>) is likely to exacerbate the difficulties related to emotions, understanding and ways of behaving for the individual with dementia, creating a vicious and damaging cycle. In many ways, this acknowledgement and recognition of the person as a ‘person’ and not a patient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1471301211430648">Sabat, 2006</xref>) appears obvious.</p>
<p>In contrast to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1471301211430648">Kitwood (1997)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1471301211430648">Sabat and Harre (1992)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1471301211430648">Buron’s (2008)</xref> structured personhood perspective outlined three distinct levels of personhood and views dementia as a degenerative process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1471301211430648">Buron, 2008</xref>, p. 324). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1471301211430648">Buron (2008)</xref> suggests a person-centred care approach should firstly address individuals’ basic biological needs, followed by individual needs and then sociologic needs. This understanding of personhood, in comparison with a social constructionist account, may be increasingly explicit in what ‘good’ dementia care should address in terms of the levels of personhood. However, a structured approach to the highly complex and subjective experience of personhood may focus on meeting these very specific ‘targets’ in global ways across individuals, which does not appear to fit with truly person-centred care. However, both <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1471301211430648">Kitwood (1997)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1471301211430648">Sabat (2006)</xref> highlight the need to view the individual with dementia as someone who may be experiencing cognitive changes but who, in essence, can experience the same feelings, thoughts and responses as we ourselves do. Though the importance of personhood has been recognised within the field of dementia care and research, much of the discussion to date has been based on opinion as opposed to evidence. Such models, for example <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1471301211430648">Buron (2008)</xref>, offer a useful conceptualisation but have not been evaluated through research with individuals with dementia, and so their utility remains limited.</p>
<p>Research studies actively seeking the views of individuals with dementia are advocated (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1471301211430648">Cottrell &amp; Schulz, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1471301211430648">Cowdell, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1471301211430648">Downs, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1471301211430648">Wilkinson, 2002</xref>) and more recently there has been an increase in the research base exploring the subjective experience in dementia. In this shift, a range of different approaches have been utilised in hearing the subjective experience of the individual with dementia including direct interviews (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1471301211430648">Clare, Rowlands, Bruce, Surr &amp; Downs, 2008</xref>), analysis of autobiographical accounts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1471301211430648">Page &amp; Keady, 2010</xref>), in-depth case studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1471301211430648">O’Connor, Phinney &amp; Hulko, 2010</xref>) and research designs utilising interview, observation and focus groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1471301211430648">Hulko, 2009</xref>). Social location appeared to be relevant to both identity and the experience of dementia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1471301211430648">Hulko, 2009</xref>; O’Connor et al., 2009), and for some individuals social location worked to mediate experiences of dementia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1471301211430648">Hulko, 2009</xref>). Further related to identity and subjective experience in dementia, individuals’ need to reconstruct their identity, alongside retaining social relationships and networks, to cope with the experience of dementia has been noted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1471301211430648">Page &amp; Keady, 2010</xref>), and managing and accepting the experience of dementia, affirmation of past sense of self and identity was reported as important in individuals’ subjective experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1471301211430648">Clare et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Research accessing subjective experiences of dementia has focused on early stages of the experience (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1471301211430648">Clare, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1471301211430648">Pratt &amp; Wilkinson, 2001</xref>) and can exclude the perspectives of those in formal care settings, although research has explored the views of individuals with dementia within residential care settings (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1471301211430648">Barnett, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1471301211430648">Proctor, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1471301211430648">Small, Geldart, Gutman &amp; Scott, 1998</xref>), although not specific to personhood.</p>
<p>Specific to personhood in dementia, limited research has particularly focused on the maintenance of personhood in dementia, has explored spouses’ views and highlighted important strategies such as maintaining continuity, buffering existing competencies, minimising incompetence and strategising public encounters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1471301211430648">Perry &amp; O’Connor, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>Despite the current lack of clarity associated with the term, personhood and its maintenance is posited as the central issue in the care of individuals with dementia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1471301211430648">Kelson, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1471301211430648">Kitwood, 1997</xref>). Consequently, understanding personhood is closely related to understanding and delivering person-centred dementia care. Research that focuses on the individual with dementia’s view about how personhood is both maintained and diminished in their care is central in advancing the quality of care offered that respects personhood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1471301211430648">Epp, 2003</xref>). This study aimed to understand the subjective experiences of personhood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1471301211430648">Bradford Dementia Group, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1471301211430648">Kitwood, 1998</xref>) experienced by those with dementia in UK dementia care settings. Such exploration aimed to highlight factors supporting and undermining individuals’ personhood, and advance both the current understanding of personhood and the relationship between personhood and person-centred dementia care.</p>

<sec id="sec3-1471301211430648"><title>Design</title>
<p>This study employed interpretative phenomenological analysis (IPA) to explore individuals’ experience of personhood in dementia care. IPA has previously been used in other research considering the subjective experience of people with neurological difficulties, such as people with Parkinson’s disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1471301211430648">Todd, Simpson, &amp; Murray, 2010</xref>) and, more specifically relevant, people with early stage Alzheimer’s disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1471301211430648">Clare, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>IPA focuses on the life-world of the participant, where the process of acquiring meaning and understanding within a social interaction is deemed relevant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1471301211430648">Smith, Osborn &amp;, Jarman, 1999</xref>). The phenomenological basis means it is concerned with individual, subjective accounts about an object or events, and it is interpretative in that accounts are elicited though a dynamic process, where the researchers’ beliefs play a part in developing an understanding of the participants’ world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1471301211430648">Smith &amp; Osborn, 2003</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-1471301211430648" sec-type="subjects"><title>Participants</title>
<p>Participants were recruited from ward settings in the north west of England offering clinical assessment and treatment for those over the age of 65 with cognitive impairments. Participants had resided on the ward for at least two weeks and had a diagnosis of dementia. Individuals with early-onset dementia were excluded as they were atypical of individuals who would normally form the ward clientele. Further inclusion criteria included the capacity to provide informed consent to take part and the ability to communicate verbally.</p>
<p>IPA research advocates purposive sampling; it seeks the views of individuals about their respective experiences of the phenomenon and sampling does not attempt to be representative or random (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1471301211430648">Smith &amp; Osborn, 2003</xref>). IPA is specifically designed to be conducted on small, purposive and homogeneous samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1471301211430648">Brocki &amp; Wearden, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1471301211430648">Smith &amp; Osborn, 2003</xref>), meaning subsequent conclusions can be attributed to the phenomena under investigation rather than individual differences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1471301211430648">Smith &amp; Osborn, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>In accordance with these methodological considerations, interviews were completed with seven individuals with dementia who, at the point of interview, were residing in dementia care inpatient settings. All participants were white British and ages ranged from 62 to 87 (<italic>M</italic> = 74 years). Three of the participants were female and four male. The length of stay within the dementia care setting ranged from 14 days to 112 days (<italic>M</italic> = 49). Three participants had a diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease, two had a diagnosis of alcohol-related dementia, one had a diagnosis of frontal-temporal dementia and one had a diagnosis of vascular dementia. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1471301211430648">Table 1</xref> denotes the characteristics of participants involved in this research study.

<sec id="sec5-1471301211430648" sec-type="methods"><title>Procedure</title>
<p>The project proposal was approved by the relevant ethics committees. Participants who wished to take part and had the capacity to provide informed consent completed a consent form. Capacity to provide informed consent underpinned all aspects of participant selection, recruitment and assessment. Assessing capacity was discussed with staff when introducing the research and via an approved capacity assessment and in line with the relevant UK legislation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1471301211430648">Mental Capacity Act, Department of Health, 2005</xref>). The first author, who carried out the interviews, did not make a global decision on capacity but rather approached and assessed the key principles – that is, an individual’s ability to understand the information presented and retain it in order to make a decision, and an ability to communicate that decision (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1471301211430648">British Psychological Society [BPS], 2008</xref>). Consent was gained both verbally and in writing from participants before interviews were conducted.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec6-1471301211430648"><title>Data collection</title>
<p>Semi-structured interviews were guided by an interview schedule focused on experiences of care, generated from Nurses’ Essence of Care literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1471301211430648">Department of Health, 2007</xref>) and areas identified as important in person-centred care (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1471301211430648">Kitwood, 1997</xref>). Interviews also sought to explore individuals’ feelings about the inpatient care environment.</p>
<p>Given the presence of cognitive impairments, adaptations to the interview process were necessary. Interviews were adapted to fit participants’ pace and timescale, attempting to enter their world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1471301211430648">Goldsmith, 1996</xref>) and transferable techniques from learning disability research, such as open questioning and validating responses, were employed to facilitate rapport between the participant and researcher (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1471301211430648">Booth &amp; Booth, 1996</xref>).</p>
<p>All interviews were conducted one-to-one in a private room separate from the ward. The duration of each interview ranged from 25 to 83 minutes (<italic>M</italic> = 40). All interviews were digitally recorded and later transcribed by the first author.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec7-1471301211430648"><title>Data analysis</title>
<p>Analysis was based on the procedures described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1471301211430648">Smith, Flowers and Larkin (2009)</xref>. Interviews were transcribed verbatim and each transcript was analysed in turn. Emergent themes for each transcript were grouped into clusters, related to different aspects of individuals’ experience, a list of themes for each participant was produced and all theme clusters were grouped together to form the overarching themes from all the data.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="sec8-1471301211430648" sec-type="results"><title>Results and discussion</title>
<p>Three themes emerged when considering individuals’ experience of personhood:
<list id="list1-1471301211430648" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Working out the system and adapting in order to survive it: the peoplehood of the system.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Using past and future roles and experiences to manage the present: the transient nature of personhood.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Being both an individual and a member of a group: the conflict of a dual role.</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>Each theme will be discussed and direct quotations will be used to illustrate the themes. Participants’ identifying information has been removed and pseudonyms have been used.</p>
<sec id="sec9-1471301211430648"><title>Working out the system and adapting in order to survive it: The peoplehood of the system</title>
<p>This theme has relational and systemic undertones and is concerned with how the ward system interacts with the personhood of the individuals in that environment. Participants spoke about their understanding of and feelings relating to the operating system of the ward environment, how they worked with what was ‘available’ and responded within the restrictions of the ward:<disp-quote>
<p>When you are kind of trapped in a situation where your presence elsewhere isn’t possible you have to take what’s available and deal with it, and that’s what I am having to do. (Arnold)</p></disp-quote>Participants described adjusting both their expectations and feelings about the system to fit the system, rather than the reverse being true. The approach to personhood they experienced in the ward system was generic. Application of a status underpinned by generalised rules to all individuals could be argued to be impersonal and therefore incongruent with a respect for personhood.<disp-quote>
<p>You’re living by their rules and regulations. You have to abide by their rules and regulations and I think that confines everybody in here to those aspects. (Ken)</p></disp-quote>Clearly within systems where individuals need to exist and function together, there need to be rules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1471301211430648">Kelley, 1955</xref>). However, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1471301211430648">Goyder (2009)</xref> has highlighted the danger of personhood being reduced to ‘patienthood’ (p. 185). Additionally, individuals with dementia have expressed a need to feel able to exist in a world which is less constrained, needing ‘a licence to be free, to be me’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1471301211430648">Killick &amp; Allan, 2009</xref>, p. 30). Therefore, such a focus on the central role of rules in the ward environment will conflict with the needs of the individual with dementia being met, as their personhood is unavoidably compromised.</p>
<p>Furthermore, participants understood that their relationship with the ward system included rules which must be adhered to, but the regimented nature of this relationship appeared to contrast directly with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1471301211430648">Kitwood’s (1997)</xref> identified need for relationships characterised by respect, recognition and trust. Furthermore, one participant, who had previously held a high civil position, appeared to feel highly frustrated at the lack of respect and trust afforded to him and felt ‘unknown’ in this current system:<disp-quote>
<p>Christ, if I can’t be trusted to go out and have a smoke, then I am over analysed, or under analysed perhaps is a better word. Anybody who really knows me knows I don’t want to destroy myself in any way, shape or form. (Arnold)</p></disp-quote>The negative impact of a lack of specific choice for individuals with dementia in long-term care has been highlighted previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1471301211430648">Train, Nurock, Manela, Kitchen, &amp; Livingston, 2005</xref>). However, if, as this research finding highlights, individuals’ lack of choice is global and pervasive across their care environment, the negative impact is likely to be further exacerbated. Aspects of the ward environment were also felt by many to be ‘like a prison’ and such emotive terms reflected participants’ feelings of incarceration (as opposed to hospitalisation) and the lack of a therapeutic element in their hospital stay. Furthermore, rules were not always explicit and may have been inherent within the system (i.e. about knowing how to act in a dementia ward environment) but confusing given they remained unspoken and unique to this particular environment. This then raises the relevance of event-based knowledge structures or ‘scripts’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1471301211430648">Fiske &amp; Taylor, 1991</xref>). Scripts include knowledge about a type of event (going to a restaurant, for example) and, although they can contain elements specific to an individual, they tend also to have generic content across individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1471301211430648">Hogg &amp; Vaughan, 1998</xref>). However, while many participants in this study had accessed their ‘being in hospital’ script, this more generic script was not helpful in the particular, dementia-focused environment in which they found themselves.<disp-quote>
<p>I don’t think there is anything wrong with me. I can’t understand why I am here. That’s my problem. Physically, I feel pretty good. (Ken)</p></disp-quote>Consequently, the individuals had to develop a new, more specific script in order to adapt their behaviour to function successfully within the system. For example, one participant, Lily, described how her clothes were constantly taken by another individual with dementia and although this frustrated her, she adapted to what was ‘expected’ of her, within the rules of the unique system.</p>
<p>However, participants commented that for some individuals on the ward, this process of script adaptation was more difficult and this process can be related to the cognitive difficulties experienced by some people with dementia. For example, although episodic memory is worst affected in dementia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1471301211430648">Piolino et al., 2003</xref>), aspects of semantic memory are also impaired (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1471301211430648">Oosterman &amp; Scherder, 2006</xref>), and both these difficulties could affect script modification, access and retrieval. Consequently, certain individuals who were more impaired, and on whom the participants commented, were less able to produce or access a script to produce behaviour compatible with ‘being in a dementia ward’.</p>
<p>However, such a ‘lack of compliance’ was perceived negatively by the more cognitively aware participants. They perceived others as unable to ‘realise’ the consequences of not adhering to the ‘rules’, when in fact this may have been a result of the relevant script not being activated.</p>
<p>Given the need for an updated ‘being in hospital’ script, acceptance of the environment’s ways of behaving happened as a result of investigation of, socialisation to and maintenance within the system:<disp-quote>
<p>It’s a lot of filling up time here, you have to do as you’re told. You can’t always have your own way. (Lily)</p></disp-quote>This is a common experience in novel systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1471301211430648">Moreland &amp; Levine, 1982</xref>). In relation to the personhood of the individual with dementia this once again highlights the apparent ‘fixed’ nature of the hospital system and how successful maintenance of personhood in this environment may depend on an individual’s ability to learn new understandings, perhaps an example of the ‘rementia’ to which Kitwood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1471301211430648">1997</xref>, p. 113) alluded. In the limited empirical literature, adaptations to preserve personhood were made by spouses, on behalf of the individual with dementia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1471301211430648">Perry &amp; O’Connor, 2002</xref>). In contrast, this theme highlights the adaptability of the individual with dementia themselves and the consequences of a lack of ability to adapt.</p>
<p>Participants generally appeared socialised to the environment and once this happened, comparisons and reflections about rules and regulations ceased, expectations of care were lowered and they appeared grateful for the system adapting to meet their needs. For example, one participant, who smoked, talking of his appreciation for the staff taking him out for a cigarette, as and when he wished, which he appeared to view as a privilege.</p>
<p>The accounts of the participants suggested a level of reflective thinking about the ward environment and have important implications for individuals less cognitively able and who may not be able to process information and understand implicit rules as readily (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1471301211430648">Kitwood, 1990</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1471301211430648">1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1471301211430648">Stokes, 2001</xref>). For those individuals, adapting to the system may compromise their ability to maintain their own personhood and this lack of self-maintenance may lead to difficulties associated with individuals who are viewed as no longer having the qualities of a person (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1471301211430648">Kitwood, 1997</xref>) by those who care for them.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec10-1471301211430648"><title>Using past and future roles and experiences to manage the present: The transient nature of personhood</title>
<p>Participants expressed a need to draw on past roles and status as this strategy served as a reminder of who they were in the present, despite their new and ‘strange territory’. Such psychological continuity (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1471301211430648">Buron 2008</xref>) is fundamental to personhood and applying the past and future to the present helped offer security and familiarity for individuals’ self-identity. One participant spoke passionately about using her religious beliefs within the present unfamiliarity:<disp-quote>
<p>It’s like putting a big jigsaw together, making the pieces fit… the life here… bits that are missing. Because I’m a Buddhist and I believe in that sort of thing. (Lily)</p></disp-quote>When asked about their present environment, participants placed huge importance on past roles and experiences. This may have been an attempt to diminish the feelings of confusion and helplessness, engendered by the current experience of dementia and the strange environment. Previous research has highlighted ways in which individuals’ concept of the self persists in Alzheimer’s disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1471301211430648">Tappen, Williams, Fishman, &amp; Touhy, 1999</xref>). However, this research finding advances upon this to highlight that the self, and the individual’s values and beliefs associated with that self, need to be respected and considered in care which is preserving of personhood, which offers support for previous research about the salience of past identity in preserving personhood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1471301211430648">Clare et al., 2008</xref>). The need to remember experiences which generate familiarity may be a way of preserving personhood in the present, in response to the perception that self-defined normal life, and roles, ceased to exist in the present environment.</p>
<p>In the interim, viewing the present as similar to the past made the current experience increasingly manageable to the individual. Maintaining continuity and sustaining competencies has previously been shown as a spousal role in maintaining personhood for those with dementia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1471301211430648">Perry &amp; O’Connor, 2002</xref>). This present research adds to the literature by demonstrating that such continuity work can be, and is, conducted by the individuals themselves. Revisiting past experiences also draws some comparisons with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1471301211430648">Butler’s (1963)</xref> work on life review. Life review is a normal developmental task of old age, prompted by the realisation of approaching dissolution and death and serves to ward off personal vulnerability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1471301211430648">Butler, 1963</xref>). This understanding, in the context of personhood and dementia, may point to a realisation of increasing vulnerability and, unknowingly, personhood is bolstered by life review process, drawing on strengths and past successes.</p>
<p>Some participants indicated that important elements of their life from ‘before’ – such as home, salient childhood experiences – were used to cope with the ‘here and now’, for example, positive experiences of childhood:<disp-quote>
<p>It’s like living at my mum’s. Everybody’s friendly. And I’ve got four sisters and brothers. So it’s a big family. Yes. Yes, a big family. I’m used to lots of people. (Peter)</p></disp-quote>Furthermore, it has been well documented that individuals with dementia often report a desire for parents and search for parental figures (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1471301211430648">Browne &amp; Schlosberg, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1471301211430648">Miesen &amp; Jones, 1997</xref>). The home may be seen as a securely attached place for these individuals and secure attachment appears to take on greater importance to individuals with dementia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1471301211430648">Miesen 1992</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1471301211430648">1993</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1471301211430648">1999</xref>). In the context of this research, it may allow individuals to use their past experience to preserve their attachment needs in the present; if the current environment and those associated relationships cannot meet their needs, then a return to the past, either literally or in thought, may offer security in the present.</p>
<p>Previous roles and strengths seemed important to individuals making sense of their current experiences. Individuals asserted strengths they knew they once had to help them manage this period of their life. Such strengths were related to specific abilities and also, more generically, to salient previous roles and skills in their life before:<disp-quote>
<p>I have held a position at home you know, I have held a high position for years… the most senior position anyone can hold in the township. (Arnold)</p></disp-quote>Considering the ward staff’s view of what was important in terms of the past, present and future, staff were accustomed to the ward environment and so their expectations varied:<disp-quote>
<p>They [the staff] don’t notice when they’re [other individuals] taking things that belong to you and they pass it off too lightly. They say ‘I’m sorry about that Lily’, but it’s too late because they’ve done it, they’ve thumped you. (Lily)</p></disp-quote>The disparity between staff’s view of what is acceptable for the ward environment may highlight staff’s focus on the present. Although there has been some support for the importance of focusing on the present needs expressed by individuals with dementia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1471301211430648">Jaworska, 1999</xref>), there seems a clear need to acknowledge the individuals’ longstanding histories, and related beliefs in supporting personhood across time and experiences.</p>
<p>This transient personhood appears particularly relevant for the more cognitively impaired individuals within wards. Memories about past roles and experiences, and the associated protectiveness of self-identity, may be less accessible and this appears salient in two ways. Firstly, they may be less adept in maintaining personhood themselves and, secondly, if they cannot do this, then carers’ roles become increasingly salient. The role of carers has been highlighted before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1471301211430648">Brooker, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1471301211430648">Buron, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1471301211430648">Kitwood, 1997</xref>), but if the individual cannot effectively communicate these needs to staff, they may experience dual disability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1471301211430648">McKillop &amp; Wilkinson, 2004</xref>) and their personhood may be undermined.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec11-1471301211430648"><title>Being both an individual and a member of the group: The conflict of a dual role</title>
<p>There appeared a tension for the individuals interviewed about how they viewed themselves. In maintaining personhood, participants either took responsibility for their own individual personhood or related closely to other group members who also have dementia, in their best effort to bolster personhood.</p>
<p>Individuals with dementia demonstrated awareness of being part of a group of individuals with dementia, with similarity to the other members who are similar in that they all have dementia but, simultaneously, they acknowledged their very individual role within that group context. Participants appeared to feel they needed to resolve either being part of a wider group of individuals who have dementia, or an individual outside of this group, and there seemed to be a wish to commit to one of these two positions, though this was also noted as challenging. The most cognitively impaired participant reflected a sense of conflict in assimilating these roles:<disp-quote>
<p>How can I put the two together? I am the same but I am different. (Jimmy)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>This finding demonstrates the need to document and understand the importance of real-world group dynamics in longer-stay environments. Recognition that ‘sociologic personhood’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1471301211430648">Buron, 2008</xref>, p. 324) seems retained, even when cognitive impairment is advanced, is salient and differs from previous accounts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1471301211430648">Buron, 2008</xref>). Individuals with dementia in a ward environment are a social group and meet the criteria characteristic of such groups; they interact together and influence each other and interactions are structured by a set of roles and norms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1471301211430648">Hogg &amp; Vaughan, 1998</xref>). Previous research has highlighted the self-focus of individuals with dementia and their own separate experience in care settings (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1471301211430648">Clare et al., 2008</xref>). However, different strategies and categorisation, as an individual or as part of a group of individuals with dementia, are employed by participants depending on the situation and their particular needs at that time and comparison experiences may be compounded by the range of ‘abilities’ (in terms of cognitive impairment) within the ward environment.</p>
<p>Furthermore, participants recognised the value of being part of the ‘in group’, favouring this group membership over any other group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1471301211430648">Sherif, Harvey, White, Hood, &amp; Sherif, 1961</xref>). The ‘out’ group appeared to include those struggling more with cognitive functioning and a variety of terms were used in comparisons, for example ‘not well’, ‘a bit mental’, ‘not with it’, but no one used the term ‘dementia’ to describe the difficulties. However, there was also a value attached to being seen as a member of a group where others had the same difficulties as the individual with dementia:<disp-quote>
<p>I’ve found that people here are like me, that aren’t sure about what is going on… it makes me feel more saner. (Peter)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>There seemed a desire to find commonality, driven by a hope that similarity would afford a sense of belonging. Such self-categorisation can produce a social identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1471301211430648">Tajfel &amp; Turner, 1979</xref>). Their identity as a member of a group of similar others, in other words a group of individuals with dementia, may offer reassurance, reducing fears and worries about memory difficulties, and these social aspects of coping have previously been documented as important in dementia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1471301211430648">Kitwood, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1471301211430648">Preston, Marshall, &amp; Bucks, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Participants’ use of social comparison experience appears relevant within the current environment. In social comparison theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1471301211430648">Festinger, 1954</xref>), people compare to manage their own uncertainty and cope more effectively, and such comparisons may be upwards or downwards depending on the circumstances and individuals’ needs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1471301211430648">Taylor &amp; Lobel, 1989</xref>). Within healthcare, downward comparisons are seen as useful to parents of those with health and mental health issues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1471301211430648">Knudson &amp; Coyle, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1471301211430648">Eiser &amp; Eiser, 2000</xref>), as well as people with chronic illness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1471301211430648">DeVellis et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1471301211430648">Jensen &amp; Karoly, 1992</xref>). Such comparisons may serve to bolster self-esteem and improve wellbeing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1471301211430648">Wills, 1981</xref>). Individuals with dementia often fail to identify themselves as sharing qualities with other members of the group of other people with dementia they reside with, instead delineating differences (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1471301211430648">Clare et al., 2008</xref>). This may be related to their lowered awareness of group elements but a group of individuals with dementia, within a dementia ward, are likely to experience their group differently; there may not be a shared aim, given that often they do not want to be there or understand why they are there. Individuals with dementia may want to separate themselves from the wider group or certain individuals who also have dementia, especially those seen to be acting in ‘strange’ or unacceptable ways. However, it may be that, for these individuals, behaviour is their only means of preserving personhood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1471301211430648">Buron, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Viewing oneself as different appeared to be a protective strategy. In psychodynamic understandings, ‘defending’ is a way of managing negative feelings towards the self (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1471301211430648">Malan, 1979</xref>). Indeed the dislike expressed for others, who may have been less cognitively able, may have been an example of displacement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1471301211430648">Malan, 1979</xref>) about the self’s present difficulties; witnessing others’ difficulties was too threatening to tolerate. Consequently, a lack of acknowledgement of similarity maintained personhood. This maintenance can occur in spite of their current environment which may have threatened to compromise personhood. One participant displayed an evident ‘empathy gap’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1471301211430648">Ariely &amp; Loewenstein, 2006</xref>) for others who, in her view, share no similarities with herself.<disp-quote>
<p>These people don’t seem to want to do that. They just say, ‘Ooh I will just stay here and give up, what have I got to live for?’ They don’t have any push at all, as if they didn’t care what happened to them… you see I am a fighter. (Marian)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Additionally, a plethora of research exists emphasising the value and necessity of approaching care in a personalised way particular to the needs and strengths of the individual (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1471301211430648">Brooker, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1471301211430648">Kitwood, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1471301211430648">Stokes, 2001</xref>). However, participants understood the ward experience was shared, with features common to the entire group and staff were perceived as treating the experiences as a global one but that individual approaches could not be expected:<disp-quote>
<p>Because… they can’t cater for each person individually. That’s not fair on the staff. (Ken)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Staff’s respect for each individual’s personhood was, then, neither expected nor received.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="sec12-1471301211430648"><title>Conclusion and implications</title>
<p>The present study offered insight into factors important in preserving personhood. The dementia care setting as an entity affected personhood and participants were acutely aware the environment was ‘rule-bound’, which affected their subsequent behaviour. Scripts triggered were based on expectations of short-stay, physical health wards and, consequently, the triggered script did not capture the dynamics and nuances of long-stay, increasingly socially focused wards, where lounges are often central within the care environment. The dementia ward appeared to have its own novel ‘script’, underpinned by social rules and pressures, and required knowledge of different rules and regulations from ‘usual’ hospital wards. For people whose cognitive abilities are compromised, these discrepancies must be striking.</p>
<p>Furthermore, in relation to social effects, there was a clear group personhood effect. Social group roles were evident on the dementia ward, with all the subtleties that underpin them (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1471301211430648">Moreland &amp; Levine, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1471301211430648">Sherif et al., 1961</xref>). In maintaining personhood, participants either took responsibility for their own individual personhood, or related closely to other members of the group of individuals with dementia, in their effort to bolster personhood. Even in participants’ cognitively compromised state, they moved between the position of being an individual and being a part of the group of individuals with dementia, according to their need. The fact that this impressive ability was retained by individuals with dementia further highlights how individuals strived to promote their own personhood.</p>
<p>Translation of the themes of this research to practice would include training with staff teams incorporating consideration of group dynamics and the presence of ‘rules’ applied within dementia care settings. Rules are needed for systems to function to protect individuals’ safety, but they may need to be calibrated differently, in light of individuals with dementia’s need to be increasingly unrestricted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1471301211430648">Killick &amp; Allan, 2009</xref>). This was perfectly illustrated by Lily: ‘I was safe but I wasn’t happy’. Looking at a rationale for ‘rules’ and possible risks and gains from them may be across different levels, for example with both direct care staff and with service managers.</p>
<p>The group dynamic effect on personhood also impacts policies regarding who is cared for with whom. Participants did not want to see themselves with the ‘strange’ others – that is, those who were more or less impaired. Therefore, it remains paramount that dementia care environments avoid incorporating newly diagnosed, higher functioning individuals with dementia, with those whose needs may be more severe. The value of relationship-centred care in dementia has already been highlighted. Care capturing the interdependencies within caring relationships has been highlighted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1471301211430648">Nolan, Ryan, Enderby, &amp; Reid, 2002</xref>). However, this research makes explicit the need to consider individuals’ relationships with carers and staff, but also relationships between individuals with dementia themselves and the dynamics associated with these interactions. This relational understanding appears relevant to the recent discussion around citizenship, personhood and dementia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1471301211430648">Bartlett &amp; O’Connor, 2007</xref>), which has attempted to extend the scope of understanding the importance of personhood for people with dementia to one where individuals, in spite of their dementia, can also retain power in the dynamics, systems and society in which they exist – in other words, they achieve citizenship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1471301211430648">Barnes, Auburn &amp; Lea, 2004</xref>). This systemic perspective is supported in this current research and it takes into account that people with dementia do not and cannot exist in isolation. Furthermore, in extending and improving dementia practice and research, it appears salient to explore both the position of the self-singular and as part of a ‘collective’ within the experience of dementia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1471301211430648">Bartlett &amp; O’Connor, 2007</xref>). The suggestion that the dementia experience may need to be increasingly understood as relational rather than singular, has also been posited by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1471301211430648">Sutton (2003)</xref>, who outlined the need for individuals with dementia to join and exist with others, in the context of both their past and present environments and relationships.</p>
<p>The transient nature of personhood highlighted by this study advances upon current dementia care approaches, for example life story work (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1471301211430648">McKeown, Clarke, &amp; Repper, 2006</xref>). Individuals in dementia care settings do not just need to be understood in terms of their present as it is crucial that individuals’ salient past roles and experiences are incorporated into how staff can support their individual identity, in the light of changing cognitive abilities. Furthermore, care may not only be about eliminating examples of obvious malignant social psychology (e.g. depersonalising tendencies); rather, care which respects personhood should eliminate care which is ‘malignant’ to the personhood of the specific person, and their specific needs, wants and wishes. Consequently, and perhaps obviously, care promoting personhood will not be universally the same for all individuals with dementia; for some there will be an increased need to understand and demonstrate this understanding of individuals’ previous status and roles in the care they deliver.</p>
<p>With specific reference to clinical care, findings from this research highlight the importance of taking into consideration factors such as the impact of other individuals with dementia in the same environment and the individual’s previous life experience and perceived strengths. Within inpatient settings, clients who may be presenting challenges to staff teams need individual assessments and personalised care plans. Such assessments could usefully include considerations, specific to the person, of the main themes from this research. For example, encouraging staff to consider questions around the understanding of the individual about why they are in a hospital, and what that means to them would be useful, along with behavioural understandings about the individual’s interactions within the group. A detailed and relevant awareness of the individual’s past experiences, roles and how they viewed themselves is central in making sense of them and their understanding of their current altered situation – that is, as an inpatient on a dementia ward. If and when appropriate, such work and the assimilation of specific, individualised care plans could be done with the individual with dementia directly, rather than through staff. Gathering explicit information in the areas outlined may aid staff team’s ability to make sense of individuals with dementia’s presentation and, furthermore, implement care plans which will successfully facilitate their wellbeing.</p>
<p>In summary, it is evident and impressive that individuals appear able to adapt their status, ways of being and group functioning, in the face of clear cognitive difficulties. This bears testament to the enduring nature of personhood across individuals, situations and time. If such awareness can be sustained, individuals with dementia should be afforded choice and autonomy in contrast to a care environment characterised by restrictions and a ‘one size fits all’ approach to preserving and enhancing personhood.</p>
