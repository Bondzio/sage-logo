<abstract>
<p>A parent-researcher examines two adolescent immigrants’ educational journey to success through the analysis of positioning theory and negotiated identities. Through the boys’ direct voices about their schooling experiences with a particular focus on the middle and high school years in the United States, this article reports on the complexities of their identity negotiation and the process of their self-positioning and interactive positioning. This longitudinal study suggests that, rather than a single focus on language or culture, the immigrant students’ critical awareness of identity, negotiated identities, and external confirmation of unique abilities enable them to construct and reconstruct the context that contributes to their success. This study aims to help educators reframe the dialogue on immigrant students to include a new voice, from their own perspectives, of how they have been able to be successful in the U.S. social and educational systems.</p>

<p>Over the decades, issues about immigrant youth in the United States have been discussed in many different disciplines including anthropology, education, linguistics, psychology, and sociology. Regardless of these various fields, the focus of these studies has drawn attention to the students’ needs and challenges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0002831212443694">Faderman, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0002831212443694">Holdaway &amp; Alba, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0002831212443694">G. Lee, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0002831212443694">Thao, 1999</xref>). This focus helps educators and policymakers to consider the issues of school improvement through adaptive teaching practices and modified policies to support these students. However, the focus on needs and challenges has led us to view immigrant students as problematic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0002831212443694">Goodwin, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0002831212443694">Orellana, 2001</xref>) and has obscured the successes of these students from grade to grade and into higher education and the workforce. More studies that examine immigrant students’ successful experiences are necessary to challenge the preconceived assumptions of language and culture and look more closely at how students negotiate identities.</p>
<p>Like many researchers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0002831212443694">Au, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0002831212443694">Fu, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0002831212443694">Ladson-Billings, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0002831212443694">Norton, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0002831212443694">Yoon, 2007</xref>) assert, academic and social success is related to students’ identities in a given context. This suggests that immigrant students’ success depends on how effectively they negotiate their identities according to situational contexts. This successful process is important to examine since it illuminates how immigrant students enact their agency in various situations. Another issue to be examined is the often “assumed” vision of Asian immigrant students being the “model minority” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0002831212443694">S. J. Lee, 1994</xref>, p. 413), which pays little attention to the intricacies of identities and being successful in school that each immigrant student faces. Along with this issue, there is a scarcity of research that has been reported from a parent’s stance, including observations over time on adolescent immigrant students. Studies (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0002831212443694">Bissex, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0002831212443694">Long, 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0002831212443694">2004</xref>) that were conducted by a parent significantly contributed to the field of young children’s literacy development. However, there is little to no research examined by a parent-researcher on immigrant youths’ educational journey. The current study may contribute to filling this research gap and enrich the dialogue around this topic by adding both home and school observations, conversations, and transactions. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0002831212443694">Gutiérrez and Orellana (2006)</xref> note, more nuanced analyses of the immigrant students’ experiences “observed across a range of settings, tasks, and contexts over sustained periods of time” (p. 505) are needed to better understand the complexities of their success and identity.</p>
<p>For this longitudinal study, as their mother, researcher, and teacher educator, I explored the schooling experiences of the two siblings, Junsuk and Junhyuck, with a special focus on their middle and high school years in the United States. Beginning the new journey as an immigrant myself, I did not know whether the siblings could be academically and socially successful. When I began taking journal notes about their schooling experiences, I assumed their different language and culture would be the major barriers for their education and socialization. Looking back over my journal notes kept during the 9 years of immigrant experiences, I noted that the observations about the siblings’ home to school experiences challenged my theoretical assumptions and led me to view their educational process with the expanded lens of identity and positioning. Through Junsuk’s and Junhyuck’s voices, this article reports on their identity negotiation and educational journey to success regardless of their language and cultural differences.</p>
<p>The purpose of this article is to show the reader that being successful in an academic setting is a complicated process that requires the students’ agency with their identity awareness, negotiation, and external confirmation of their unique abilities from teachers and peers. It needs to be remembered that the purpose of the article is not to commend the siblings’ success as their mother. The boys’ narratives might challenge the view of immigrant students as passive and provide significant implications for teaching and learning of the students. The research questions include the following: What processes are involved in the immigrant adolescents’ success in the U.S. context? How is the successful process related to their identities as immigrant students? There are various subjective definitions of success (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0002831212443694">Alfaro, Umaña-Taylor, Gonzales-Backen, Bámaca, &amp; Zeiders, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0002831212443694">Canabal, 1998</xref>). In this study, it is defined based on the siblings’ academic performance that exceeds school requirements and their active social interaction with teachers and peers inside and outside the classroom. Grounded in positioning theory and identity theory, this study aims to help educators reframe the dialogue about immigrant students to include a new voice from their own perspectives of how they have been able to be successful in the U.S. social and educational systems.</p>
<sec id="section1-0002831212443694">
<title>Theoretical Perspectives</title>
<p>Several areas of research support the development of the premises introduced in this study. The first is positioning theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0002831212443694">Harré &amp; van Langenhove, 1999</xref>), which provides an overarching theoretical framework for this study. Positioning theory, which emphasizes how individuals’ positioning as active or passive is related to how they are positioned by others, is helpful in understanding the siblings’ interactions with their peers and teachers both in and outside the classroom. Other considerations are the strong relationship between positioning and identity and the research on immigrant students related to the issue of positioning and identity.</p>
<sec id="section2-0002831212443694">
<title>Positioning Theory</title>
<p>Leading positioning theorists <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0002831212443694">Harré and van Langenhove (1999)</xref> have defined positioning theory to include “the study of local moral orders as ever shifting patterns of mutual and contestable rights and obligations of speaking and acting” (p. 1). “Positioning” is a symbolic notion that was originally introduced to analyze interpersonal encounters from a discursive viewpoint (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0002831212443694">Hollway, 1984</xref>). The concept of positioning enables researchers to make sense of the dynamics of evolving social interactions, how individuals are positioned by others, and how they position themselves within a specific context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0002831212443694">Harré &amp; van Langenhove, 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>There are two important perspectives on positioning that are relevant to this study. One mode of positioning is intentional self-positioning. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0002831212443694">Davies and Harré (1990)</xref> refer to this as “reflexive positioning in which one positions oneself” (p. 48). From the constructionist point of view, individuals’ reflexive positioning is manifested in various discursive practices such as taking responsibility for their actions. The discursive practices of positioning make possible a way of expressing one’s stance “by indexing one’s statements with the point of view one has on its relevant world” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0002831212443694">Harré &amp; van Langenhove, 1999</xref>, p. 62). Immigrant students’ stated beliefs about their relative world help to illuminate how they position themselves in the classroom. For instance, some immigrant students might position themselves as students who assimilate into mainstream culture by losing their own cultural identity. Others might position themselves as students who challenge the dominant power and sustain their own cultural identity. Whatever positions the students take up, that positioning guides their interactive approaches with teachers and peers in classroom settings.</p>
<p>Another key mode of positioning is interactive positioning, “in which what one person says positions another” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0002831212443694">Davies &amp; Harré, 1990</xref>, p. 48). Unlike self-positioning, which fails to provide details about how and why a person positions herself differently in diverse contexts, interactive positioning takes it further by stating that positioning happens in relation to others. In this view, positioning people in particular ways limits or extends what those people can say and do (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0002831212443694">Adams &amp; Harré, 2001</xref>). That is, if people are “positioned as incompetent in a certain field of endeavor they will not be accorded the right to contribute to discussions in that field” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0002831212443694">Harré &amp; van Langenhove, 1999</xref>, p. 1). These characteristics of interactive positioning help us understand teachers’ and peers’ positioning of immigrant students in the classroom. Teachers and classmates might intentionally or unintentionally position the immigrant students in more positive or negative ways through their interactions. They might position the immigrant students as “other” without realizing that they may be limiting the students’ opportunities to develop a positive sense of themselves as immigrants.</p>
<p>As many positioning theorists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0002831212443694">Tan &amp; Moghaddam, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0002831212443694">Taylor, Bougie, &amp; Caouette, 2003</xref>) claim, any positioning, including interpersonal and intergroup positioning, involves issues surrounding how individuals see themselves. “Positive action in response to needs” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0002831212443694">Howie, 1999</xref>, p. 58) is necessary to encourage individuals to situate themselves positively. Theoretically, it seems apparent that teachers’ and peers’ positioning of immigrant students as valued members of the classroom community and teachers’ response to their needs are fundamental for the students to be able to view themselves positively, which might affect their academic and social success.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0002831212443694">
<title>Positioning, Identity, and Research</title>
<p>The major contribution of positioning theory to the educational field is that it helps us understand identity in a social context. Many scholars (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0002831212443694">Davidson, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0002831212443694">Norton, 2000</xref>) note that identity is a complicated concept that cannot be defined in one simple phrase. Identity is used in many different ways including voice, self, and subjectivity. Regardless of the numerous definitions on identity, scholars in contemporary studies often view identity as a social construct. Through the analysis of identity in the current literature, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0002831212443694">Moje and Luke (2009)</xref> demonstrate that identity and positioning are interrelated. By stating and elaborating “positioning theories of identity” (p. 430), these researchers emphasize the characteristics of identity as social constructions. This view of identity as socially mediated process states “one sees identity less as an interpretation of the person who has the identity and more dependent on other people’s recognitions of a person” (p. 418). This social nature of identity does not exclude individual constructions, but it clearly shows the power and influence of others’ positioning on individuals’ identity. For instance, the same immigrant students might position themselves as active participants in learning activities in one context while they might position themselves in another context as passive learners. They may decide, based on their perceptions of how others are viewing them in these specific contexts, to position themselves as either passive or active learners. The view of identity as position is similar to the view held by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0002831212443694">Taylor et al. (2003)</xref>, who argue that the identity process operates from a perspective of positioning. Any positioning including interpersonal and intergroup positioning involves issues surrounding individuals’ identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0002831212443694">Tan &amp; Moghaddam, 1995</xref>).</p>
<p>Due to these new characteristics of identity as position, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0002831212443694">Lewis and del Valle (2009)</xref> describe it as the third wave of identity. An individual’s identity is dynamically (re)created through positioning, and it changes through the positioning that comes from social interactions. Positioning theory’s view of identity being dynamic and social in nature is aligned with the perspective of antiessentialists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0002831212443694">Hall, 1996</xref>). Antiessentialist viewpoints focus on <italic>who I become</italic>, dealing with identity as a shifting notion, as opposed to essentialist perspectives that focus on <italic>who I am</italic>, treating identity as a fixed concept. This concept of <italic>who I become</italic> demonstrates that identity is not inherent in individuals but is recognized by other people in context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0002831212443694">Gee, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>Several scholars’ work on immigrant youth discusses the shifting notion of identity in mainstream contexts, which illustrates how adolescent immigrants represent themselves in different ways. For instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0002831212443694">Miller (2000)</xref> conducted studies of several Asian immigrant students who recently arrived in an Australian high school. The study provides evidence of how the students were positioned by the mainstream Anglo-Australian teachers and peers. Some students mentioned that they did not like to speak due to their different accent, which was not recognized as legitimate under the mainstream power. The study suggests that the Asian students were aware of their positioning as outsiders, a position that was established by the dominant group. Without repositioning their identity by challenging the dominant classmates, the Asian immigrant students tended to remain silent and isolated.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0002831212443694">Norton’s (2000)</xref> findings are consistent with those of Miller. Through the experiences of five female immigrants, Norton discussed the issue of identity. The participants were sometimes motivated, extroverted, and confident and sometimes unmotivated, introverted, and anxious. At times they remained silent, and at other times they spoke. Their different identities were shown to vary according to different contexts such as when they were within the dominant culture or the subdominant culture. All of the participants had difficulty speaking under conditions of marginalization. If they felt inferior, they were hesitant to speak. Norton’s findings suggest ways in which individuals act and position themselves differently according to different contexts. Furthermore, the studies by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0002831212443694">Miller (2000)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0002831212443694">Norton (2000)</xref> suggest that learning may change as a function of the interrelationships due to social power dynamics.</p>
<p>This feature of social power dynamics is also shown in the study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0002831212443694">Yoon and Haag (2010)</xref> that examined South Korean high school immigrant students’ identity negotiations. According to the situation, the students positioned themselves as Korean or American in a dynamic interplay depending on how they were perceived or recognized by their dominant peer group. In other words, the immigrant students’ identity as Korean or American shifted based on their recognition of the dominant group’s power in the social interactions. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0002831212443694">Walsh (1991)</xref> also discussed this power issue in her findings. She conducted a study of Puerto Rican students in America and found that the students were positioned differently in relation to one another, the subject matter, and the teacher. According to the power dynamics that the students perceived, they positioned themselves differently. In one instance they participated in learning activities, and in another instance they withdrew from the activities. Walsh argues that in an unequal society where power relations are continuously at work, participation and dialogue do not occur as freely among immigrant students. As in the examples above, individuals represent themselves differently based on the social interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0002831212443694">Mishler, 2004</xref>). They show how identity is “produced, generated, developed, or narrated over time” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0002831212443694">Moje &amp; Luke, 2009</xref>, p. 418) and how the immigrants <italic>become</italic> silent or silenced in different contexts.</p>
<p>In sum, positioning and identity are related with each other, and this relationship is supported by current research on immigrant students. Although the studies that have been reviewed provide implications on the importance of identity for students’ learning, the findings focus on the dominant group’s power that positions immigrant students as passive. They do not necessarily suggest how the process of identity negotiations is connected to immigrant students’ agency for their academic and social success. Thus, in this longitudinal study, I examine the complex process by taking the antiessentialist stance on identity and positioning through the two immigrant students’ narratives on their educational journey to success. The premise of this article is that their identity is not the presentation of <italic>who they are</italic> but <italic>who they become</italic> by enacting their agency in both educational and social settings.</p>

<title>Participants and School Settings</title>
<p>As brothers, Junsuk and Junhyuck have been in the United States for 9 years as of August 2010. Junsuk came to the United States in his fourth grade and Junhyuck in his fifth grade when they came to live with their mother, me, as I pursued my doctoral degree in New York. Their father stayed in South Korea and financially supported them. The siblings attended an elementary school in upstate New York. After 3 years in New York, Junsuk and Junhyuck moved to Texas with me when I accepted a position at a university. As of 2010, Junsuk is a freshman at a college in Texas and Junhyuck is a sophomore at a college in New York.</p>
<p>When the siblings entered the United States in 2001, they had a very limited English proficiency and were placed in the beginning English as a second language (ESL) program in their elementary school. The elementary and middle schools had ESL pullout programs, and the siblings were able to pass the English proficiency tests within 3 years. We moved to Texas when Junsuk was entering seventh grade and Junhyuck was entering eighth grade. Both of them graduated from their middle school with high rankings: Based on their report cards, they received scores greater than 90% in all subject areas. More than 600 students attend the middle school, and its ethnic makeup is 3% African American, 8% Hispanic, 80% White, and 9% Other. At this middle school, 3% of students receive free or reduced-price meals.</p>
<p>The high school has about 3,200 students. According to the school website, students’ ethnic makeup is 4% African American, 9% Hispanic, 78% White, and 9% Other. At this high school, 2% of students are identified as economically disadvantaged. The teachers’ average teaching experience is 10 years. Again, both siblings’ report cards consistently declared grades about 90% for all subjects, and both graduated in the top 10% of their graduating classes. Junsuk’s high school GPA was 3.9, and Junhyuck’s was 3.8 out of 4.0.</p>
<p>Their middle and high schools are located in a suburban area that is 25 miles away from a metropolitan city. Each school consistently ranks in the highest tiers for public schools in Texas. Due to my role as a parent, I visited the schools several times for events including open houses, music concerts, and theater presentations. Based on my journal entries and informal observations, most teachers and staff across all schools seemed to be friendly and attempted to promote welcoming environments for parents and students.</p>
<p>In his high school, Junsuk, the younger sibling, was involved in various clubs and activities including debate, orchestra, community service, and business clubs. He describes himself as “nice” and “easy to get along with others.” He is sociable and at school interacts well with his teachers and peers across diverse ethnic groups including African American, Asian, Hispanic, and White. Junsuk’s main hobby is playing the piano. He attended several piano competitions and had an opportunity to perform at the Carnegie Hall as a Grand Prix winner at an international competition when he was a junior in high school.</p>
<p>Junhyuck is Junsuk’s older sibling. Many of his classmates whom I met described him as “cool,” “funny,” and “smart.” Junhyuck describes himself as “likable,” “funny,” and “charismatic.” In high school, Junhyuck worked as president for a community service club. He was also involved in several clubs related to math and science and received several awards at the school, district, national, and international levels with regard to math and science. He was a National Merit Scholarship finalist, which represented the top 1% high school students in the state in the Preliminary Scholastic Aptitude Testing.</p>
<p>The common responses that I received from teachers about Junsuk and Junhyuck were “It’s a pleasure to work with them” and “You have two promising boys.” Although I received similar responses about the siblings from teachers, I, as a parent, think that they possess different characteristics. Their different characteristics are shown through the examples in the findings section. Due to Junsuk being more verbal and willing to share more stories about friends and school with me than Junhyuck, the data contain more direct quotes for voice from Junsuk in this article. Except for the siblings’ real names, which they allowed me to use, all the other names are pseudonyms.</p>

<sec id="section6-0002831212443694">
<title>Role as Parent-Researcher and Home Context</title>
<p>My identity and role in this longitudinal research is critical in understanding and dealing with my own perspectives and bias throughout this research study. At the beginning of this research, I was a graduate student going to school in New York, busy learning new cultures and norms in America just as Junsuk and Junhyuck were learning to adjust to a new language and cultural setting. They observed me going from my own identity as an English teacher in South Korea, being thrust into a new cultural environment and struggling in our new setting as I dealt with simple language phrases such as “cash back?” at a grocery store. I was open in sharing not only my cultural and language challenges but also my excitement about learning with Junsuk and Junhyuck, and I tried to take them to as many different places as possible to encounter new experiences. The places were diverse, including my colleagues’ houses, grocery stores, car dealerships, and public libraries. Since I knew our time as a family was cut a bit short due to all of my academic work and responsibilities, I made sure to plan new cultural outings as a way to provide them with opportunities for learning in a new context.</p>
<p>My own experience as an immigrant parent in a new country naturally led me to be interested in immigrant students, English language learners (ELLs), and identity. I was particularly curious about the siblings’ schooling experiences in the new context. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0002831212443694">Bissex (1980)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0002831212443694">Long (2004)</xref>, who examined their own children’s learning development, noted, my role as a parent-researcher allowed me to have rich data and reflect on them from a distance with a more critical lens. I listened and observed more delicate issues in a natural setting, which provided “ecological validity” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0002831212443694">Carpenter, 1997</xref>, p. 396). As a participant observer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0002831212443694">Bogdan, 1973</xref>), I participated in Junsuk’s and Junhyuck’s daily life, engaged them in casual conversations, shared their concerns, and tried to understand their schooling experiences in the new environment. In sum, my positionality as a parent-researcher contributed a naturalistic quality to the study on the siblings’ educational journey to success and identity negotiations.</p>
<p>Despite these rich contexts and my careful research methodology triangulated through my journals, observations, and interviews, some bias and validity issues remain with my role due to the researcher’s roles and identities being intricately embedded in the research process and outcome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0002831212443694">Chapman, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0002831212443694">Ely, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0002831212443694">Ladson-Billings, 2000</xref>). My positionality as an immigrant and a highly educated mother who has research interest in identity issues has influenced the siblings’ experiences and the way I collected data and interpreted them. I attempted to balance a dual role as a parent and researcher, but I could not be a simple observer of their identity negotiations. I responded to the siblings’ narratives in certain ways by praising their active roles and questioning their behaviors, which might have reinforced them to continue their identity processes. Moreover, my attitude and teaching philosophy based on inquiry-based approach for independent learners might have affected my expectations toward Junsuk and Junhyuck and the study consequently. Even though I encouraged the siblings’ independence to take responsibility for their own learning, my support as a parent could not be excluded from their success.</p>
<p>In addition, as a graduate student, I conducted studies on immigrant students at different schools almost every semester in New York, including Junsuk’s and Junhyuck’s middle school for my course projects. In the New York context, the boys knew that I was in their middle school as a researcher. Although my presence in their middle school classrooms over one semester became a regular feature, Junsuk’s and Junhyuck’s positioning of themselves and teachers’ and peers’ positioning of both siblings in the classroom context might have been different while they interacted with each other and influenced the findings of the study accordingly.</p>
<p>In terms of the home environment, I attempted to provide the siblings with a comfort zone through the family routine at the dinner table. What we took for granted in South Korea was not considered routine anymore in America, and they became adept at bringing up and discussing new topics at the table. As I shared my own new learning from my experiences, I prompted the siblings to talk about “any interesting thing that happened at school.” The siblings’ father and I share a similar philosophy of raising children: providing as many opportunities as possible and having them learn from these opportunities. When he visited us in the United States, he often brought some Korean books including novels, essays, and math textbooks for the siblings. Junhyuck enjoyed reading these books, compared to his younger sibling Junsuk, who preferred watching TV programs with English or Spanish captions. Since the beginning of high school, Junsuk and Junhyuck were seen to develop different hobbies: Junsuk spent more time playing on the piano and Junhyuck reading books in both English and Korean and playing basketball with peers.</p>
<p>Although Junsuk and Junhyuck gradually developed different interests, during the first 3 years in New York, they spent most of their time together watching TV, playing computer games, and playing outside on the playground in our apartment complex. There were a few newcomer Korean students in the complex when living in New York, and Junsuk and Junhyuck often played with them. Their emotional comfort in America was more important than their academic work in the beginning years of immigrant life, so I did not restrict how much they played outside, watched the TV, or played computer games. Due to my own belief that the mass media present one way for Junsuk and Junhyuck to experience different languages and cultures, I supported these activities at home. I also encouraged their independence in both Korea and the United States. One way I encouraged and respected this independence was in allowing them, throughout their middle and high school years, choice in self-selecting elective courses including foreign language and AP courses, along with selecting their own extracurricular activities.</p>

<title>Data Sources</title>
<p>The primary data for this study include my journals that have been written periodically from the siblings’ entry into the United States from South Korea, numerous informal conversations with them, and two formal interviews about their schooling experiences (Grades 4–12) including their relationship with peers and teachers. In terms of the journals, special events, moments of joy, frustration, and curiosity that Junsuk and Junhyuck shared at informal settings including the dinner table, when spending time together on outings, and during any trips, were also recorded. Sometimes, I recorded notes daily, writing short excerpts, and other times I recorded biweekly, writing longer excerpts depending on the nature of the stories. The journal records that were started randomly, casually, and irregularly during the first year became more systematic and organized with my analytical thoughts after I learned the method of qualitative studies during my doctoral work. The journals were kept in a box which has all other artifacts including the siblings’ school records, awards, and personal letters and notes. The data from my journals that were used in this article were confirmed by using a “stimulated recall method” in the formal interviews.</p>
<p>Although the journals and the informal conversations from 2001 to 2010 were extensive and sufficient to develop the patterns of their educational journey, formal interviews with Junsuk and Junhyuck were necessary to triangulate the data. The one-hour-long interviews were conducted and audio-recorded at the end of their high school years in June 2009 with Junhyuck and in June 2010 with Junsuk. I conducted these formal interviews as an “exit” tool since their high school graduation was the final stage for this current study that focuses on the middle and high school years. The first interview was completed at home right after their high school graduation. The first interview questions included more general questions like their view about themselves as immigrant students and their interaction with teachers and peers. The second formal interview, which was conducted 3 months after the first interview, concentrated on their specific experiences that are particularly relevant to the research questions of this study focusing on their view of educational journey as immigrant students.</p>
<p>The secondary data consisted of my classroom observations of each sibling’s classes, observations of extracurricular activities, and their writing projects. The secondary data were also used to triangulate the primary data. In terms of formal classroom observation, I observed Junsuk’s and Junhyuck’s interaction with their teachers and peers over one semester in the middle school in New York when they were in sixth and seventh grade, respectively. The siblings were among the immigrant students whom I observed for my official study. The initial research question that guided the study in their middle school was how the students interacted with their teachers and peers in regular and ESL classrooms. I also observed their interaction with teachers and peers through extracurricular activities outside the classroom from 2001 to 2010. Finally, I used Junsuk’s and Junhyuck’s writing projects as another data source to triangulate the data. Some of these dealt with their experiences in American schools.</p>

<sec id="section8-0002831212443694">
<title>Data Analysis</title>
<p>Data were analyzed by using a narrative inquiry method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0002831212443694">Clandinin &amp; Connelly, 2000</xref>) and constant comparative analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0002831212443694">Strauss &amp; Corbin, 1998</xref>). The purpose of narrative inquiry is to understand the meaning of participants’ lived experiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0002831212443694">Connelly &amp; Clandinin, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0002831212443694">Kim, 2010</xref>). Therefore, it was appropriate to select the method for this study that focuses on the two siblings’ stories about their lived experiences in the United States as immigrants. With narrative inquiry as an overarching method, I employed constant comparative analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0002831212443694">Strauss &amp; Corbin, 1998</xref>) to specifically analyze the siblings’ stories, to code them, and to develop the themes. Constant comparative analysis involves three stages of coding: open, axial, and selective coding. The theoretical frameworks of this study, positioning and identity theory, guided the coding process focusing on the siblings’ educational journey to success.</p>
<p>In the first stage, the primary and secondary data sources including my journals over the 9-year period and the siblings’ interview transcripts were read repeatedly without making any specific categories. Because positioning and identity can be identified through persons’ speech and acts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0002831212443694">Harré &amp; Moghaddam, 2003</xref>), I carefully examined the siblings’ stories and behaviors that I observed through daily activities in and outside of the classroom. The data were extensive, so the key characteristics of reflexive positioning, interactive positioning, and identity as a social construct were particularly helpful to guide my study and develop the themes on the siblings’ academic and social experiences. In open coding, I developed initial categories: “ethnic identity,” “immigrant identity,” “self-positioning,” “others’ positioning,” “interaction with diverse groups.”</p>
<p>In the axial coding stage in which the data are assembled in new ways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0002831212443694">Creswell, 1998</xref>), the central categories of the boys’ academic and social success yielded “identity awareness through situated position,” “identity negotiation,” “adaptation to the dominant culture,” and “external confirmation of talents.” In this process, the codes were reexamined to find whether they were identified as categories or subcategories. This axial coding process was used to remove redundant categories and to organize it into larger categories. For example, the code of “adaptation to the dominant culture” was put into the larger category of “identity negotiation” since the adaptation issue was a part of negotiation to the boys. Finally, because selective coding involves integrating the categories in the axial coding to write a story, I revisited the data for any discrepancies. In this stage, each boy’s case was revisited to ensure trustworthiness to the study.</p>
<p>Since the data are about my own children, I was careful with interpreting data in order to avoid assumptions. I used a rigorous member check process to establish trustworthiness. I presented my findings to Junsuk and Junhyuck to confirm or disconfirm my interpretation of the data. When they did not feel comfortable about some data that encroached upon their privacy, I removed them to ensure ethical compliance. The conversations with them were conducted in both languages, Korean and English. For this article, text was translated into English when conversations had been conducted in Korean. The translations were also member checked by both Junsuk and Junhyuck and were changed or retained based on their comments and agreements. In this article, I selected the specific examples and quotes from my extensive data, which highlight their self-positioning, interactive positioning, and identity negotiations in and outside of the classroom.</p>
<p>The English transcripts in this article might not deliver the accurate nuance of the Korean language that the boys attempted to convey. Although I attempted to accurately translate their dialogues from Korean to English and the translation was member checked by the two siblings, some meaning might have been lost during this translation process due to the lack of a one-to-one relationship between the Korean and English languages.</p>

<sec id="section9-0002831212443694">
<title>Findings</title>
<p>The two adolescent immigrants’ successful academic and social processes involved three important elements: (a) identity awareness through situated position, (b) negotiated identities through adaptation, and (c) external confirmation of unique abilities. The specific examples to support these themes are provided starting with Junsuk in each section, followed by Junhyuck. The examples are not presented in chronological order but are organized based on the key themes. Throughout the finding section, the term <italic>Korean</italic> is used as an ethnic identity rather than a national identity, since ethnic identity connotes more inclusive cultural concepts that include “a sense of shared values, and attitudes” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0002831212443694">Phinney, Horenczyk, Liebkind, &amp; Vedder, 2001</xref>, p. 496).</p>
<sec id="section10-0002831212443694">
<title>Identity Awareness Through Situated Position</title>
<p>Awareness of both siblings’ ethnic identity as Korean was promoted through interactions with peers and teachers, and this awareness influenced the process of their success. The identity of immigrants was given to the siblings when they entered the United States, and they utilized this situated position to participate in learning. Both Junsuk and Junhyuck shared narratives about identity issues in the beginning years of immigrating to America. Given that neither sibling ever discussed being Korean while living in South Korea, it appears that they both became conscious of their identity as Korean in the U.S. educational context while they interacted with teachers and peers. They <italic>became</italic> Korean in the new context.</p>
<p>This finding is evident through Junsuk’s voice. In a conversation with me when he started his junior year in high school, he talked about how his identity as an immigrant promoted his motivation for the academic success:
<disp-quote>
<p>I know I am here as an immigrant. That’s why I felt like working harder. It seemed I was at a disadvantage in the classroom with other kids because I didn’t understand much English and American culture. . . . I don’t think I would have worked harder if I had been in Korea.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This excerpt implicates Junsuk’s identity awareness and his positioning in the new context. When we lived in South Korea, Junsuk did not discuss his determination to work hard due to his identity as Korean. Junsuk’s self-positioning as an immigrant student guided the way in which he thought about his roles and responsibility about his learning in the United States.</p>
<p>However, the awareness of his ethnic identity and active positioning of himself as a hardworking student did not come abruptly. It took the process of an identity dilemma, and this dilemma was developed through some teachers’ and peers’ positioning of him as “different” and “other.” For instance, from the first year in his new elementary school in New York, his marked appearance as Asian appeared to affect his interaction with American peers and teachers. Junsuk described how his difference as Korean was viewed by his peers when he was in fourth grade and described an experience with an American boy:
<disp-quote>
<p>I think they [American peers] know I look different from them. . . . During lunch time at a school cafeteria, one of the American boys cut in front of me. So I said, “don’t cut in.” He responded to me with his frowned face, starting with F words, “Fxxx Korean.”. . . He knows I’m Korean, though I don’t know how he knows it.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Rather than using a common English phrase “Fxxx you,” the American boy used this extended derogatory phrase and specifically positioned Junsuk as Korean, his ethnic identity. When I talked about this datum to Junsuk in an interview, he reflected this past incident and added, “I’d never been so conscious about being a Korean until that thing happened.” His statements illustrate that he was little aware of his ethnic identity before he moved to the United States.</p>
<p>Junsuk’s awareness of his identity was strengthened through interactions with teachers as well. Another noticeable incident that positioned Junsuk as “other” happened in his middle school in Texas just after moving from New York. Although Junsuk successfully graduated from his ESL program in New York, he was assumed to be an ESL student and was not welcome by one of his teachers. After about one month in his new school, he came home and shared his concern with me:</p>
<speech>
<speaker>Junsuk:</speaker>
<p>I don’t think my science teacher likes me.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Researcher:</speaker>
<p>What makes you say that?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Junsuk:</speaker>
<p>On the first day when I entered her class, she said whether I am in the right class. She thought that I am an ESL student who needs to go to ESL class. It’s interesting that she assumes I’m an ESL student by simply looking at my appearance. . . . I also don’t have much attention from her. I often raise my hand to answer her questions during class, but she always points to other students and I have never had a chance to answer her questions. When I turn in my assignments or when I approach her with some questions to ask, she usually avoids me and doesn’t even look at me.</p>
</speech>
<p>This is one of numerous examples that Junsuk shared with me about how he was positioned differently than other students. Although the data do not show why the science teacher treated him this way, it is evident that Junsuk felt that she positioned him as “other.” Junsuk attempted to actively participate in learning activities, but he perceived his teacher’s positioning as limiting his opportunities.</p>
<p>The interesting point is that these negative experiences of being positioned as other actually facilitated Junsuk’s identity development process and his motivation for success in learning. Whenever he shared the hostile experiences with me, he often said, “This is the reason why I should work harder in America.” Based on these comments, the experiences during the years of elementary and middle schools helped him to be aware of his situated identity and promoted his motivation to focus on his studies. Junsuk’s comments illustrate his sense of agency in the new context.</p>
<p>Junhyuck, Junsuk’s older sibling, also demonstrated his identity awareness through situated positions as a Korean immigrant in the United States. Compared to Junsuk, Junhyuck appeared to have more identity issues as shown through coded data when he interacted with his teachers. As I noted earlier, he did not share as many stories as Junsuk at home, but when there were issues related to his identity as Korean, he often expressed his feelings. His identity dilemma was connected to his use of his native Korean language. He shared an anecdote about how he was not allowed to speak his primary language in the classroom when he was in the fifth grade, his first year of U.S. schooling.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I spoke in Korean with my Korean friends, Hyunbin and Changmin, in the classroom because I couldn’t express myself in English at all. But Mrs. Anderson was upset because of my use of Korean. She said that I shouldn’t speak Korean in her ESL classroom. . . . I am Korean, but not being allowed to speak Korean was frustrating. I had to simply sit in the classroom silently.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Junhyuck’s comments illustrate that he felt his Korean language was not acceptable in the American classroom. When I, as a parent, visited his elementary school, the ESL teacher also shared with me that she was concerned about her Korean students because they tended to speak their native language “too much” among themselves. Although the teacher’s intention was to have her students be immersed in English, her approach hurt Junhyuck’s identity as Korean and inadvertently positioned him to be silent in the classroom.</p>
<p>Another example also indicates Junhyuck’s ethnic identity awareness through identity dilemma between being Korean and an immigrant. He spoke with me about how he felt awkward about presenting loyalty to the United States through the daily pledge of allegiance. This example, shared when he was in the fifth grade, shows his identity dilemma due to his positioning as Korean and immigrant.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I kind of did the similar thing in Korean school, pledge to the Korean flag, Taegukki. Now I am here in America. Do I have to do the pledge of allegiance to America? . . . It was awkward to do it. I just stood up and waited until it was over.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>According to Junhyuck, who mentioned “I pride myself for being Korean,” this daily experience in his new American school unintentionally positioned him as uncomfortable. Although the experience was not positively accepted by Junhyuck, it provided him with an opportunity to reconsider his ethnic identity and to be more aware of his positioning in the U.S. setting.</p>

<sec id="section11-0002831212443694">
<title>Negotiated Identities Through Adaptation</title>
<p>Through dynamic positioning in different contexts, both boys learned how to “play” for success. The two adolescents’ identity awareness and dilemma processes in the beginning stages of immigration appeared to be necessary for them to learn how to negotiate their identities. They learned how to position their situated identity as immigrants and to sustain their identity as Korean. This identity negotiation process was developed through active interaction with their peers and effective adaptation to the dominant culture.</p>
<p>For instance, Junsuk talked about this negotiation process through the modification of his first name. Throughout his immigrant life, I noticed that Junsuk talked about the issues regarding his name more often than any other topic. He explained how his Korean name became <italic>Jack</italic> in middle school and how he returned to <italic>Junsuk</italic> at the end of his high school days.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>In the school bus, one of the girls said my Korean name was hard to pronounce and suggested Jack as my name. Everyone around her was so excited about the name, so I couldn’t reject it. I thought, okay, why not if everyone likes the name. That’s how I became Jack. Although I couldn’t connect myself to the English nickname, but I used it until the end of high school. I thought that’s the way they want to call me and I can interact more with them. . . . But I’ll go back to my original name Junsuk for my new teachers and peers in college.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This excerpt shows that Junsuk negotiated his identity by accommodating and using his friends’ new name for him in order to interact in his new environment. It also represents a desire to return to his identity when his interaction with high school peers ended. It was only a negotiated name to be used in that context. In the second formal interview, when I refreshed Junsuk’s memory about this conversation about his name, he added, “Jack still sounds artificial to me.” Despite his feeling of the unnatural name, his positioning of himself as Jack throughout high school enlightens how individuals’ self-positioning is influenced by interactive positioning with others. However, by mentioning the use of his Korean name in college, it also illustrates how his agency is being enacted despite others’ positioning.</p>
<p>Junhyuck’s identity negotiation took a similar process in terms of the name change. Junhyuck also found his way to negotiate his identities by modifying his Korean name to <italic>Jun</italic> for his American peers and teachers. He shared with me that his Korean name Junhyuck was difficult for his peers to pronounce and he adjusted it to Jun. He stated that “Jun is more simple and people might remember me easily.” He also added that his American friends said “Jun is a cool name.” In this case, Junhyuck’s self-positioning through the name change explains the impact of others’ positioning on his action.</p>
<p>Starting with their name modification process, the boys’ identity negotiation was shown through their active participation in class. Instead of hiding their identity as Korean, they began to exhibit it more explicitly. They actively positioned themselves as contributing members by projecting themselves as Korean in the classroom. Through inside- and outside-classroom activities, Junsuk and Junhyuck attempted to challenge the dominant groups’ perception about their cultural and economic superiority. For instance, one day in his freshman year in high school, Junsuk came home and described a situation in his world history class. Mr. King (a strong supporter for Junsuk’s college application) was showing video clips to students.</p>
<speech>
<speaker>Junsuk:</speaker>
<p>In class, we talked about diversity. The interesting thing was when Whites were shown, they were having parties in luxurious houses or having wedding ceremonies at a church. But when the slides showed Asians and Africans, they all depicted how poor they were by showing construction sites, farms, and unsanitary classrooms. So, I raised my hand and asked the teacher whether there are other slides that can accurately portray current images of Asia. When I said that I felt that everyone looked at me doubtfully.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Researcher:</speaker>
<p>What did the teacher say?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Junsuk:</speaker>
<p>He said, are there any new things? So I said I have lived in South Korea for more than 8 years, but it was hard to find unsanitary classrooms. I also mentioned that I saw many homeless people in European countries when I traveled. I just wanted to point out that the slides don’t picture the diverse image of ethnic groups.</p>
</speech>
<p>When Junsuk shared this story, I was curious about what made him question his teacher and the video in front of his class. Junsuk elaborated on his stance:
<disp-quote>
<p>In this country, people seem to understand that all Asian countries are undeveloped and America is the best. I was even asked questions from American kids that whether we [Korean people] have cellular phones. Isn’t it interesting that they don’t know their Samsung and LG phones are the products from South Korea? . . . I just want American people to know that there are other pictures that they don’t see. . . . It’s good that I as an immigrant Korean can talk about the experiences that my American peers don’t have.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Junsuk’s remarks exemplify that he attempted to position in a stance that challenged the preconceived ideas that his teacher and peers have about his native country and other Asian countries. Junsuk resisted accepting the positioning of the dominant culture’s economic superiority by presenting different opinions from his own life experiences as a Korean as well as an immigrant to the United States.</p>
<p>Junhyuck also had many stories about how he negotiated his identities between situated identity as an immigrant and self-identity as Korean. When there were opportunities for class projects, he was willing to present his project regarding Korea. I observed numerous times that he was excited to complete his projects at home when they were related to his ethnic identity. I often observed him spending hours on the Internet exploring his chosen topic. For instance, he conducted his project on the Korean War in the 1950s and presented how it was depicted differently in America and in Korea. He shared the different ideas in the classroom through videos he made. When I asked Junhyuck what encouraged him to do this particular topic, he stated,
<disp-quote>
<p>If I were in Korea, I don’t think I’d be interested in doing this type of project. The reason that I wanted to do the project on Korea is that sometimes I found the wrong information in the social study textbooks about the Korean War and other historical events. I wanted to challenge the limited ideas that American students might have. They don’t seem to know much about other countries and what’s going on around the world. Someone in my sixth grade even asked me “What’s Korea?” He didn’t even know that Korea is a country.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Junhyuck’s voice illustrates that his situated identity as immigrant prompted him to be involved in the project with regard to Korean events. Realizing the lack of knowledge that American students have about Korea and other countries, he attempted to bring his own knowledge to the class and to play a role as a cultural resource by positioning himself as an active member.</p>
<p>Finally, the boys’ identity negotiation came through their adaptation to American culture and system. These adolescents’ adaptation process was an important element behind their academic and social success. By respecting the dominant culture and other cultures as well as sustaining their own primary culture, both boys actively interacted with teachers and peers inside and outside the classroom. For example, the successful adaptation came through their frequent use of multiple languages, understanding of other cultures, and active social interactions with teachers and peers. Junsuk successfully completed AP Spanish in high school, and Junhyuck learned German as well. They attended several activities that were conducted in Spanish or German. What language they chose to use depended on what situation they were in. When I met their Spanish teacher and German teacher during the school open house, both teachers mentioned that the boys were active in learning the language and the culture of the countries studied. Junsuk’s Spanish teacher mentioned that he was “energetic” in learning the Spanish language and culture. She invited him for her wedding ceremony and requested that he play the piano for the event. On his way back home, Junsuk shared with me in the car how it was exciting to practice Spanish with some of the guests. Junhyuck’s German teacher added that he often communicated with him in German via e-mails. Junhyuck successfully finished German IV, which is the highest course level at his high school and ranked sixth in the regional contest on reading comprehension. Moreover, I observed him in communication with a German classmate who came to the United States through an exchange program.</p>
<p>These examples illustrate that Junsuk and Junhyuck positioned themselves as flexible in learning and using a new language in a different context. As noted earlier, when they entered the United States, they had a limited English vocabulary. Through their schooling experiences, they realized that learning English is a tool for learning and succeeding in the mainstream U.S. context. However, they also understood that the Korean language is a tool for learning and for sustaining their cultural identity. By actively learning other foreign languages, they also attempted to understand other cultures. Junsuk talked about the use of languages in different contexts and what it meant to speak multiple languages:
<disp-quote>
<p>It’s good. I can say. . . . Sometimes, it’s better to express certain nuances in certain languages. For example, when I had a chance to go on a trip to Yucatan for church activities, there were many native Korean-speaking friends. We did some games and it was impossible to do the games by translating them in English. There are ways that you need to speak Korean.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>When Junsuk called me on the phone, he usually spoke Korean, but he sometimes switched it to English when his American peers were around in order to let his friends be aware of what he was saying to me. This selectivity of language choices shows his sensitivity about using different languages in different contexts. By using a Korean, an English, and a Spanish dictionary at home, he often shared with me how the languages are different from each other by contrasting specific words across the languages. He often watched TV programs in Spanish and shared what he learned.</p>
<p>Junhyuck also demonstrated how he negotiated his cultural identity as Korean and his situated identity as an immigrant through the use of various languages. I observed that Junhyuck often used the social network Facebook to communicate with his classmates who are American, Indian, German, and Korean. In addition to English, he often wrote in Korean or in German to promote attention and discussion on certain topics including sports, music, and new inventions when chatting online. For instance, he cited a Korean poem, and several followers responded to this. On Facebook, he had more than 400 friends interacting with him through discussions about social events as well as historical events around the world. Junhyuck positioned himself as flexible in employing different languages online as well as in face-to-face conversations.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0002831212443694">
<title>External Confirmation of Unique Abilities</title>
<p>Another important element for the adolescent immigrants’ academic and social success is related to the fact that their peers and teachers acknowledged and confirmed their talents. Both Junsuk and Junhyuck mentioned that they felt they needed to prove that they excelled in certain areas to be recognized by teachers and students. Although they resisted simply accepting the negatively perceived immigrant identity as described in the previous sections, they constructed their new identities as capable students through this recognition by others. This shows that individuals’ positioning of themselves is connected to how others position them. Often, interactive positioning involves individuals’ passive behavior through others’ power that limits the individuals’ actions. However, in this study, there was a positive impact of others’ positioning on individuals’ self-positioning. The boys’ awareness of the recognition of their unique abilities by peers and teachers propelled their motivation for success.</p>
<p>Junsuk’s comments support this analysis. In an informal conversation with me when he was in fifth grade, he stated the reason that he needed to work hard and to exhibit his excellence in the United States.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Mom, immigrants like me can’t be just so-so to be recognized by American people. You have to excel. I noticed that when I am excellent in some areas, then they begin to pay a <italic>little</italic> [his emphasis] attention to me. Otherwise, you can’t get any attention from them. You can’t be mediocre.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>These comments illustrate that Junsuk realized that he needed to excel in academics and other areas to receive American peers’ and teachers’ attention. Furthermore, Junsuk’s finding is triangulated by my observation in his classroom. During my observation of his classroom for a research project during my doctoral program, I noticed that his mainstream peers rarely approached him in the beginning of the semester. However, the interaction pattern between Junsuk and his peers became different after his English language arts teacher brought in a piano, upon which Junsuk played. After his performance in front of his peers, most of them gave him a big round of applause. Some of the American girls, who rarely approached him, ran to Junsuk and shared how fast his fingers moved across the keyboard. I observed Junsuk’s excitement by his smile. Junsuk showed a clear example of how an individual’s reflexive positioning is influenced by others’ positioning.</p>
<p>During one of our interviews after his high school graduation, Junsuk stated, “The piano experience was one of the most exciting moments in my school life.” The experience provided him with an opportunity to feel valued by his teacher and peers, which in turn reinforced his continued practice of the piano. Junsuk was a piano accompanist for musicals throughout his high school days. His musical talent allowed him to gain positive teacher and peer recognition. Junsuk used his musical talent to seek recognition, to develop his identity, and to position himself as confident.</p>
<p>Compared to Junsuk, Junhyuck exhibited different talents in academic subjects; math, science, and physics in particular. Based on my classroom observations, in the beginning of his middle school days, he did not actively interact with American peers, and they also did not approach him. One of his teachers in middle school told me that he was quiet in her classroom and enjoyed reading books alone. The teacher’s comments and perceptions aligned with my observations of Junhyuck at home. However, his math skills appeared to influence the way he interacted with his peers. He was approached by teachers and peers more often within the classroom context after he was confirmed by them as a “math genius” and a “human calculator.”</p>
<p>This finding on interactive positioning is supported by Junhyuck’s comments in the second interview with me. He discussed an experience in seventh grade math class and how it promoted his motivation for math.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>One day, Mr. Baker pointed to me to solve a question. It was about solving unknown variables. I approached to the board and quickly solved it before most of the students. Since that time, I could notice that my peers’ attitudes toward me were different. They often asked me for help to solve the questions. I felt good that my skill was recognized. One of my friends even nicknamed me as a human calculator.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Junhyuck’s focus on math continued during his high school days, and this brought other attention from other peers as well. For example, the Robotics Club members who designed robots for national competitions recruited him as a key member due to his skills in math and physics. Also, the high school teacher who was in charge of school’s math and science teams included him in University Interscholastic League and other academic competitions. As noted earlier, Junhyuck is not as verbal as Junsuk is. However, whenever he was recognized by his teachers and peers, he was excited and talked about what happened in the classroom with me and his brother. The positive interactive positioning is shown through Junhyuck’s actions. It clearly illustrates that the external confirmation of his abilities in math and science promoted his motivation to focus on his learning and to position himself as active throughout his school life.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Through the lens of self-positioning and interactive positioning, I reported on two adolescent immigrants’ educational journey to success and identity negotiation. My positionality as a parent-researcher played an important role in observing the extensive process of the siblings’ positioning and repositioning of themselves to <italic>become</italic> legitimate, confident, and active immigrant members in the U.S. context. While I, as an immigrant, sought to define myself in the new country, both Junsuk and Junhyuck attempted to situate themselves in their own ways and challenged the data of the immigrant youth identity as being passive. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0002831212443694">Ngo (2010)</xref> shares, it is dangerous to simplify immigrants’ identities within discrete dualisms such as good or bad without looking at contexts. Examining the layers of immigrants’ youth experiences through their authentic voices is vital to understand the delicate and complex issues of the students’ success. The findings of the study refine the existing literature regarding immigrant students and provide implications for educators.</p>
<p>First, the findings illuminate the significance of the immigrant students’ identity agency for their academic and social success. Antiessentialist perspectives on <italic>who I become</italic> are shown through the siblings’ agency and active positioning. They knew how to utilize their newfound awareness of their ethnic identity as Korean for their learning. It is noted that this awareness might not be common among immigrant students. Several studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0002831212443694">Cummins, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0002831212443694">Hsieh, 2006</xref>) show that immigrant students often accept the negatively constructed identities and positioning as perceived by others in academic contexts. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0002831212443694">Cummins (1984)</xref>, students tend to hide their primary language and culture because they are afraid of being rejected by teachers and peers. However, the cases of these two siblings illustrate a different phenomenon. This research shows that both siblings are the subjects of their identities, and they lead their school and social lives with their dynamic positioning. Rather than being afraid of the dominant group’s rejection, Junsuk and Junhyuck enacted their agency through the newfound awareness of their identity as Korean and their situated identity as immigrants. It is important to note that they were in identity dilemma and instability in the beginning stage of immigration as shown in the data. However, this dilemma process was necessary since it was transformed to identity awareness, and it facilitated their motivation to focus on learning. They learned how to “play” within the dominant culture and to find their own voice and name within their new U.S. context.</p>
<p>These two adolescent immigrants’ agency is shown through reflexive positioning and interactive positioning. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0002831212443694">Blackledge and Pavlenko (2001)</xref> note, “Often instances of reflexive positioning are contested by others and many individuals find themselves in a perpetual tension between self-chosen identities and others’ attempts to position them differently” (p. 249). This claim demonstrates that self-chosen identity conflicts with others’ positioning in social interactions. Despite the impact of others’ positioning of them as different and other, this study shows that the self-positioning of Junsuk and Junhyuck as competent Koreans living within the United States overpowers others’ positioning that they lived through. They learned how to play out their identity as immigrant Korean. As opposed to accepting the negatively perceived identities as immigrants, Junsuk and Junhyuck constructed and reconstructed their identities as capable students in the new setting.</p>
<p>This study challenges the view of immigrant students as inactive or passive. Much research has often portrayed immigrant students as passive who are under dominant groups’ power based on deterministic perspectives and on social reproduction perspectives. For example, in his seminal work, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0002831212443694">Ogbu (1987)</xref> divided immigrants into two categories as voluntary and involuntary and claimed that immigrants who voluntarily came to America produce more academic achievement and success. The current study, however, shows that the dichotomization of voluntary or involuntary does not fully explain the complexities of individuals’ agency under the given situation. Instead of viewing the cultural and language barriers that they should overcome in order to succeed in the United States as Ogbu claimed, the two boys “played” through the system by respecting the dominant culture but sustaining their own cultural and social identities.</p>
<p>The siblings’ identities to <italic>become</italic> active immigrant students through dynamic positioning and repositioning might not be simply categorized as “oppositional identity” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0002831212443694">Ogbu, 1978</xref>) that is developed through distrust in the mainstream society. They might not be categorized as “nonoppositional identity” either through trust in the dominant society. Given that Junsuk and Junhyuck did not merely follow the language and cultural reference of the mainstream society but negotiated their identities by selecting the references based on different situations, the shifting concept of identity explains the siblings’ actions. This study suggests the issue of immigrant students’ success needs to be approached from the perspective of the individuals’ subjectivity, agency, and resilience to better understand the complexities. The results suggest that it is incomplete to confine the students’ complicated successful experiences within binary categories of model minority or voluntary, which views identity as fixed and stable and overlooks individual aspects.</p>
<p>Another important finding indicates that immigrant students’ identity negotiation follows identity awareness. Although the view of identity as being dynamic in nature has been discussed through several theorists who are against the positivistic concept of identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0002831212443694">Perry &amp; Purcell-Gates, 2005</xref>), the process of identity awareness and negotiation and the relationship between them has not been widely discussed. Through the cases of Junsuk and Junhyuck, this study indicates that when students are aware of who they are, they are able to effectively negotiate their identities between self-chosen identity and assigned identity. It demonstrates that the process of who they <italic>are</italic> leads to the process of who they <italic>become</italic> and vice versa. These identity processes are on a continuum through active positioning. This relationship between identity awareness and negotiation is aligned with the claim of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0002831212443694">Ting-Toomey’s (1993)</xref> identity negotiation theory. Ting-Toomey states that the more confident individuals’ self-identities are, the more they are flexible to interacting with others. As shown in the data, Junsuk and Junhyuck, who had strong self-identification as Korean, actively interacted with teachers and peers through activities inside and outside the classroom. Instead of viewing their ethnic background as a constraint (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0002831212443694">Hsieh, 2006</xref>), these two boys utilized it for their success.</p>
<p>This finding refines the results by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0002831212443694">S. J. Lee (1994)</xref>. Lee found that Korean students worked hard in school because they knew that their parents came to the United States to offer their children educational opportunities. She argued that Korean immigrant students “were motivated by a sense of guilt and responsibility to their families” (p. 427). However, the cases of Junsuk and Junhyuck challenge these findings. For the siblings, who followed their mother for her studies, the responsibility and guilt for their parents’ sacrifices were not the main elements for their achievement. The factors of their success are more related to the siblings’ identity awareness and their negotiation within the new context. They actively worked to become legitimate and active members through dynamic positioning in the mainstream context.</p>
<p>The other main finding of this study is that adaptation to American culture, not assimilation, and accommodation of other cultures promote immigrant students’ success. This study supports the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0002831212443694">Gibson (1988)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0002831212443694">S. J. Lee (2001)</xref> that suggests immigrant students’ academic success is the result of accommodation and acculturation by confirming the dominant culture’s rules while preserving the native cultural value. Although literature encompassing multicultural children’s literature may share stories supporting immigrant students’ assimilation to the dominant culture by losing their linguistic and cultural identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0002831212443694">Yoon, Simpson, &amp; Haag, 2010</xref>), the data from this study indicate that the boys’ success comes from effective adaptation into American systems and from accommodation of other cultures. Rather than putting Korean culture, American culture, and other cultures into separate categories, the boys showed an adaptability and flexibility in knowing how and when to use language and culture for their best social and learning needs. It was not about monocultural or bicultural, but it was about multicultural concepts that Junsuk and Junhyuck used for their learning.</p>
<p>These findings might challenge immigrant parents, educators, and policymakers who attempt to require students to limit or negate their native language use as they begin to acquire English. They might believe assimilation to the dominant culture is the best way that immigrant children can succeed in the United States. This study, however, shows that accommodation and adaptation contribute to immigrant students’ educational and social success. The melting pot (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0002831212443694">Schlesinger, 2002</xref>) that has been the popular assimilation concept in the past does not work for immigrant youths’ success in the 21st century. As immigrant students’ accommodation and adaptation appear to be desirable based on the findings of this study, the mainstream culture also needs to be informed about the students, rather than putting the locus of responsibility on them to change for the culture.</p>
<p>One visible point of this study is that, in this adaptation and accommodation process, mainstream teachers’ and peers’ confirmation of immigrant students’ unique identities and talents is important since they can promote the students’ academic achievement and active social interaction. The case of the two siblings suggests that the element of success requires the individuals’ enacted agency as shown in the first finding section, but it also needs other people’s positioning of them as capable to propel the process. The study indicates that immigrant students’ successes are grounded in basic learning tenets that ensure active interaction and positioning between teachers and students, and among students themselves. It suggests that the complexities of immigrant students’ success require fundamental learning principles of social interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0002831212443694">Vygotsky, 1978</xref>).</p>
<p>In addition, unlike the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0002831212443694">S. J. Lee (1994)</xref> that points out that Korean immigrant students work hard to live up to the model minority standards, this study demonstrates that Junsuk’s and Junhyuck’s motivation comes from the implementation of their special skills through various activities and confirmation of them by their teachers and peers. Based on the different findings between the study by Lee and the current study on the same ethnic group, it is important to examine the issues of immigrant students individually in a given context, instead of dumping all immigrant students, Asians, or Koreans into one single group.</p>
<p>The findings also give us insights for reexamining the view of Asians as a “model minority.” Junsuk and Junhyuck might be in the category of model minority who work hard and excel in academic areas. They might be seen as “typical” middle-class Asians who play the piano (Junsuk) and are good at math and science (Junhyuck). This view, however, might overlook the complex contexts that led them to concentrate not only on their academics but also on their interpersonal social skills, extracurricular activities, and personal talents that all filtered into their success. Although the model minority notion might be perceived as positive in the educational field, the data do not show that Junsuk and Junhyuck received favorable treatment and support because of the fact that they are Asian. Rather, they both encountered unreceptive experiences from some of the teachers and peers due to their appearances as Asian, as shown in the data. They were positioned as others under the mainstream power, and they had to prove that they were capable students. The finding indicates that it is too simplistic just to accept the model minority myth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0002831212443694">Li &amp; Wang, 2008</xref>) without understanding the context. This study shows that there is a gap between the myth and the reality in the classroom. A more nuanced approach to studying immigrant students is crucial to understanding the dynamics of positioning and repositioning with the hidden power of the mainstream culture.</p>

<title>Implications</title>
<p>The narratives of the two immigrant youth help us modify the categories of immigrants broadly and extend our understanding of how their identity is related to the complex process of learning and success. These cases of the two adolescent immigrants provide important implications for research and practice for the greater immigrant population. The United States has a long history of immigration and continues to become more diverse with different socioeconomic, cultural, linguistic, and religious backgrounds, influenced by the impact of globalization on the world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0002831212443694">Hernandez, Denton, &amp; MaCartney, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0002831212443694">Suárez-Orozco, 2001</xref>). According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0002831212443694">Rong and Preissle (1998)</xref>, there is a new immigration pattern: “A larger proportion of the new immigrants are the educated, the skilled, and even the affluent and powerful of other nations” (p. 5). This new phenomenon indicates that America has all different types of immigrant students compared to the past, and these students are now found in almost every corner of the Unites States including urban, suburban, and rural areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0002831212443694">Holdaway &amp; Alba, 2009</xref>). This trend of growing diversity provides implications for researchers and educators who need to prepare to accommodate all of these students’ needs effectively for their academic and social success.</p>
<p>The findings of this study might contribute to the field of education by suggesting three important messages. These suggestions are particularly aimed at teachers and teacher educators in the education program. First, educators may need to focus more on immigrant students’ identity (re)formation and help them position themselves as powerful, which is related to their success of learning. Rather than the “blind” approach that disregards the differences of immigrant students, it is vital to implement a conscious identity-based approach by assisting the students’ awareness of their immigrant positioning. In this process of immigrants’ identity awareness, it is important to promote the positive image of immigration by respecting the students’ native country and culture since it might influence the mainstream students’ positioning of immigrant students as important and their active interaction with their peers.</p>
<p>Throughout U.S. history, immigration has been “the fear that the ‘alien element’ would somehow sabotage the institutions of the country and lead them down the path of disintegration” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0002831212443694">Rong &amp; Preissle, 1998</xref>, p. 11). The mainstream students might be influenced by the mass media, which often portray the image of immigration and immigrant students as negative and deficient. The stereotypic image of immigrants as ones who are in poverty and from underdeveloped countries seems to be prevalent in America based on the responses that Junsuk and Junhyuck received from some teachers and peers. It is crucial for teachers to promote the positive image of immigrant students through the classroom activities that invite the students’ unique experiences and their voices into the classroom. The activities should not be focused only on the common surface cultural elements such as food or traditional festivals, but should help students deepen their understanding of the world by including modern aspects of immigrant students’ culture. Since interactive positioning is important for both immigrant students’ and mainstream students’ learning and success, teachers might consider how to encourage the students to use critical literacy to question the inaccurate image of immigration through critical multicultural education that focuses on differences in a positive perspective.</p>
<p>Second, educators may overgeneralize that language is the primary barrier for immigrant students. This study, however, suggests that language is not the real obstacle for the students. Over the decades, immigrant education has focused on “helping students learn English” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0002831212443694">Rong &amp; Preissle, 2009</xref>, p. 19) without considering other cultural and social aspects. As shown in the data, the two students had limited English in the beginning. However, throughout data analysis, much more discussion was on their identity conflicts. Regarding immigrant status, they shared more stories about discrimination, prejudice, and stereotypes that they had to deal with, rather than language per se. Teachers’ and peers’ attempts to promote immigrant students’ positive sense of themselves by accommodating their different culture are as important as English language learning. When immigrant students perceive that their primary language and culture are respected and appreciated in the mainstream culture, they might feel more accepted to share their identities and use them for their academic and social success. Focusing only on English language learning without considering other cultural and social aspects might be dangerous and incomplete to understand immigrant students’ identity and success. This does not mean that language should be excluded from the discussion of immigrant success. Rather, it should be repositioned and reexamined to better understand the complexities of the students’ academic and social successes.</p>
<p>Third, educators might consider approaching the issues of immigrant students from the perspective of cultural assets that contribute to expanding an individual’s understanding of our diverse world. The long-time view of immigrant children as “problematic other” may stem from the assumption that they simply take what America offers by entering this country, rather than what they offer to American education. Since the focus on the deficits of the students might lead to problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0002831212443694">S. J. Lee, 2001</xref>), more studies that examine the successful process are necessary to challenge the preconceived ideas of immigrant students as problematic and passive. According to the data, Junsuk and Junhyuck actively positioned themselves as cultural resources inside and outside the classroom by presenting different opinions and by challenging the dominant groups’ hidden power. Although they were able to enact their agency under the dominant power, the process was propelled and expanded when teachers’ support for their identity was provided. The boys more actively participated in learning activities when they were recognized by their teachers and peers. The results indicate that an “asset-based approach” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0002831212443694">Borrero &amp; Yeh, 2010</xref>, p. 580) that positions immigrant students as cultural assets is desirable to assist their success. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0002831212443694">Moje and Luke (2009)</xref> claimed, students “come to imagine future positions and their future selves moving within and across those positions” (p. 430). It is about time that teachers focus on immigrant students’ difference as an asset and seek for the specific practices to help the students vision and position themselves as capable and confident.</p>
<p>For this asset-based approach, it is fundamental that teachers utilize “funds of knowledge” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0002831212443694">González, Moll, &amp; Amanti, 2005</xref>) that immigrant students bring to the classroom for all students’ learning. As their mother, I often heard from Junsuk and Junhyuck that they were surprised that many American peers do not seem to have sufficient knowledge of other countries and are even unaware of how little knowledge they have about global perspectives. Given that the United States is one of the most diverse countries with different ethnic groups in the world, this realization from the siblings is an interesting aspect for teachers and educators to consider. Teachers might think about utilizing cultural resources that the immigrant students bring to the classroom by viewing their cultural and linguistic differences as strengths and by allowing them to teach peers. When immigrant students are viewed as invaluable cultural resources and are allowed to bring their identity and culture into the classroom, <italic>all</italic> students might have opportunities to broaden their cultural understandings.</p>
<p>In this process of utilizing immigrant students’ cultural resources, recognizing the various layers of context, culture, language, positioning, and identity is a starting point to avoid preconceived ideas of immigrant students as one single group. As demonstrated by Junsuk and Junhyuck, who, even with the same environment and the same family support, developed their academic and social skills in different ways, each immigrant student works in her or his own way to define who she or he is and to become successful through dynamic positioning. Just as Junsuk and Junhyuck constructed and reconstructed their identities, immigrant youth have those abilities. The key point is that we researchers and educators recognize the importance of identity for the students’ success and support their sense of agency. Indeed, this study suggests that educators listen to individual students’ narratives, observe their positioning, and celebrate their unique abilities.</p>
<p>Finally, educators might consider the ways in which they work with immigrant parents to support immigrant students’ identity. There are no “silver bullet” skills and strategies. The basic premise is to understand the importance of identity for the immigrant students’ educational and social success as shown in this study. Through their children’s classroom activities and assignments, immigrant parents receive implicit and explicit messages from the teachers whether they respect their children’s identity. As Junsuk and Junhyuck did, immigrant students might share with their parents how their teachers approach them. As an immigrant parent myself, it was not difficult to sense what was happening in the classrooms. When the parents perceive that their children’s teachers value their primary culture, they might encourage their children to sustain their cultural identity at home and at school.</p>
<p>Based on my formal and informal observations, many immigrant parents seem to view assimilation to the mainstream culture as the best way for their children’s success in the United States. I often heard from Junsuk and Junhyuck that many of their immigrant peers were discouraged from exhibiting their ethnic identity due to the fear of rejection by peers and teachers. Some parents even encouraged their children to hide their identity by dying their hair to a lighter color or to inhibit their use of their native language. These immigrant parents’ perceptions might have developed from ungrounded or grounded reasons in the mainstream culture. Teachers’ implementation of cultural inclusivity in the classrooms is an important model to show the parents that the students’ cultural identities are appreciated and should be sustained for their success. Although the economic and social situations of the immigrant parents might be different, most parents care for their children and hope for their success (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0002831212443694">Sobel &amp; Kugler, 2007</xref>). It is important for teachers to share their support for the immigrant students’ identity with their parents. They can work together as “partners” to enact the students’ agency by recognizing their unique talents and abilities. The teachers and parents bear the responsibility of supporting immigrant students to reconstruct the context in which they can find their educational and social spheres.</p>
