<p>One may well be forgiven for asking why a moral theologian with no formal training in law has undertaken to review a book on jurisprudence. And it was with considerable hesitation that this reviewer agreed to the task. But it is to the authors’ credit that the content of this book is accessible to those approaching it from other disciplines. Indeed, readers will note the apparent effortlessness with which Barden and Murphy interweave the worlds of jurisprudence, philosophy, and ethics. The book displays a rich understanding of all these traditions; the sheer scope of material that is consulted and the manner of its presentation are impressive, to say the least. The authors rely on many classical and medieval texts throughout the work. One finds here a thorough and informative presentation of these sources. But we are taken beyond this in that the authors show how relevant and applicable these sources remain in contemporary thinking.</p>
<p>The starting point for the book, indeed, the idea that it hinges on, is that of ‘the living law.’ By this the authors mean ‘those judgements and choices that in recurrent kinds of circumstances are generally accepted and approved in a particular community … The living law is the communal moral law, or, even more simply, the communal law’ (p. 3). Barden and Murphy argue that the living law is omnipresent in human communities; it is a set of communally accepted laws or rules on how best to live in right relationship. It differs from how we more commonly think of law today. We tend to associate law(s) with state law/positive law, conventional law, international law, and so on. By contrast, the living law ‘did not come into existence by any process of formal consideration, debate or decree’ (p. 3). Its existence arises in a more gradual and gentle way, and if/ when change occurs, it tends to occur slowly and incrementally. The living law represents what we might today call the moral tradition of a people. It includes those values and actions that a community has come to see as beneficial and worthy, and by implication those that are deemed to be inappropriate. Therefore, the living law is not always written down, although it may come to be in time (in what we might call state law). The authors believe that it is from this living law or ‘communal moral law’ that our sense of justice emerges—justice understood here to be the constant and enduring will to give to each what is their due (p. 5).</p>
<p>The concept of justice is then explored in detail. Chapters three and four in particular provide an excellent account of the different types (or ‘species’ as Aquinas would have termed it) of justice. Barden and Murphy distinguish between natural justice and conventional justice, and then proceed to discuss distributive, rectificatory, and reciprocal justice. The relationship between morality and law is explored in chapter seven. Natural law, rights, law and the force of law/coercion are discussed in chapters eight, nine, and ten respectively. An enormous amount of material is covered throughout these chapters, but I wish to focus on some of it in greater detail.</p>
<p>Chapter eight explores the idea of natural law and its place within the broader analysis of law. The authors make clear their position from the outset; ‘we emphasize that the terms “natural law” or “natural justice” are never used in this book to mean the divine law believed by religious Jews, Christians, and Muslims to have been revealed. We emphasize also that these terms are never used in this book to mean a set of inbuilt infallible moral axioms from which appropriate moral or legal rules may be deduced’ (p. 189). That being the case, how do they understand natural law, and what relevance has it for law more generally? They suggest that the natural law is not in fact a superior set of moral axioms. Rather, it ‘refers primarily to the moral experience of being human, or to put it another way, to the responsibility intrinsic to being human’ (p. 190). That takes us close to the Catholic moral/philosophical tradition which does believe that there are objective moral truths discoverable through human reason, albeit that these ‘primary precepts’ remain general. The major contribution of this chapter lies in the fact that Barden and Murphy emphasize strongly the human, rational, reflective aspect of natural law. This dimension of the natural law does not always receive the attention that it deserves in the Catholic tradition, especially if one is studying sexual or bio-medical ethics (where we find a more physicalist Ulpian-based interpretation). And yet, this chapter demonstrates the importance of human reason reflecting on what it is to be human in order to discover what responsible living requires of us. ‘By “moral experience of being human” we mean that, as humans, we must, constantly and always, ask the moral or ethical question: What am I to do?’ (p. 190). And so, Barden and Murphy explain that ‘Natural law in humans arises from the human need and ability to discern what is good and bad. The first principle—that we, who are naturally social animals, are responsible for how we live and what we do—means that we are required to decide responsibly’ (p. 190).</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, the second half of the chapter examines St Thomas Aquinas’s contribution to natural law thinking. Here we find a very informative account of the Thomistic approach to natural law. We are reminded of the classical definition of law found in the <italic>Summa</italic>: law is the ‘reasonable command of the person who has care of the community, ordered to the common good, and promulgated’ (p. 198). Aquinas, of course, situates his theory of natural law within a broader understanding of the other ‘types’ of law, namely the eternal law, the divine law, and positive law. Barden and Murphy unpack each of these in turn and explain their interrelationship. However, they also note (earlier in chapter one) that most jurisprudential scholarship confines its focus to Aquinas’s treatise on Law (<italic>Summa Theologiae</italic>, Ia IIae, Questions 90–97) making little or no reference to what he says about Justice. That being the case, the comprehensive account of justice found in other chapters throughout the book becomes all the more important.</p>
<p>Students of moral theology are familiar with the debate concerning the relationship between faith and morality. Religious approaches to morality must contend with the question of whether something is good because commanded by God, or whether it is good and therefore commanded. For example, are the Ten Commandments correct ethical directives on how to live simply because God imparted them to His people, or are they correct irrespective of their being commanded? Most commentators today agree that something is good/right not because an authority (even God) has said so but because it is good in itself. Indeed, Aquinas makes this very point. Barden and Murphy explain: ‘According to St Thomas, the precepts commanding how humans ought to treat one another in the Decalogue may be understood as the clarification of what could be discovered. The precepts, revealed in the divine law, were commanded because they were right, and could be discovered by natural reason to be right’ (p. 197). Thus, for St Thomas, it seemed obvious that God commanded acts that were intrinsically good and right and he forbade acts that were intrinsically bad. But these acts are good/bad in themselves, and although God’s revelation helps us to see this, human reason could discover this through the process of critical reflection on what it means to be human, social, and relational.</p>
<p>One has barely begun to touch the surface of what is contained in this book. The scope of its content, the depth of research, and the comprehensive way in which the material is presented are to be commended. It certainly makes an important contribution to jurisprudence. But it is of wider interest, and the issues dealt with here are of concern to all people intent on living ‘the good life.’ Students and scholars from, in particular, law, philosophy, theology, and political science will find this a helpful, challenging, and informative read.</p>
