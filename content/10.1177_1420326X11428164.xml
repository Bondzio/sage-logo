<abstract>
<p>There has been an increasing concern on indoor air quality in recent years due to the possible harmful effects to human health. Indoor air pollution as a result of using natural gas for cooking and heating is a common health threat, particularly for women and young children. Therefore, quantification of the type and emission levels of these pollutants is necessary in order to mitigate and monitor the emissions. Computational fluid dynamics (CFDs) can be used to model airflow and dispersion within buildings of complex geometry and layout. In the present paper, a CFD analysis is performed to determine the concentration of indoor air quality for a typical one-floor building in order to determine the optimal locations of monitoring sensors. According to this study, placing the monitoring sensors based on the maximum concentrations of the individual contaminant does not entirely overcome the problems, as the concentrations of different hazardous pollutants cannot be added. Moreover, high concentration with low duration of exposure is not a good candidate for placing the monitoring system. A risk-based methodology is proposed to determine the optimal location for the monitoring systems. Different risk management strategies are also considered as a part of the methodology to reduce the exposure risk of indoor contaminants.</p>

<sec id="sec1-1420326X11428164"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Early detection of toxic contaminants in indoor environments is necessary to protect the building’s occupants from the toxic effects. In the new century, green building design (GBD) may be seen at the confluence of emergency societal benefit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1420326X11428164">1</xref>] and all attempts lead to use resources intelligently in the design of health-promoting environments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1420326X11428164">2</xref>].</p>
<p>People spend 90% of the time indoors and most of their working hours in an office environment; illustrating the significance and the need of indoor air quality (IAQ) evaluation and to assess the effect on public health. Due to the poor dispersion and stagnant region formation, indoor environments can have higher levels of toxic contaminants than outside environments. Poor IAQ may decrease the occupant’s productivity and increase the cancer risk. Long-term exposure may cause clinical effect that includes respiratory diseases. In Xuanwei County of China, 25.3 per 100,000 of female mortality was attributed to lung cancer due to heavy smoke from indoor burning of coal and wood for cooking and heating purposes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1420326X11428164">3</xref>]. Therefore, it is essential to develop indoor air monitoring systems that can detect toxic emissions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1420326X11428164">4</xref>]. Generally, these monitoring systems are placed where the maximum contaminant concentrations are found [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1420326X11428164">5</xref>]. However, considering the effects of different contaminants released from various sources simultaneously, locating the optimum place for the monitoring systems is not an easy task. Furthermore, since the concentrations of hazards cannot be added, this issue is further complicated.</p>
<p>Natural gas is used for cooking and heating purposes in many countries. More than half of the British houses and U.S. residents use natural gas as the cooking fuel. It is reported that the use of gas stove has led to increased asthma, respiratory illness and impaired lung function, particularly in young women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1420326X11428164">6</xref>]. The Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC) has recommended to substitute indoor gas appliances and combustion sources with electrical appliances to decrease the indoor air pollution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1420326X11428164">7</xref>]. However, natural gas is still a convenient and economic source of heating and cooking in many countries and the effects of the released contaminants need to be better studied.</p>
<p>Detailed information on air distribution, such as air flow patterns, temperatures, humidity, turbulent intensity and pollution concentrations are required to evaluate the IAQ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1420326X11428164">8</xref>]. Application of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) to simulate IAQ is a more common approach since the 1970s [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1420326X11428164">9</xref>].</p>
<p>Modelling the human exposure to indoor air pollution has been studied for many years. However, the effects of human activity on indoor pollutants exposure integrated with risk have not been studied well. The use of risk assessment as the basis of monitoring the IAQ helps to evaluate the human health risk of the indoor contaminants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1420326X11428164">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1420326X11428164">11</xref>]. A risk-based approach places monitoring sensors at locations with the greatest risk to human health.</p>
<p>This paper provides a methodology of combining a CFD to study contaminants dispersion released by natural gas use with a risk-assessment framework to determine the optimum locations of monitoring sensors. The paper also explores different strategies of risk management using the proposed CFD and risk-based approach.</p>

<sec id="sec2-1420326X11428164"><title>Risk-Based Methodology for Designing IAQ Monitoring System</title>
<p>IAQ deterioration may cause severe adverse health effects to the occupants, as mentioned earlier. These primary and main effects vary from simple coughing to respiratory and cardiovascular illnesses. However, it can produce secondary effects such as chronic obstructive pulmonary and lung cancer. To maintain acceptable air quality, continuous monitoring of the IAQ is required to detect the concentration of contaminants and assess risk.</p>
<p>A risk-based methodology for IAQ monitoring design is illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1420326X11428164">Figure 1</xref>. This methodology has two phases: risk assessment and risk management. The risk assessment phase consists of dispersion modelling, exposure assessment, dose-response assessment and risk estimation. The risk management phase identifies the optimal location of sensors and evaluates the need to consider ventilation. This paper presents a detail methodology with a case study. The case study is developed to apply the risk-based methodology for the IAQ monitoring system.

</p>
<sec id="sec3-1420326X11428164"><title>Dispersion Modelling</title>
<p>The air flow pattern and contaminants dispersion for a typical building after the release of toxic contaminants is modelled using a CFD tool FLACS. The risk-assessment framework is then adopted as the approach for monitoring the system design. A brief description of the modelling tool and the building model used in this study is presented in subsequent sections.</p>
<sec id="sec4-1420326X11428164"><title>Dispersion Modelling Using FLACS.</title>
<p>The FLACS CFD software [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1420326X11428164">12</xref>] is used to model the dispersion of contaminants of concern. Using a finite volume method in a Cartesian grid, the concentration equations of mass, momentum and enthalpy are solved using FLACS. For turbulence modelling, FLACS uses a Reynold-Averaged Navier–Stoke (RANS) approach based on the standard <italic>k</italic>-ε model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1420326X11428164">13</xref>]. Obstacles with small details play a significant role during indoor dispersion of pollutants and as such the representation of these details is a key aspect of dispersion modelling. A distributed porosity concept is used in FLACS dispersion simulation as obstacles are represented by area and volume porosity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1420326X11428164">14</xref>].</p>
<p>Compared to other dispersion models, FLACS has advantages such as better predictions that have been validated for different dispersion scenarios. The distributed porosity concept to create complex geometries and the Cartesian grid result in more rapid solutions in large and complex facilities when compared to conventional models. Additionally, the well-established turbulence model (<italic>k</italic>−ε) compared to other alternative models makes FLACS more appropriate to simulate dispersion phenomena [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1420326X11428164">15</xref>].</p>
<p>CFLC and CFLV are Courant–Friedrich–Levy numbers based on the sound velocity and the fluid flow velocity, respectively. By choosing the appropriate values of CFLC and CFLV, the sound waves and the fluid flow propagate a limited distance in each time step; the average control volume length multiplied by the value of CFLC and CFLV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1420326X11428164">12</xref>]. In the current study, to control time steps, the CFLC and CFLV numbers were assumed to be 20 and 2. The simulation volume of 14 m × 14 m × 6 m was selected with a grid size of 0.2 m, obtained as an optimum value through a sensitivity analysis. The time of simulation was chosen as 7,200 s for leak points and to continue air supply that was operating during the entire simulation. There was no absorption of emissions by obstacles as the porosity of all objects was considered to be 1.</p>

<sec id="sec5-1420326X11428164"><title>Building Model.</title>
<p>A typical one-storey apartment is selected as the prototype building for this study as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1420326X11428164">Figure 2</xref>.

</p>
<p>The building comprises of a dining and main hall area, bathroom, kitchen and bedrooms. The height of the rooms is 3 m. The mechanical air supplier in the apartment (A1) supplies a flow rate of 0.85 m<sup>3</sup> h<sup>−1</sup> throughout the building. There is a stove in the kitchen (L1) and heaters are located in the main hall and bedrooms which use natural gas (L2, L3 and L4).</p>

The effect of indoor contaminants released from the gas stove on an occupant’s health is evaluated using this approach. The four steps of framework, as mentioned in the following, are carried out to estimate the risk.</p>

<sec id="sec9-1420326X11428164"><title>Exposure Assessment.</title>
<p>The exposure is a function of the time spent in different locations in the house. Time spent in the bathroom and kitchen is adopted from USEPA’s National Human Activity Pattern Survey (NHAPS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1420326X11428164">19</xref>], and for the living room and bedrooms are taken from previous researches [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1420326X11428164">20</xref>]. Time distribution by an individual at various locations in the house is illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1420326X11428164">Figure 3</xref>. Based on available data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1420326X11428164">20</xref>], it is assumed that an occupant spends a maximum of 21 h inside the building and only 3 h outside.
<fig id="fig3-1420326X11428164" position="float"><label>Fig. 3.</label><caption><p>Time spent by an individual during a day.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1420326X11428164-fig3.tif"/></fig>
</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec10-1420326X11428164"><title>Dose-Response Assessment.</title>
<p>Dose-response assessment connects the likelihood and severity of the damage to human health from exposure to risk agents. The relationship between the level of exposure and the intensity of the resulting adverse health effects is the basis for the quantitative dose-response model. The lowest value on the dose-response curve is called the threshold dose. The American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH) establishes threshold limit values (TLVs), which demonstrate the threshold doses. TLV shows the concentration that normally has no adverse effects by inhaling over a defined period of time. TLV-TWA shows the time–weight average for a normal 8-h workday or a 40-h work week to which a person can be exposed without adverse effects.</p>
<p>The TLV-TWA for two contaminants of concern (NO<sub>2</sub> and CO) evaluated in this study is taken from ACGIH and are 5.6 and 57 mg·m<sup>−3</sup>, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1420326X11428164">21</xref>].</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec11-1420326X11428164"><title>Risk Estimation.</title>
<p>By integrating exposure and toxicity assessment, the probability of negative effects is assessed. Risk is calculated for individual chemicals and then summed for a mixture of chemicals (considering additive property of risk).</p>
<p>The exposure concentration is calculated by using the concentration in different locations of the building and multiplying by the probability that a person will be in the specific location. The hazard quotient (HQ) is calculated by taking the ratio of exposure chemical concentration and TLV-TWA for each chemical of concern, as represented by Equation (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula1-1420326X11428164">1</xref>).
<disp-formula id="disp-formula1-1420326X11428164"><label>(1)</label><mml:math xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="block" id="mml-disp1-1420326X11428164"><mml:mrow><mml:mtable><mml:mtr><mml:mtd columnalign="right" columnspan="1"><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>HQ</mml:mtext><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>Exosure</mml:mtext><mml:mi> </mml:mi><mml:mtext>Concentration</mml:mtext></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>TLV</mml:mtext><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:mtext>TWA</mml:mtext></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow></mml:mtd></mml:mtr><mml:mtr><mml:mtd columnalign="right" columnspan="1"><mml:mrow><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>ConcentrationTime</mml:mtext><mml:mi> </mml:mi><mml:mtext>spend</mml:mtext><mml:mo>/</mml:mo><mml:mtext>BW</mml:mtext></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>TLV</mml:mtext><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:mtext>TWA</mml:mtext><mml:mo>/</mml:mo><mml:mtext>BW</mml:mtext></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow></mml:mtd></mml:mtr></mml:mtable></mml:mrow></mml:math><graphic alternate-form-of="disp-formula1-1420326X11428164" xlink:href="10.1177_1420326X11428164-eq1.tif"/></disp-formula>
</p>
<p>TLV−TWA is the time–weight average for a normal 8-h workday, BW is the body weight</p>
<p>As a common practice in human exposure assessment, different chemical exposure hazards are often considered additive in nature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1420326X11428164">22</xref>]. This fact is used in driving threshold exposure limit. HQ is calculated by adding the HQ of each chemical of concern, as demonstrated in Equation (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula2-1420326X11428164">2</xref>). The HQ is a unit-less ratio that provides screening risk criteria. As it is a unit-less ratio, it can be added for all the individually exposed chemicals to assess the overall risk.

<sec id="sec12-1420326X11428164"><title>Risk Management</title>
<p>After defining HQs, these HQs are evaluated against the criteria to determine the acceptability of risk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1420326X11428164">23</xref>]. Risk management integrates these details back again into an efficient and enforceable policy to decrease the risk. Although risk assessment is a scientific exercise, risk management also involves technical, economic, social and legal realities. To reduce the risk, natural ventilation is considered close to four sources considered in the present modelling scenario. While this study considered the natural ventilation systems as a part of risk-based methodology, mechanical ventilation is not considered. It should be noted that use of mechanical ventilation (fans and hood) to decrease the final risk to acceptable level cannot be neglected as it may be an important part of risk management strategy.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec13-1420326X11428164"><title>Results and Discussion</title>
<p>The concentration of NO<sub>2</sub> and CO released from different sources, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1420326X11428164">Figure 2</xref>, was modelled by using FLACS. The vectors of velocity for the developed model are demonstrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1420326X11428164">Figure 4</xref>.
<fig id="fig4-1420326X11428164" position="float"><label>Fig. 4.</label><caption><p>Velocity vectors showing the air pattern.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1420326X11428164-fig4.tif"/></fig>
</p>
<p>As may be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1420326X11428164">Figure 4</xref>, the air supplier at the right side of the building produces the high velocity air and is the main source of contaminant dispersion inside. This higher velocity compared to the surrounding environment produces the negative pressure gradient (entrainment). The vortexes that can be seen on the sides are the result of this negative pressure gradient. As the air heats the sidewalls, recirculation of the air occurs, which can be observed by following the changes in the pattern of velocity. This air recirculation accelerates the local dispersion of the contaminants.</p>
<p>The contaminants of concern were released from the four sources, as highlighted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1420326X11428164">Figure 2</xref>, after 2 h resulted in concentration contours as illustrated in Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1420326X11428164">5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1420326X11428164">6</xref>. The contaminants concentration contours were situated 1.5 m from the ground surface of the building. This is an average height for human inhalation when standing on the floor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1420326X11428164">3</xref>].

</p>
<p>These contours show the boundary of contaminant concentrations dispersed within the building through air circulation. Concentrations near the sources are high and dispersed through the building after 2 h.</p>
<p>HQs are calculated based on these concentrations and exposure times of an individual in different places of the building during a day using the methodology mentioned earlier. The risk contours for the two contaminants of concern were drawn as illustrated in Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-1420326X11428164">7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-1420326X11428164">8</xref>.

</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-1420326X11428164">Figure 7</xref> outlines HQ for CO and highlights that the left corner of the main hall and corners of the bedrooms have values more than 1, representing high-risk area in this building. Other places are not major causes of concern. HQs for released NO<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-1420326X11428164">Figure 8</xref>) exceeded the acceptable criteria throughout the floor.</p>
<p>The monitoring system design was determined by assessing the additive characteristic of the risks. After determining the HQs of inhaling CO and NO<sub>2</sub> for each point in this building separately, the HQs for each point were summed to calculate the final value of HQ. This would enable calculation of the final inhalation risk of CO and NO<sub>2</sub> at the same time. The additive final values of HQs for each point in the building are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-1420326X11428164">Figure 9</xref>.

</p>
<p>As illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-1420326X11428164">Figure 9</xref>, three different regions (A, B, C) have the highest HQs compared to other regions. For this release scenario, these three regions are the best candidates for locating the monitoring system. Although, the concentrations of CO and NO<sub>2</sub> individually were not highest in these positions, the cumulative risk was assessed to be the highest at these points.

</p>
<p>The additivity characteristic of risk for different chemical components is one of the unique characteristics that help to evaluate the effect of released contaminants on human health. Moreover, using the exposure duration in different areas when calculating the risk takes not only the contaminants’ concentration into consideration but also the dose that reaches to human body. This is the priority of risk-based decision-making compared to decisions based on the concentrations to locate the monitoring systems. Considering the ventilation at the four identified sources that produced the pollutants, the final values of HQs were significantly decreased. Although, the amount of HQs was not less than one, there was approximately 70% reduction in HQ at the risk point A, which was defined as the most hazardous location. For this specific scenario, mechanical ventilation would be required to maintain a healthy living environment.</p>

<p>Evaluating the IAQ is required as people spend most of their time indoors. Monitoring system designed to detect contaminant concentrations and alarm critical conditions is critical to maintain IAQ. As various chemicals can be released from different indoor sources at the same time, this monitoring system should not be placed in specific areas based on one individual contaminant. Furthermore, locating the sensors at the maximum concentration may not be the best approach as occupants may spend a small percentage of their time in that area. Integrating the CFD to model the contaminants dispersion within the building with the risk-assessment framework helps to overcome these problems. The exposure durations at different areas are included in assessing the risk value. Additivity characteristics of risk are used to consider the simultaneous effects of various contaminants. Modelling the two contaminants released from burning the natural gas in a prototype model considered in this paper demonstrated that the high-risk areas are not necessarily the places of the maximum concentrations for each contaminant individually. Moreover, considering natural ventilation beside the released sources in the present modelling scenario helps to reduce risk by 70%. Although, the reduction is significant, the risk is still not acceptable. The authors recommend the use of mechanical ventilations, such as fans and hoods, to further reduce risk and maintain a safe indoor environment. This approach is very important to develop risk management strategies in an indoor environment. Use of the present approach would help to develop an efficient monitoring system to speed the determination of indoor toxic concentrations and IAQ.</p>
