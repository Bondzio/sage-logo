<abstract>
<p><bold>Objective:</bold> To investigate possible gender differences in patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and without significant stenoses on coronary angiography (CAG) regarding prognosis and use of secondary preventive medication.</p>
<p><bold>Design:</bold> Nationwide register-based cohort study.</p>
<p><bold>Patients:</bold> By compiling data from Danish registries, we identified 20,800 patients hospitalized with AMI during 2005–2007. We included the 834 women and 761 men without significant stenoses on CAG who were discharged and alive after 60 days.</p>
<p><bold>Main outcome measures:</bold> All-cause mortality, recurrent AMI, and redeeming a prescription for a lipid-lowering drug, beta-blocker, clopidogrel, or aspirin within 60 days of discharge.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> During follow-up, 97 women and 60 men died, resulting in a crude female/male hazard ratio (HR) of 1.51 (95% CI 1.09–2.08). After adjustment for age, time-period, and comorbidity, the gender difference was attenuated (HR 1.22, 95% CI 0.86–1.72). AMI recurrence was experienced by 28 women and 29 men with a female/male HR 0.88 (95% CI 0.52–1.48). After multivariable adjustment results were similar (HR 0.84, 95% CI 0.50–1.43). More women than men redeemed a prescription for lipid-lowering drugs with no differences in other medication. In the adjusted models lipid-lowering drugs, beta-blockers, clopidogrel, and aspirin were all redeemed equally with odds ratio (OR) 1.25 (95% CI 0.99–1.59), OR 1.10 (95% CI 0.88–1.37), OR 1.09 (95% CI 0.88–1.34), and OR 1.13 (95% CI 0.90–1.42), respectively.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Our study shows that in a population of patients with a first admission for AMI and no significant stenoses on CAG, women share the same prospects as men regarding long-term prognosis and the extent of secondary preventive medical treatment.</p>

<p>Ischaemic heart disease constitutes a major cause of death in both women and men, but the disease differs between the sexes regarding various issues.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1741826711416046">1</xref></sup> Women with acute coronary syndrome have been found to be less invasively examined, diagnosed, and treated than their male counterparts.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1741826711416046">2</xref></sup> Furthermore, there may be an under-treatment regarding secondary preventive medication of women with acute coronary syndrome or stable angina pectoris, suggesting a higher threshold for treatment in women.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1741826711416046">3</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1741826711416046">6</xref></sup> Among women with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) a larger proportion present without significant coronary stenoses than among men.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1741826711416046">7</xref></sup> Little is known about gender differences in long-term prognosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1741826711416046">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1741826711416046">8</xref></sup> and to what extent both women and men receive the recommended secondary preventive medical treatment in this subgroup of patients with AMI.</p>
<p>In a nationwide population of patients with confirmed AMI without significant stenoses on coronary angiography (CAG), we investigated prognosis with respect to AMI, all-cause mortality, and secondary preventive medical treatment, hypothesizing that women have a poorer prognosis and receive the recommended secondary preventive medical treatment to a lesser extent than do men.</p>

<sec id="sec2-1741826711416046" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title>
<sec id="sec3-1741826711416046"><title>Study population</title>
<p>The study was designed as a nationwide register-based cohort study of all patients hospitalized with AMI (International Classification of Diseases (ICD) 10 codes I21 and I22) in Denmark from 1 January 2005 to 31 December 2007.</p>
<p>We included patients aged 30–90 years with a first time admission with AMI as the primary discharge diagnosis who were examined with CAG within 60 days of admission and who were found to have no significant stenoses. A significant stenosis was defined as a stenosis occluding more than 50% of the cross-sectional area of a major epicardial vessel.</p>
<p>All patients with a previous hospital admission for AMI (since 1978) were excluded in order to study only patients with first admission with AMI. The definition of AMI in Denmark follows the guidelines of the European Society of Cardiology. The diagnosis of AMI has been validated by comparison with results from the MONICA database, showing sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value of 90–95%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1741826711416046">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1741826711416046">10</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-1741826711416046"><title>Data collection</title>
<p>All residents in Denmark have a unique personal civil registration number enabling linkage of data between nationwide registries. Information on admissions and comorbidity was obtained from the Danish National Patient Registry, which holds information on all admissions to Danish hospitals since 1978. Each admission is registered by one primary diagnosis and, if appropriate, one or more secondary diagnoses according to the ICD before 1994 (the 8th revision, ICD-8) and since 1994 (the 10th revision, ICD-10). The diagnoses registered in the Danish National Patient Registry are the final discharge diagnoses.</p>
<p>Information on the extent of coronary artery disease (CAD) among patients examined by CAG was obtained from the Danish Heart Registry, which includes all invasive examinations and procedures performed at Danish hospitals since the year 2000. The data from the Danish Heart Registry have been validated elsewhere.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1741826711416046">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>Information on redeemed prescriptions for relevant medications according to Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) classification groups was obtained from the Danish Register of Medicinal Product Statistics, which due to partial reimbursement policies is a precise register.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1741826711416046">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>Information on level of education, level of income, and civil status was obtained from Statistics Denmark. Information on the patient’s vital status was obtained from the Danish Civil Registration System, where all residents in Denmark are registered from birth or time of immigration.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-1741826711416046"><title>Baseline and explanatory variables</title>
<p>We included age, length of hospitalization, comorbidity, concomitant medication, and socioeconomic status as baseline variables.</p>
<sec id="sec6-1741826711416046"><title>Age</title>
<p>The age of each patient was recorded as discrete variables but treated as a categorical variable in all analyses and was divided into 10-year intervals in the regression models in order to obtain estimates for different age groups.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec7-1741826711416046"><title>Length of hospitalization</title>
<p>The length of hospitalization was recorded as a discrete variable and tested in regression models when appropriate.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec8-1741826711416046"><title>Comorbidity</title>
<p>Primary and secondary diagnoses, both at index admission and at admissions up to 1 year prior to the index admission, were used to define comorbidity. Diagnoses of congestive heart failure, cardiogenic shock, dysrhythmia, and pulmonary oedema gave indications of the severity of heart disease. Diagnoses of malignancy, diabetes with complications, cerebrovascular disease, acute renal failure, and chronic renal failure indicated comorbidity. ICD-10 coding was used in accordance with the work of So et al.,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1741826711416046">13</xref></sup> who validated the ICD-10 codes based on the Ontario MI mortality predictive rule<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1741826711416046">14</xref></sup> for the aforementioned comorbidities as predictors for death within 30 days and 1 year of AMI. As a proxy for smoking, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) was included independently in the model (ICD-10; J40–J44, J47).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec9-1741826711416046"><title>Concomitant medication</title>
<p>A patient was defined as being treated with a relevant drug by having redeemed a prescription for that drug within the 6 months before index admission. Each class of drugs was defined using the ATC classification system: antihypertensives (C02; C07; C08; C09), loop-diuretics (C03C, C03EB), beta-blockers (C07), calcium antagonists (C08), antidiabetics (A10), lipid-lowering drugs (C10AA), vitamin K antagonists (B01AA), clopidogrel (B01AC04), aspirin (B01AC06; N02BA01), and COPD medications (R03).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec10-1741826711416046"><title>Socioeconomic status</title>
<p>Three parameters were used to describe each patient’s socioeconomic status: (1) civil status: living alone or living with others; (2) the individual patient’s highest educational level distinguishing between three groups: short, medium, and long education; and (3) the individual patient’s annually available family income after tax – three groups were defined: high, medium, and low income.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec11-1741826711416046"><title>Year of admission</title>
<p>To adjust for temporal trends in morbidity and mortality, all analyses were adjusted for calendar year as a categorical variable.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="sec12-1741826711416046"><title>Outcomes</title>
<p>We investigated gender-related differences for two outcomes: (1) clinical endpoints of all-cause mortality and recurrence of AMI from day 60 of index AMI; and (2) secondary preventive medical treatment within 60 days of index AMI.</p>
<sec id="sec13-1741826711416046"><title>Death and recurrence of AMI</title>
<p>We estimated possible gender differences in all-cause mortality and recurrence of AMI from day 60 after index AMI and 3 years forward. Events occurring before day 60 were regarded as directly related to the index admission. Patients hospitalized for more than 60 days were excluded from analyses as an event in this group would also be directly related to the index admission.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec14-1741826711416046"><title>Secondary preventive medical treatment</title>
<p>We estimated possible gender differences in the secondary preventive medical treatment following index AMI regarding beta-blockers, lipid-lowering drugs, clopidogrel, and aspirin. A patient received the relevant drug if a prescription for that drug had been redeemed within 60 days of index admission.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="sec15-1741826711416046"><title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p>Data on continuous variables are presented as mean and standard deviation if following a normal distribution, otherwise as median and interquartile range. Discrete data are presented as frequencies and percentages. When comparing baseline data we used Student’s <italic>t</italic>-test to compare continuous data if normally distributed, and non-parametric Mann–Whitney <italic>U</italic>-test otherwise. χ<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1741826711416046">2</xref></sup> test was used to compare discrete data and Fisher’s exact test was used if the expected number of observations in a group was below 5.</p>
<p>We analysed recurrence of AMI using a competing risks model with all-cause mortality as a competing risk.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1741826711416046">15</xref></sup> All-cause mortality was analysed by age-adjusted survival estimates using Cox proportional hazards regression. Possible gender differences for both outcomes were investigated using Cox proportional hazards regression, both univariable and multivariable. In the multivariable analyses, age, year of admission, and comorbidities were included along with sex in a stepwise manner regardless of their significance level.</p>
<p>We used uni- and multivariable logistic regression to analyse possible gender differences in the use of secondary preventive medication. In the multivariable analyses, age, year of admission, and comorbidities were included along with sex in a stepwise manner.</p>
<p>Model assumptions – interactions, collinearity, and proportional hazards – were found valid unless otherwise indicated. Interactions between sex and all other explanatory variables were addressed by including product terms in the regression models. Collinearity was assessed by including all variables in a linear regression model and testing for tolerance. Finally, the proportional hazards assumption was assessed graphically by log–log survival curves and by testing Schoenfeld’s residuals for time-dependency. All hypothesis tests had a two-sided significance level of 0.05. All analyses were performed with STATA Statistics/Data analysis, MP 11.0 (StataCorp, Texas, USA).</p>

<sec id="sec16-1741826711416046"><title>Ethics</title>
<p>The Danish National Board of Health, the Danish Data Protection Agency, and the Board of the Danish Heart Registry all approved the project, which was carried out in accordance with current rules of ethics and legislature. Register-based studies do not require ethical approval in Denmark.</p>

<sec id="sec17-1741826711416046" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title>
<p>During the study period 20,800 patients were hospitalized with an AMI and 15,235 were examined with CAG within 60 days. A total of 1643 (10.8%) were without significant stenoses: 855 women (18.1%) and 788 men (7.5%) (χ<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1741826711416046">2</xref></sup> test <italic>p</italic>-value &lt;0.0001); 44 patients died within 60 days of AMI and four were hospitalized for more than 60 days, leaving 1595 patients for the analyses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1741826711416046">Figure 1</xref>). A Cox regression model adjusting for age did not show any significant difference in 60-day mortality with a female/male hazard ratio (HR) of 0.57 (95% CI 0.31–1.07). Shock was excluded from all models due to the low number of observed events in both women and men.

<p>In the subgroup of patients with a first time admission for AMI, who were examined with a CAG showing no significant stenoses, women received the recommended secondary preventive medication at least to the same extent as men. Furthermore, prognosis with respect to all-cause mortality and recurrence of AMI was similar for women and men after adjusting for explanatory variables.</p>
<p>Our results are interesting in several aspects. Firstly, our data include all citizens of Denmark aged 30–90 years (3.5 million inhabitants) and our data cover all Danish hospitals and not only cardiac care units. Therefore, our results reflect the everyday clinical practice and adherence to national guidelines in patients with AMI without significant coronary stenoses in Danish hospitals. Thus our results of no gender differences in secondary preventive medical treatment and long-term prognosis represent a strong and positive message.</p>
<p>Secondly, the type of patients in our data have only been poorly characterized in terms of treatment and outcome. Von Korn et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1741826711416046">16</xref></sup> investigated the prognosis of acute coronary syndrome patients from 2002–05 and found no differences in all-cause mortality between patients with (3.9%) and without (4.7%) significant coronary stenoses on angiography after a mean follow-up of 1 year. These data were from a single centre and excluded patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). Bugiardini et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1741826711416046">17</xref></sup> analysed data on non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) patients with non-obstructive coronary artery disease from three Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction trials. They found that 1% of patients had died and 1.2% had recurrent myocardial infarction after a 1-year follow-up. None of these studies provided results in terms of differences between women and men. Potential sex-related differences in outcome have been investigated by Dey et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1741826711416046">18</xref></sup> They analysed data on acute coronary syndrome patients from the GRACE study and found no differences in mortality (2% men vs. 1% women) or recurrence of myocardial infarction (2% men vs. 2% women) after 6 months of follow-up in patients with normal coronary arteries or mild coronary artery disease. These results were consistent in subgroup analyses of patients with unstable angina pectoris, NSTEMI, and STEMI. Our results do not suggest any differences between women and men in terms of all-cause mortality and recurrence of AMI within 3 years of discharge. Furthermore, the prognosis in the study population as a whole appears to be fairly good, although recurrent AMI remains a substantial risk.</p>
<p>Gender differences in secondary preventive medical treatment following an AMI have been described in the literature with a suggested under-treatment of women. The national guidelines in Denmark recommend that all patients with an AMI receive a beta-blocker, a statin, clopidogrel, and aspirin at discharge. Our results show that these recommendations are complied with to a high degree, also when comparing with other Danish register-based studies on AMI populations,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1741826711416046">19</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1741826711416046">22</xref></sup> and more importantly there was no evidence of under-treatment of women in our data. A recent study on the GRACE dataset<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1741826711416046">23</xref></sup> showed that clopidogrel and statins have the greatest independent pharmacological benefit in terms of 6-month survival in acute coronary syndrome patients. Our results show that almost three-quarters of both women and men redeem prescriptions for lipid-lowering drugs within 60 days with clopidogrel lagging at about 55%. These differences could partly be due to contraindications of clopidogrel and concomitant anticoagulation therapy with fewer patients receiving a prescription at discharge. Chew et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1741826711416046">24</xref></sup> also compared the potential gains of optimized use of the recommended secondary preventive medication with possible new innovations in therapy. They found that an optimization of medication at discharge was likely to have the greatest reduction in terms of mortality, myocardial infarction, and stroke in patients with AMI regardless of age and sex. This emphasizes the importance of patients receiving prescriptions for guideline-recommended medication at discharge.</p>
<p>Thirdly, it has recently been found that women are less invasively investigated with CAG and subsequently less treated than men.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1741826711416046">2</xref></sup> Our results suggest that if a gender bias exists, it is present in the pre-invasive diagnostic workup rather than in the secondary preventive medical treatment, at least in this particular group of patients examined with CAG, who do not receive invasive treatment.</p>
<p>It is well known that patients with AMI and no significant stenoses on coronary angiography are a heterogeneous group in terms of aetiology including concealed atherosclerosis with external remodelling of the epicardial vessels, transient coronary vasospasms, thrombosis with subsequent spontaneous fibrinolysis, embolization from diseased heart valves, and in very rare cases spontaneous dissection of coronary arteries (SCAD) or myocardial bridges.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1741826711416046">25</xref></sup> Some of these conditions might be undetectable on coronary angiography. Also, diagnoses which to some extent mimic AMI at presentation including the Tako-Tsubo-like syndrome and myocarditis may have been included in our population, although the management of these conditions does not include similar secondary preventive medication.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1741826711416046">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1741826711416046">27</xref></sup></p>
<sec id="sec22-1741826711416046"><title>Study strengths and limitations</title>
<p>This study was based on nationwide data including all citizens of Denmark. Using the entire Danish population as the study base regardless of age, socioeconomic status, or race minimizes possible selection bias. Using a discharge diagnosis of AMI, which is a validated diagnosis, and hospitalization for more than 1 day, thus ensuring that AMI was present, adds further validity to the data. Further, reporting to the Danish Heart Registry was mandatory throughout the study period, minimizing possible selection bias due to incomplete reporting of CAG. No differences in 60-day mortality were observed between women and men, suggesting that our results in terms of clinical outcomes are not due to confounding from differences in survival during the first 60 days after admission.</p>
<p>A possible weakness of the study was the lack of core clinical parameters such as electrocardiographic findings, enzyme troponin levels, and left ventricular ejection fraction. Instead, we used proxies for the extent of concomitant heart disease and comorbidity in our analyses, which might have left some residual confounding in our estimates.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="sec23-1741826711416046"><title>Conclusions and implications</title>
<p>Our study suggests that in a population of patients with a first admission for AMI and no significant stenoses on CAG, women share the same prospects as men with respect to long-term prognosis and the extent of secondary preventive medical treatment. Furthermore, this subgroup of patients in general appears relatively well treated, although there may well be room for improvement as recurrent AMI is still an issue in both women and men. Attention should be paid to treatment and follow-up in this group of patients, who cannot benefit from our current invasive treatment strategies and thus rely on the use of secondary preventive medical treatment.</p>
