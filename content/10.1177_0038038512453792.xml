<abstract>
<p>Age, temporality and intergenerationality have often been neglected in debates on intersectionality within sexuality studies. This article contributes towards these debates by examining how age and generation operate within transnational activism around LGBTQ (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer politics) in Poland. Drawing on interviews with activists in Poland, Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands and the UK, this article examines age and generation as significant aspects of activists’ positioning with regard to each other and to archives of political experiences and discursive repertoires. The article argues that age and generation matter on the level of personal inter-subjectivity and are frequently rationalised by recourse to different national and local narratives of LGBTQ movement histories.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Sexualities research has often overlooked questions of age, generation and intergenerationality and has reproduced age identity categories as fixed rather than relational (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0038038512453792">Hammack and Cohler, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0038038512453792">Heaphy, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0038038512453792">Plummer, 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0038038512453792">2010</xref>). In this article we examine the politics of age, temporality and intergenerationality within transnational activist networks around sexual dissident politics in Poland since 2004. We argue that concepts of age, temporality and intergenerationality offer rich analytical possibilities for examining the transnational dimensions of sexual dissident politics in contemporary Poland. Moreover, we suggest that thinking about these concepts in the context of transnational activism can enhance and question the ways in which they have been applied to the analysis of contemporary sexual politics. Examining the transnational politics of age, intergenerationality and temporality also shows the limitations of what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0038038512453792">Glick Schiller and Çağlar (2009</xref>: 180) term ‘methodological nationalism’, by which they mean analysis that takes for granted the nation-state as the conceptual framework for understanding social and political phenomena.</p>
<p>The article begins by locating the main themes of our discussion within existing literatures on age, generation and temporality. The following section focuses on age, generation and temporality through a transnational lens, and our discussion highlights the contingency at the heart of definitions of these terms. We argue that the politics of age, generation and temporality can often be interconnected in ways which reinforce stereotypes about the relative ‘progressive’ or ‘backward’ nature of sexual politics in post-accession Poland, Central and Eastern Europe and the European Union. Having set the theoretical context for the article, we go on to examine how age, intergenerational relations and temporality were framed in an empirical project on transnational activist networks that emerged in response to the crisis regarding the treatment of LGBTQ people in Poland between 2004 and 2007. We explore how age, generation and temporality were configured within activist narratives. We suggest that the figure of the queer child was central to how temporality was narrated in relation to notions of queer utopia and resistance to western paternalism. In the conclusion we argue that intergenerational relationships are fundamental to transnational activist practices and the political projects that these networks are realising. We further suggest that queer theoretical work on age, generation and temporality can benefit from a more sustained engagement with questions of space in relation to time.</p>

<title>Age, Generation and Queer Temporality</title>
<p>Recent debates in queer theory and sexuality studies more broadly have critiqued the heteronormativity of culturally hegemonic understandings of age, generativity and temporality. For instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0038038512453792">Halberstam (2005)</xref> has explored the implication of queer lives, queer politics and subcultures for the conceptualisation of time. She is particularly interested in how heteronormative time is mediated by the rationalities and social values underpinning reproduction. Reproductive futurity, she argues, establishes a specific mode of governmentality which regulates the life course of women much more than men. ‘Repro-time’ or ‘family time’ implies normative scheduling of everyday processes of living, often with reference to real life or imagined needs of children. For Halberstam, queer uses of time and space are often based on an opposition to the institutions of family, heterosexuality and reproduction. In this context we see how queer temporalities may be marked more by what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0038038512453792">Stockton (2009)</xref> terms ‘growing sideways’ rather than ‘growing up’. Stockton’s notion of ‘growing sideways’ complements Halberstam’s notion of queer temporality and resists hegemonic notions of ‘maturity’ based on biological reproduction.</p>
<p>In its assertive gesture of dethroning reproduction as the core metaphor of time and futurity, Halberstam’s work converges with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0038038512453792">Edelman’s (2004)</xref> polemical commentary on the construction of time in US politics. Edelman establishes queerness as an antipode to reproductive futurity in conservative politics, arguing that queer sexualities are depicted by the Christian Right as undermining heterosexual family life and threatening the health and well-being, and gender normativity of children. Reproductive futurity thereby entails a collective fetishistic investment in the figure of the Child. In this political context he argues that: ‘queerness names the side of those not “fighting for the children”, the side outside the consensus by which all politics confirms the absolute value of reproductive futurism’ (2004: 3). Edelman calls on queers therefore to reject any investment in reproductive futurism and instead accept the position of the abject of social theory and political discourse. Mirroring <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0038038512453792">Bersani (1996)</xref>, Edelman asks queers to embrace the death drive and to affirm the irrational, senseless, repetitive nature of sexuality. This includes a principled rejection of politics:
<disp-quote>
<p>For politics, however radical the means by which specific constituencies attempt to produce a more desirable social order, remains, at its core, conservative insofar it works to affirm a structure, to authenticate social order, which it then intends to transmit to the future in the form of its inner child. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0038038512453792">2004</xref>: 2–3)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>At this point we need to question whether all notions of futurity necessarily hinge upon the notion of heterosexual reproduction and why all political aspirations are defined as necessarily conservative. While Edelman shatters the connection between queerness and temporality in his rejection of (reproductive) futurity, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0038038512453792">Muñoz (2009)</xref> attempts to develop an archive for a queer utopianism based on the conception of queer as a collective sociality based in diversity. Muñoz argues that queerness is essentially a rejection of the limitations of the present, and about imagining new ways of living and being together, and envisaging new modes of intimacy. In this way he aims to alter our understanding of time through a rejection of heteronormativity, by conceptualising queer time as being phenomenologically distinct from straight time.</p>
<p>While this recent body of work has made a significant contribution towards our understanding of the queer politics of temporality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0038038512453792">Dinshaw et al., 2007</xref>), the debate has a tendency to reproduce rather rigid and stereotypical interpretations of queerness and heterosexuality. For example, reproduction is cast as being essentially about heterosexuality in both Halberstam’s and Edelman’s work. The rigid juxtaposition between regulated normative straight family lives and adventurous counter-normative sexual lives overlooks the increasing complexity of life trajectories associated with all sexual subjectives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0038038512453792">Ruddick, 2003</xref>). It renders more and more heterosexuals outside of the reproductive futurism that Edelman tends to construct as hegemonic and all pervasive in US political life.</p>
<p>One more recent contribution to the study of the sexual politics of temporality is <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0038038512453792">Plummer’s (2010)</xref> wide-ranging and nuanced examination of the politics of age and generation in the study of sexualities. Plummer claims that issues of age, generation and life course have been neglected within sexuality studies, arguing that ‘all sexualities dangle from an age perspective. They are situated in age standpoints’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0038038512453792">2010</xref>: 165). Plummer uses the term ‘generational narratives’ to describe the way lives are narrated within a framework of a common set of experiences that constitute generational standpoints. However, he also recognises that there is considerable variation in experiences within the same generation. Plummer thereby endorses an intersectional approach to the study of generational sexualities thereby highlighting the importance of age and generation in the simultaneous workings of multiple oppressions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0038038512453792">Erel et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0038038512453792">Taylor et al., 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Recent work on temporality in queer theory has been valuable in challenging the heteronormativity of accounts of age, generativity and temporality rooted in biological reproduction. However, we have also suggested that debates on queer temporality can sometimes reproduce essentialist notions of queerness and heterosexuality. Both Muñoz’s call for a queer utopianism based on collectivity in difference, and Plummer’s argument for a more holistic integration of generational theory, intersectionality and queer theory can contribute towards more nuanced analysis of the sexual politics of age, generation and temporality. Furthermore, we argue that the (transnational) politics of space can inform our understanding of the contingent nature of these categories.</p>

<sec id="section3-0038038512453792">
<title>Thinking Age, Generation and Temporality Transnationally</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0038038512453792">Butler (2008)</xref> has argued that we need to conceptualise temporality in relation to space, thereby bringing into focus the difference that space makes to theories of queer temporality. The question of how histories intersect, and whose histories are known, intelligible and talked about within queer theory, is salient when one considers the transnational politics of temporality. Work related to temporality in the ‘anti-social thesis’ within queer theory addresses a specific set of cultural and political tropes in US right-wing politics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0038038512453792">Caserio, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0038038512453792">Dean, 2006</xref>). It is therefore questionable how useful the anti-social debate in queer theory may be in helping to explain the conditions for struggles around sexual dissident politics outside of the US context. While <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0038038512453792">Muñoz (2009)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0038038512453792">Love (2007)</xref> have both argued that the act of ‘looking back’ can be a valuable resource in helping to imagine new political possibilities and queerer futures, we need to recognise how the queer politics of the past, present and future may be re-imagined differently in other, non-US contexts. For instance, witness the growth of Yugo-nostalgia and what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0038038512453792">Dioli (2009</xref>: 15) terms ‘the utopian idea of Queeroslavija’ for the regional cross-border cooperation and solidarities of LGBTQ activists in the former Yugoslavia; and the adoption of socialist icons such as the red star and the use of socialist era language of solidarity for one pride event in Zagreb which embraced activists from across the former Yugoslavia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0038038512453792">Todorovic and Simic, 2011</xref>). While looking back can be generative of queerer futures, looking back can also be problematic, as in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0038038512453792">Wekker’s (2009)</xref> critique of what she terms ‘homonostalgia’ in Dutch gay politics, which she sees as the nostalgia for a less complicated time ‘when there were no Muslims’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0038038512453792">2009</xref>: 1) (quoted in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0038038512453792">Jivraj and De Jong, 2011</xref>: 146).</p>
<p>Discussions of space in relation to temporality bring to the fore debates around the politics of translation and exchange of ideas from one social and political context to another. In the context of a discussion of the politics of conducting research on ‘lesbian’ identities and spaces in metropolitan and non-metropolitan Russia, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0038038512453792">Stella (2011</xref>: 211) has argued that: ‘queer political activism and academic discourse remain predominantly located within Anglo-American and Western European societies, and are therefore deeply implicated in global power hierarchies’. Discussing LGBTQ politics in Central and Eastern Europe, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0038038512453792">Mizielińska and Kulpa (2011)</xref> reject the anti-social premises of Edelman’s ‘no future’ agenda as a position of privilege which can only have suicidal consequences in the context of LGBTQ struggles in Central and Eastern Europe. Apart from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0038038512453792">Halberstam’s (2005)</xref> abstract and general claims on the theoretical importance of space for our understanding of temporality, space is largely absent from debates on queer temporality. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0038038512453792">Mizielińska and Kulpa (2011)</xref> insightfully demonstrate how narratives on LGBTQ activism in Central and Eastern Europe and in Western Europe are structured around particular understandings of temporality and space. Discourses on space and temporality (with regard to questions of history, ‘progress’, ‘maturity’) are closely interconnected. The spatial terms which organise reflections on sexual politics (‘Central and Eastern Europe’, ‘the West’, ‘Europe’, ‘western activism’, ‘eastern activism’, ‘transition societies’, etc. ) are overloaded with cultural meanings which sustain a binary logic at the heart of East–West discourses. According to Mizielińska and Kulpa, different representations govern the narration of the histories of sexual struggles in Western Europe and Central and Eastern Europe. While the former set of histories is often represented according to a linear model, according to which waves of politics smoothly unfold in a sequential order, the case is different for Central and Eastern Europe. The flow of time (and linear representation of history) has been unsettled by the collapse of socialist regimes as a rupture of the common styles of political and social engagement. This temporal disjunction unsettles representations of time, including past, present and future, leading to what Mizielińska and Kulpa describe as ‘coincidental’ exploration and adaptation of political ideologies and strategies in Central and Eastern European contexts, a phenomenon they capture with the metaphor of ‘knotted time’.</p>
<p>Sexual politics have often been folded into hegemonic geopolitical notions of progress and European modernity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0038038512453792">Beger, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0038038512453792">El Tayeb, 2012</xref>). Contemporary discourses around transnational LGBTQ politics within Europe frequently reproduce Orientalist discourses which construct countries and regions in Central and Eastern Europe as backward and temporally delayed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0038038512453792">Kuus, 2004</xref>). These logics are further sustained by an ideological discourse, according to which the post-socialist societies of Central and Eastern Europe realised a less developed stage of modernisation and are only catapulted into modernity through processes of adaptation of the standards of capitalistic and liberal civil societies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0038038512453792">Mizielińska and Kulpa, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0038038512453792">Woodcock, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Discussing generationality in relation to globalisation, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0038038512453792">Plummer (2010</xref>: 183) has suggested that: ‘In the current world, generations seem much more globally mobile than previous ones, raising many issues for understanding the globalization of sexualities.’ Our examination of age, generation and temporality in relation to transnational activism addresses how generational narratives are simultaneously bound up with questions of national identity. We argue that these narratives convey wider meanings and connotations attached to spatial and temporal contexts. Having outlined the main theoretical contexts for the analysis that follows, we now proceed to discuss our study of transnational activism.</p>

<title>About the Study</title>
<p>The empirical component of this article is based on anonymised data from a project on transnational activist solidarities and networks around LGBTQ politics in Poland since 2004. The original aim of the project was to map and examine the development of transnational activist networks related to the Krakow Culture for Tolerance festival and march. This initial focus on Krakow later expanded to include wider transnational activist networks related to Polish LGBTQ politics. This entailed interviews with 35 activists in Poland, Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands and the UK. It also involved participation in equality marches and associated cultural festivals in Warsaw and Poznan in 2008; the Krakow Culture for Tolerance festival in 2008 and 2009; and the Queer in May event and the March for Tolerance in 2008 and 2009. It also included participant observation of the 2007 Get Bent festival in Manchester and the 2009 Pink Saturday Event in The Hague. We interviewed activists who either organised or participated in such events. These ranged from individuals with no political or organisational affiliation, to those who were active within trade unions, political parties, or professional lesbian and gay and LGBTQ social and political organisations. We were interested in how solidarities around LGBTQ politics in Poland were produced and sustained. We sought to understand both the transnational basis of LGBTQ politics in Poland and how notions of solidarity were deployed, mobilised and contested. Interviews were transcribed, coded and analysed using a discourse analysis approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0038038512453792">Howarth, 2000</xref>). In our project we found that issues around age, temporality and intergenerationality emerged as significant themes in interviews with activists.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0038038512453792">
<title>Age, Intergenerational Sexualities and Queer Temporalities in Transnational Activism</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0038038512453792">Tarrant (2010</xref>: 191) has argued that ‘generational interactions that produce identities are always embedded in particular contexts at particular times’. It is therefore imperative that we set out the social and political contexts for our discussion of intergenerational relations within transnational activist networks in LGBTQ politics in Poland in recent decades. In the Polish context we only witness the growth of a public consciousness and active deployment of a politics around LGBTQ visibility from 2001, when the first march for LGBTQ rights took place in Warsaw, organised by the Polish branch of the ILGCN (International Lesbian and Gay Cultural Network) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0038038512453792">Gruszczyńska, 2008</xref>). Gruszczyńska argues that before 1989 (the end of communist rule) LGBTQ culture in Poland was underground and that if networks did exist they were primarily social and cultural in function and not political.</p>
<p>However, Gruszczyńska argues that 2004 is seen to be the moment of rupture or a turning point in Polish LGBTQ politics. In 2004 the first March for Tolerance in Krakow was subject to a violent counter-demonstration organised by the far right (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0038038512453792">Tőrnquist-Plewa and Malmgren, 2007</xref>). The annual march has since been the main focus of far-right attacks, and for national debate about LGBTQ politics. In November 2005, 68 people, mostly pro-equality activists, were arrested on an equality march in Poznan which had been banned by the city’s mayor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0038038512453792">Gruszczyńska, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0038038512453792">Kowalczyk, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0038038512453792">Warkocki, 2006</xref>). The 2005 Warsaw March for Equality was banned by the city authorities under the leadership of the then Mayor of Warsaw Lech Kaczynski (who was President of Poland until his death in the Smolensk air disaster in 2010).</p>
<p>The oppression of these marches led to strong mobilisation in support of the LGBTQ movement. Some Polish activists describe the years around 2004 as the moment in which multiple solidarities were forged across boundaries of sexual identifications, political affiliations, class positions, gender lines and age differences. The attempts at censorship and the violence of Far-Right counter demonstrations were widely published in the international media, particularly within EU member states such as the UK, where EU expansion led to an increased concern with (sexual) politics in Central and Eastern Europe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0038038512453792">Graham, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0038038512453792">Watt, 2006</xref>). This media interest in turn supported the creation of transnational networks around the specific events in our study.</p>
<p>Local participants in marches for equality have been predominantly in their early and mid-20s. This has had interesting consequences for transnational LGBTQ activism when activists in their early 20s interact with activists from outside of Poland, many of whom have several decades of experience of activism in the movement. Susanne, a co-organiser of the Krakow Culture for Tolerance festival and the Krakow Queer in May festival, highlights the intergenerational aspect of transnational cooperation as a particularly valuable experience. Talking about her experience of the Krakow March for Tolerance, Susanne contends:
<disp-quote>
<p>For me it was also quite inspiring to hear how they … what kind of impression makes the Festival for them … and also to hear their experience, because, as I said they were from another generation than we are. It was really … it felt really good to see there are older people, because in Krakow I never see older gays or lesbians, so there is no role models and it’s really nice to see somebody the age of my parents who is into activism and is just, like, so secure on the march, like ‘okay, we just have to march’. It’s like ‘okay, we already survived the marches in Cologne and twenty years ago, when they also were throwing eggs and now we have to march in Krakow, with our Krakow friends’. It’s very nice I think, emotional support, it is for me.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Susanne appreciates the experience of socialising with, and engaging in, activism with lesbians and gay men of older generations, an experience she rarely has in the local context. For Susanne, the support and solidarity from activists from abroad is a form of intergenerational as well as transnational solidarity. It also offers hope to the Krakow activists – the thought that the marches in Krakow will also be survived and that the violence will dissipate in the future. For Susanne, their bodies and actions stand in, emblematically, for experiences of collective struggle and animate hope for a better future. Susanne’s description resonates with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0038038512453792">Muňoz’s (2009)</xref> allusions to a queer futurism – open, indeterminate, but always tied to collective effort.</p>
<p>However, Susanne’s assessment of cross-generational cooperation is not unequivocally positive. Like many other respondents, she discussed intergenerationality as a source of problems, too. At times, discussions of age differences were reframed alongside questions of cultural or national differences. In response to a question regarding her understanding of a specific critical moment in her experience of transnational activist cooperation, Susanne explained:</p>
<speech>
<speaker>Interviewer:</speaker>
<p>Would you say the cooperation turned difficult because of primarily personal, emotional or political issues … or a mixture of it?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Susanne:</speaker>
<p>I think it’s more about personal […] but I think it was just misunderstandings because of culture and because of generation, because the activists who came, they were all, like 50 years old. They were all like twice the age of the average Polish activist’s age … and they were also sometimes, like … because our activists are almost all women … and it was a little, sometimes, strange. It was like the 50-year-old German gays come and tell the young, Polish lesbian feminist women what to do. […] Germans have this tendency, maybe, to discuss everything and to make it clear and Polish people don’t have, maybe, this much this culture … and then the generational thing, that they have the experience of 20, 30 years activism.</p>
</speech>
<p>Susanne suggests that some conflicts emerged on the personal level due to misunderstandings derived from cultural and generational differences. Different styles of communication can ascerbate conflicts related to age differences. Gender is a further important element here. Susanne also stresses national identities, talking of ‘German gays’ and ‘Polish lesbian feminists’ respectively, which could be read as indicating the relevance of geopolitical power relations (based on a history of war and domination and the uneven distribution of political and economic power in contemporary Europe). The geopolitical dimension is also at the core of her view that experience tied up with social movement practice can be cited in order to bolster authoritative positions based in expertise:
<disp-quote>
<p>And the other problems are that people from outside are coming and telling us in Krakow, from the inside, what we should do … like this perspective as an expert, like ‘we have already the LGBT movement 30 years and we know what is the right way’. (Susanne)</p>
</disp-quote>

<p>This discursive construction of time supports <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0038038512453792">Mizielińska and Kulpa’s (2011)</xref> critical reading of the ways that social movement histories in Western Europe and Central and Eastern Europe are pitched against each other. Susanne also illustrates how age differences between groups of activists may accentuate other differences in the registers of gender identification, national location or geopolitical positioning. This works to reinforce the potential for paternalism by older western gay male activists towards younger Polish lesbian activists in transnational LGBTQ activist networks. This also highlights the important contribution of age in relation to the politics of intersectionality, in that Susanne narrates multiple differences through the lens of age.</p>
<p>In our examination of the ‘networked solidarities’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0038038512453792">Gould, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0038038512453792">Scholz, 2007</xref>) produced through activist practices, we found that age, temporality and intergenerationality were central to the way other respondents narrated their encounters with other activists. Take for example, Jan, a Dutch activist and member of COC Leiden in the Netherlands, who in the late 1990s had been part of a delegation to Poland, and who later sought to re-establish these transnational links in his activism throughout the 2000s. His narrative reflects on age, activism and transnationality from a lifecourse perspective. Interestingly, different periods of his activism were shaped by different intergenerational dynamics. In the 1980s he was part of a youth delegation who met officials of the Polish Communist Party, who usually were of a very different age.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>What was funny in those days when you went over, we were especially a youth delegation and we were going to meet people from youth organisations in Poland. In those days, still the communist days, you saw that people who were working for youth organisations were all people appointed politically or whatever by the party, and were all people over 50. So one side of the table, the Dutch side, were 25 minus, the other side of the table was 50 plus, which in itself gave already quite a difficult environment to get the real constructive talks because we considered them to be too old, and they considered us too young to do anything. (Jan)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In this quote, the age gap is offered as a self-evident explanation for a communication barrier. In accounts of later periods of his activism, the age gap remains a salient issue. Jan described the age difference between himself and the young groups of activists he met during a visit in 2005 as ‘shocking’ and estranging.</p>
<speech>
<speaker>Interviewer:</speaker>
<p>You talked about your experience in the 80s when you met these 50-year-old representatives of the youth groups but how was it when you went back in 2005 and since?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Jan:</speaker>
<p>Shocking.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Interviewer:</speaker>
<p>Can you just talk about how it felt going back and being with people who were half your age?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Jan:</speaker>
<p>Half your age? Yeah. The funny thing was it was a déja vu, but twisted around, like where I was the eldest one in ’87 when I was 24 in our delegation and on the other side of the table there was nobody below 50. I think that’s something, like what do we have in common? Strangely enough right now they were all in their early 20s and this time I was nearly the eldest and I’m in the second half of the 40s, so it gave me kind of a strange feeling.</p>
</speech>
<p>The term shock was also used by some younger Polish activists when they talked about their first encounter with older activists from abroad. The interesting aspect of Jan’s narrative is that he described the age barrier as more rigid and less permeable when he talked about his activism in the 1980s (when he was a younger person). In his description of his 2005 experiences, he emphasises that age is not absolute and that the perception of age is influenced by questions of style and fashion. Jan is keen to stress that the younger people did not disrespect him because of his age, or dismiss him because of his age difference:
<disp-quote>
<p>Yet the problem that occurred from their side because they did not have something like, yeah but you’re too old, you wouldn’t understand. Not once they told me that. Anyway in Poland if you are dressed as a modern gay person in Holland over the age of 46 they still think you’re 32, so that’s always nice to go to Poland. So they still thought I was only 10 years older instead of 25 years older.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>For Jan, age is related to dress and style, as he states that in Poland he was often read as ‘being a modern gay person’ and therefore being 10 years younger than his actual age. So in this sense, he gets younger when he goes to Poland. Jan uses his experience of being in a gay youth group and growing up in Catholic, provincial southern Netherlands to express his ability to empathise with young Poles. Jan mobilises reminiscences of his own youth and engages in acts of cultural translation to produce a narrative on solidarity which is transnational and intergenerational at the same time. Jan also refers to the paradoxical potential of transnational encounters to transcend absolute age differences on the level of his experience.</p>

<title>Narratives of (Queer) Temporality in Relation to the Nation</title>
<p>Jan explicitly articulates distinctions between Dutch and Polish activists through notions of temporality. Elsewhere in the interview Jan narrates differences (and similarities) between the experiences of gay men and lesbians in Poland and the Netherlands through temporality – with Poland constructed as being behind the Netherlands in terms of the status of lesbians and gay men. Jan discusses the age of political organisations in the Netherlands and Poland and the transformations in sexual politics from gay to queer. He notes that organisations reflect their history. The Dutch COC is an old established organisation founded in 1946 and based on gay and lesbian politics, as opposed to the very young organisations in Poland which are a product of their time, and therefore more concerned with transgender politics compared to the Netherlands.</p>
<speech>
<speaker>Interviewer:</speaker>
<p>So – transgender is feeding back into the work that you’re doing here?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Jan:</speaker>
<p>Yeah, thinking of sexual diversity you know in gay and lesbian. That is something which we in Holland think in, gay and lesbian, because we have been an organisation which has been focusing on gay and lesbian issues from the ’40s – ’46 we were founded – so we’ve always been fixed on gay and lesbian and of course suddenly there was bisexuality […] and then there was transvestites. […] and then came transgender […] and now we’ve got inter-racial, and you’ve got queer […]. But that is thinking more inclusive, which the new states, the new organisations do, because they are founded in a situation, in a time and a place, where thinking inclusive was already something more available. In our time it wasn’t and it’s very hard to change an already existing organisation in the way of how to approach some things. So that is something which we hardly do, so that is something which I actually take out from experience with young organisations, and I mean young as the organisation.</p>
</speech>
<p>Jan therefore distinguishes between the age of activists, and the age of activist organisations. It could be argued that Jan’s explanation is somewhat apologetic in that it rationalises the absence of transgender politics and awareness in the COC with its formation in an era of ‘gay politics’. It is more natural for younger, contemporary organisations, such as the ones he has seen springing up in Poland since 2001, to reflect on transgender issues. Jan’s narrative shows that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0038038512453792">Mizielińska and Kulpa’s (2011)</xref> argument of a sequential temporal development of sexual politics in Western Europe, which progressed from a homophile, to a gay liberationist, to a queer and ultimately anti-social paradigm has its limitations. Rather then being sequential in any strict sense of the term, these political frameworks coexist in Western European polities, within and across political organisations and currents. Mizielińska and Kulpa’s notion of disjunctive time on first sight appears to be more helpful to explain some elements of Jan’s reflection. Mizielińska and Kulpa argue that activist developments in many Central and Eastern European countries can be characterised by a ‘temporal disjunction’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0038038512453792">2011</xref>: 15). They show this disjunction with regard to the prominence and absence of ‘transgender’ and ‘bisexuality’ references in queer politics in Central and Eastern Europe. They argue that Polish activists quickly adopted the LGBT rhetoric, even if transgender and bisexual politics were not yet developed at all. Transgender activism, they argue, only emerged in Central and Eastern Europe in the years around 2007–2008. This means that substantive transgender perspectives are much less embedded in contemporary Polish LG(B)(T) politics. That notwithstanding, it is striking that it is transnational campaigning work with Polish activists which opened Jan’s eyes for the significance of transgender politics. At the same time, Jan tends to equate the youth of organisations with lack of development and professionalisation. To a certain extent Jan’s narrative reflects a hegemonic way in which age and temporality are intertwined within western activist narratives. But it is not only that activists are much younger in Poland, but that their organisations are younger compared to organisations such as the Dutch COC.</p>

<title>Generational Narratives and Stories of Intergenerationality</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0038038512453792">Plummer (2010)</xref> has highlighted the relevance of ‘generational narratives’ in discourses of sexuality. These ‘generational narratives’ are very important in the interviews we undertook with activists within the networks in our study. For Polish activists, one significant generational narrative is that the post-2004 generation find themselves without parents given the lack of out LGBTQ people in their 30s and 40s. In a public interview conducted as part of the 2007 Get Bent festival of Queer Diversity in Manchester (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0038038512453792">Get Bent Manchester, 2007</xref>), the very theme of Ida Lukawska’s talk was ‘Poor Children, Perverts and Troublemakers, Being Queer, Out and Loud in Poland’. Ida, one of the organisers of the Krakow event refers to 1989 and to Operation Hyacinth to articulate her periodisation of different phases or generations of activism:
<disp-quote>
<p>So it was only from the ’90s that there was a possibility to do anything and the other thing is that in the late ’80s there was a big action, like the secret service secret police, they arrested homosexual men and they put their data on the files. Some of them were used to blackmail those people to force them to cooperate with the regime. Those data still exist, nobody knows where, so 1000s of gay people still feel in danger because lots of them are not out.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Ida argues that this authoritarian treatment of homosexuals by the communist state explains why so few people over 30 and 40 are out and part of the movement. She argues that this also explains why so many of those active today are young. She adds ‘in Poland’, which suggests that this age difference in terms of the movement is a significant point of difference compared to the UK and the West. She marks Polish difference from the West in terms of the age of the activists:
<disp-quote>
<p>Obviously people of over 30 and 40, hardly anybody is out as a gay person, and I think that’s one of the reasons why all the queer activists in Poland are very young. I’m 26 and for example as for Krakow, my organisation, I’m one of the oldest. People coming to us are like 19, 20!</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Ida compares the current state of Polish queer politics with reference to the past of western LGBT politics. Echoing the earlier statements by Mizielińska and Kulpa about different waves of sexual politics and ‘knotted time’, Ida argues that different waves of activism that took place over a long time in the West are taking place simultaneously in contemporary Poland. She discusses the Campaign Against Homophobia’s visibility campaign ‘Let Them See Us’, with its focus on respectability, as being like western activism 30 years ago. In this sense she categorises specific types of western activism into different time periods.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0038038512453792">
<title>The Queer Child and Western Paternalism</title>
<p>Ida argues that western activists mark themselves as different from Polish activists through age difference and paternalism:
<disp-quote>
<p>That’s one thing about the poor children because that’s the picture of out/queer people in Poland that lots of our friends or some of the relations from the West have. I mean they came to Poland and they see, oh those poor children, so young and so innocent against such a dreadful homophobic government, etc.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Ida’s use of the label ‘poor children’ to describe how western activists see Polish activists suggests that Ida resents the way that westerners infantilise Polish activists. Age difference – the way westerners view Polish activists as innocent, poor children – is therefore an important way in which differences between western and Polish activists are reproduced. While Ida praises the support of western activists, and acknowledges that this support was essential for the organisation of the first march and festival in Krakow, she is scathing of the way in which Polish activists were sometimes seen by westerners as ‘poor children’ – as victims deserving of charity.</p>
<p>Ida’s narration of being interpellated as a queer child is redolent of developmental media discourses that construct the ‘Third World Child’ as an innocent victim that commands the sympathy of the western donor. Discussing hegemonic western media images of the Third World child, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0038038512453792">Susan Ruddick (2003</xref>: 347) argues that: ‘The “saving of children” has been a persistent and recurring project over at least the past two centuries.’ This sequence of quotes by Ida shows in a striking fashion how a generational narrative on Polish LGBTQ politics entails the representation of the early 2000s cohort of activists as a young generation without precursors, a ‘generation without parents’.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0038038512453792">
<title>The Queer Child and Utopian Futures</title>
<p>Some positions within the queer theoretical debate on temporality have assumed a so-called anti-social position, directed against any notion of reproductive futurity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0038038512453792">Edelman, 2004</xref>). Some scholars who work on sexual politics in Central and Eastern Europe have rejected such a position as luxurious and inadequate in the face of the current struggles around sexuality and gender in the region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0038038512453792">Mizielińska and Kulpa, 2011</xref>). This mirrors some statements by our research participants who clearly saw their activism as a contribution to a queer future. Interestingly, at times these narratives operated a logic of generativity around the figure of the ‘queer child’. For example, Marek, a core organiser of the 2008 Krakow Culture for Tolerance festival deployed the figure of the ‘queer child’ as an initiator of future social transformation:
<disp-quote>
<p>[T]his year we had a volunteer who was 17, which means that when we started she was 12. So I guess the people, they live here, they witnessed the festival, the riots after the first march in 2004 and I think they were growing up with the festival, and the big ones, so it means that the festival somehow is a part of cultural life and social life in Krakow so I think it’s a kind of norm, it’s a normal thing which is … everybody knows that in May there is a Jewish festival that in July there is a film festival and April there’s a gay and lesbian festival.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>The ‘queer child’, socialised into adolescence in an environment of queer art and activism symbolises the transformation of society, in which queer festivals and demonstrations have become a regular feature of the calendar (as indicators of a queer time within ordinary cultural life). The ‘queer child’ symbolises both radicalism (in the sense of queer activism) and integration (in the sense of normalisation and fitting in). The ultimate hope is that the queer festival will become part of the ‘normal’ temporality of Krakow’s social and cultural life, so there is an investment in the queer child becoming normalised within the life of the city. A new generation of ‘queer children’ represent in Marek’s narrative the vanguard of the movement, and the real transformers of the society:
<disp-quote>
<p>[J]ust this year I came to realise that the social change which is going on right now, which is taking place, which will happen and succeed. The platform of this change … there are people who are 16, 17, 18, 19, 20 at the moment, this year we have these young people and when the time will come and they will take measures in their hands, I think that will be the moment where … And now I can see that nothing will stop it.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>In Marek’s statement we see an investment in the queer child as the harbinger of social and sexual political transformation in Poland. In this sense Marek’s vision of the queer child accords with Muñoz’s notion of queer futurity when Muñoz argues that: ‘the future is queerness’s domain. Queerness is a structuring and educated mode of desiring that allows us to see and feel beyond the quagmire of the present’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0038038512453792">2009</xref>: 1). In this confident investment in a vision of a queer future based on the figure of the queer child, Marek focuses on the agency of the queer child. In marked contrast, Ida constructs the Polish queer child as subject to rescue by paternalist western activists. Such strategies of rescue reproduce hegemonic notions of time and space and deny the agency of Polish activists. It runs counter to Edelman’s notion of queerness as that which ‘names the side of those not “fighting for the children”’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0038038512453792">2004</xref>: 3).</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>In this article we have examined how understandings of age, generation and temporality within queer theory and sexuality studies can contribute to examinations of transnational activism around LGBTQ politics. We have argued that queer theory and sexuality studies can make a significant contribution in making visible the socially constructed nature of age categories. Debates in queer theory have shown the heteronormative underpinnings of hegemonic notions of time and temporality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0038038512453792">Edelman, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0038038512453792">Halberstam, 2005</xref>), while <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0038038512453792">Plummer (2010)</xref> has argued that sexual politics always speaks to or operates on the grounds of age standpoints.</p>
<p>Our study of activists engaged in transnational LGBTQ politics in Poland found that there have been productive and positive intergenerational encounters and relations between activists of different ages – in terms of sharing of experiences, resources and tactics, thereby constituting intergenerational solidarities that are simultaneously transnational. However, we also found that generational narratives were significant in narrating distinctions, differences and conflicts between activists. In this sense age difference was a lens through which other forms of difference (e.g. gender and nationality) were narrated. Such deployments are fostered by the fact that age difference is often constructed as being less contentious, less political (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0038038512453792">Sandberg, 2008</xref>). Age, generation and temporality are always mediated by other social divisions, such as gender, class, race/ethnicity and nation and provide important lenses for the intersectional study of transnational activism.</p>
<p>Age does not only matter with regard to the individual life course, but also provides a metaphorical language for the representation of social movement histories. In transnational activism, age, cultural, ethnic, national, political, gender and class differences are often worked through, deploying different registers of temporality. This may imply spatialised constructions of the past (e.g. ‘we have gone through that before’), the present (e.g. backwardness vs vanguardism) or the future (e.g. investment in anti-social narratives or metaphors of the queer child). Concepts of temporality shift, get blurred or are reordered in the transnational sphere. Our empirical study of transnational activism around LGBTQ politics in Poland suggests that further research is needed to explore the spatially contingent nature of age, generation and temporality in relation to sexual politics. This is particularly important given the ongoing transnationalisation of struggles around sexual politics. We hope that these struggles can be better informed by a nuanced awareness of the politics of age, generation and temporality.</p>
