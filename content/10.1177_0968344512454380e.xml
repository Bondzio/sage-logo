<p>In 1917 James W. Gerard released <italic>My Four Years in Germany</italic>, a memoir of his time as American ambassador to the German imperial court. His observations helped inform the Anglophone world of the fates of certain POWs and civilians. Although Gerard’s observations were skewed by the limitations of his experience, he nevertheless commented that, in terms of prisoners suffering abuse by German soldiers, guards, and the civil population, ‘The instances were too numerous, [and] the evidence too overwhelming to be denied’ (p. 162).</p>
<p>Heather Jones has succeeded in defining, comparing, and analysing the origins, motivations, propaganda, practices, results, and legacies of violence against prisoners of war during the First World War on a scale beyond the reach of Gerard. She has done so in a manner which is both scientifically thorough and artistically distinct. The result enriches the study of comparative violence during the Great War by providing evidence and arguments which advance our understanding of a nation’s trajectory towards total war.</p>
<p>Several structural pillars support this process. Chief among these are primary source records which challenge traditional interpretations of the POW as a passive subject in his own chronicling. Jones utilizes records of interviews conducted with repatriated prisoners during the war, contemporary letters, and official reports – mined from several international repositories – to allow prisoners a voice in their own historicization. This testimony is complemented by the analysis of the prisoner of war, in both a cultural and historical context, through the synthesis of numerous additional primary and secondary source works, impressively balanced between belligerent nations. An attempt to quantify the number of prisoners of war, as well as those who died while in captivity, adds to the comprehensive nature of this study. Jones acknowledges some of the limitations inherent in this process. For example, the mobility experienced at the beginning and end of the conflict created administrative problems: rapid advances or retreats often demoted record keeping as a military necessity.</p>
<p>One particular case study will interest students of the medical humanities as well as war studies. Jones describes how the outbreak of typhus in German prisoner-of-war camps in 1915 prompted the British and French authorities to classify such negligence in hygiene as a war crime. Although the epidemic was eventually quarantined, a major propaganda victory was won by the British, who, by exposing conditions in camps such as Wittenberg and Gardelegen, were able to manipulate the definition of violence against prisoners to include an unsanitary prison-camp environment. As there were no comparable outbreaks of typhus in British or French prison camps during the war, sickness among prisoners was widely believed to have been a German atrocity.</p>
<p>A further compelling argument that develops throughout this study is the way in which prisoners contributed to the totality of war by acting as collateral, or wartime capital, for their captor nation. This was perpetrated, to varying degrees, by all three nations examined. Prisoners acted as collateral by being placed in culturally humiliating scenarios, or transferred to environmentally harsh regions, in an effort to pressure a prisoner’s home nation to relieve conditions being endured by enemy prisoners. Prisoners’ proximity to the front was also a concern. The Berne Accords signed by France and Germany in 1918 stipulated that prisoners should not be forced to work within 30 kilometres of the firing line. It was prisoners’ labour, however, which revealed the value of human capital. The conditions under which British, French, and German prisoners of war laboured, the ends to which they worked, the abuse they endured, and the level of sustenance they received are all examined by Jones. Britain and France possessed an array of colonial soldiers and sources of immigrant labour; their dependence on prisoner labour was therefore negligible. This again helped the Allies to portray themselves as morally superior to their enemies and, particularly in the British case, as upholders of a pre-war humanitarian outlook toward POWs. Conversely, Germany came to rely heavily on the labour of its prisoners – so much so, Jones argues, that ‘as discipline broke down in the German army in 1918, violence against prisoners increased as part of an army culture that … had come to view prisoners <italic>solely</italic> in terms of their labour value to the German war effort’ (p. 221).</p>
<p>Any deficiencies connected with Jones’s study stem from questions that lie beyond the identified purpose and scope of her book – subjects might include mistreatment of interned alien civilians, or the coercion of cultural minority prisoners to form individual national units, such as Casement’s Irish Brigade or Masaryk’s Czech Brigade. Such additions to this volume would be superfluous.</p>
<p>Overall this book synthesizes a plentiful, polylingual track of literature on the subject of violence against prisoners of war, and will allow scholars to push ahead their own research agendas aided by the valuable research conducted by Jones.</p>
