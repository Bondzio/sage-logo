<abstract>
<p>A review of the literature on Rett syndrome (RS) for school-based professionals is presented from a behavioral perspective. A description of RS is provided, including distinctive physical, behavioral, and emotional features, diagnostic criteria for classic and <italic>formes frustes</italic> forms of RS, and stages of the disorder. The similarities and differences between RS and autism are reviewed. Controversies regarding the classification of RS are presented, including whether RS should be classified as a neurological or psychiatric condition and whether RS should remain classified as a pervasive developmental disorder. Last, a variety of options for the treatment of RS are discussed.</p>

<body>
<p>Since its earliest description by Austrian physician Andreas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0143034311403058">Rett (1966)</xref>, Rett’s syndrome (RS) has existed in measured obscurity as perhaps the most identifiable but least discussed classification in a compendium that makes up Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0143034311403058">American Psychiatric Association, 2000</xref>). Estimates of RS globally have varied from 0.36/10,000 females to 1/10,000 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0143034311403058">Choi, Lee, Huh, &amp; Kim, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0143034311403058">Fujino &amp; Hashimoto, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0143034311403058">Hagberg, Aicardi, Dias, &amp; Ramos, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0143034311403058">Hagberg, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0143034311403058">Kerr &amp; Stephenson, 1985</xref>) to approximately 1 in 22,800 females (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0143034311403058">Kozinetz et al., 1993</xref>). Rett’s syndrome exists in all races and all countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0143034311403058">Tsai, 1992</xref>) from North Dakota (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0143034311403058">Burd, Vesley, Martsolf, &amp; Kerbeshian, 2005</xref>) to Australia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0143034311403058">Laurvick et al., 2006</xref>). The international distribution of RS has lead to the formation of an international genetics data base (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0143034311403058">Bebbington et al., 2008</xref>) for the etiological study of the disorder and the establishment of the International Rett’s Syndrome Association (IRSA). The IRSA offers support to families, fosters research, and disseminates information about RS globally. However, despite multi-site international etiology research studies and the IRSA’s efforts to globally disseminate information about RS, there is still little recognition and understanding of the syndrome within the domain of schools. This is reflected in the speculation that there was a minimum of 2,000 documented cases of RS across the globe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0143034311403058">Perry, 1991</xref>). School psychologists internationally can be an invaluable resource to families with children with RS, in that schools are often the venue where developmental concerns are first noted. For school psychologists, this predicates a knowledge and understanding of RS that leads to accurate identification, correct referral, effective treatments, and proper placement within appropriate classroom settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0143034311403058">Symes &amp; Humphrey, 2010</xref>).</p>
<sec id="sec1-0143034311403058"><title>Symptoms of Rett syndrome</title>
<p>Rett syndrome is a neurological disorder typically diagnosed in childhood and found almost exclusively in females (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0143034311403058">Hagberg et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0143034311403058">Leonard et al., 2001</xref>). The disorder is characterized by normal development until approximately 7 to 18 months of age, followed by a slowing of development and eventual regression. Within 18 months of onset, girls with RS typically display severe dementia, autistic features, loss of purposeful hand movements, ataxia, and acquired microcephaly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0143034311403058">Hagberg et al., 1983</xref>).</p>
<p>The disorder is caused by an X-linked MECP2 gene mutation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0143034311403058">Amir et al., 1999</xref>). Prognosis for RS is generally poor. Girls with the disorder display very limited expressive communication, become non-ambulatory, and score within the range of severe or profound mental retardation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0143034311403058">Bashina, Simashkova, Grachev, &amp; Gorbachevskaya, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0143034311403058">Lavås, Slotte, Jochym-Nygren, Van Doorn, &amp; Witt-Engerström, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0143034311403058">Smith, Klevstrand, &amp; Lovaas, 1995</xref>). In rare cases, however, some individuals with RS will display some ability to utilize grammatically correct expressive language (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0143034311403058">Gillberg, 1997</xref>).</p>
<sec id="sec2-0143034311403058"><title>Physical symptoms</title>
<p>Physical symptoms of RS include scoliosis, deceleration of head growth, seizures, poor muscle control (ataxia), difficulty co-ordinating bodily movements (apraxia), foot deformities, dystonia, and nutritional problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0143034311403058">Bashina et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0143034311403058">Hagberg &amp; Witt-Engerström, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0143034311403058">Klin &amp; Volkmar, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0143034311403058">Smith et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0143034311403058">Wolf-Schein, 1996</xref>). Scoliosis frequently occurs in girls with RS. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0143034311403058">Bassett and Tolo (1990)</xref> reported that 119 out of 258 patients (48%) in their study had scoliosis; furthermore, the likelihood of an RS female developing this condition increases with age. Hagberg and Witt-Engerström reported that over half (14 out of 25) of the patients with RS in their study had foot deformities, which contribute to difficulties with mobility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0143034311403058">Hagberg &amp; Witt- Engerström, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0143034311403058">Larsson &amp; Witt-Engerström, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>Ataxia often manifests itself as a stiff or awkward gait, stumbling, difficulty controlling trunk muscles resulting in jerky bodily movements, or difficulty engaging in typical play movements (e.g. jumping). Apraxia is observed in children who display difficulty or inability to change bodily positions independently, such as moving from lying down to sitting, or from sitting to standing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0143034311403058">Bashina et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0143034311403058">Larsson &amp; Witt-Engerström, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>Epileptic seizures are also seen among RS children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0143034311403058">Klin &amp; Volkmar, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0143034311403058">Sansom, Krishnan, Corbett, &amp; Kerr, 1993</xref>). Seizures are typically characterized by focal somatomotor fits, although generalized seizures are also seen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0143034311403058">Bashina et al., 2002</xref>). Bahi-Buisson and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0143034311403058">Bahi-Buisson et al., 2008</xref>) surveyed parents of children diagnosed with RS regarding the occurrence of epileptic and non-epileptic seizures. Parents reported seizures in 70% of the sample. They also reported seizures as negatively impacting many areas of functioning, including alertness, communication, and motor abilities. Additionally, families reported an increase in psycho-social stressors surrounding the seizures, namely fear regarding their child’s overall quality of life.</p>

<sec id="sec3-0143034311403058"><title>Behavioral phenotype</title>
<p>The behavioral phenotype of RS includes behaviors that occur in a larger proportion of individuals with the disorder when compared to a control group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0143034311403058">Mount, Hastings, Reilly, Cass, &amp; Charman, 2002</xref>). Such behaviors include stereotypic hand movements, loss of purposeful hand skills, repeatedly putting the hands in the mouth, unusual sleep patterns (i.e. sleeping less during the night but napping frequently during the day), breath-holding, hyperventilation, swallowing air, expelling air or saliva forcefully from the mouth, facial grimacing, expressionless face, body rocking, bruxism, and indifference to others or objects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0143034311403058">Klin &amp; Volkmar, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0143034311403058">Mount, Charman, Hastings, Reilly, &amp; Cass, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0143034311403058">Mount, Hastings, Reilly, Cass, &amp; Charman, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0143034311403058">Smith et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0143034311403058">Wolf-Schein, 1996</xref>).</p>
<p>Stereotypic hand movements are the most frequently observed behavioral characteristic in RS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0143034311403058">Mount et al., 2001</xref>). Mount noted that the child lacks purposeful hand use, displays a limited repertoire of hand movements, and tends to experience difficulty controlling hand stereotypies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0143034311403058">Mount et al., 2001</xref>). These stereotypies often accompany facial grimaces involving movements of the mouth and tongue. Body rocking can also occur when stereotypical hand movements are prevented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0143034311403058">Mount, Charman, et al., 2002</xref>). Functional assessments have indicated that environmental manipulations do not impact the frequency of stereotypic hand movements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0143034311403058">Roane, Piazza, Sgro, Volkert, &amp; Anderson, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0143034311403058">Wales, Charman, &amp; Mount, 2004</xref>). In addition to these stereotypic hand movements, RS children may become unable to hold objects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0143034311403058">Bashina et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0143034311403058">Hanks, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0143034311403058">Piazza, Anderson, &amp; Fisher, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0143034311403058">Yasuhara &amp; Sugiyama, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>Children with RS sleep less each night than typically developing controls, but because they take frequent daytime naps, RS children actually tend to get more sleep per 24-hour period than controls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0143034311403058">McArthur &amp; Budden, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0143034311403058">Mount et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0143034311403058">Young et al., 2007</xref>). These children wake up to uncontrollable fits of crying, screaming, or laughing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0143034311403058">Mount, Charman, et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0143034311403058">Young et al., 2007</xref>). Some evidence suggests these are more prevalent in younger children (under age 7-years-old) as opposed to adolescents and adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0143034311403058">Young et al., 2007</xref>). Respiratory abnormalities, characterized by patterns of apnea (i.e. breath holding) and hyperventilating typically lasting one to two minutes, are also commonly seen in RS children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0143034311403058">Mount et al., 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>Self-injurious behavior is also reported in children with RS. In one study, parents of children with RS reported that 52 out of 107 children (48.6%) displayed self-injurious behavior. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0143034311403058">Sansom et al. (1993)</xref> noted biting of hands as most common; however, in more extreme cases, head-banging, hair-pulling, and scratching can occur.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-0143034311403058"><title>Emotional features</title>
<p>Some children with RS display distinctive emotional traits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0143034311403058">Mount, Charman, et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0143034311403058">Sansom et al., 1993</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0143034311403058">Hanks (1986)</xref> reported that irritability among individuals with RS is particularly distressing. In a study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0143034311403058">Mount, Charman et al. (2002)</xref>, parents reported that their child with RS becomes frightened or panicked with changes in body position, or the introduction to novel situations. Parents also noted uncontrollable crying or screaming, irritability, and instances of appearing miserable for no apparent reason. However, when physical disabilities are controlled for, there is no clinically significant difference in emotional and behavioral disturbances between girls with RS and girls with severe/profound mental retardation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0143034311403058">Mount, Charman, Hastings, Reilly, &amp; Cass, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Additionally, there is evidence that excessive and inappropriate emotionality may diminish in adulthood. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0143034311403058">Sansom et al. (1993)</xref> reported that 70% of the children in their study experienced observable episodes of low mood and 75% experienced episodes of anxiety, yet these mood fluctuations tended to decrease with age. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0143034311403058">Mount, Hastings, et al. (2002)</xref> reported that adult women with RS displayed less irritability, hyperactivity, and inappropriate speech when compared to a control group of adults with intellectual disabilities.</p>

<sec id="sec5-0143034311403058"><title>Rett syndrome: Criteria for diagnosis</title>
<p>A group of representatives from the Centers for Disease Control and the International Rett Syndrome Association have proposed three sets of diagnostic criteria for RS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0143034311403058">Rett Syndrome Diagnostic Criteria Work Group, 1988</xref>). A diagnosis of RS remains tentative until age 2- to 5-years-old. Necessary criteria include: apparently normal pre and perinatal period; apparently normal psychomotor development through the first 6 months (may appear normal for up to 18 months); normal head circumference at birth; deceleration of head growth between age 5 months and 4 years; loss of acquired purposeful hand skills between ages 6 and 30 months, temporally associated with communication dysfunction and social withdrawal; development of severely impaired expressive and receptive language; presence of apparent severe psychomotor retardation; stereotypic hand movements (such as hand wringing/squeezing, clapping/tapping, and ‘washing’/rubbing automatisms): and appearance of gait apraxia and truncal apraxia/ataxia between ages 1 and 4 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0143034311403058">Rett Syndrome Diagnostic Criteria Work Group, 1988</xref>).</p>
<p>Criteria that are often present but not necessary for a diagnosis were also noted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0143034311403058">Rett Syndrome Diagnostic Criteria Work Group, 1988</xref>). These include: breathing dysfunction (periodic apnea during wakefulness, intermittent hyperventilation, breath-holding spells, and forced expulsion of air or saliva); EEG abnormalities (slow waking background and intermittent rhythmical slowing, epileptiform discharges with or without clinical seizures); spasticity (often with associated development of muscle wasting and dystonia); peripheral vasomotor disturbances; scoliosis; growth retardation; and hypotrophic small feet. The Work Group also addressed exclusionary criteria, which include symptoms that cannot be present in order for the child to be diagnosed with RS. They include: evidence of intrauterine growth retardation; organomegaly or other signs of storage disease; retinopathy or optic atrophy; microcephaly at birth; evidence of perinatally acquired brain damage; existence of identifiable metabolic or other progressive neurological disorder; and acquired neurological disorders resulting from severe infections or head trauma. On an added note, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0143034311403058">Woods, Parkinson, and Lewis (2010)</xref> have affirmed the importance of school practitioners being aware of the varied reactions and responses that disabled children might have while being assessed. This holds particularly true with children having RS or ASD.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec6-0143034311403058"><title>Atypical or formes frustes Rett syndrome</title>
<p>The term <italic>formes frustes</italic> Rett syndrome is often used to describe atypical forms of Rett Syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0143034311403058">Tsai, 1992</xref>). Hagberg and Witt-Engerström have suggested the following criteria for this form: female sex; at least 13 years of age; normal pre, peri, and neonatal period; normal development for first year of life; period of distinct developmental decline, including loss of hand skills and language; signs in teenage years of moderate or severe mental retardation, apraxia or partial apraxia, dysphasia, stereotypies (atypical), and extensive laboratory investigations are unrevealing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0143034311403058">Hagberg &amp; Witt- Engerström, 1986</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec7-0143034311403058"><title>Stages of Rett syndrome</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0143034311403058">Bashina et al. (2002)</xref> report that 80% of individuals with RS had a history of being born via normal pregnancies, while 20% experienced mild abnormalities in the pre or perinatal period. Prior to onset, 70% displayed typical mental development, while the remaining 30% were delayed by 2–4 months in gross motor development. Overall, most children who develop RS initially appear social, extroverted, emotionally responsive, and it is a minority of children who appear overly passive. Subtle symptoms may develop prior to the onset of RS, including discrete motor retardation, muscular hypotonia, other alterations in motor abilities, and occasional trembling movements in the neck (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0143034311403058">Mercadante, Van der Gaag, &amp; Schwartzman, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0143034311403058">Percy, Gillberg, Hagberg, &amp; Witt-Engerström, 1990</xref>).</p>
<p>Four stages of RS have been generally accepted in the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0143034311403058">Hagberg &amp; Witt-Engerström, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0143034311403058">Percy et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0143034311403058">Perry, 1991</xref>). Stage I, also known as <italic>Early Onset Stagnation Stage</italic>, occurs from approximately 6 months to 18 months of age. This stage includes developmental stagnation, changed communicability and eye contact, unspecified personality deviation, diminishing interest in play, unspecified and episodic hand waving, and decelerating skull growth. Stage II, the <italic>Rapid Destructive Stage</italic>, is usually weeks or several months in duration and occurs between 1–4 years of age. This stage is characterized by developmental deterioration, ‘pseudotoxic’ symptoms, Rett stereotypies and autistic manifestations, severe dementia, loss of hand skill and use, clumsiness, apraxia, ataxia, respiratory abnormalities, and emotional fits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0143034311403058">Hagberg &amp; Witt- Engerström, 1986</xref>).</p>
<p>Stage III, the <italic>Pseudostationary Stage</italic>, lasts years and typically begins during the preschool or early school-age years. Dementia becomes less severe and stabilizes, mental retardation becomes apparent, emotional contact increases, characteristics of autism decrease, gross motor skills deteriorate to a variable degree, gait apraxia and jerky truncal movements become apparent, and epileptic symptoms become common. Stage IV, is known as the <italic>Late Motor Deterioration Stage</italic>. In this stage, the individual displays decreasing mobility and is often confined to a wheelchair, has multiple handicaps, and displays loss of weight and accompanying muscle atrophy. Additionally, scoliosis becomes severe, trophic foot disturbances occur (e.g. Freiberg’s disease), emotional contact continues to improve, epilepsy becomes less severe, growth slows but pubertal development remains typical, and the child becomes prone to staring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0143034311403058">Hagberg &amp; Witt-Engerström, 1986</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec8-0143034311403058"><title>Differentiating between Rett syndrome and autism</title>
<p>Upon seeing a client with RS, school-based practitioners tend to notice autistic features rather than symptoms of mental retardation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0143034311403058">Tsai, 1992</xref>). A 2003 study by Mount et al. indicated that six out of 15 children (40%) with RS scored above the cutoff on the Autism Behavior Checklist (ABC) for ‘high probability of autism’, compared to just one out of 15 children (7.1%) from the severe and profound mental retardation control group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0143034311403058">Mount et al., 2003</xref>). Similarly, three out of four (75%) of the RS children in a study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0143034311403058">Fiumara, Pavone, Siciliano, and Nigro (1990)</xref> were originally misdiagnosed as having autism, although the measures used for diagnosis were not noted.</p>
<p>Recently, researchers have proposed that the diagnostic criteria for the autism spectrum disorders have broadened to the extent that other disorders with characteristics similar to autism can be included within the category of pervasive developmental disorders (PDD; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0143034311403058">Gernsbacher, Dawson, &amp; Goldsmith, 2005</xref>). Others have suggested a benefit in having the category of PDD remain broad, but with different disorders being subcategorized sufficiently to best meet the needs of both scientists and practitioners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0143034311403058">Rutter &amp; Schopler, 1992</xref>). Expanding these diagnostic criteria may result in disorders with some semblance to autism (e.g. RS or <italic>fragile X syndrome</italic>) being classified as a PDD, leading to confusion as to what exactly is meant by an ‘autism’ diagnosis. Another example of a disorder frequently diagnosed as autism, but verifiably different is <italic>Landau-Kleffner syndrome</italic>. As with RS, the observable characteristics of Landau-Kleffner often fit the diagnostic criteria for autism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0143034311403058">Nass, Gross, Wisoff, &amp; Devinsky, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0143034311403058">US Department of Health and Human Services, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Under the current classification, RS and autism are both labeled as PDD. Although they have similar symptomology, it is extremely important to recognize the differences between the two disorders. First, each disorder has a very different prognosis. Children with RS tend to continue to deteriorate, while autistic children generally advance in development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0143034311403058">Rutter &amp; Schopler, 1992</xref>). A second reason that this differentiation is critical is that RS is accompanied by a set of unique physical difficulties, and misdiagnosis can have serious implications. For example, RS requires physiotherapy for muscle weakness and special care to address epilepsy seizures. These could be overlooked if the child was misdiagnosed as having autism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0143034311403058">Rutter &amp; Schopler, 1992</xref>).</p>
<p>Clearing up the confusion between RS and autism would help school-based practitioners make decisions as to how a particular female child should be diagnosed. Properly distinguishing between RS and autism could potentially lead to the formation of a model of neuropathological development for both disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0143034311403058">Mount et al., 2003</xref>). Finally, clearly distinguishing between RS and autism is critical because a retrospective diagnosis of RS may be extremely difficult or impossible. Once stages III and IV have been reached, there is often a lack of evidence regarding the early stages of the disorder that is critical for a proper diagnosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0143034311403058">Percy et al., 1990</xref>).</p>
<sec id="sec9-0143034311403058"><title>Similarities between Rett Syndrome and Autism</title>
<p>As with autism, RS children typically show symptoms before age 2, display disordered social and environmental interactions, and have language deficits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0143034311403058">Fiumara et al., 1990</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0143034311403058">Percy, Zoghbi, Lewis, and Jankovic (1988)</xref> reported that although RS and autism are actually quite different, several of the core features of autism are also seen in RS. These include poor eye contact, absence of appropriate facial expressiveness, speech disturbances, and body rocking. Autistic-like behaviors may be most evident in children with RS during its early stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0143034311403058">Wolf-Schein, 1996</xref>).</p>
<p>Others have argued a possible genetic link between autism and RS. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0143034311403058">Gillberg, Ehlers, and Wahlström (1990)</xref> reported a case of three extended family members, two of whom had been diagnosed with autism, and one of whom had been diagnosed with RS. Although these diagnoses may be coincidental or misdiagnoses, the authors argue that given the rarity of these disorders in the general population, the occurrence of these diagnoses within the same family is more likely due to genetics than coincidence.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec10-0143034311403058"><title>The classification of Rett syndrome</title>
<p>When addressing whether RS should remain classified as a PDD, it is important to recognize some of the key distinctions between RS and autism. Retts is a deteriorating disorder of the brain, whereas autism is a developmental anomaly where individuals often improve (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0143034311403058">Gath, 1989</xref>). Furthermore, RS has a unique clinical picture and course, and unlike autism, it occurs almost exclusively in girls (autism occurs more often in boys; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0143034311403058">Rutter &amp; Schopler, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0143034311403058">Wing, 1996</xref>).</p>
<p>There are also behavioral differences between the disorders. RS children display characteristic hand stereotypies and a loss of purposeful hand skills. Children with autism may also engage in stereotypic hand movements, but they do not lose the ability to use their hands purposefully (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0143034311403058">Fiumara et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0143034311403058">Mount et al., 2003</xref>). Deficits in social interaction are also quite different. Children with RS tend to maintain eye contact, whereas children with autism avert gaze (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0143034311403058">Holm, 1985</xref>). Children with RS often appear to enjoy social interaction and show signs of attempting to communicate, namely by using eye movements, finger pointing, or other gestures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0143034311403058">Fiumara et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0143034311403058">Lavås et al., 2006</xref>). Finally, while episodes of breath-holding are a common symptom of RS, such episodes are not usually seen in children with autism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0143034311403058">Klin &amp; Volkmar, 1995</xref>).</p>
<p>Children with RS regress significantly in their motor abilities and display marked characteristic difficulties in gait and trunk movements. This does not typically occur in autism unless there is a comorbid condition, such as cerebral palsy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0143034311403058">Fiumara et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0143034311403058">Klin &amp; Volkmar, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0143034311403058">Mount et al., 2003</xref>). These children also frequently experience seizures and display mental retardation generally more severe than in autism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0143034311403058">Klin &amp; Volkmar, 1995</xref>).</p>
<p>There has been some debate in the literature as to whether RS should be classified a neurological disorder or a psychological disorder. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0143034311403058">Tsai (1992)</xref> argues that neurological disorders that lead to emotional and behavioral problems should also be classified as psychiatric disorders, as this practice will recognize the ‘whole person’ rather than focusing solely on the brain versus the mind. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0143034311403058">Rutter (1994)</xref> states that although RS is a neurological condition, it initially presents as abnormal mental development. Therefore, it is unimportant as to exactly where RS is classified in the DSM and the ICD, but it needs to be classified somewhere either in the neurological or mental disorders sections, or both.</p>
<p>There has been additional debate regarding the classification of RS as a PDD. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0143034311403058">Percy et al. (1988)</xref> refer to autism as a broad, overarching category that has embedded in it several distinct disorders (e.g. Autistic disorder, Rett’s disorder, Childhood Disintegrative disorder, Asperger’s disorder, Pervasive Developmental disorder&amp;mdash;not otherwise specified). Whereas children with autism display many behavioral characteristics that could result from different disorders, one of which may be RS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0143034311403058">Fiumara et al., 1990</xref>), the current classification can blur important distinctions.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0143034311403058">Rutter and Schopler (1992)</xref> argue for the appropriateness of RS remaining classified under the PDDs because RS initially presents with symptoms indicative of a PDD, rather than symptoms indicating a neurological disorder. Mazzocco and colleagues argue that RS should remain classified as a PDD due to the frequency of autistic behaviors that are present in girls with RS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0143034311403058">Mazzocco et al., 1998</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0143034311403058">Tsai (1992)</xref> states that it is appropriate to classify RS as a PDD, but it remains unclear whether RS completely meets the clinical criteria for a PDD. Specifically, he suggests that it is not clear whether the deficits displayed in an individual with RS are deviant in terms of the individual’s mental age. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0143034311403058">Tsai (1992)</xref> also states that it would be inappropriate to classify RS as a medical condition associated with PDDs and argues that clear identification is essential for effective research.</p>
<p>However, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0143034311403058">Gillberg (1994)</xref> appears to disagree strongly with Tsai and argues that RS should not remain categorized as a PDD; rather, it should be classified as a medical condition associated with autism. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0143034311403058">Mount et al. (2003)</xref> agree, stating that RS children do not exhibit increased occurrence of behaviors consistent with the principal deficits in autism, and express uncertainty regarding RS being classified as a PDD.</p>
<p>Finally, it has also been argued that the boundary between autism and its milder forms (e.g. Asperger’s) cannot be determined with certainty without a biological or psychological marker to distinguish these disorders. Current increases in diagnosis appear closely tied to changes in classification systems as well as changes in how the educational system views children with PDD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0143034311403058">Gernsbacher et al., 2005</xref>). Confusion exists as to if the autism spectrum consists of one large disorder with many subtypes or several different disorders with similar symptomology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0143034311403058">Willemsen-Swinkels &amp; Buitelaar, 2002</xref>). As school practitioners, the term ‘autism’ guides treatment and assessment decisions. To be perceived as a definable disorder, autism needs to stand alone and not serve as an umbrella under which many definable disorders such as RS reside. If it better serves us to have autism be an early ‘catch basin’ for anything that might fit the criteria, with the understanding that later we will sort out the various details of an exact diagnosis, then the current format works. However, does this ‘sorting out’ operate for a global disorder within the current model for training school practitioners, and is there evidence that it is beneficial? Current research is suggesting that autism is swelling up to include many of the disorders of mental retardation as well as others (e.g. Fragile-<italic>X</italic>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0143034311403058">Gernsbacher et al., 2005</xref>). This trend might lead to more confusion, rather than less, which is inconsistent with the goals of the DSM and which might hinder appropriate diagnosis and treatment.</p>

<sec id="sec11-0143034311403058"><title>Treatments</title>
<p>It is important for school psychologists to consider which areas of functioning are effected in RS, as well as which areas are not affected, in order to most effectively tailor treatment to specific needs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0143034311403058">Kerr, 2003</xref>). There are several treatment options for RS, including behavioral interventions, physiotherapy, music therapy, sensory-motor rehabilitation, and pharmacological interventions.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0143034311403058">Bat-Haee (1994)</xref> reported a successful instance of utilizing behavioral treatment in a 24-year-old underweight female with RS to regain purposeful use of her hands (by eating and drinking independently), increase her ambulation, and increase her weight to a healthy range. Procedures such as shaping, graduated guidance, and regulating the patients’ hands were used in order to help her meet her first two goals. In order to increase her weight, the patient was given double-portion meal trays and more than enough time to finish her food at each meal. The patient gained 10 lb and reached a healthy weight range. At 6-month follow-up, the patient had maintained her gains in all three areas. Other researchers have also demonstrated that a behavioral intervention that consists of prompting, modeling, and verbal praise can increase independent eating skills in children with RS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0143034311403058">Piazza et al., 1993</xref>).</p>
<p>Behavioral intervention in the form of a ‘hands down’ procedure, either with or without the addition of a differential reinforcement of incompatible behaviors (DRI) component, has also been shown to be effective in reducing stereotypical hand movements and hand-biting in RS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0143034311403058">Roane et al., 2001</xref>). Although these behaviors are typically maintained by automatic or intrinsic reinforcement, and do not change with environmental manipulations, the relationship between the behavior and reinforcement can be altered by interrupting or preventing the behavior from occurring.</p>
<p>Other researchers have utilized a behavioral intervention consisting of adults altering their interactional style with a female child diagnosed with RS, as well as teaching the child functional skills, such as toy play and operant behaviors (to encourage the child to use purposeful hand movements in order to manipulate her environment). While the change in adult interactional styles seemed to have substantial effects in reducing some of the child’s challenging behaviors (e.g. stereotypic hand movements, body rocking, blowing), teaching the child to acquire new skills proved more difficult and did not produce any meaningful changes in the child’s level of functioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0143034311403058">Evans &amp; Meyer, 1999</xref>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0143034311403058">Watson, Umansky, Marcy, Johnston, and Repacholi (1996)</xref> have reported that non-functional behaviors that are typically associated with RS (e.g. hand clasping) compete with other, more functional behaviors (e.g. reaching). The use of ‘contingency games’ to increase functional behavior, including reaching, kicking, eye movement, and vocalization demonstrated that the participant was able to respond to the contingencies implemented and learn to increase her functional behaviors as a result.</p>
<p>Smith et al. (2005) did not find behavioral treatment to be effective in three cases of young girls diagnosed with RS. At intake, all three participants scored in the moderate to severe range of mental retardation, but at follow-up the functioning of each had declined so severely that they were no longer testable. Additionally, two out of the three girls were institutionalized by age 6-years-old, and the third girl continued to display serious difficulties at home and at school.</p>
<p>Physiotherapy may also be an effective and necessary component in treating RS. Orthoses, daily exercises, gross motor activities, surgeries, and teaching or re-teaching methods to increase mobility can be essential for improving ambulation and preventing deformities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0143034311403058">Larsson &amp; Witt-Engerström, 2001</xref>). Physical, occupational, and music therapy have also been reported to be effective in helping the client to maintain or improve daily functioning, preventing physical deformities, assisting with positioning and mobility, and keeping RS children involved in their environments. These therapies can be particularly helpful in improving ataxia, spasticity, ambulation, spinal deformities, hand function, interaction with the environment, feeding, irritability, and family coping skills (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0143034311403058">Hanks, 1986</xref>).</p>
<p>Music therapy has also been reported to be beneficial for children with RS. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0143034311403058">Wigram and Lawrence (2005)</xref> reported that using music during an assessment of physical symptoms of a 6-year-old female with RS increased awareness, interaction, eye contact, vocalization, smiling, and laughing and decreased hand stereotypies while allowing the girl’s truncal hypotonia and hand function to be assessed.</p>
<p>Sensory-motor rehabilitation programs can also be beneficial for children with RS. Researchers conducted a single-case study to investigate the effects of a computerized program to improve visual-motor coordination as well as a sensory-motor rehabilitation program over a period of three years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0143034311403058">Pizzamiglio et al., 2008</xref>). These programs taught skills in a measured manner that was increasingly difficult for the child. Post-test data indicate that upon completion of the study, this child displayed significant improvements in her cognitive and motor abilities (e.g. functional hand use, intentional watching of people and objects, receptive language) while also decreasing challenging behaviors (e.g. hand-biting, stereotypic hand movements, inconsolable crying).</p>
<p>Lastly, medical treatments may also manage difficult behaviors among individuals with RS. Evidence suggests that pipamperone may be effective in reducing severe sleep disturbances, while carbogen treatments can successfully reduce life threatening breathing abnormalities (i.e. severe hypocapnoea; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0143034311403058">Smeets et al., 2006</xref>). Researchers have found the atypical antipsychotic, olanzapine, was successful in reducing severe agitation and self-injurious behavior in a 16-year-old female with RS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0143034311403058">Bober, Sabzwari, &amp; Star, 2005</xref>). Other researchers report that cerebrolysin, a brain-derived peptidergic drug known to support neuronal survival, improved brain function in nine RS girls. This drug did not increase frequency or severity of seizures; in fact, it appeared to eliminate seizures in one case (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0143034311403058">Gorbachevskaya, Bashina, Gratchev, &amp; Iznak, 2001</xref>). Some research suggests the efficacy of melatonin in reducing latency of sleep onset, with data also suggesting a mild trend towards increasing overall sleep time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0143034311403058">McArthur &amp; Budden, 1998</xref>). Additionally, preliminary evidence suggested that melatonin treatments successfully treated the sleep disorders of two girls with RS for over two years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0143034311403058">Miyamoto, Oki, Takahashi, &amp; Okuno, 1999</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec12-0143034311403058" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title>
<p>For school psychologists, an effective understanding of RS, its diagnostic characteristics, and its most effective treatments are essential. Currently, RS is classified in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders as a PDD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0143034311403058">American Psychiatric Association, 2000</xref>). If RS remains classified in this manner, it is logical to conclude that behavioral interventions should be used to increase adaptive behavior and decrease maladaptive behavior in individuals with RS in a fashion similar to individuals with autism. School psychologists should be familiar with functional behavior assessment, effective behavioral interventions, and positive behavioral support techniques to help design effective treatment programs for RS.</p>
<p>In autism and RS, stereotypic bodily movements and deficits in communication are common symptoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0143034311403058">American Psychiatric Association, 2000</xref>). Self-injurious behavior is also seen among individuals with autism and RS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0143034311403058">Mash &amp; Wolfe, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0143034311403058">Sansom et al., 1993</xref>). Behavioral interventions based on effective functional behavior assessments have been demonstrated to be successful in improving such symptoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0143034311403058">Magiati &amp; Howlin, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0143034311403058">Sidener, Carr, &amp; Firth, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0143034311403058">Van Camp, Vollmer, &amp; Daniel, 2001</xref>). Therefore, while behavioral interventions are not a ‘cure’ for children with RS, they have shown to effectively treat many of the core behavioral symptoms of this disorder.</p>
