<abstract>
<p>This study presents the effect of impact energy on the static failure pressures, and fatigue life of composite pipes. The specimens manufactured have inner diameter 100 mm and length 400 mm. Impact tests were realized at three different energy levels 5.0, 7.5, and 10.0 J. Force–deflection curves were plotted. Impacted and non-impacted specimens were subjected to internal pressure statically and dynamically to obtain failure pressure and fatigue life of the composite pipe, respectively. Results indicate that leakage and eruption pressures for static test decrease and perspiration, leakage, and eruption cycles decrease by lateral impact.</p>

<p>Fiber-reinforced composite structures have a wide range of applications because of their high stiffnesses and strength-to-weight ratios. Pressure tubes, for example pressure fuel tanks, rocket motor cases, and pipes, may be made of fiber-reinforced composite materials. These tubes are frequently fabricated using filament winding method, which involves winding a resin-impregnated continuous filament around a rotating mandrel in a desired pattern. Winding angles, number of layers, fiber volume fractions, internal pressure, and environmental conditions affect the strength of the tubes. Matrix cracks and delamination in composite structures can lead to catastrophic failures, especially in corrosive and cyclic loading conditions. During the utilization of filament-wound glass fiber-reinforced plastic (FW-GFRP) tubes, there are possibilities of impact loading such as dropping, knocking, and/or rough handling. Investigation on the subject of the strength reduction mechanism of the composite tube after these low-velocity and/or low-energy impact is worthwhile.</p>
<p>Sari<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0021998311425717">1</xref></sup> investigated the sea water effect on composite pipes subjected to impact loading. In his study, specimens with dry and sea water immersion times of 3 months were used for impact and fatigue-after-impact tests. Onder et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0021998311425717">2</xref></sup> studied the determination of burst failure pressures of composite pipes, experimentally, analytically, and numerically using finite element for various filament winding angles and different temperatures. Tarakcioglu et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0021998311425717">3</xref></sup> analytically and experimentally worked on the effect of surface cracks on the strength for FW-GFRP pipes. They set the specimens at three different orientations with surface crack which have several notch–aspect and notch-to-thickness ratios in the axial direction. Curtis et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0021998311425717">4</xref></sup> investigated the damage, deformation, and residual burst strength of FW-GFRP pipes subjected to impact or quasi-static indentation. Naik<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0021998311425717">5</xref></sup> studied many different effects of environmental conditions such as sea water immersion, dry heat, salt spray, humidity, and impact on the burst pressure performance of the glass fiber-reinforced thermoset pipes, which are of two types, glass–epoxy and glass–vinylester. Arikan<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0021998311425717">6</xref></sup> performed a study on the failure analysis of FW-GFRP pipes with an inclined surface crack. Tests have been performed at seven different crack angles, 0°, 15°, 30°, 60°, 45°, 75°, and 90°. Gning et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0021998311425717">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0021998311425717">8</xref></sup> and Tarfaoui et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0021998311425717">9</xref></sup> carried out the identification and modeling of damage initiation and development in pipes subjected to quasi-static and drop weight impact for underwater applications. Some indications of how this damage affects the capacity of cylinders to resist external pressure loading were also presented. They noticed that the impact damage has been shown to significantly reduce the residual implosion strength of pipes. Chang<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0021998311425717">10</xref></sup> numerically and experimentally investigated the failure modes of damaged and undamaged composite pipes subjected to internal pressure and to qualitatively determine the relative burst pressure degradation. Kaneko<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0021998311425717">11</xref></sup> studied on the impact analyses of pressurized vessels by simulation. It is concluded that the relationship between burst mode and inner pressure can be clarified. In addition, some studies have been done on the burst strength of pipes with aluminum liner.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0021998311425717">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0021998311425717">13</xref></sup> A review of the literature revealed a number of studies focused on composite tubes. However, fewer investigations were conducted on the fatigue behavior of fiber-reinforced pipes with impacted surfaces. Experimental studies have been conducted on the fatigue behavior of pipes as an open-ended condition with a variety of parametric applications. Samanci et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0021998311425717">14</xref></sup> studied the fatigue damage behavior of [±75°]<sub>3</sub> filament-wound composite pipes with different surface cracks subject to alternating internal pressure. Some researchers applied three different maximum stress levels to composite pipes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0021998311425717">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0021998311425717">16</xref></sup> Some researchers exposed them to HCl acid and examined the failure strength by changing the parameters.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0021998311425717">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0021998311425717">18</xref></sup> On the other hand, Bie et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0021998311425717">19</xref></sup> proposed the fatigue evaluation model which is associated with the finite element analysis to explore the fatigue lifetime of FW-CFRP hydrogen storage vessel under cyclic internal pressure.</p>
<p>In this study, the residual failure pressures and fatigue life of [±55°]<sub>3</sub> filament-wound glass/epoxy pipes with internal static pressure and cycling loadings are investigated. While some of the pipes were subjected to impact at 5.0, 7.5, and 10.0 J impact energies, the others were not. Impacted and non-impacted specimens were statically and dynamically loaded by internal pressure. Leakage and eruption pressures for static test and perspiration, leakage, and eruption cycles were obtained in the composite pipes according to the impact energies.</p>

<sec id="sec2-0021998311425717"><title>Production of composite pipes</title>
<p>Composite pipes were manufactured with winding orientation angle [±55°]<sub>3</sub> and bandwidth 11 mm using a computer numerically controlled filament winding machine in Izoreel Firm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0021998311425717">Figure 1</xref>). Roving E-glass fiber with 600 Tex and 17 µm diameter was used as reinforcement. Epoxy EPR 828 resin and EPH 875 hardener were used as matrix. Composite pipes were cured at 130°C for 3 h. The inner diameter, length, and thickness of the specimens were approximately 100, 400, and 1.75 mm, respectively. The fiber volume fraction (<italic>V</italic><sub>f</sub>) of the pipes was calculated as 65%. To find fiber volume fraction, the weight of the fiber used in a pipe is obtained from the difference between the weights of the fiber rolls after and before winding. The total weight of the pipe after manufacture minus the weight of the fiber gives the weight of the epoxy used. The fiber volume fraction can be calculated from these weights and the densities of fiber and matrix.

<sec id="sec3-0021998311425717"><title>Test procedures</title>
<p>In this study, the impact behaviors of glass/epoxy composite pipes have been experimentally investigated for three different energies. Both static and dynamic internal pressure tests were performed on impacted composite pipes. These tests were maintained until the completely damaged specimen was obtaining.</p>
<sec id="sec4-0021998311425717"><title>Impact tests</title>
<p>The impact tests were performed using Fractovis Plus impact test machine with V-groove apparatus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0021998311425717">Figure 2</xref>). A number of tests were performed under three distinct impact energies 5.0, 7.5, and 10.0 J at room temperature. Every test was performed eight times and average values were calculated. During impact tests, an anti-rebound device which protects the composite was used in order to sustain repeated impact. Fractovis Plus test machine which is suitable for a wide variety of applications requiring low to high impact energies. The striker consists of three parts: a hemispherical nose with 12.7 mm diameter, force transducer with maximum loading capacity of 22.4 kN, and the striker body. The total impact mass including striker and the cross-head was 5.02 kg. Data acquisition system records the time vs. force data. The software used by the impact testing machine calculates time-dependent velocity, deflection, and absorbed energy values of the specimen using Newton’s second law and the kinematic equations.

<p>In this study, first, static pressure test was applied to the non-impacted and impacted composite pipes. The internal pressure produced by the testing machine was gradually increased 1 MPa/min loading rate up to the burst pressure. Every test is repeated four times and average values are calculated.</p>
<p>Second, dynamic internal pressure (fatigue) test was carried out for the non-impacted and impacted composite pipes. The applied maximum and minimum stresses were calculated from the values of 70% and 20% of burst hoop stress of the weakest sample. In these tests, the maximum and minimum stresses of the weakest specimen (impacted at 10 J) were found to be <italic>σ</italic><sub>max</sub> = 120 MPa and <italic>σ</italic><sub>min</sub> = 34 MPa, respectively. In the non-impacted and impacted samples, the same <italic>R</italic> = <italic>σ</italic><sub>min</sub>/<italic>σ</italic><sub>max</sub> ratio is used. The low cycle tests were applied with 0.5 Hz frequency and the cycle type was selected as punch. Every test was performed four times and the average cycle values were calculated.</p>

<p>In order to investigate the impact response of filament winding composite pipe specimens, impact tests were performed at three different impact energies, 5.0, 7.5, and 10.0 J.

<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0021998311425717">Figure 6</xref> shows the photos of impacted composite pipes for three different impact energy levels, 5.0, 7.5, and 10.0 J. From these photos, it can be seen that, delamination occurs at 5.0 J impact energy with a small area. The delamination propagates according to the fiber orientation angle with increasing impact energy. In the impacted specimens, indentation damage occurs at the impact point and matrix failure in the inner surface. Delamination exists at the lower interface because of the matrix cracks. Fiber breakage can also occur at the inner surface with the increase of the impact energy.
<fig id="fig6-0021998311425717" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><p>Illustration of impacted surface for three different energy levels of the composite pipes: (a) 5 J, (b) 7.5 J, and (c) 10 J.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0021998311425717-fig6.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>The contact force–deflection curves give significant information about the impact response of the composite materials tested. There are three types of contact force–deflection curves: rebounding, penetration, and perforation. In this study, rebounding type curve was observed for all the tests. In this curve, after a peak contact force, the deflection value decreases and the curve is closed. As long as a closed curve is observed, it is possible to say that the impact loading does not result in a serious damage to the specimen. The contact force–deflection curves of the specimens at three different levels of impact energy (5.0, 7.5, and 10.0 J) are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0021998311425717">Figure 7</xref>. As seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0021998311425717">Figure 7</xref>, during loading, the slope of the curve does not change by increasing the impact energy up to about 1.5 mm deflection. After that, the slopes of the curves decrease because of the matrix cracking and delamination. Peak force and maximum deflection increase with the increase of impact energy.

<sec id="sec9-0021998311425717"><title>Static pressure tests</title>
<p>During static pressure tests, a total of 16 tests were conducted, totally, including 4 non-impacted and 12 impacted (5.0, 7.5, and 10.0 J) specimens. Two different failure damages were observed during the static pressure test, leakage, last failure, or eruption. Because of the increase of the internal pressure, in the pipes, matrix cracks and delaminations occur and/or propagate. The leakage initiates when the micro-cracking and crack coalescence reached the point in which the pressurized oil can penetrate through these micro-cracks to reach the surface of the pipe.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0021998311425717">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0021998311425717">17</xref></sup> The oil penetrates through the cracks and helps to open and close them at each cycle by means of internal pressure. Therefore, on increasing the pressure, it is seen that leakage failure has occurred at the specimen surface. The eruption failures occur with additional matrix failure as a result of increasing the cycles. All the failure stages were observed with naked eyes.</p>
<p>Internal pressure tests were performed using a test apparatus in close-end condition. The middle region of the composite pipes swells due to internal pressure and behaves in a more elastic manner. So, less stress and less damage occur at this region. But the end part of the pipe, due to test apparatus and more thickness, shows more rigid behavior and also stress concentrations occur because of the radius at these parts. So, damage mainly occurred around the end region in case of non-impacted specimens. In the impacted specimens, indentation damage occurs at the impact point and matrix failure in the inner surface. Delamination exists at the lower interface because of the matrix cracks. Fiber breakage also occurs by the increase of the impact energy. In addition to these, matrix cracking and debonding in the fiber–matrix interfaces occur due to the increase of internal pressure. So leakage exists around the impact point.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0021998311425717">Figure 8</xref> shows the internal failure pressure vs. the impact energy curves for leakage and eruption failures. As impact energies increase from 0 J (non-impacted) to 5.0 J, leakage and eruption pressures decrease by about 34% and 40%, respectively. After this level of impact energy, failure pressures slowly decrease for two failure types.

</sec>
<sec id="sec10-0021998311425717"><title>Fatigue tests</title>
<p>Matrix failure, delamination, and debonding failure as a result of the impact loading in the pipe spread with each additional cycle. Fatigue tests cause three damage modes, named perspiration, leakage, and eruption. Perspiration is the phase before leakage failure. In this phase, wetness is observed on the specimen surface. These modes are observed according to the increase of the fatigue cycle. The whitening stage also can be observed in the filament winding direction because of the presence of matrix cracks and debonding of fiber and matrix (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11-0021998311425717">Figure 11</xref>).</p>
<p>The variations of fatigue cycle number according to the impact energy for perspiration, leakage, and eruption cases are given in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0021998311425717">Figure 9</xref>. It is seen from the figure that fatigue cycle suddenly decreases from 0 to 5.0 J impact energies. Reduction in fatigue cycle continues on increasing the impact energy. Fatigue cycle values of 7.5 and 10.0 J impact energies have been zoomed in the circle shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0021998311425717">Figure 9</xref>.

<p>Gemi et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0021998311425717">16</xref></sup> observed similar failure cases with the fatigue failure of our non-impacted pipes and have reported the following situations. According to their study, the leakage initiates when the matrix crack coalescence reach the point in which the pressurized oil can penetrate through these cracks to reach the surface of the pipe as surface wetting. Due to crack coalescence from inner surface toward outer surface, a leakage path is formed. After a few cycles, the pipes reach the point where small matrix cracks turn into bigger ones that allow an intense oil leakage. At each cycle, the oil penetrates through the matrix cracks and helps to open them, and the cracks quickly coalesce and turn the slight leakage into an intense one. So, it is observed that these cracks have opened and closed at each cycles by means of internal pressure. After that, failure turns to an eruption failure case. In our study, in the case of impacted and non-impacted pipes, one or more than one leakage points exist around the impact point (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-0021998311425717">Figure 10</xref>). Eruption occurs at the end of the experiment. More than one leakage can be explained as: Pressurized oil may penetrate and add new matrix cracks in the delamination regions. By increasing the fatigue cycle, matrix cracks increase and pressurized oil penetrates through these cracks to reach the surface of the pipe.

<p>In the fatigue tests of the non-impacted pipes, perspiration and leakage failures occur. As the cycle increases, leakage failure spreads to the whole surface of the vessels. This failure is called the last failure or eruption. In the case of fatigue tests of the impacted pipes, in general, eruption failure is observed. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11-0021998311425717">Figure 11</xref> shows the eruption failure of the pipe impacted for 7.5 J. Perspiration and leakage failures occur at 1805 and 2100 cycles, respectively. Finally, eruption happens at 4700 cycles.

<p>This article investigates the impact and the post-impact (internal static pressure and fatigue-after impact) behavior of the [±55°]<sub>3</sub> oriented glass/epoxy composite pipes. In the fatigue tests, internal pressure have been applied in the range between 20% and 70% of the burst pressure of the weakest pipe. The following conclusions can be drawn from the following results obtained.
<list id="list1-0021998311425717" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Impact characteristics of the composite pipe such as maximum contact force, maximum deflection, and absorbed energy were increased by increasing the impact energy.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>In the static internal pressure tests, leakage and eruption pressures decrease with the increase of impact energies. Failure pressure of non-impacted pipe was higher than the impacted one at 5.0 J, about 34% and 40% for leakage and eruption, respectively. After this level of impact energy, the failure pressures relatively decrease in a slow manner.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Fatigue life of the pipes decreases by transverse impact with comparing non-impacted pipes. So, in serves, impact event in the pressured composite pipe should be taken into consideration.</p></list-item>
