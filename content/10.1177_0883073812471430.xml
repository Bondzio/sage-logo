<abstract>
<p>The disclosure to a family of a child’s cerebral palsy is an important transformative event that has potential lasting implications. This article highlights specific challenges, the results of research into the disclosure process and what attributes should be sought for in this encounter by health care providers. Illustrative case vignettes are presented to concretely demonstrate the “dos and don’ts” of the disclosure. Suggestions will also be provided to improve the disclosure process.</p>

<title>Disclosure and Its Importance</title>
<p>Providing a diagnosis is a necessary aspect of medical care. To be effective, a physician must be a diagnostician because labeling provides a necessary conduit to guide investigations, referrals, effective therapy, and programmatic supports that are each predicated on diagnostic accuracy. Like a “key fitting into a lock,” a diagnosis opens the door for future provision of care. Inaccuracy or delay is fraught with missed steps that can irretrievably worsen outcome, because early intervention, no matter what the underlying diagnosis, does beneficially improve outcome. Cerebral palsy is no exception to these general observations.</p>
<p>From a parental perspective, a diagnosis of cerebral palsy represents a clear break. A parent’s cherished dream of a “normal” child is lost. Fears, guilt, and uncertainty weigh heavily. Family dynamics are irreversibly altered. The prospect of disability creates new challenges and expectations that can appear to be insurmountable. Lives are literally changed in a heartbeat.</p>
<p>For the parents, the initial disclosure of a diagnosis of cerebral palsy is the beginning of a process of adaptation that begins in a setting of crisis and apparent loss of control. The process of disclosure not unsurprisingly influences a parent’s later adaptation and coping mechanisms that are crucial to eventual parental attributes and actions on behalf of their affected child. This is critically important as parents are the essential drivers and partners of their child’s health care.</p>
<p>Increasingly, disability is construed as a socially created construct that is only partly explained by the medical intrinsic factors of bodily impairment.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0883073812471430">1</xref>
</sup> Context exerts a powerful influence on disability. For the child, it is the family that is the most important context. It is within the family cauldron that whatever intrinsic potential exists will be realized. The importance of disclosure in this crucial initial adaptation and coping is undeniable. Its modifiability suggests that changes in disclosure can improve initial adaptation and coping so that eventual child outcomes can be ameliorated.</p>
<sec id="section2-0883073812471430">
<title>The Challenge of Cerebral Palsy</title>
<p>Historically and currently, cerebral palsy is conceptualized and defined as a “symptom complex” that is intrinsically heterogeneous.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0883073812471430">2</xref>
</sup> The heterogeneity of cerebral palsy is evident in multiple domains. Although all individuals with cerebral palsy share a common core of neuromotor impairment that is acquired early in life (as a fetus, newborn, or infant) and that implies some degree of activity limitations, differences are readily evident with respect to neurologic subtype, functional severity (ie, gross motor, fine motor, communications skills), etiology, pathogenesis, spectrum of comorbidities experienced (ie, coexisting seizure disorders, cognitive limitations, behavioral difficulties, sensory impairments, orthopedic deformities), and expected outcomes over the life span.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0883073812471430">3</xref>
</sup> This innate heterogeneity can challenge the timing and process of disclosure of the diagnosis of the disorder itself.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0883073812471430">4</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Though two-thirds of individuals with cerebral palsy have a recognized risk factor for eventually manifesting this disorder (ie, prematurity, birth asphyxia, birth trauma, untreated neonatal jaundice, early central nervous system infection), the remainder have no evident risk factor to lead to a suspicion for diagnosis.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0883073812471430">2</xref>
</sup> In addition, early development is highly individualized following a unique trajectory within a wide range of norms, that rather than being smooth in configuration, can follow a saltatory configuration. Furthermore, it is well recognized that early neuromotor signs in infancy can be transitory in nature and resolve over time.</p>
<p>A final aspect to be considered is that cerebral palsy is a neurodevelopmental disability.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0883073812471430">5</xref>
</sup> That is, although the underlying mechanisms are neurologic, representing a “hard-wired” deficit in brain structure and function, this occurs within the developmental context of an ever-evolving and maturing brain. These developmental changes occur particularly rapidly early in life and thus the recognition in diagnosis of cerebral palsy must occur with a developmental sensitivity that is framed by a knowledge of chronologic expectations of “normality.”</p>
<p>For the above reasons, an accurate diagnosis of cerebral palsy can be challenging.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0883073812471430">6</xref>
</sup> Full disclosure is predicated on prior accurate diagnosis and indeed for this reason disclosure of a diagnosis of cerebral palsy can be delayed. Health professionals are reluctant for obvious reasons to disclose to parents that their child is afflicted with a chronic incurable disorder unless they can do so with a fair degree of certainty. This reluctance is further compounded by a lack of certainty regarding eventual outcomes across a spectrum of concerns for the child. In this respect, cerebral palsy is not unlike the other recognized neurodevelopmental disability subtypes: global developmental delay, intellectual disability, and autistic spectrum disorders.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0883073812471430">7</xref>
</sup> It is however distinct in this respect from developmental disorders attached to more readily recognized clinical phenotypes characterized by well-delineated dysmorphic features.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0883073812471430">8</xref>

<sec id="section3-0883073812471430">
<title>What Do We Know About the Disclosure Process in Cerebral Palsy?</title>
<p>Multiple studies have revealed a high level of dissatisfaction with early encounters associated with the disclosure of a diagnosis of cerebral palsy. McKay and Hensey<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0883073812471430">9</xref>
</sup> in a 1990 study noted that 70% of parents reported dissatisfaction with some components of the disclosure encounter. Specifically, they noted a “lack of explanation” regarding the diagnosis together with a dismissal of parental worries and a lack of demonstrated professional understanding for what they and their child were experiencing. Of note, the major factor prompting parental dissatisfaction was a delay in diagnosis. For the most part, parents perceived that they had not been informed as soon as professionals were aware of a diagnosis of cerebral palsy. The parents also noted dissatisfaction with the manner and specifics of disclosure of the diagnosis together with a perceived lack of professional sensitivity and honesty regarding their child’s medical condition.</p>
<p>In a qualitative study using semistructured interviews of the mothers of children with severe disabilities (including cerebral palsy), Sloper and Turner<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0883073812471430">10</xref>
</sup> in 1993 identified multiple features that were determinants of parental satisfaction. The authors focused on disclosure variables, including the parental opportunity to ask questions and have further contact with the disclosing physician. In addition, parents emphasized the need for the conveyance of sufficient and understandable information. Actual structural aspects of the disclosure process, specifically its timing and setting, were not identified by these authors as being of importance for establishing a satisfactory disclosure.</p>
<p>In a 1994 study examining physician-parent communication at the time of first diagnosis of severe physical and mental disability (once again including instances of cerebral palsy), Quine and Rutter<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0883073812471430">11</xref>
</sup> utilized a 5-point Likert scale to evaluate parental satisfaction with different aspects of physician communication. Overall, the authors found that the main predictors of parental satisfaction were identified to be early disclosure (even when physician uncertainty existed), a sympathetic manner, and sufficient relevant information provision.</p>
<p>Baird and colleagues<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0883073812471430">12</xref>
</sup> interviewed over a hundred parents of children with “bilateral spastic” cerebral palsy. Incredibly, 5% of parents could not recall prior to the study having actually been told explicitly the ‘cerebral palsy’ diagnosis attached to their child. For the remainder, there was general satisfaction with the manner of the disclosing physician and the structural aspects of their interaction with the disclosing physician. This satisfaction was noted also with the actual information provided.</p>
<p>Dagenais and colleagues, within the context of enrollment of a child in a population-based cerebral palsy registry, noted 62% parental satisfaction with their recall of the disclosure of diagnosis.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0883073812471430">9</xref>
</sup> Once again, the main predictors of parental satisfaction were information content both with respect to its qualitative and quantitative components. Parents also appreciated a direct and honest physician approach that featured such elements as approachability, hopefulness, and clear communication skills.</p>
<p>In a comparison of parental satisfaction with disclosure comparing parents of children with different diagnoses of disability, Quine and Pahl<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0883073812471430">13</xref>
</sup> noted higher dissatisfaction among parents of children with cerebral palsy compared to parents of children with Down syndrome. A delay in diagnosis was used by the authors to account for this difficulty. The delay in diagnosis was attributed to a failure to adequately address previously expressed parental concerns regarding their child’s developmental trajectory that effectively ignored parental anxiety and implicitly disenfranchised parental custodial duties.</p>
<p>In addition to evaluating parental satisfaction with the disclosure process, investigators have also evaluated its later effects, with particular relevance to parental affect, adaptation, coping, and stress. Baird and colleagues<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0883073812471430">12</xref>
</sup> noted that parental dissatisfaction was consistently associated with later maternal depression. Furthermore, these dissatisfied mothers struggled to cope with their child’s disability. Not surprisingly, dissatisfaction with disclosure correlated with the subsequent later pursuit of legal action focused on allegations of medical malpractice as being responsible for the child’s cerebral palsy. Dagenais and colleagues<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0883073812471430">4</xref>
</sup> confirmed this influence on coping and adaptation by linking dissatisfaction with specific aspects of the diagnosis encounter with parental stress as measured by the Parenting Stress Index. Retinck and colleagues<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0883073812471430">14</xref>
</sup> also directly explored the process of parental adaptation to a child’s cerebral palsy. They highlighted parental satisfaction with the initial disclosure of diagnosis as a key contextual factor influencing later adaptation. Specific elements noted included an early timing of diagnosis, positive physician intrinsic qualities, and information content.</p>
<p>Parental expectations for disclosure have also been investigated. Cottrell and Summers<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0883073812471430">15</xref>
</sup> noted a general consensus to inform as early as possible in a comprehensive way. Parents expressly desired in this study to be fully aware of the entire spectrum of future expectations that is particularly relevant to their child’s quality of life. Although honesty was valued, they sought to be provided some hope for their child’s future that enabled them to have some aspect of control through parental actions and involvement. Clearly, parents wanted to be seen as “partners in care” with a defined role. They also sought social engagement with other parents in a similar situation. Indeed support groups in which they could share experiences and seek out potential solutions from other parents to emerging issues were especially valued.</p>
<p>In a study eliciting caregiver preferences among parents with a variety of developmentally impaired children, parents expressed a clear need for greater information provision and emotional support from their child’s physician.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0883073812471430">7</xref>
</sup> They actively sought an opportunity to express their emotions and once expressed to be comforted by the disclosing health professional. As in other studies, parents expressed a preference for more information rather than less and a frank disclosure regarding the range of possible outcomes for their child.</p>
<p>Parental reactions to disclosure were explicitly studied by Quine and Pahl.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0883073812471430">16</xref>
</sup> A perception that the diagnosis was delayed frequently led to feelings of anger and resentment. A loss of trust in the healthcare team appeared to be inevitable if parents felt that there had been a delay. The parents also noted that they were often overwhelmed by the information provided, suggesting that disclosure should best be a longitudinal process involving a series of opportunities to convey information, ask questions, and integrate an emerging reality of disease and diminished expectations for their child.</p>
<p>The actual practice of physician disclosure of severe physical disability (including cerebral palsy) was evaluated in a survey of pediatricians by Turner and Sloper.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0883073812471430">17</xref>
</sup> A model service delivery based on 9 important criteria was created for the disclosure process. Using open-ended questions, a Disclosure Practice Index Score was derived on the basis of how many of these 9 criteria for disclosure were actually being met in current practice. Of note, no single physician met all criteria as part of regular practice, and indeed nearly a third met less than half of the enumerated criteria that were considered by these authors as components of an ideal model of service delivery.</p>

<sec id="section4-0883073812471430">
<title>What Should We Strive for? Positive Attributes and Elements of the Disclosure Process</title>
<p>The literature does suggest key elements of a successful disclosure process.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0883073812471430">18</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0883073812471430"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0883073812471430">20</xref>
</sup> Clearly, early diagnosis is a desirable goal even in the face of diagnostic uncertainties. Parents want their concerns regarding their child’s neuromotor development to be explicitly addressed. If a diagnosis of cerebral palsy is possible and being considered by the treating physician, then at this point this should be discussed. Uncertainty where it exists should be highlighted. Early diagnosis would minimize parental concerns regarding loss of control and potential feelings of guilt and enable parents to become active partners in their child’s care. Parents clearly prefer more information honestly and fully presented rather than less. They seek referral and guidance to additional sources of information and the opportunity to ask questions important to them. They especially appreciate contact with other parents who can provide support and guidance in a way that is beyond the capability of any healthcare professional. Referral to rehabilitation service providers not only provides the benefits of early intervention but also acts as important sources of both counseling and support to families.</p>
<p>Parents also expect support from the disclosing physician. They seek an opportunity to express their varied emotions as they are in a very tangible way grieving a “lost” child. They want a discussion of practical realities and what the future could bring. They seek to be aware of the range of future possibilities for their child. Hope, encouragement, and reassurance are powerful elements that should be conveyed in the process of disclosure, thus empowering parents to effectively and directly address their feelings of weakness, vulnerability, and loss of control. This can be further reinforced by highlighting what they can actually do on behalf of their child. Delays in diagnosis coupled with an expression of frustration with prior minimization of parental concerns can emerge, leading to feelings of anger coupled with a sense of resentment and loss of trust. To best address this, the physician must be prepared to attempt to provide an explanation for this delay that can be based on the inherent uncertainty and heterogeneity of the cerebral palsy symptom complex itself.</p>
<p>Specific physician attributes can enhance the disclosure process. Parents seek and indeed expect compassion, sensitivity, support, and honesty. Knowledge regarding cerebral palsy, confidence, and a willingness to answer questions fully are important. Terminology should be appropriate and understandable to the degree of parental education and relatively free of medical jargon. Acknowledging a child’s positive characteristics together with optimism and the avoidance of a nihilistic view of the future are key elements. Parents prefer to be told the diagnosis in private together with their child present. A single messenger or point of information dissemination is preferable. Much time should be allotted to the disclosure process and nonverbal cues that suggest a hurried and pressed schedule (ie, standing, avoiding eye contact, looking at one’s watch, simultaneously completing a chart or paperwork) should be avoided. Indeed, a follow-up appointment to expressly discuss the diagnosis and further reinforce information already disseminated or to answer new parental questions is especially preferred by parents.</p>

<title>Case Vignettes</title>
<sec id="section6-0883073812471430">
<title>Case 1</title>
<p>
<italic>Peter was the first of twins born at 26 weeks’ gestation. Weighing 850 g, not surprisingly he developed respiratory distress syndrome requiring surfactant administration, intubation and ventilation, continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), and supplemental oxygen. In addition, he had (1) a significant patent ductus arteriosus necessitating closure with indomethacin, (2) apnea and bradycardia of prematurity requiring caffeine, (3) anemia of prematurity requiring several transfusions, and (4) jaundice leading to phototherapy for 3 days. Serial cranial ultrasound studies revealed a grade 2 intraventricular hemorrhage on the left, no periventricular cysts, and no post-hemorrhagic hydrocephalus. He was discharged home close to his mother’s original due date on no medications</italic>.</p>
<p>Peter’s parents are high school graduates living in a rural setting that precluded their attendance at the hospital’s neonatal follow-up clinic. Compared to his fraternal twin sister, Peter’s motor skills were evidently delayed by 6 months’ corrected age. Mother noted this and brought this to the attention of the family physician at each well baby visit. The physician reassured her by stating that “boys develop slower than girls.”</p>
<p>At the 24-month visit, Peter was still not yet walking and the family’s physician referred Peter to a local pediatrician. The pediatrician found Peter to be “stiff and delayed.” The pediatrician arranged for Peter to see a physiotherapist, undergo a cranial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and see a pediatric neurologist at the university hospital where he had spent time in the neonatal intensive care unit. No mention of cerebral palsy was made at this visit.</p>
<p>Peter went to the visit with the pediatric neurologist together with his mother about 6 months later. The father was unable to take time off work that day. After examining Peter, the neurologist informed the mother that Peter had the “spastic diplegic type of cerebral palsy likely due to periventricular leukomalacia.” His delayed motor skills, together with his delayed language skills meant he also had global developmental delay. Unfortunately, the neurologist was on call for the neurology service that day and had to leave the clinic abruptly to attend a child in status epilepticus in the pediatric intensive care unit. Before leaving, he did give Peter’s mother an information pamphlet on cerebral palsy, the phone contact information for the neurology nurse, and a follow-up appointment to see him again in 6 months.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0883073812471430">
<title>Case 2</title>
<p>
<italic>Naomi was born at term following an entirely uneventful pregnancy, labor, and delivery. Despite both being right-handed themselves, the parents noted that Naomi almost exclusively used her left hand in reaching for objects beginning at 4 months of age. Before they could bring this to the attention of their child’s pediatrician, Naomi experienced a seizure involving her right hemibody in the context of a high fever at 6 months of age. The seizure occurred at home around 7 o’clock in the morning and both parents brought Naomi into the hospital emergency room. In the emergency room, the physician noted a right-sided hemiparesis and consulted the pediatric neurology service later that same morning who saw Naomi in the emergency room itself. These physical examination findings were confirmed by the neurology resident who ordered a cranial MRI that was undertaken early that same afternoon. The MRI revealed a left porencephalic cyst in the middle cerebral artery territory.</italic>
</p>
<p>The attending neurologist, while on service rounds in the late afternoon with the entire physician team, informed Naomi’s parents (both university graduates) that Naomi had had “a stroke before she was born” and that she had the “hemiplegic form of cerebral palsy.” The information was given in an examining room in the emergency room with the other members of the neurology team present (ie, senior pediatric neurology resident, senior adult neurology resident, junior pediatric resident, and elective medical student). The neurologist showed the parents Naomi’s MRI on the desktop computer and explained that the stroke had happened and would not get worse nor likely occur again. She explained that blood and other tests would need to be done to find out a reason why, but there was a good chance that all tests would be negative. She explained that Naomi also had had “an atypical febrile seizure, but that this was not epilepsy” and would not currently need any treatment. She did mention that Naomi was at risk for later epilepsy, as well as other issues including speech delay, motor delay, and intellectual disability. Before leaving, the neurologist arranged a telephone rendezvous with herself in 1 week to discuss any further questions the parents might have and gave the parents the contact information for the neurology outpatient department nurse and local cerebral palsy parent association.</p>

<title>Commentary</title>
<sec id="section9-0883073812471430">
<title>Case 1</title>
<p>
<italic>In the first disclosure vignette, initial concerns regarding their child expressed by the parents appears to have been minimized or dismissed by healthcare providers. Furthermore, there does not appear to have been any mention of the possibility of neurologic or neurodevelopmental sequelae either broadly conceptualized or cerebral palsy specifically, expressed by care providers in the neonatal intensive care unit during Peter’s extended stay despite his being at “high risk.” These errors of omission were compounded by the lack of expedient disclosure of the diagnosis of cerebral palsy. Given that possible reasons for diagnostic delay are not mentioned, it would not be surprising if Peter’s parents will have difficulty trusting current and future care providers for their child.</italic>
</p>
<p>The structure and content of the diagnostic disclosure also was wanting in this vignette. Only 1 parent was present and jargon (“spastic diplegic type of cerebral palsy due to periventricular leukomalacia”) is used that would be beyond the level of parental understanding. Competing professional demands have rendered this contact rushed, with closure prior to an effort to respond fully to parental questions and ascertain the mother’s correct level of comprehension of what is wrong with her child. While an information pamphlet and contact information for a nurse is provided, a follow-up appointment 6 months later leaves a considerable temporal gap for parental misunderstanding, anxiety, and uncertainty to fester.</p>
<p>Finally in this encounter, there appears to be no “positive spin” provided. Specifically, with its emphasis on diagnosis and etiology, there appears to be no mention of Peter’s positive characteristics. A range of possible outcomes is not discussed, leaving parents to naturally focus on negative and worst-case scenarios, as this is probably all they know about “cerebral palsy” from the popular media. The practical realities of parenting a child who is “different” and will have “special needs” are not explored. In the absence of any message of hope or an explanation of what parents can actively do to help their child, it would not be surprising if Peter’s parents either adopt a nihilistic framework or become susceptible to complementary (ie, naturopathy), alternative (ie, hyperbaric), or experimental (ie, stem cell) approaches without any proven benefit to the detriment of the pursuit of meaningful rehabilitation interventions.</p>

<title>Commentary</title>
<sec id="section11-0883073812471430">
<title>Case 2</title>
<p>
<italic>With Naomi’s disclosure, an acute event (ie, an atypical febrile seizure and emergency room presentation) prompted a rapid and early diagnosis of cerebral palsy. Although some jargon is used, the parents’ university education suggests a greater potential level of understanding, especially as details regarding pathogenesis are provided and the actual stroke is demonstrated on the MRI. Explicit expectations regarding the future with respect to the recurrence of the stroke, and future investigations and their yield are also provided. Although an almost full range of possible adverse outcomes is mentioned, there does not appear to have been any discussion of their possibility or probability that would enable a proper parental perspective. Perhaps the neurologist did not feel comfortable discussing this because of her own uncertainty regarding the probability of these comorbidities. If this was indeed the case, this professional uncertainty should be explicitly stated.</italic>
</p>
<p>Although presentation to the emergency room for an acute event facilitates early diagnosis, it is often less than ideal as the setting to deliver the diagnosis of a chronic condition. Privacy is frequently an issue as is the opportunity to have sufficient time for an extended contact in a comfortable setting. Finally, the presence of an extensive team of health professionals is something parents have explicitly highlighted as a negative feature of disclosure.</p>
<p>Once again in this vignette there has been a medical focus on the “here and now” and the challenge of addressing pressing medical issues of diagnosis and treatment. It is hard to avoid such a focus given the rapid turnover in an emergency room, the shift to ambulatory care provision in health services delivery, and the pressing need of comprehensive service provision. Missing in this disclosure once again is a description of practical realities, positive child characteristics, and possible parental actions that can be undertaken both in the short and long term. The arrangement for a telephone contact with the physician in 1 week provides a concrete point soon in time for parents to formulate questions that can be addressed and ensure that they are fully understanding of their child’s condition and challenges. The provision of contact information to the parents of both a health professional and a local support group provides available ready resources for appropriate and accurate information provision.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>One can foresee that focus groups combining parents of children with cerebral palsy with service providers may provide additional insights that will sharpen our understanding of the key elements of the disclosure process from varied perspectives. To improve the disclosure process itself, one can envision the composing of a checklist of key elements. These elements would be related to both content and context. Content would concern itself with (1) the use of appropriate terminology that is explained, (2) information that is fully and honestly disclosed, (3) the highlighting of potential uncertainty, (4) actual referral to other relevant service providers and appropriate information sources (eg, support groups, websites), (5) practical future realities for the child and family balanced with hope, and (8) concrete suggestions about what the family can do for their child. Contextual items on a checklist to improve disclosure would include (1) a private setting with the affected child present, (2) sufficient time for the posing of questions initially, (3) a follow-up opportunity, and (4) a single diagnosis messenger.</p>
<p>The disclosure of a diagnosis of a child’s cerebral palsy to parents is a key point in diagnostic confirmation and information provision. For parents, it represents a sharp break with cherished dreams and expectations for normality that will influence later adaptation and coping. For the physician, it represents a challenge to practice the highest levels of professionalism and physicianship. For both, it should represent the beginning of a therapeutic relationship built on solid foundations of trust and knowledge that will serve as a mechanism of achieving the full intrinsic potential of the child with cerebral palsy.</p>
