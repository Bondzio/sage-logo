<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Beginning in the 1960s, many countries began shifting from a hospital-based system of mental health treatment to one centered on the community. After 1980, the number of hospital beds and length of hospital stays reduced sharply. In Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries, the average length of stay in 2005 for patients with schizophrenia was 38 days.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0269215512473136">1</xref></sup> In contrast, the number of psychiatric beds in Japanese hospitals increased suddenly in the 1960s, and the average length of stay in 2008 for patients with schizophrenia was 601 days.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0269215512473136">2</xref></sup> Mental health care in Japan has historically been hospital-centered, characterized by long hospital stays and insufficient support services to allow people with mental disorders to live in the community.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0269215512473136">3</xref></sup> Long-term hospitalization can cause institutionalization.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0269215512473136">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0269215512473136">5</xref></sup> Patients with institutional syndrome restrain themselves, live a passive life, and lose their individuality and initiative.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0269215512473136">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0269215512473136">5</xref></sup> The 2009 interim report of “Visions in Reform of Mental Health and Medical Welfare” noted that patients with schizophrenia who had stayed in a hospital for more than one year were more likely to be subsequently hospitalized for a long period.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0269215512473136">6</xref></sup> Some patients with schizophrenia continue to experience a chronic course of symptoms followed by long-term hospitalization.</p>
<p>The symptoms of schizophrenia include positive symptoms, negative symptoms, cognitive dysfunctions, and nonspecific psychological symptoms, such as anxiousness/depression.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0269215512473136">7</xref></sup> Psychopharmacological treatments, which are the basic treatment, are not highly effective.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0269215512473136">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0269215512473136">9</xref></sup> The effect of psychosocial therapies, which are provided as add-on therapies to psychopharmacological treatments, is also insufficient.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0269215512473136">9</xref></sup> Therefore, it is necessary to establish an effective treatment that minimizes prolonged hospitalizations and promotes the transfer of patients back to the community.</p>
<p>Psychiatric rehabilitation, including occupational therapy, has been a client-centered practice since the 1990s.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0269215512473136">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0269215512473136"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0269215512473136"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0269215512473136">13</xref></sup> Corring et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0269215512473136">10</xref></sup> emphasize that it is important to focus on client perspectives. It is also important for the clients to work on activities based on their preferences and choices. Following the introduction of client-centered occupational therapy in Japan, it quickly became common in most psychiatric hospitals. However, little research has been done studying the effects of client-centered occupational therapy in psychiatric hospitals in Japan.</p>
<p>The aim of this study was to compare the effects of subject-chosen and therapist-chosen activities in the occupational therapy on the psychiatric symptoms and psychosocial functions of patients with schizophrenia.</p>
<p>The hospital ethics committee approved this study on 19 January 2010.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0269215512473136" sec-type="methods">
<title>Method</title>
<p>The study was conducted at a private psychiatric hospital located in an urban area. We assessed all inpatients for eligibility; 209 of them were diagnosed with schizophrenia, as defined by the International Statistical Classification of Diseases (10th Revision), and had been hospitalized for more than a year as of January 2010. A total of 59 patients were included in the study after excluding patients who had difficulty communicating owing to their symptoms, those who were going to be discharged in a few day, and those who declined to participate in the study.</p>
<p>The allocation for males and females was independent. Each male subject’s data were consecutively listed in a row on an excel spreadsheet. The Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF) Scale scores were in the first column. All dates were sorted according to the GAF score (from the highest to the lowest). Subjects on odd numbered rows were allocated to a subject-chosen activity group and those on even numbered rows were allocated to a therapist-chosen activity group. The same procedure was followed for females. The data for males and females were unified as a subject-chosen group and a therapist-chosen group.</p>
<p>For the subject-chosen activity group, at the first interview, the subjects were asked to choose activities. The Canadian Occupational Performance Measure (COPM)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0269215512473136">14</xref></sup> was used in the process of extraction of the chosen activities so that the occupational therapists could understand the subjects’ choices, regardless of their years of experience. After subjects had determined the set of activities that they would take part in, the subjects performed these activities.</p>
<p>For the therapist-chosen activity group, the first series of interviews was conducted without using the COPM, and the occupational therapists chose activities for patients based on treatment recommendations. The therapists then had their patients perform these activities under patients’ consent. The therapist-chosen activity is often employed in the occupational therapy for chronic inpatients with severe symptoms of schizophrenia in Japan.</p>
<p>In both groups, when a patient completed the first activity that had been chosen, the next activity was chosen and performed via the same process. Patients took part in occupational therapy for up to two hours, once a week, for six months (March to September 2010). The interviews and interventions were conducted by different therapists so that differences in the relationship between subjects and occupational therapists owing to interview methods could be avoided.</p>
<p>Psychiatric symptoms were measured using the Japanese version of the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0269215512473136">15</xref></sup> Psychosocial function was measured using the Japanese version of the GAF scale.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0269215512473136">7</xref></sup> The GAF rates psychological, social, and occupational function on a scale of 1 to 100.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0269215512473136">7</xref></sup> To minimize evaluator bias, subject psychiatric symptoms and psychosocial function was evaluated before and after occupational therapy by a psychiatrist who was blind to the group allocation of patients.</p>
<p>The differences between the two groups in subject characteristics, including age of onset, amount of drug, and duration (months) of occupational therapy before the study, were examined using the Student <italic>t</italic>-test. The other factors; age, duration of illness, number of hospital admission, and length of current stay were examined using the Mann-Whitney <italic>U</italic> test, as the data were not normally distributed. For the PANSS and GAF Scale, the differences before and after the occupational therapies were tested using the Mann-Whitney <italic>U</italic> test, and differences within each group before and after the therapies were tested using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. The statistical analyses were performed using Statcel2 for excel 2007 (The Publisher OMS, Saitama, Japan), and statistical significance was set at <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05 for all analyses.</p>

Also, no significant differences in all item scores of PANSS and GAF were demonstrated between the two groups before the occupational therapies (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0269215512473136">Table 2</xref>).</p>

<p>After the six-months occupational therapies, suspiciousness and hostility scores of the positive scale, and preoccupation scores of the general psychopathology scale for the subject-chosen activity group and therapist-chosen activity group were 2(2) (median (interquartile range)) and 3(1.25), 2(1) and 2.5(1), and 2(1) and 3(1), respectively. The other items in PANSS and GAF Scores were not significantly different between the two groups (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0269215512473136">Table 2</xref>). These results show that the suspiciousness, hostility, and preoccupation items were significantly improved more in the subject-chosen activity group as compared with the therapist-chosen activity group (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05).</p>
<p>In the comparisons within the groups between before and after the occupational therapies, the scores in the suspiciousness item of the positive scale and the preoccupation of the general psychopathology scale were significantly improved in the subject-chosen activity group from 3(1) (median (interquartile range)) and 3(1) before the occupational therapies to 2(2) and 2(1), respectively, after the occupational therapies (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05). In contrast, no significant changes were found for any of the PANSS items in the therapist-chosen group. The GAF Scores in the subject-chosen activity group significantly improved after occupational therapy, from 40(9) (median (interquartile range)) to 40(16), respectively (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05). This improvement was not found in the therapist-chosen group.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We adopted only the item that improved in both group and pre–post comparisons as an improvement item. The subject-chosen activity in occupational therapy consisted of patients’ choosing and performing activities and being supported in performing it by occupational therapists. This might result in improvements on the suspiciousness item of the positive scale and the preoccupation item of the general psychopathology scale of PANSS.</p>
<p>The suspiciousness item of the PANSS positive scale is defined as unrealistic or exaggerated ideas of persecution.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0269215512473136">15</xref></sup> In the subject-chosen activity group, the occupational therapists accepted the activities that the subjects chose and coordinated the environments in order to support the subjects in performing their activities satisfactorily. This relationship between the subject and the occupational therapist is called a “partnership.” This is one of the important concepts constituting client-centered occupational therapy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0269215512473136">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0269215512473136"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0269215512473136">18</xref></sup> Partnership leads to the subjects’ trust in their occupational therapists<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0269215512473136">16</xref></sup> and comfortable performance of activities. This experience is considered to relieve patient suspiciousness. This characteristic symptom, which is often observed in the acute stage, makes it difficult to attain stable and smooth human relationships. Ikebuchi<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0269215512473136">19</xref></sup> also reported that schizophrenia symptoms, such as hostility, excitement, and suspiciousness, which destroy patients’ relationships with those around them, could be factors that prevent them from being discharged from the hospital. Therefore, it is suggested that subject-chosen activities improve psychiatric symptoms, such as suspiciousness, making it easier to build a stable relationship between inpatients with chronic schizophrenia and their therapists, and helping patients recover enough to return to the community.</p>
<p>The preoccupation item of the PANSS general psychopathology scale refers to absorption with internally generated thoughts and feelings and an autistic experience. This comprehensive psychopathological symptom, encompassing both positive and negative symptoms, is detrimental to reality orientation and adaptive behavior.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0269215512473136">15</xref></sup> In the subject-chosen activity group, the subjects chose and performed activities with the support of occupational therapists. Choosing and performing the activities might enable the subjects, who are deeply involved in an autistic experience, to act realistically and autonomously, and might improve preoccupation of the general psychopathological symptoms.</p>
<p>When they are experiencing strong suspicion, patients with schizophrenia often avoid relationships with others and their surroundings, and immerse themselves in their own experiences. Therefore, the results of this study also suggest the possibility that the improvement of positive symptoms, such as suspiciousness, may improve the preoccupation of general psychopathological symptoms.</p>
<p>Negative symptoms improved neither in the therapist-chosen nor subject-chosen activity groups. This suggests that occupational therapy did not directly improve the negative symptoms of schizophrenia. This finding is consistent with the previous finding that the negative symptoms of schizophrenia are notoriously difficult to treat.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0269215512473136">20</xref></sup> However, preoccupation, the general psychopathological symptom encompassing both positive and negative symptoms, was improved in the subject-chosen activity group. This finding suggests that clinical conditions associated with negative symptoms could be improved through client-centered occupational therapy, even if it were difficult to improve the negative symptoms themselves.</p>
<p>Client-centered occupational therapy, in this study, consisted of interviews and interventions. The interview was conducted less than five times, for 10 minutes each. Since the total interview time was so short, the authors suggest that the influence of the interview itself can be ignored. Therefore, the effects of the client-centered occupational therapy would be owing to the client-centered approach regarding patient choices and performance in occupational therapy.</p>
<p>In this study, social function was also explored using the GAF Scale. There was a slight improvement in GAF scores in the subject-chosen group, while no difference in GAF score was observed between the subject-chosen and therapist-chosen activity groups. Improvement in PANSS items, such as suspiciousness and preoccupation in the subject-chosen group, might have partially affected the psychological functioning area of the GAF Scale and led to a slight improvement in GAF scores.</p>
<p>Our findings suggest that the subject-chosen activity in the occupational therapy could improve the psychiatric symptoms of the inpatients with chronic schizophrenia. In the therapist-chosen activity group, no effect of the occupational therapy was found for any examined items. These results suggest the possibility that the subject-chosen activities in the occupational therapy break the cycle of long-term hospitalization of the patients with intractable schizophrenia who experience failed therapies by various types of professionals and have long-term chronic conditions. Currently, an effective treatment is necessary to help patients return to the community. The effects of the client-centered occupational therapy in this study can be highly significant.</p>
<p>This study was limited by the fact that it was only conducted with a small group of subjects at one hospital. Less than one-third of eligible participants actually took part in the study. In light of the fact that many patients with schizophrenia had disease periods of more than 30 years, and hospitalization periods of more than 10 years, the intervention period may have been too brief to be effective. The authors recommend conducting future studies in this area using longer and more frequent intervention periods. Increasing the number of subjects and the participating institutions may contribute to the establishment of the client-centered occupational therapy as an effective treatment for inpatients with chronic schizophrenia.</p>
