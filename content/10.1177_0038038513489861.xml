<p>Discussions of inequalities have once again risen to the top of social, political and economic agendas in Britain, and therefore this text is timely. Professor Platt’s new book on understanding inequalities is framed within the sociological conceptions of social stratification and social differences. Each chapter is designed to be read separately but there is considerable complementarity between them. It is refreshingly empirical in its orientation, and this is likely to set it apart from many other works on inequality.</p>
<p>The introduction describes some of the ideas and terminology deployed in the study of inequality in an attempt to help the reader understand how they are routinely implemented in research practices. There is a useful account of the importance of studying inequality in society, and passages that discuss the nature of fairness, opportunity and equality, as well as material on the defences of inequality. In our experience these concepts can be deceptively complex, and frequently banana skins will trip those new to thinking and reading about social inequality. Therefore the sections included in the opening chapter are helpful in so far as they provide useful intellectual background for the reader that helps them to better comprehend the empirical chapters that follow.</p>
<p>The first three chapters focus on class, gender and ethnicity, which are the traditional domains of stratification research and teaching. Platt makes the organizing distinction that, along with disability, these domains of inequality are largely ascribed. The second part of the text treats inequalities in areas such as education, income, housing and health, and illustrates how they are experienced by various groups unequally. This seems to be a sensible pedagogic device, although we suspect that some sociologists may disagree. Particular attention is paid to ‘intersectionality’, which Platt describes as the interaction between gender and ethnicity and other categories of difference in individuals’ lives, including social practices, institutional arrangements, cultural ideologies and power. This is likely to help the reader frame social inequalities within a more appropriate multidimensional context.</p>
<p>An undeniable strength of the book is the emphasis that the author places on measurement, which Platt argues is crucial to the understanding of inequality. Within the text there are sections in which the construction of groups and the social processes by which individuals are allocated to them are discussed. Platt argues that this is central to a meaningful understanding of regularities, and contractions, within inequalities. Similarly, the author attempts to clarify the measurement of outcomes that are unequal, since these too must be grasped if evidence is to be appropriately interpreted and evaluated.</p>
<p>A useful description of some classification schemes is provided in the Social Class chapter that will serve as a good quick reference for many (e.g. when comparing a Goldthorpe scheme with NS-SEC). Obvious topics such as class distributions are presented in this chapter along with ideas surrounding debates on meritocracy and inequality more generally. Chapter three provides an overview of female labour market participation and inequalities, along with relevant information on inequalities in domestic work and home life. Ethnicity is the focus of the next chapter and Platt devotes a suitable amount of time to how ethnicity can be measured. A discussion of issues such as labour market experiences and discrimination then follow. Youth and ageing is the focus of the next chapter, which helps to situate inequalities within an understanding of the lifecourse.</p>
<p>The chapter on education is very well crafted and presents a series of up-to-date empirical examples that illustrate the intersectionality of inequality. The next chapter is on income and wealth. Our reading is that Platt adopts the particular sociological view that whilst income is important it is merely epiphenomenal in relation to inequality. This chapter provides some useful empirical illustrations of poverty, income and wealth across social groups in society.</p>
<p>Chapter eights treats disability and health and once more the issues of definition and measurement feature prominently. Platt provides a defensible set of reasons for combining these two topics, however we suspect that some readers will still be dissatisfied at the amalgamation. The final chapter focuses on geography and housing. The powerful aspects of space and structural constraints are frequently overlooked in discussions of inequality and social stratification.</p>
<p>Our overall conclusion is that it is more than a textbook, and it provides an excellent collection of empirical material. The use of boxes to isolate key pedagogical points and the questions provided at the end of each chapter make the book a valuable teaching resource. Suitable further reading is also provided. Whilst undergraduate students are likely to benefit most from the text it is also a good primer for postgraduates, especially those that are on general social science programmes or have moved into sociology from a neighbouring discipline.</p>
