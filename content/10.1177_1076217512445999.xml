<abstract>
<p>Oftentimes, when the subject of Black students’ talent maximization in gifted and advanced courses and programs is broached, students are treated as a monolithic entity. In fact, there is considerable evidence to suggest that unsuccessful achievement of academic excellence may be more troublesome for males than females at many points along the educational pipeline (Ford, 2010; Grantham, 2004a). School counselors, trained to understand the intended and unintended consequences of ignoring the importance of race and gender are well equipped to assist in the battle to increase the academic performance of talented Black males and—by extension—aid in ameliorating the achievement gap between the best and brightest Black students. The purpose of this column is to provide a brief introduction of the cumulative risks associated with being Black and male in educational settings as well as a discussion of how these risks are associated with mental health and academic performance. The column will conclude with a discussion of implications for school counselors.</p>

<title>Multicultural Issues</title>
<p>Too few school counselors have received formal training to work with and understand the experiences and needs of gifted students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1076217512445999">Peterson &amp; Morris, 2010</xref>); even fewer get training to counsel and guide gifted Black students. As a professional school counselor, I decided to take a different route to actively seek such training. I saw and still see so many gifted students, especially Black males, failing to achieve to their potential. Serving as leaders and advocates, professional school counselors are in an ideal position to support gifted students. In addition to supporting students’ academic and career needs, they are also prepared to meet the social-emotional and affective needs of gifted students from all backgrounds. To be effective with Black males, however, specific information must be understood first.</p>
<p>For quite some time, there has been a great deal of attention given to the persistent disconnect between Black students and high academic achievement. Specifically, an overwhelming body of literature has been published highlighting the difficulties Black students’ experience in K-12 educational environments in comparison with their White peers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1076217512445999">Ford, Grantham, &amp; Whiting, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1076217512445999">National Center for Education Statistics, 2003</xref>). Most often referred to as the achievement gap (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1076217512445999">Barton &amp; Coley, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1076217512445999">Ferguson, 2003</xref>), the conundrum can best be described as nothing less than the top educational crisis of our time—with no significant changes in sight. Indeed, numerous policies have been created to address the issue, yet the problem persists in urban, suburban, and rural contexts alike.</p>
<p>Oftentimes, when the subject of Black students’ talent maximization in gifted and advanced courses and programs is broached, students are treated as a monolithic entity. There is considerable evidence that unsuccessful achievement of academic excellence may be more troublesome for males than females at many points along the educational pipeline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1076217512445999">Ford, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1076217512445999">Grantham, 2004a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1076217512445999">2004b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1076217512445999">Toldson, 2008</xref>). It is also quite clear that when issues related to Black students, even those formally identified as gifted, are introduced in popular and scholarly literature, it typically focuses on race without taking Black males’ conceptions of masculinity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1076217512445999">Majors &amp; Billson, 1992</xref>) into much consideration. As a result, when constructing interventions to disrupt the unfortunate academic trends as related to Black males, masculinity is sacrificed for a narrow focus on race; doing so fails to take into consideration the cumulative risks associated with being Black <italic>and</italic> male, as opposed to one or the other, and the issues the dual identities represent for them in academic settings.</p>
<p>School counselors, trained to understand the intended and unintended consequences of ignoring the importance of race and gender are well equipped to assist in the battle to increase the academic performance of talented Black males. By extension, aiding in ameliorating the achievement gap between capable Black students may also assist in closing the overall achievement gap between Black and White students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1076217512445999">Ford, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1076217512445999">Plucker, Burroughs, &amp; Song, 2010</xref>). As such, the purpose of this column is to provide a brief introduction to the cumulative risks associated with being Black and male in educational settings, as well as a discussion of how these risks are associated with mental health and academic performance. The column will conclude with a discussion of implications for school counselors.</p>

<title>Race, Gender, and Cumulative Risks</title>
<p>Popular and scholarly discourse is saturated with information describing Black males and academic achievement using a deficit lens. Indeed, it can easily be argued that the vast majority of information in the public sphere related to Black males is focused on their perceived inability to succeed in comparison with students belonging to other racial and ethnic groups. There are, of course, Black males who have managed to be formally identified for gifted and advanced courses and programs. These students, though, are frequently confronted with a plethora of social, psychological, and cultural issues that serve to impede the maximization of their academic potential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1076217512445999">Henfield, Moore, &amp; Wood, 2008</xref>). There are also other Black males who have not been formally identified for gifted and advanced courses and programs, yet are more than capable of being successful in such learning environments if systemic and interpersonal barriers are acknowledged and eradicated. Clearly, both groups—even if they are high academic achievers—are confronted with multiple stressors directly related to race and gender, the cumulative effects of which have dangerous implications for continued academic achievement and talent maximization.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1076217512445999">
<title>Black Male Adolescents and Mental Health</title>
<p>Although the mental health risks associated with being Black or being male are quite high, the amalgamation of the two social constructs is alarming. Clearly, there are environmental factors predisposing Black males to negative mental and physical health outcomes. Urban, Black male adolescents, for example, have been found to experience disproportionately high levels of depression in comparison with adolescents from other racial/ethnic groups due to their exposure to high-risk settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1076217512445999">Lindsey, Joe, &amp; Nebbitt, 2010</xref>) and poor support from individuals in their social circles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1076217512445999">Hammack, Richards, Luo, Edlynn, &amp; Roy, 2004</xref>). It is also important to note that males account for 80% of all suicides among Black adolescents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1076217512445999">Joe, 2006</xref>).</p>
<sec id="section4-1076217512445999">
<title>Schools as high-risk environments</title>
<p>It could easily be argued that schools may, too, be considered high-risk environments for Black males, filled with multiple detrimental stressors. The current educational context in which all students must learn may, in fact, be considered one of the more challenging for teachers and consequently, students in recent memory. Much of this can be attributed to the current culture of accountability. In this environment, educators are expected to increase academic achievement for all students regardless of race, socioeconomic status, gender, or any other factors as measured by scores on standardized tests. On the surface, this appears to be a significant social justice measure; however, there have been many instances suggesting that, in actuality, students may not be receiving the education they deserve due to increased pressures placed on teachers to use pedagogical measures designed to prepare students to achieve minimum competency on the tests. It has been determined that such a strong emphasis on minimum competency has come at the expense of those students who have the potential to go far beyond minimal standards and achieve academic excellence. While closing the achievement gap between Black and White students has made steady progress as measured by minimal standards, the gaps between Black and White students performing at the highest levels of achievement—otherwise known as excellence gaps—continues to grow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1076217512445999">Lovelace, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1076217512445999">Plucker et al., 2010</xref>). As such, it could easily be argued that the current era of accountability is an example of an environmental risk factor that is having the most adverse impact on Black students who have the greatest academic potential.</p>

<title>Mental Health and Academic Excellence</title>
<p>The experience of overcoming the odds and achieving academic excellence as a Black student can be quite enchanting. Yet, consistently falling short of the academic performance of White students may leave some Black students feeling irritated and unfulfilled at their failure to “measure up” to those academic standards. This phenomenon can be linked to episodes of stereotype threat, which has been found to have a negative impact on academic performance; it can also be associated with goal-striving stress, which has received relatively little coverage in educational literature.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1076217512445999">Sellers and Neighbors (2008)</xref> defined goal-striving stress as the tension associated with striving for goals that, for Black people, were historically unattainable but now are perceived as being within the realm of possibility. The degree to which efforts to reach socially derived aspirations match the achievement of those aspirations are thought to determine which individuals experience goal-striving stress. In the case of high academic achievers who are Black, efforts to accomplish similar levels of academic achievement as White students may be quite stress inducing because of stubborn environmental risk factors such as attending schools that emphasize minimal standards achievement as opposed to academic excellence.</p>
<p>It makes sense that Black high-achieving students may experience goal-striving stress regardless of gender background. However, research has shown that Black females are far more likely to seek out help in dealing with stress-related issues in comparison with Black males. From the time they are very young, males hailing from all types of cultural backgrounds are conditioned to believe that seeking help is for the weak and they, as males, should rely on no one but themselves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1076217512445999">Courtenay, 2000</xref>). Such deeply imbedded notions of masculinity oftentimes manifest as individuality, stoicism, and aggression as they mature. Such behavior is associated with their reluctance to utilize counseling services.</p>
<p>In probably the most popular book exploring Black male masculine meaning-making, <italic>Cool Pose: The Dilemmas of Black Manhood in America</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1076217512445999">Majors and Billson (1992)</xref> submitted the widely cited term <italic>cool pose</italic> to describe how Black males cope with race and gender discrimination:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>By cool pose we mean the presentation of self many black males use to establish their male identity. Cool pose is a ritualized form of masculinity that entails behaviors, scripts, physical posturing, impression management, and carefully crafted performances that deliver a single, critical message: pride, strength, and control. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1076217512445999">Majors and Billson, 1992</xref>, p. 4)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>More recent conceptions of Black masculinity are thought of as more context dependent. Over time, literature related to the topic has evolved from the notion of a monolithic meaning based on White male norms, to the understanding of it as a social construction that differs according to a number of different factors such as race, social class, ethnic group, sexual orientations as well as generation. Nonetheless, Black males who adopt traditional ideas of what it means to be a man increases the risk that they will develop poor coping mechanisms that have a negative impact on their mental health and, consequently, their academic achievement. Furthermore, given the strong connection between stressful environments, perceived lack of support, and other debilitating conditions—even suicide—it is imperative that gender-specific measures be taken to support Black males, specifically.</p>

<title>Professional School Counseling and Black Male Academic Excellence</title>
<p>Professional school counselors are in a unique position because they are, quite often, the only educators in school buildings who have been trained to render personal/social, academic, and career services to meet the needs of all students. Their position in schools makes them a valuable resource in comparison with other educators who have more focused responsibilities (e.g., teachers, administrators, etc.). Similar to other educators, they, too, are under tremendous pressure to prove their worth in terms of their contributions to schoolwide academic achievement. To achieve this goal, their efforts should be tailored to address the needs of high achievers, including Black students, who are achieving at lower rates than White students according to all measures and levels of academic performance. As Black males have traditionally been reluctant to seek help from formal mental health service providers when confronted with issues, it stands to reason that this population of high achievers is deserving of targeted initiatives designed to meet their unique needs.</p>

<title>Ten Nonnegotiable Understandings</title>
<p>Aside from specific information related to gifted Black males, it is important for school counselors to develop a more general understanding of the following nonnegotiable statements that are widely known and supported in the literature. To serve as leaders and advocates acting on these students’ behalf, the following statements can serve as a strong foundation for subsequent interventions:</p>
<list id="list1-1076217512445999" list-type="order">
<list-item>
<p>Giftedness is found in all racial, gender, and economic groups. Thus, Black male underrepresentation is indefensible/unjustifiable. As such, those Black males who manage to achieve success academically should not be thought of as an anomaly—success should be perceived as the norm.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Black males are the most severely underrepresented in gifted education and advanced classes. This tragic waste of gifts and talents has reached epidemic portions. Those Black males who are achieving academic success outside of gifted and advanced classes may be even more successful if surrounded by other students in gifted and advanced courses who love learning and have a similar thirst for knowledge.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Black males face more barriers to achievement than other racial and gender groups as a function of their race and gender backgrounds; they are profiled, negatively stereotyped, and feared because of the overwhelmingly negative portrayals of Black males historically and in the media. Those Black males who have managed to achieve academic success have, more than likely, had to overcome a number of obstacles.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Black males are taught by a predominantly female teaching and counseling force. As a function of this skewed representation and a lack of understanding, Black males are often on the receiving end of sexism, which often leads to hyperaggressive responses that can be misconstrued if viewed through stereotypical lenses.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Black males with strong (even excessive or unrealistic) masculinity issues or masculine identities (e.g., macho) will pose the greatest challenge and resistance to change. Many may be classified as being in the immersion-emersion racial identity stage according to Cross’s Theory of Nigrescence, which characterizes individuals as displaying such emotions as anger, hostility, defensiveness, and confusion when interacting with individuals who do not have similar racial backgrounds.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Black males want to be successful in school and life, just like any other student; however, given the barrage of negativity associated with Black males in mass media and other sources, they need empathy, compassion, and support to resist these negative portrayals and stay focused on meeting their goals.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Black males not identified as gifted will surely underachieve if not presented with curriculum that is challenging and culturally relevant; however, those identified as gifted and enrolled in gifted programs are much more likely to use their gifts and talents in socially acceptable ways compared with those who are not; an idle mind is the devil’s workshop.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Many of the “behavioral problems” associated with Black males can be explained by their boredom and lack of challenge in schools in general, and their underidentification as gifted, in particular. Functioning in a more rigorous, culturally relevant environment has the potential to engage these students and help maximize their potential.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>School counselors, operating as consultants, are charged with making other educators in the school more aware of the needs of all students in the school, including gifted and high-achieving Black males. Not knowing is not an excuse!</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>School counselors matter! They are trained to assume leadership roles in our nation’s school and, as a result, have the ability to make a difference in the lives of gifted Black males by playing a meaningful role in developing plans to recruit more students into gifted and advanced classes and retaining them once they decide to participate.</p>
</list-item>
</list>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1076217512445999">
<title>Recommendations</title>
<p>The Council for Accreditation of Counseling and Related Educational Programs (CACREP) assures that any student graduating from a CACREP-accredited master’s-level school counseling program has received a wide array of courses designed to ensure students are capable of meeting the needs of all students upon graduation. While this is true, the amount of time spent on meeting the needs of high-achieving Black males is unclear as this specific population is not a required emphasis according to CACREP standards. As such, students may graduate from school counseling programs without ever receiving information. Therefore, it is incumbent on professional school counselors to advocate on their own behalf and demand that school administrators include information related to high-achieving Black males when developing professional development activities for educators in the school building.</p>
<p>Once trained, professional school counselor should then be able to implement the following interventions with a greater likelihood of success:</p>
<list id="list2-1076217512445999" list-type="order">
<list-item>
<p><italic>School–Family–Community Partnerships (SFCs)</italic>. To be successful in terms of meeting the needs of Black male students in general and high achievers in particular, it is important to develop strong partnerships between the school, families, and community members. This may entail attending events and frequenting places that are common among stakeholders outside of school settings, but not necessarily to professional school counselors. Once professional school counselors demonstrate their commitment to meeting students’ needs, stakeholders will be more apt to assist them in meeting the needs of Black male high achievers; essentially, helping professional school counselors to perform their jobs more effectively.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p><italic>Mentoring programs</italic>. Professional school counselors should develop strong connections with Black male adults who have managed to overcome obstacles and meet their goals. This will provide students with the race- and gender-specific role models with whom they are most likely to identify with and rely on for support.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p><italic>Individual counseling</italic>. If strong SFCs and mentoring programs are established, professional school counselors will have an important network of stakeholders able to advocate on their behalf and the services they are trained to provide. Among the many services are individual counseling sessions, which may not be attractive to Black male high achievers initially but may become more of an option if stakeholders operating in a vetting role strongly suggest students participate. Within the context of individual counseling, students will be able to develop insight related to goal-striving stress and develop techniques to lessen its impact.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p><italic>Small-group counseling</italic>. If there are multiple Black male high achievers who are not succeeding according to their standards, it may be prudent to meet with them in small-group counseling sessions. Some of the topics to be addressed can be coping with goal-related stress, as well as other issues that are more common among the general population of Black males.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p><italic>Large-group guidance</italic>. In addition to counseling Black male high achievers individually and in small groups, it is important that other students are aware of the dangers associated with goal-striving stress. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1076217512445999">Sellers and Neighbors (2008)</xref>, Blacks suffer from this type of stress at a higher rate than Whites. Nonetheless, it is important that, like any other type of stress, all students are aware of the phenomenon and the potential ramifications if it is ignored.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p><italic>Advocacy</italic>. Far too often, the primary intervention for anything that hinders student growth is to teach resilience methods to help them cope with said issue. While this is important, it is just as important to institute changes in the system that allows said issue to persist; only then will future generations of students not be subjugated to similar environmental conditions. In the case of the excellence gap, more attention must be given to the phenomenon on a structural as well as an individual level—a two-pronged approach is needed. Administrators and other educators must be made aware that although students appear to be succeeding academically, a gap in achievement still exists among those in the upper echelon of achievement and must be addressed.</p>

<title>Summary and Conclusion</title>
<p>Although some would argue the value of a postracial, culture-blind society, the scholarly research and popular literature is replete with evidence disproving the notion that such a utopia exists. In reality, race, masculinity, and everything they have come to represent over time, while socially constructed, still have real and often negative effects for Black males in systems of education—including those performing well, academically. Professional school counselors, working in concert with families and communities, are in a unique position to lend their considerable expertise—insights, training, and skills—to eradicating this pervasive issue. Moving away from a “one-size-fits-all” approach toward more nuanced interventions that demonstrate an understanding of the interactions between race and gender is a good place to begin.</p>
