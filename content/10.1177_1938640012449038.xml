<p><italic>Objective</italic>. To evaluate the safety and efficacy of the pan metatarsal head resection (PMHR) compared with nonsurgical management of wounds in the forefoot in people with diabetes. <italic>Methods</italic>. The authors evaluated 92 patients with diabetes (66.3% male), with ulcers classified as University of Texas grade 1A or 2A at the plantar aspect of the forefoot using a case-control model. Cases were patients treated with multiple metatarsal head resections for multiple metatarsal head wounds, and controls received standard nonsurgical care. Both groups received standard off-loading and wound care. Outcomes included time to healing, reulceration, infection, and amputation. <italic>Results</italic>. Patients in the surgery group (SG) healed significantly faster than those in the standard therapy group (ST; 84.2 <italic>±</italic> 39.9 days for the ST vs 60.1 <italic>±</italic> 27.9 days for the SG; P = .003) and had fewer recurrent ulcers (39.1% for the ST vs 15.2% for the SG; P = .02; odds ratio [OR] = 3.6; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.3-9.7) and infections during 1 year of follow-up (64.5% for the ST vs 35.5% for the SG; P = .047; OR = 2.4; 95% CI = 1.0-6.0). There was no significant difference in the proportion of patients receiving an incident amputation in the follow-up period (13.0% for the ST vs 6.5% for the SG; P = .5). <italic>Conclusion</italic>. The results of this study suggest that the PMHR may be associated with shorter times to healing and lower morbidity compared with standard care alone in patients without digital gangrene and with multiple plantar forefoot ulcers.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Diabetic foot ulcers constitute a major source of morbidity in both the developed and developing world.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1938640012449038">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1938640012449038">2</xref></sup> The etiology of these wounds most frequently involves repetitive normal and shear stress over an anatomically prominent location. Whereas normal sensation would allow for painful feedback, the presence of diabetic peripheral sensory neuropathy blunts this nociceptive response, leading to skin breakdown and chronic inflammation. It has been noted that once diabetic foot ulcers develop, more than 50% become infected, with 20% to 30% of these ending in amputation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1938640012449038">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1938640012449038"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1938640012449038">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>Treatment of diabetic foot ulcers fundamentally involves surgical debridement and redistribution of the stresses associated with cycles of activity (usually walking).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1938640012449038">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1938640012449038"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1938640012449038">8</xref></sup> This redistribution of stress (both vertical and shear) is most frequently performed through the use of casts, walking boots, bracing, and other modalities.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1938640012449038">9</xref></sup> Should these measures prove inadequate, surgical modification of the internal deforming forces is entertained.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1938640012449038">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1938640012449038">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>Surgical management, when necessary, should be tailored toward reducing focal stress. Resection of the metatarsal heads (either isolated or multiple) has been used as a surgical procedure to decrease the plantar pressure of the forefoot to help facilitate healing of multiple diabetic foot ulcers or sites before and after ulceration. The extant literature is mainly composed of retrospective case series reporting outcomes of metatarsal head resection in the treatment of diabetic neuropathic foot ulcers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1938640012449038">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1938640012449038"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1938640012449038">14</xref></sup> To our knowledge, there has been only 1 study that has compared metatarsal head resection with standard nonsurgical care. This cohort study evaluated the efficacy of isolated fifth metatarsal head resection and compared it with nonsurgical treatment of 40 people with plantar ulcerations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1938640012449038">15</xref></sup> It reported faster time to healing and reduced reulceration in the surgery group (SG). However, as mentioned above, this study was limited to a single metatarsal head resection and did not address the potentially very different scenario of multiple metatarsal head resection for deformities causing multiple ulcerations. No reports to our knowledge have been published using a case-control model comparing the pan metatarsal head resection (PMHR) for the treatment of multiple plantar forefoot ulcers in people with diabetes. Therefore, the purpose of the present study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the PMHR and compare it with nonsurgical management of diabetic forefoot wounds.</p>

<sec id="section2-1938640012449038" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>This project, designed as a case-control model, was conducted at a large, referral-based diabetic foot clinic located in a teaching institution. We abstracted data from a registry of more than 2900 patients on a combined podiatric and vascular surgical service.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1938640012449038">16</xref></sup> From this registry, we selected 92 consecutive patients with diabetes, aged 59.7 ± 9.7 years, who met the following criteria: (1) a diagnosis of diabetes by their primary care physician, (2) the presence of one or more wounds of the plantar forefoot with a history of multiple forefoot wounds, (3) the ability to ambulate freely without the assistance of a wheelchair, and (4) at least 1 year of clinical follow-up. All wounds were classified as University of Texas grade 1A or 2A (wounds without infection/ischemia not involving bone or joint).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1938640012449038">17</xref></sup> Abstracted data over a 3-year period for any multiple metatarsal head resection procedure performed during that interval yielded 46 procedures. These individuals were compared with 46 age- and sex-matched controls receiving standard nonsurgical care for plantar forefoot diabetic foot ulcers, thus yielding a 1:1 case to control ratio.</p>
<p>Patients were excluded if they had a diagnosis of clinically significant vascular disease that was not treated with vascular reconstruction. Vascular status was evaluated by pedal pulse palpation and noninvasive vascular laboratory assessment—primarily ankle-brachial index determination, toe pressure measurement, and arterial Doppler waveform assessment. The diagnosis of ischemia was standardized in the facility where data were abstracted and was made if there was a monophasic signal on Doppler ultrasonography of the dorsalis pedis or posterior tibial pulses on the affected extremity or an occlusive toe pressure of less than 40 mm Hg.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1938640012449038">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1938640012449038"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1938640012449038"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1938640012449038">21</xref></sup></p>
<p>Patients were excluded from analysis if they had a clinical diagnosis of acute soft-tissue or bone infection. Soft-tissue or bone infection was a clinical diagnosis made by the treating physician at the time of assessment. Per standard protocol, the diagnosis of infection was consistent with the current criteria described by the International Working Group on the Diabetic Foot.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1938640012449038">22</xref></sup> These include the presence of purulence, cellulitis, or 2 or more other local signs of inflammation.</p>
<p>Patients in both the surgery and control groups were treated in a standardized fashion per protocol followed in the high-risk diabetic foot center where treatment was rendered. All procedures performed fell into diabetic foot surgery class 3 (curative), using the classification described by Armstrong et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1938640012449038">23</xref></sup> The procedure performed was a multiple metatarsal head resection. This procedure, generally performed through multiple dorsal incisions over the forefoot involves resection of the head of the metatarsal proximal to the surgical neck (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1938640012449038">Figure 1</xref>). It reduces retrograde buckling and increases range of motion at the articulation of the given joint.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1938640012449038">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1938640012449038">24</xref></sup> All procedures were performed by one attending surgeon (DGA). Postoperative care for all patients was similar, with the first dressing change performed 2 to 3 days after surgery, with weekly evaluation thereafter. Wounds were dressed with moisture-retentive gauze and were not disturbed between weekly postoperative visits. On postoperative visit 3 (at 3 weeks), sutures were removed. Patients were then switched to a daily dressing change regime until the wound healed. Patients were off-loaded in a standard fashion using a DH Walker or DH sandal (Ossur Medical, Incorporated, Irvine, CA). These devices were converted into “instant total contact casts” at the discretion of the attending clinician, using the technique described by Armstrong and coworkers. The instant total contact cast involves wrapping a removable cast walker with cohesive bandage or plaster of Paris in an effort to ensure adherence to pressure off-loading.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1938640012449038">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1938640012449038">25</xref></sup> Patients in the control group were treated with moisture-retentive dressings and were off-loaded in a manner similar to the surgical group patients.</p>

<p>Care following healing was identical in both groups per a standardized protocol. All healed participants were assessed for appropriate footgear by the podiatrist and on-site pedorthics team. This footgear consisted of either comfort shoes or prescriptive depth inlay shoes with sufficient room in the toebox for an accommodative pressure-reducing insole. Patients were followed every 2 months following healing for foot examination and shoe gear checks.</p>
<p>We evaluated several outcome variables at 1-year follow-up in this case-control model, including time to healing, recurrent ulcer rate, and rates of infections and amputation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1938640012449038">Figure 2</xref>). Healing was defined as complete epithelialization of the wound without drainage.

<sec id="section4-1938640012449038" sec-type="discussion">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The results of this study suggest that PMHR is a safe and effective procedure in the treatment of noninfected, nonischemic wounds of the plantar forefoot when compared with nonsurgical therapy. Although this type of procedure is commonly performed in persons with diabetic foot ulcers, this appears to be the first report in the medical literature to make this comparison.</p>
<p>The current study reports a reduction in healing times of approximately 3 weeks (8.8 vs 12.0 weeks) for neuropathic foot ulcers following a PMHR. This is longer than the previously mentioned healing rates by Armstrong et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1938640012449038">15</xref></sup> in which isolated fifth metatarsal head resection healed at an average of 5.8 weeks compared with 8.7 weeks for the controls. This finding may suggest that wounds appearing under multiple metatarsals are the result of more significant deformities that require longer durations for wound healing. This stands to reason because our group has reported that increased numbers of documented foot deformities are associated with a significant trend toward higher peak plantar pressure.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1938640012449038">27</xref></sup> Despite the longer time to healing in this cohort, the difference in time to healing is still 3 weeks faster in the surgical group, which is nearly identical to the previous single metatarsal head resection study.</p>
<p>With respect to the reulceration rate, there was a greater than 2-fold reduction in the PMHR patients over a 1-year period compared with the control group (15.2% vs 39.1%). In a previous survey of 12 patients with diabetes by Petrov et al,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1938640012449038">14</xref></sup> the recurrence of plantar ulcerations following PMHR in neuropathic ulcers was 25%. It is possible that an alteration in preventive off-loading once healing occurred could be a reason for the difference. There was no mention in the latter study regarding postoperative off-loading. The only other studies evaluating this procedure involved patients with rheumatoid arthritis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1938640012449038">28</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1938640012449038"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1938640012449038">30</xref></sup> By virtue of the very different patient (nonneuropathic, generally nonulcerated) population, the issues (healing, reulceration) that might compel a surgeon and patient to embark on this procedure in a neuropathic patient were not stressed or well described, either. Each patient in the current study was professionally fitted with deformity-specific shoes and insoles and routinely followed for shoe gear checks by an interdisciplinary outpatient team consisting of podiatric and vascular surgery as well as certified pedorthists.</p>
<p>The overall healing rate without amputation was high in both the SG and ST (94% and 87%, respectively). These results closely mirror findings from Giurini and coworkers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1938640012449038">12</xref></sup> and Wieman et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1938640012449038">13</xref></sup> (94% and 88%, respectively). Although neither of these studies offered a comparative control group nor did they follow patients for 1 year, it appears that amputation outcomes may be at least grossly comparable.</p>
<p>The overall incidence of subsequent infection in this group (35.5%) is relatively high compared with that in nondiabetic elective foot surgery (reported as 3%).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1938640012449038">31</xref></sup> Lavery and coworkers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1938640012449038">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1938640012449038">32</xref></sup> reported an infection to ulcer ratio of 56% during the life cycle of lower-extremity wounds in persons with diabetes. This rate, however, compares favorably with the proportion of patients in the control group requiring treatment for infection during their period of therapy (65.5%). To our knowledge, this is the first study to quantify this comparison for PMHR.</p>
<p>There was no significant difference in the proportion of people undergoing amputation at any level between surgical and nonsurgical groups in this study. It is difficult to speculate on the reasons why this is the case, given the presence of improved time to healing and lower proportion of infection favoring the SG. This may be a result of (among other possibilities) underlying osteomyelitis that was inadequately resected, occult vascular disease leading to faulty healing, or type 2 statistical error.</p>
<p>One limitation of this study is its case-control design, which exposes the data to potential selection bias. The particular concern is in the determination of surgical and non-surgical patients. The decision to operate may be based on a multitude of factors such as perceived compliance, qualitative surgeon preference, and consent of the patients being offered the treatment options. Although bias cannot be completely excluded, the descriptive characteristics of both the surgery group and non-SG were similar.</p>
<p>Additionally, one might argue that a good comparison group might ultimately be transmetatarsal amputation, a procedure that is almost always considered in this population as an alternative to multiple metatarsal head resections. Although a viable option, recent data suggest that the outcomes are not as predictable as some might suggest, particularly in high-risk patients. Landry and coworkers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1938640012449038">33</xref></sup> reported a 53% healing rate for patients followed over a 6-year period. This rate of healing versus proximal revision falls in between data our group reported in 1997 for ischemic (90% proximal revision) versus neuropathic (4% revision) patients over a 15-month follow-up period.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1938640012449038">34</xref></sup> This stands to reason because we believe that our population over this time period has shifted to a more mixed neuroischemic one.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1938640012449038">35</xref></sup> Although it is no doubt a significant challenge, future work in this area might consider comparing similarly matched patients receiving both procedures. We believe that this procedure ultimately offers an option for healing and risk reduction in the patient with nongangrenous digits and plantar diabetic foot ulcers.</p>
<p>PMHR appears to be a potentially effective procedure that may improve time to healing, reduce the incidence of infection, and lower the rate of reulceration when surgically treating multiple neuropathic diabetic foot ulcers. Further studies of PMHR are needed to better define its clinical role.</p>
