<title>History</title>
<p>Although descriptions of hand surgical treatments go back to ancient Egyptians and Greeks, modern hand surgery as a multidisciplinary qualification was only born between the two World wars, when the number of wounds and their sequelae promoted its development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1753193413488491">Verdan, 1980</xref>). Since then, hand surgery in Europe has been performed by surgeons with different training backgrounds, including not only plastic, orthopaedic and general surgery, but also traumatology and paediatric surgery. This heterogenic background reflects the wide basis of knowledge and skills necessary for a complete and competent hand surgeon. It also explains why it remains an additional qualification in most countries with a wide range of different training programmes and curricula (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1753193413488491">FESSH, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>In 1996 the Federation of European Societies for Surgery of the Hand (FESSH) was founded with the aim of improving the exchange of knowledge among hand surgeons and to improve the standard of hand surgery throughout Europe. It seeks to develop surgical resources by advising European authorities of the requirements and appropriate standards of hand care. Another purpose of FESSH is to rationalize and unify the training and educational structure for qualification of European hand surgical specialists.</p>
<p>From the beginning, FESSH worked on these topics appointing different chairmen to be members of the Council, among them the Chairman of the Examination with the specific task to establish and develop a common assessment for all hand surgeons across Europe. This examination is neither a substitute for the national examinations (where present), nor does it give the right to practice in any European country, but as stated in the Glasgow Declaration (<xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-1753193413488491">Appendix 1</xref>) it is intended to be a mark of excellence and of recognition for fulfilling the high standards required by the European Board of Hand Surgery.</p>
<p>In 1996 the first FESSH Diploma Examination was held in Paris with the participation of 38 candidates. The examination was held again in 1999, 2000 and afterward every year from 2002 on the day before the FESSH congress with an almost constant rise in the number of candidates (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1753193413488491">Table 1</xref>).</p>

<p>In 2010 hand surgery was recognized by the European Institution of all medical specialists, Union Européen des Médecins Spécialistes (UEMS), as a separated board and the European Board of Hand Surgery (EBHS) was established. FESSH was then confirmed as the provider of the diploma examination thus it changed the name to the EBHS Examination.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1753193413488491">
<title>The examination committee</title>
<p>Starting in 2007 a permanent working examination committee was established, including all the examiners under the lead of the Chairman of the Examination. The main activity of the committee, beyond the examination, is writing, correcting and validating of multiple choice questions (MCQs). Since 2011 oral cases have been prepared, discussed and validated in the group. Moreover the committee collaborates with the chairman on developing the examination and its rules.</p>
<p>The chairman participates to the activities of the Council for European Specialist Medical Assessment (CESMA), is an officer of the European Board of Hand Surgery and has the responsibility for organizing and controlling the EBHS Examination.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1753193413488491">
<title>The examination</title>
<p>To be eligible candidates require: (a) adequate training in hand surgery according to the different national regulations as reported in the White Book on Hand Surgery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1753193413488491">FESSH, 2011</xref>); (b) membership of a national society (associated to FESSH or the International Federation of Societies for Surgery of the Hand (IFSSH)) or with a letter of recommendation from the national society; and (c) surgical experience as defined in the log-book also reported in the White Book.</p>
<p>The examination consists of a written part and two viva voce interviews of 45 minutes. The candidates that pass the written examination gain the right to continue with the viva voce. Each part is marked one to five with the minimum to pass set at three. A marginal failure in one viva voce (mark two) can be compensated with a better performance in the second. The examination is held in English, even though an effort is made to have examiners that can help in the mother language of the candidate in order to avoid language-based incomprehension.</p>
<p>Starting from 2013 the written test is held two to three months before the oral part in different European centres, depending on the number and origin of the candidates, under the responsibility of examiners appointed by the chairman. This part of the EBHS examination deals with theoretical and applied knowledge and is composed of 60 multiple choice questions (stem with five true/false statements each) that are selected from the pool of questions selected and validated by the Examination Committee. Considerable effort is made to cover the wide range of conditions and procedures typical of hand surgery, however the relative number of questions in each field remains constant thanks to a pre-determined blueprint (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1753193413488491">Table 2</xref>) based on the knowledge basis reported in chapter 3.1 of the White Book (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1753193413488491">FESSH, 2011</xref>). The candidates have 120 minutes to answer the questionnaire. Negative marks for wrong answers are used in order to reduce the effect of guessing, as already applied in other European board examinations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1753193413488491">Mathysen et al., 2012</xref>).</p>

<p>The main goal is to keep the pass rate stable through the years even though the exams may vary in difficulty.</p>
<p>The rules for marking and setting the pass mark are similar to some other European board examinations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1753193413488491">Mathysen et al., 2012</xref>). CESMA is working on harmonizing these, but at the moment there are no fixed rules and the choice remains with the chairman.</p>
<p>The viva voce interviews are with two different pairs of examiners and include at least three questions each. The results are recorded on an evaluation sheet that is archived for future reference. The first viva voce is about traumatic and post-traumatic conditions, while the second one is about congenital abnormalities, degenerative problems, tumours and peripheral and central nerve problems.</p>
<p>Candidates who pass the EBHS Examination and who are certified specialists in their own country may call themselves ‘Fellow of the European Board of Hand Surgery’ and will receive a certificate (see also <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-1753193413488491">Appendix 1</xref>).</p>
<p>The harmonization of training in hand surgery across Europe is not yet a reality, but the EBHS examination is, at the moment, the only international assessment open to all hand surgeons that meets the required standards. In 2013, CESMA started an audit process that ensures an independent evaluation as an additional guarantee of quality. In the future, the constantly rising mobility of specialists across Europe and from outside the continent will make the need for a unifying European exam even more important. With the EBHS Examination we aim to maintain the high European standards of education and training in hand surgery and to provide a benchmark that could be used by sovereign states as part of their own assessments. Those countries that already have a national exam may wish to continue with their current system, but we hope that a growing number will adopt the EBHS examination as part of their certification of completion of training in hand surgery.</p>
