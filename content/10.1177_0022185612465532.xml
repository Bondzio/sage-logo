<abstract>
<p>This article examines the position of women within the modernization processes of British trade unions, based on the first analysis to date of projects funded under the British government’s Trade Union Modernisation Fund. The focus of the article on the Trade Union Modernisation Fund provides unique insights into the relatively underexplored ‘inner workings’ of unions, and allows an examination of the types of modernization projects that may advance women’s interests within unions and the types of challenges such initiatives face. The projects suggested that reflection and learning around women’s interests and equality agendas were taking place, along with a degree of mainstreaming and embedding activity within union structures. However, projects had to face not only deeply entrenched constraints, but also a new set of challenges raised by the process of modernization itself.</p>

<sec id="sec1-0022185612465532" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>This article examines how projects funded under the British government’s Trade Union Modernisation Fund (UMF) have contributed to integrating women’s concerns into trade union agendas. Trade union density by gender achieved parity in the UK around 2001, and female membership has subsequently outstripped male membership. In 2011, union density of female employees in the UK was 28.7%, compared to 23.4% for male employees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0022185612465532">Brownlie, 2012</xref>). Female members are significantly more likely to work in the public sector.</p>
<p>Despite advances in their share of membership, the leadership structures and power relations within unions have traditionally been, and remain, balanced in favour of men (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0022185612465532">Cooper, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0022185612465532">Cunnison and Stageman, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0022185612465532">Kirton and Healy, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0022185612465532">Munro, 2001</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0022185612465532">Kirton and Healy (2008)</xref> note that while gender representation against most measures of union leadership has improved, few unions have achieved ‘proportionality’. Many commentators argue that for women to achieve proportionality within the representational and power structures of unions, deeper cultural change is needed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0022185612465532">Cooper, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0022185612465532">Dickens, 1997</xref>). Yet surprisingly little research has explored change and modernization programmes within unions. This is the aim of this article. It examines how British unions have sought to promote, increase and mainstream women’s participation in unions through different types of change initiatives. The article aims to locate this agenda within the broader context of political and organizational modernization and how this shapes and can underpin wider union equality agendas.</p>
<p>A novel aspect of the change initiatives examined in this article is that they were resourced through state funding of the UMF. Introduced in 2005, the UMF was set against the changing contextual environment faced by British unions and sought to assist unions’ adaptation to changing labour market conditions (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0022185612465532">Stuart et al., 2010</xref>). Our analysis covers projects funded under the first two UMF rounds, many of which had a central focus on equality. A focus on the UMF allows for unique insights into the inner workings of trade unions, something that is recognized as central to the wider strategic reorientation of unions, but which is under-researched (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0022185612465532">Cooper, 2012</xref>). Following a review of the relevant literature, the article maps the context, activities and outcomes of UMF projects, before evaluating the challenges for internal change and the mainstreaming of women’s interests. By emphasizing women’s interests and the mainstreaming of equality, the article shows how the modernization of unions is a complex, multilayered process that brings about change, prompts reflection and learning, but also raises new challenges and concerns.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-0022185612465532"><title>Women, Trade Unions and Modernization</title>
<p>The literature on women in unions has explored how representation has developed over time, and the position of women’s interests within the policies and practices of unions. In Britain, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0022185612465532">Howell (1996)</xref> notes, the union movement started to engage more directly with women’s issues from the late 1970s. For example, the Trades Union Congress (TUC) established a ‘Charter for equality for women within trade unions’ in 1979. Revised in 1990, the ‘Charter for equality’ recommended key targets for women’s participation and advocated ‘proportionality’ in terms of women’s involvement in unions’ decision-making structures. For <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0022185612465532">Howell (1996)</xref>, this had less to do with recognition by unions of the need to change their internal policies and practices, and more an acceptance that the traditional male model of trade unionism, and the associated industries that served this, were being challenged in cultural and organizational terms due to sectoral and political changes. Unions essentially had little choice but to develop more effective ways of representing women’s interests, given the changing composition of the labour market.</p>
<p>From this perspective, change is seen as largely driven by exogenous factors. Certainly, unions have sought to develop new ‘renewal’ strategies that respond to their changing economic, compositional, technological and legal contexts, through approaches such as organizing, community-building and labour–management cooperation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0022185612465532">Simms et al., 2012</xref>). Yet the ability of unions to deploy such strategies is heavily contingent on internal administrative, leadership and democratic structures and cultures. It is well recognized in the organizing literature, for example, that if unions are to more effectively represent diverse groups of interest, including those of women, the cultures and structures of unions, often criticized for being ‘male, pale and stale’, need to be transformed. In other words, endogenous drivers and challenges also need consideration.</p>
<p>Numerous studies have explored how women’s roles and interests can contribute to union renewal, transformation and the decision-making structures of unions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0022185612465532">Cunnison and Stageman, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0022185612465532">Dickens, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0022185612465532">Healy and Kirton, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0022185612465532">Kirton and Greene, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0022185612465532">Parker, 2009</xref>). Such research highlights a tension between whether women’s interests are best advanced through separate union structures or more general mainstreaming, through the transformation of practices, policies and cultures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0022185612465532">Colgan and Ledwith, 1996</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0022185612465532">Colgan and Ledwith (1996</xref>: 158) note that union initiatives tend to follow either a liberal or a radical approach: ‘The liberal approach emphasises the development of “fair”, and frequently bureaucratic, procedures in order to deliver equality’, and includes specialized women’s courses and support systems for childcare and family responsibilities. While many unions developed such initiatives, they did little to challenge power structures within unions and often disappointed in terms of the wider representation of women’s interests (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0022185612465532">Dickens, 1997</xref>). The deeply embedded masculine cultures and patriarchal views of unions mean that change requires more radical approaches that ‘intervene directly in organisational practices in order to achieve fair representation and a fair distribution of rewards among groups’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0022185612465532">Colgan and Ledwith, 1996</xref>: 159). This can be seen in the development of stand-alone women’s groups or structures, such as women’s committees, conferences and reserved seats on key decision-making bodies.</p>
<p>Extensive research has explored the way in which women’s groups and structures may contribute to union change and transformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0022185612465532">Colgan and Ledwith, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0022185612465532">Dickens, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0022185612465532">Kirton and Healy, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0022185612465532">Parker, 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0022185612465532">2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0022185612465532">Parker and Douglas, 2010</xref>). Women’s groups are defined as ‘collective spaces for women within the union setting that enable them to develop their strengths, advance their concerns and access empowering positions’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0022185612465532">Parker, 2009</xref>: 78), based on the premiss that women have common concerns as a disadvantaged social group that require a ‘separate space’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0022185612465532">Parker, 2002</xref>). Such groups and structures grew systematically during the 1990s and early 2000s, before stabilizing more recently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0022185612465532">Kirton and Greene, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0022185612465532">Parker, 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0022185612465532">2009</xref>). Nonetheless, there has been extensive debate over the effectiveness of separate interest structures compared to the mainstreaming of women’s issues. A major concern is whether separate structures marginalize women’s issues and roles within union hierarchies rather than integrate them into mainstream union agendas and priorities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0022185612465532">Colgan and Ledwith, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0022185612465532">Cooper, 2012</xref>). From this perspective, if women’s issues are not integrated as mainstream union business, they may remain secondary or even fall off the union bargaining agenda (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0022185612465532">Cooper, 2012</xref>). Nonetheless, many unions have not adequately reflected women’s interests in past campaigns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0022185612465532">Dickens, 1997</xref>), thereby necessitating separate organizing. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0022185612465532">Heery and Conley (2007</xref>: 10) argue that in terms of developing policy on part-time work, evidence shows that it was ‘unequivocally … a product of women’s activism’.</p>
<p>Most large unions have recognized that gender (and race) equality will not happen without cultural and structural change: positive action may be required (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0022185612465532">Kirton and Greene, 2002</xref>). For example, unions have sought to address women’s under-representation through reserve seats on national executives and committees, and the number of senior women union officials has increased over the last 20 years, though remains way short of proportionality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0022185612465532">Kirton and Healy, 1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0022185612465532">2008</xref>). Deeply entrenched challenges remain, including: the reluctance of many union traditionalists to accept change; the attitudes of union leaders; the ‘masculinist culture’ of unions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0022185612465532">Cooper, 2012</xref>); the proportion of female activists; and differences within unions over how to organize and bargain for equality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0022185612465532">Parker and Douglas, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Despite these constraints, the increased participation of women has contributed, at least partially, to the reshaping of many union agendas. Women’s activism and the creation of self-organized interest groups have contributed to more diverse sets of interests (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0022185612465532">Parker, 2006</xref>) and representation of women, for example, in terms of class, occupation, ethnicity, disability or sexual orientation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0022185612465532">Munro, 2001</xref>). Nonetheless, more recently, mainstreaming approaches have been advocated within the feminist movement, which aims to ‘make visible the gendered nature of assumptions, processes, and outcomes’ within institutions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0022185612465532">Walby, 2005</xref>: 321). Mainstreaming typically requires gender and/or equality issues to be built into policy programmes with the aim of ‘ensuring that gender effects are taken into account in the initial design’, thus potentially creating ‘transformatory approaches’ to policymaking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0022185612465532">Rubery, 2002</xref>: 501). While rare in practice, the principle of integrating gender- and equality-based concerns into all decision-making and policy does hold the prospect for new thinking and transformation, moving beyond separatism and towards integration and negotiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0022185612465532">Walby, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>In understanding how women’s interests and equality may become mainstreamed within unions, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0022185612465532">Parker (2009)</xref> calls for an analysis that is sensitive to both internal factors and external environmental changes. This is because, as noted earlier, while the changing legislative context may have helped raise the profile of women’s concerns at a societal level and within unions, deeper internal cultural problems remain; and, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0022185612465532">Parker (2009)</xref> explains, women activists typically cite internal concerns as more significant drivers of change than external factors. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0022185612465532">Heery and Conley (2007)</xref> explore how mainstreaming can occur through a process of ‘frame extension’, with reference to union policy development for part-time workers. This process, they argue, occurred through several important developments, including: the mobilization and self-organization of specific groups of members and other key actors, such as feminist activists in positions of influence; and the way in which unions have been able to take advantage of the changing legislative framework, including European Directives on equality. These developments together contributed to the evolution of union policies and practices on part-time work. A combination of pressures provided the frame through which unions sought to advance gender equality and commit to the broadening equality agenda.</p>
<p>This brings us to the wider question of how state-initiated support for union modernization may facilitate cultural change and transformation within unions. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0022185612465532">Howell (2005)</xref> observes, the British state has long sought to intervene in the activities of trade unions. Such state intervention is not just the product of legislation (or the state as an employer). Recently, the state has sought to ‘modernize’ not just the contours of employment relations, but the practices of trade unions themselves, through various forms of ‘soft regulation’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0022185612465532">Stuart et al., 2011</xref>). The aim of this article is to examine how one particular initiative, the UMF, sought to facilitate the integration of women’s interests and equality concerns into union agendas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0022185612465532">Department of Trade and Industry (DTI), 2005</xref>). The challenges confronting women have been considered earlier, but are supported by wider studies of union revitalization strategies, such as organizing, which point to the internal constraints unions face in transforming themselves, in terms of resource constraints, poor management systems and lack of commitment to change from senior leaders, full-time officials and lay activists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0022185612465532">Heery and Simms, 2008</xref>). To the extent that the UMF provided much-needed resources and space for ideational experimentation, the article is interested in how UMF activities may have provided an opportunity structure that, in responding to external pressures by confronting internal constraints, contributed to the mainstreaming of women’s interests.</p>
<p>This is not to suggest that organizational change initiatives and union transformation are anything but complex. As organizations, unions have their own distinctive strategic imperatives and concerns that are often far removed from consideration of administrative or operational efficiency. The specific union context will shape the way in which modernization is defined and implemented. Nonetheless, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0022185612465532">Hyman (2007</xref>: 4–5) suggests that in understanding how unions may go about modernization:<disp-quote>
<p>Whether, and how, unions respond to external and internal challenges, is also conditioned by what may be termed organisational capacity. This can be understood as the ability to assess opportunities for intervention; to anticipate, rather than merely react to, changing circumstances; to frame coherent policies; and to implement these effectively.</p></disp-quote>While <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0022185612465532">Hyman (2007</xref>: 5) notes that the meaning of ‘organisational capacity’ is difficult to ‘specify concretely’, he argues that modernization is best understood in terms of how processes of organizational capacity develop, change and may be challenged to generate particular outcomes. Related to this is the nature of organizational learning and, in particular, how organizations, and in this case unions, are able to ‘unlearn’ extant internal bureaucratic protocols in the pursuit of modernization.</p>
<p>The logic of the modernization imperative, then, as <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0022185612465532">Table 1</xref> details, is in part to fit the internal organizational space of unions (and associated opportunities and constraints) with the needs of a changing social and economic context, where worker representation requires constant innovation and new forms of dialogue. Thus, we would argue that processes of organizational change that seek to advance and sustain women’s interests, and more broadly the equality agenda, must be understood in terms of how unions actually develop more responsive and strategic internal organizational structures and systems of representation, while at the same time facing and potentially transforming extant internal constraints. By focusing on the UMF, we explore an alternative way in which unions have acquired resources to assist with their own internal change agendas across a range of issues. The article points to how questions of gender and women’s position within society and unions cannot be understood solely in terms of bureaucratic practice or political discourse and regulation, but necessitate a greater sensitivity to issues of change and the structural context more generally. To the extent that the UMF is concerned with the operational and administrative modernization of unions, it thus presents us with a unique opportunity to explore in more depth the ‘black box’ of unions’ internal structures and change agendas.

<sec id="sec3-0022185612465532"><title>The Context of the Union Modernisation Fund</title>
<p>The UMF was the result of a political compromise between the Labour government and the union movement, the so-called Warwick Agreement, prior to the 2005 general election. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0022185612465532">Simms et al. (2012)</xref> note, unions experienced something of a benign environment under the ‘New’ Labour government from 1997. While this did not extend to repeal of the previous Conservative governments’ anti-union laws, it did include increased individual employment rights, the introduction of a National Minimum Wage and a statutory recognition procedure for unions. Unions were also supported through small-scale funding programmes, the Union Learning Fund being the most notable (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0022185612465532">Rainbird and Stuart, 2011</xref>). The UMF was an idea pushed by the union movement, initially on the basis of gaining state support for the upgrading of technological capacity. Following consultation, the government put aside £5–10m to support union innovation and modernization, but with a wider remit than just unions’ computer systems, set against the changing external context that unions faced and the recognition that unions had limited resources to experiment with new ideas.</p>
<p>The UMF aimed to support innovative projects to help <italic>speed</italic> unions’ adaptation to changing labour market conditions and economic change more broadly. It supported projects that either explored the potential for, or contributed to, a <italic>transformational</italic> change in organizational efficiency or effectiveness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0022185612465532">DTI, 2005</xref>). The scheme offered matched funding up to £200,000 against designated priority themes: it did not support activity that directly led to membership recruitment, the support of strikes or political activity. Projects were supported across three rounds of funding. For the purposes of this article, we focus on the first two rounds which covered 66 projects (35 in UMF1 and 31 in UMF2); UMF3 focused on vulnerable workers, funded just 13 projects and did not complete until 2012.</p>
<p>Projects funded under UMF1 and UMF2 were led by 40 different unions, both large and small (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0022185612465532">Stuart et al., 2010</xref>). The first projects started in 2006, set against six thematic priorities: understanding modern business practices; improving two-way communications with members; responding to labour market diversity; applying modern management methods; developing professional competence; and assessing the challenges of mergers. UMF2 projects started in 2007 and, of interest to this article, included a new priority (at the recommendation of the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0022185612465532">Women and Work Commission (2006)</xref>) focused on the training and capacity-building of ‘equality representatives’. Many of the labour market diversity projects, and specifically those on equality representatives, sought to develop unions’ capacity for improving gender equality and representing women’s interests.</p>
<p>The development of the UMF was tracked by the authors from its inception in 2006 to its conclusion in 2012. During this period, telephone interviews were conducted with project managers across each round, along with more detailed case studies of 10 first-round projects and interviews with fund officials. In total, more than 100 interviews were conducted, supported by extensive documentary analysis of all project quarterly and final reports. For the purposes of this article, we draw exclusively from those UMF1 and UMF2 projects (18 out of 66) that had either a central focus on women’s interests or more general concerns with gender and equality.</p>
<p>For analytical purposes, Tables <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0022185612465532">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0022185612465532">3</xref> highlight the projects examined in the article. These included six notable projects under UMF1 and 12 in UMF2. Two UMF1 projects, led by the National Union of Journalists (NUJ) and the Transport and General Workers Union (TGWU), sought to trial new workplace union ‘equality representatives’. These projects proved timely, as they coincided with the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0022185612465532">Women and Work Commission’s (2006)</xref> recommendations that the government allocate an additional £5m to the UMF ‘for capacity building to support training and development of equality reps in the private and public sectors’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0022185612465532">Women and Work Commission, 2006</xref>: 86–87). This was rejected in favour of an additional priority theme (in UMF2) on equality representatives. Consequently, seven equality representative projects were funded in UMF2, with an additional coordinating project let by the TUC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0022185612465532">TUC, 2009</xref>).

<sec id="sec4-0022185612465532"><title>Union Modernization Fund Initiatives to Support Women in Unions: Activities and Outcomes</title>
<p>As Tables <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0022185612465532">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0022185612465532">3</xref> show, UMF projects focused on a diverse array of activities. Typically, the final outputs of projects were new educational provision and newly trained staff. Yet these often basic activities sought to contribute in a variety of ways to deeper processes of cultural change and the wider mainstreaming of women’s issues and concerns. In the following, the activities of projects are considered in terms of key organizational dimensions of change.</p>
<sec id="sec5-0022185612465532"><title>Knowledge Creation, Understanding and Dissemination</title>
<p>Projects often began with background research to understand, and respond to, the concerns and needs of different stakeholders. The research often revealed extensive gaps in unions’ knowledge of membership demographics. For example, the UMF1 project by the GMB – a large general union – on race and diversity had set itself key targets for increasing the participation of diverse groups, including women, in the union’s democratic structures. Yet initial analysis revealed gaps in the union’s membership database that prohibited any baseline comparison against the target. The union simply did not know how many members were of particular ethnic groupings or the diversity and gender profile of lay officials.</p>
<p>Research and consultation also sought to ascertain particular training needs, for example, in relation to the demands of equality representatives or to identify fair access to leadership/management in respect of women and minority officials. Research also confirmed and challenged established views within unions. For example, the UMF2 project by the Public, Commercial and Services Union (PCS) on mentoring had developed from a concern of the union’s women’s committee that women were under-represented in senior positions. An initial audit of women across the union confirmed that while there was a growing number of women at lower levels and in activist roles, they were under-represented at higher levels of the union. Hardly unexpected, the findings helped to legitimize the project internally and evidenced the need for the project in promotional materials. Similarly, the British Dental Association (BDA) project manager explained that while the research found ‘nothing too earth shattering … it provided empirical evidence to back up assumptions’.</p>
<p>Evidence was also used to raise awareness and interest in the value of particular projects. Where projects produced toolkits, they typically distributed them widely to elicit views on how they could be updated and refined. In other cases, such as the UMF1 TGWU project on equality representatives, evidence and output had more of a campaigning purpose. Likewise, the UMF2 TUC equality representative project commissioned research on the impact of equality representatives at the workplace that was used in the wider campaigning activity of unions for the support that equality representatives may need from employers and the state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0022185612465532">Bacon and Hoque, 2012</xref>). Hence, change was increasingly tied to a more systematic effort on reflecting and measuring the challenges to unions.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec6-0022185612465532"><title>Building Resources and Expertise</title>
<p>Projects contributed to resourcing and expertise in three ways: new posts within unions; training for different groups of union officials and staff; and equality toolkits to guide and sustain practice. First, in many cases, the projects contributed to the employment of dedicated project workers/managers, or the secondment of senior union officers. While the remit of such positions was self-evidently to oversee projects, they also acted more widely as ‘change agents’ within unions. Project workers played an important role in legitimating the activities of projects, challenging existing practices and fostering learning within unions. They acted as conduits between different interests and structures within unions, though much depended on senior leadership support.</p>
<p>Second, programmes of training were ubiquitous across projects. These included: training dedicated to particular roles, such as equality representatives; more general training and awareness-raising for larger and more diverse groups of staff; and the trialling and development of new courses for ongoing union education. As part of the UMF1 GMB Race and Diversity project, 452 members of union staff undertook diversity awareness courses. The rationale was to mainstream issues of gender, race and the broader diversity agenda across all aspects of the organization, from the senior officials and national executive down to branch and regional structures. From this, regions and branches were expected to further cascade learning down to lay representative level. The General Federation of Trade Unions (GFTU), which supports many smaller unions, along with a research partner, Ruskin College, developed a range of accredited education resources that sought to empower and develop future women leaders within unions.</p>
<p>Third, there were concrete outputs – artefacts – that were usable internally and externally. These included detailed equalities toolkits/handbooks and guides, such as the UMF1 projects by the Wales TUC, NUJ and TGWU, and UMF2 projects by the GFTU, Communication Workers' Union (CWU), Unison, Unite, PCS and TUC. The NUJ toolkit, for example, contained: a job description and advice for the establishment, recognition and training of equality representatives; a model equality agreement; guidance for equalities bargaining; and ‘best practice’ tips for representatives. It also contained updated information on equalities legislation, and was published in both hard form and on the Web. The main problem facing this project was the hostile employer environment in terms of support for NUJ equality representatives.</p>
<p>The UMF2 toolkit produced by the CWU followed a similar model. The project manager described the ‘equality agenda as a living creature, continually developing, and that as a result the toolkit was a platform that needed to be developed’. Available online, it was seen by the union project manager as ‘groundbreaking’ and the ‘most comprehensive online diversity toolkit of any union’. Designed to ‘empower equality representatives’, it was available to members and union officials. This, the union claimed, had impacted internal union culture and the behaviour of members, as it had changed attitudes towards equalities and opened debate on challenging topics for the union. According to the project manager, there had been a reduction in workplace disputes over equality issues as members, more informed by their rights, were using the toolkit directly before taking up matters formally with equality representatives or branch officials. Toolkits were shared just as widely by other unions and, in the case of the NUJ, also acted as a benchmark across unions. In the case of the UMF1 TGWU project, the project manager claimed that equality representatives were ‘literally carrying their handbooks in their pockets’. Such ‘artefacts’ acted as concrete reference points that were not contingent on internal politics or formal accessibility. The materials were meant to be circulated and used within and between unions.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec7-0022185612465532"><title>Representing the Equality Agenda</title>
<p>Projects provided the resources and space for unions to experiment with novel ideas for the representation of members’ interests. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0022185612465532">Parker and Douglas’s (2010)</xref> study of the relationship between women’s groups and union renewal strategies in Britain and New Zealand suggested linkages with union organizing and also external communities and coalitions, but little connection with partnership strategies with employers. UMF2 projects had started to connect with union organizing, although this was not an intended outcome. A number of projects had also forged links with leading policy and practitioner bodies in the equalities field. For example, the UMF1 Wales TUC project had worked in partnership with the Equality and Human Rights Commission.</p>
<p>Partnership relationships with employers were not central, but were explored by selected projects. The UMF1 TGWU project held various ‘awareness’ workshops with large employers. This project, and others (such as UMF1 Transport Salaried Staff Association [TSSA]), developed ‘pilot partnerships’ with employers to explore recognition of equality representatives and wider equalities bargaining. Getting employers on board proved problematic. It was not uncommon for employers who had signalled initial commitment to be less than cooperative once projects started (e.g. UMF1 TSSA). The equality agenda was as much a challenge for employers as it was for unions.</p>
<p>More significant than partnership relations was the development of union equality representatives. This new representational role had been trialled in UMF1 projects by the NUJ and TGWU. The NUJ trained 70 equality representatives to represent mainly freelance workers. While the TGWU project trained just 40–50, their project was more wide-ranging and designed to have political impact. The union used the project not only to extol the benefits of equality representatives, but also to raise wider political issues and to campaign for dedicated legal rights for equal representatives. At present, equality representatives, unlike the union learning representative role, do not have statutory rights.</p>
<p>The various UMF2 equality representative projects were networked together via a TUC-led coordinating project (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0022185612465532">TUC, 2009</xref>). This project sought to promote the new role and recruit and train a network of equality representatives. A survey was conducted across 11 unions to evaluate the activities and training needs of equality representatives. This contributed to the design of a new, nationally accredited three-day training course. Twelve initial pilot projects trained 129 equality representatives. Two training courses were also held for 21 TUC tutors. Following feedback from tutors and trainees, the learning materials were further refined, hard copy manuals printed and an online resource developed. Interest in the online education was high and a further 116 reps were trained. Materials were shared with the seven other UMF2 equality representative projects and the TUC shared materials, project findings and good practice. Ambitious targets had been set across projects: Unite – 400 equality reps; UNISON – 380 reps and 180 branch equalities officers; PCS – an equalities officer in every branch; National Union of Teachers (NUT) – an equalities officer in each of its 149 associations and divisions; Prospect – 30 equalities representatives to train 30 interested members. An independent evaluation concluded that equality representatives were starting to impact at the workplace level and that projects were starting to change perceptions of equality and behaviour at workplaces. We see in regards to this dimension a move towards a more concerned effort at networking, and internal communication strategies that aim to open communication on new agenda issues and new forms of trade union activity.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec8-0022185612465532"><title>The Embedding of Equality in Union Structures</title>
<p>UMF projects were naturally concerned with internal sustainability, not just in terms of project activity, but also the wider impact of project processes on internal union culture. Projects recognized that any assessment of the impact of projects would need a long-term perspective. Nonetheless, there was some evidence of impact and sustainability through some forms of training provision and through resources such as toolkits. The UMF1 TGWU project manager noted how their equalities handbook had been ‘weaved into everything that the union did’; a sentiment expressed by most unions. A minority of projects went further and actively explored how the activities, outputs and outcomes of projects could be embedded more generally into union rulebooks, branch structures, equalities networks and wider aspects of policy. For example, the UMF2 UNISON project on equality representatives sought explicitly to embed the role in the union’s rulebook and in its branches. This was rightly seen as needed to challenge perceived resistance from the more traditional cadres of the union and ensure the legitimacy of the equality representative role as core union business. The project did this through a number of branch pilots. In contrast, the UMF2 TSSA project sought to mainstream equalities through the encouragement and development of self-organizing groups, including women’s groups, and a new equality network to support lay advisors. While these projects were concerned with embedding, it was equally clear that the purpose of mainstreaming such activity was to ensure connection to ‘core’ union agendas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0022185612465532">Parker and Douglas, 2010</xref>). This was also supported, in many cases, through the formalization of equality concerns and the outcomes of projects into formal trade union education as well as, in the case of the UMF1 GMB project, the appointment of a new Equalities Officer position at the national level to oversee its ongoing diversity and equalities strategy</p>
<p>The UMF2 PCS project sought to embed equalities through a formal mentoring process specifically for its women activists. In 2005 a PCS report, ‘Count me in’, found that women were poorly represented at all senior union representative/decision-making levels, despite comprising 60% of total membership. The project aimed to test a mentoring scheme to encourage women, with training for 20 mentors (senior female representatives) to support 20 individuals (preferably young female representatives). The project struggled to attract and train the proposed numbers of participants: 15 mentors were trained, but only eight individuals were assigned mentors. Nonetheless, the project provided a useful ‘demonstration effect’, and has subsequently been rolled out across the union. Evidence suggested that those being mentored were networking with each other and, according to the project manager, showing ‘an increase in confidence in dealing with management and going about their day-to-day duties representing members’.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="sec9-0022185612465532"><title>The Challenges of Transformation and Internal Processes of Learning</title>
<p>The UMF stimulated a wide range of new union initiatives, many aimed at fostering greater equality and inclusivity within unions, often with women’s concerns being a primary focus. In <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0022185612465532">Hyman’s (2007)</xref> terms, this can be seen as contributing to organizational capacity. However, all projects faced both internal and external challenges. These included the widely recognized internal constraints reported by much previous literature on women’s involvement in unions, such as leadership commitment and the masculine nature of union cultures (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0022185612465532">Cooper, 2012</xref>). However, the longer-term outcomes of projects depend on the extent to which new organizational capacity is able to challenge traditional union narratives, foster new learning and transform dated union structures and decision-making processes. This is central to modernization and was recognized by all projects.</p>
<p>The first challenge related to the <italic>external context</italic>. Projects were conducted during an uncertain political climate which coincided with changes in equality legislation, an impending general election and economic recession. As the UMF2 TUC project manager reported: ‘There is a fair amount of uncertainty about equalities work and it perhaps was not such a priority when people were losing jobs.’ One obvious impact of this was the limited funding of the UMF, restricted to just three rounds. However, as the economic context deteriorated, it became harder for projects to pursue, for example, partnership-working and engagement with employers. Internally, economic pressures also put increased strain on already over-burdened regional officers and lay activists and diminished the space for promoting modernizing agendas, as the need for union structures to focus on ‘core agendas’ and bargaining was emphasized.</p>
<p>The second challenge related to <italic>role development and new union identities</italic>. The UMF fostered a number of new roles within unions, but their development and influence was dependent on how their identities evolved and contributed to a more professionalized engagement with equality agendas and the mainstreaming of women’s interests. The UMF contributed, as noted, to the development of a new network of equality representatives. While TGWU/ Unite reported than their union had built a network of some 1000 equality representatives, it was not possible to verify this and such figures seemed overstated. A number of projects also reported some initial resentment and uncertainty among lay activists about the new role. For example, the UMF1 TGWU project manager noted that some existing ‘shop stewards felt that the role of the equality rep undermined their role and indirectly was a criticism of their ability to handle equality issues’, while the UMF2 GFTU project manager reported that there was a ‘view amongst some shop stewards that we are busy enough, without having to take on the role of an equality representative as well’. Role overload was seen as a very real problem, with 43% of equality representatives having another union role (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0022185612465532">Bacon and Hoque, 2012</xref>); the lack of statutory rights for the role also meant difficulties working with some employers.</p>
<p>The lack of statutory rights compared to the Union Learning Representative role, combined with the more limited financial support (which ended with the UMF), suggests that the future of equality representatives may be uncertain. Nonetheless, the UMF fostered a substantial network of such representatives, extensive networking and knowledge-sharing took place across unions, and new educational provision was established. Much depends on how legitimate the role is seen within union structures over time. Many projects reported that, with varying degrees of success, the equality representative role had started to be seen as a core part of the union ‘offer’ to members, and a variety of handbooks, guides and toolkits had been promoted to assist the operational utility of the role vis-a-vis interest representation and bargaining. Equality representatives are indicative of the changing nature of worker representation and the need to cope with more diverse workplace issues. However, as equalities work becomes more complex through the extension to cover six legally protected identity characteristics, the role may need to develop a more technical knowledge base.</p>
<p>The UMF also contributed to new role development within the staffing of unions, notably in terms of UMF project managers/workers. The project manager potentially acted as an important conduit for change within unions. How the role was developed and the background of the incumbent proved an issue for debate within unions. Evidence suggested that across all UMF1 projects, there was tension between senior officials taking on the role or the hiring of a dedicated person. The benefit of a senior official was their ability to navigate and influence the political structures of unions. Yet it was often difficult for such officials to run UMF projects and do their ‘day job’. As the UMF evolved across the rounds, it became more common for dedicated project workers to be appointed, although this created further issues. There were very real tensions between new UMF project workers and established union officers, who often did not accept the legitimacy of project workers or the ‘new’ agendas they were looking to implement. This acted to block the dissemination of projects within unions and project workers often faced difficulties enthusing participation at workshops/events. In the case of one project, by a large private sector union best kept anonymous, the union officer with overall responsibility for the project stated that they ‘had recruited the wrong type of person, they thought like a manager and not an equality representative’. New roles challenge established ones and at the level of equality-related union positions (be they representatives and officers), they highlighted a need to readjust the working patterns of unions.</p>
<p>The third challenge related to the <italic>sustainability of modernization processes</italic>. As the previous section detailed, UMF projects had myriad outputs, but it is how such outputs translate into longer-term outcomes of change that really defines modernization. Projects had created an abundance of handbooks, toolkits and guides, but there was a danger that these would be consigned ‘to the shelf’ following project completion – indeed, this was not an uncommon outcome. For this reason, structural embedding was seen as necessary. Without this, projects would be little more than time-constrained initiatives with specified deliverables, rather than opportunities to change union practice. Structural embedding involved the assimilation of project objectives, activities and outputs into union rulebooks (e.g. to legitimize the role of equality representatives) and branch-working. The UMF2 PCS project raised a constitutional amendment to make the equality representative role mandatory in branch elections, rather than just a role to be encouraged. In cases such as the UMF1 NUJ and UMF1 TGWU projects, the aspirations of equality representatives and wider equality concerns were mainstreamed into all their equality committees as core union business; while the UMF1 GMB project sought to integrate previously separate structures (including a women’s committee) into a single equality committee, supported by the appointment of a new senior officer role.</p>
<p>Keeping issues ‘live’ was often dependent on wider programmes of dissemination and cross-union networking, so that ‘lessons learnt’ could be shared across a community of experts. Indeed, this ‘demonstration effect’ was seen as one of the key objectives of the UMF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0022185612465532">Stuart et al., 2010</xref>). The UMF2 TUC coordination project sought to do this through regional briefings. Attended by 185 officers from various unions, they were seen as pivotal in promoting equalities work and the role of the equality representative. More generally, the extent of such dissemination, networking and sharing of expertise was relatively underdeveloped, and needed the input of an external agent such as the TUC to move things. Union structure remained a major obstacle to sustaining initiatives. A final challenge of sustainability related to the role of the project workers themselves. As project workers moved on, the resources they left behind were often quickly misunderstood or forgotten – indeed, in one case, the union asked the researchers to explain to them what the impact of their project had been (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0022185612465532">Noon et al., 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>The fourth challenge related to <italic>union leadership</italic>. All UMF projects had to be signed off by a senior officer or general secretary to receive funding. Union leaders also made important interventions at opportune moments to ensure project continuity or to get less enthused officers behind projects. This notably related to support at the regional level. Yet, while senior support was forthcoming, this could get disconnected from practice, as union leaders’ time was limited by competing priorities. Initiatives were often held up as a result and resistance within union structures was more ingrained, particularly where project workers did not actively seek the support of leaders. Where project workers had a long-recognized union background, the solid backing of union leaders and had sought to put in place senior-level governance structures (such as UMF1 GMB), they had more leverage over the political processes of union structures. Overall, there was little evidence that the UMF had directly contributed to the increased involvement of women at senior levels, even if initiatives such as PCS mentoring recognized that such change was needed in the long term. There were limited examples, such as the UMF1 and UMF2 TGWU/Unite projects, that were led directly by senior female union officials, and their influence both within the union and externally had increased as a result. In the UMF1 NUJ case, it was asserted that the introduction of equality representatives and the need to support their role had contributed to increased (parity) participation of women at senior level within the union. In such cases, the interests of women were clearly articulated within the wider equalities roles and agendas being advanced.</p>
<p>The fifth challenge related to <italic>external politics</italic>. Women’s issues in unions have often developed as a response to external regulatory and social drivers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0022185612465532">Howell, 1996</xref>) as well as internal dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0022185612465532">Parker, 2009</xref>). The state, in particular, can play a central role, not only in terms of legislative enactments and political networks, but also directly and indirectly through resources such as the UMF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0022185612465532">Heery and Conley, 2007</xref>). While not a direct objective of UMF projects, in a number of cases (e.g. UMF1 NUJ and TGWU) unions sought to meet, engage and lobby government offices and equalities networks. This took place within a political context that was broadly supportive of regulating for equalities. The new Coalition government (elected in May 2010) is less supportive of regulation on business, suggesting new challenges for unions. The climate for developing partnerships with employers or recognition and facilities for workplace equality representatives will be colder. This will demand more internal resource investment by unions, as well as acceptance of the central bargaining role of equality representatives and equality issues.</p>

<p>Our analysis of the UMF has revealed new insights into the range of activities that have recently been undertaken in British unions under the banner of modernization. While the literature on union strategic reorientation and women in unions recognizes that internal structures and processes of decision-making act as constraints on modernization, the inner workings of unions are rarely investigated in any detail. In international terms, state support for the operational modernization of unions can be seen as something of a unique experiment, particularly in the British neoliberal context. One interpretation would be to see this as an attempt by the state to define the strategic direction of unions. However, we would argue that it depended on the agency of unions themselves and how they sought to respond. The UMF offered unions the resources and space to develop new organizational capacity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0022185612465532">Hyman, 2007</xref>). Projects were typically developed against recognized external and internal challenges, such as the need to represent more diverse groups and the need to integrate the interests of women more extensively within the decision-making and leadership structures of unions.</p>
<p>Across unions, UMF projects contributed to wide-ranging activities and outputs. This included extensive programmes of training, new knowledge assets and tools (such as handbooks), and the development of the equality representative role. These deliverables cannot, however, be taken in themselves as evidence of change within unions. More significant was the extent to which projects pushed unions to reflect not only on how to respond to external challenges, but also on how to challenge extant internal constraints and path dependencies, such as the masculine culture of unions and the extent to which women’s interests are rendered ‘invisible’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0022185612465532">Cooper, 2012</xref>). In this regard, the evidence was mixed. The projects were suggestive of (un)learning within unions, and a degree of mainstreaming and embedding of women’s interests and equality concerns was taking place, through committee structures, branch constitutions and rulebook amendments. Certainly, the invisible was made visible, if only for the duration of projects. However, in part, this only revealed the extent of the challenges facing unions in their modernization. Projects clearly had to address already well-known internal constraints, such as the need for senior leadership support, and there was little evidence that they had fostered change in gender parity among senior union officials. However, the nature of project activity also revealed new types of challenges related to the sustainability of change agents (i.e. project workers) and ongoing modernization activity. The UMF projects were suggestive of what unions need to do to change. Such change is necessary if unions are to become not only more equal and participatory organizations, but also ready to face the future challenge of representing more diverse interest groups.</p>
