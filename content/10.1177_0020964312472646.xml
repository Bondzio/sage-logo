<p>PREACHERS MAY BE TEMPTED TO IGNORE Lamentations. It is tough to read, the subject matter is grim, its theological assertions are challenging, and much of its literary genius is lost in translation. Readers of the NRSV translation, for example, will miss that each of the first four chapters is an acrostic poem written in <italic>kinah</italic> meter, a poetic dirge reserved for funerals that pairs a “complete” three beat verse with an “incomplete” two beat verse. While exceptionally attentive readers may notice the gradual amplification of emotion over the first three chapters, they will miss how the poet intensifies this by starting every strophe in ch. 3 with its acrostic letter. (This has influenced the verse layout and may lead readers to conclude falsely that ch. 3 is three times longer than the other chapters.) And while some may sense a relaxing of emotion in ch. 4, they will miss how, when the poet moves to prayer in ch. 5, he drops the acrostic form, though he continues for the same 22 stanzas, reflecting the 22 characters of the Hebrew alphabet, and shifts from <italic>kinah</italic> meter to “complete” couplets of three beats each.</p>
<sec id="section1-0020964312472646">
<title>A is for Acrostic</title>
<p>How might the preacher approach such a difficult passage? One sermonic angle is to explore what the Book of Lamentations as a whole might teach those who grieve and those who comfort them.</p>
<p>At first glance, it may seem counter-intuitive that the poet would employ a literary device as dispassionate as an acrostic to express such raw emotions. An acrostic does not allow the disconsolate to connect thoughts in logical progression or construct an argument. B comes after A, even if one might prefer to talk about M. While this rigidity prevents one from repeating oneself for emphasis and frustrates the telling of a stirring narrative, it is very good for helping people compile a dictionary of woe.</p>
<p>An acrostic invites the disconsolate to enumerate their losses from A to Z, or, in Hebrew, from <italic>alep</italic> to <italic>ta w.</italic> It encourages those who grieve to itemize everything: the terrible events, what has been taken from them, all the sadness, anger, or guilt the loss has provoked, as well as nascent thoughts about where God may be in this. It provides space for a full and honest accounting of the community’s devastation, as well as a way for the community to structure and express tumultuous emotions at a time when people may be inclined to dissolve into chaotic despair.</p>
<p>Preachers will want to note that Lamentations is not a universal catalogue of devastation, but a response to the historical memory of the fall of Jerusalem in 587 B.C.E. Most preachers have learned that all grief is specific to the particularities of the situation. Indeed, many pastors have counseled families whose members experience a loved one’s death quite differently. Was the deceased the breadwinner? A scoundrel? Really young? Did the deceased favor one sibling? Or constantly complain about neglect? Did a grieving caretaker faithfully endure an exhausting decade of dementia before the deceased passed away? The shape of lamentation turns on these sorts of details, as does the work of finding “the meaning that lies hidden in the heart of sorrow, disappointment and grief,” as the old funeral prayer put it.</p>
<p>There is much to be learned from the honesty of Lamentations. The poet makes no attempt to prettify the facts of the event, their guilt and deserving, or the rawness of their lingering emotions. The poet freely admits that Jerusalem sinned greatly and deserved God’s judgment (1:8). Unspeakable things are given voice, including cannibalism (2:20; 4:10). The poet divulges a despairing state of mind (3:20), and he urges God to destroy their enemies (1:21–22; 3:64–66). Mourning involves honestly naming these external and inner realities. The poet knows that we cannot find comfort by pretending that things are other than what they really are.</p>
<p>The acrostic form does not produce a theological essay, but, rather, a catalogue of grief. As such, it encourages the expression of contradictory ideas and conflicting emotions. In ch. 3, for example, vivid descriptions of God’s judgment (3:1–20) are followed by equally vivid declarations of God’s mercy (3:21–33). Admissions that they deserved every bit of the punishment God meted out (1:8; 3:39) are followed by rage against the undeserved suffering their enemies inflicted on them (1:21–22; 3:64–66). Those who grieve and those who comfort them need not press too hard for consistency. Indeed, efforts at premature resolution could silence what needs to be said.</p>
<p>The acrostic form suggests that the loss, great as it is, will not have the last word. We may need to go through the alphabet of pain more than once (the poet goes through the Hebrew alphabet four times), but eventually we do come to Z or <italic>ta w</italic>. That is, we reach a stopping place. Grief need not be bottomless. In all these ways, Lamentations shows us a way to acknowledge that the suffering hurts and the loss maters.</p>

<title>E is for Enemy, M is for Mercy</title>
<p>Another approach to the sermon may focus more narrowly on ch. 3, which is the chapter that comes closest to linking its ideas into a thematic structure. Chapter 3 begins with the poet piling up metaphors that develop an idea voiced earlier in Lamentations, that God has “become like an enemy” (2:4–5). God has imprisoned him within walls and in chains (3:7). God is a predatory bear and a lion that has torn him to pieces (3:10). God has shot arrows into the poet’s vitals (3:12). God has made his teeth grind on gravel (3:16). The poet does not doubt that God is responsible and utterly justified in inflicting this terrible carnage and suffering. While the poet maintains that God’s wrath was justified, he does not doubt that his human enemies are culpable and closes the chapter by imploring a just God to “destroy them” (3:59–66).</p>
<p>The preacher may want to acknowledge how these graphic portraits of God’s judgment are in deep tension with contemporary, feel-good religion. We are drawn to upbeat, therapeutic religion and have marginalized lament to avoid the sense of being weighed down. Indeed, the poet acknowledges that when he “thinks of it,” his soul is brought low (3:20).</p>
<p>Then, in a remarkable turn, in v. 21, the poet sets his mind in another direction by reflecting on God’s steadfast love that “never ceases.” Against the backdrop of graphic depictions of God’s judgment and devastation, he makes the astonishing affirmation that God’s mercies are “new every morning” (3:23). As the phrase suggests, this means that a gracious God is making new possibilities available. Trusting God’s mercy enables the poet to welcome the new day and all its potentiality as God’s good gift. The poet then piles up declarations of God’s blessing. God is good to those who wait (3:25) and does not willingly afflict anyone (3:33). In light of God’s goodness, the poet even asks why anyone should complain of God’s punishment (3:39)! These affirmations remind us that lamentation is not just a way of saying goodbye to the world we thought we lived in; it is also a way of opening ourselves to the new world God is trying to give us.</p>
<p>The preacher may note that the poet does not rush to make these affirmations of God’s faithfulness, but waits until ch. 3. And even then, after this brief excursion into hope, the poet returns to his grief: God has made them “filth and rubbish” (3:45). The poet is more interested in the comfort that comes from honestly sharing his devastation than numbing his pain with pious platitudes.</p>
<p>Behind the theme of judgment and the theme of mercy is a conviction that God governs the chaos. Even if one allows, as the poet does, that God governs for God’s own purposes, hearing these themes, one right after the other, is quite jarring. Preachers would do well to follow the poet’s lead here. In fact, they may want to stress this dissonance as they read the Scripture in worship. Rather than trying neatly to harmonize these themes into a single melody, which would inevitably silence one in favor of the other, they might approach these clashing leitmotifs as sections in an orchestra, allowing the harsh, percussive refrains of judgment to highlight and compliment the soft melody of grace. They can then remind the congregation that this is an acrostic poem. It is not theological exposition. It is more concerned with faithful expression than clarity of explanation.</p>
<p>Perhaps the meaning that lies hidden in suffering and devastation cannot be voiced by simple expressions of grief or affirmations of God’s judgment and grace. Perhaps this sort of dissonance is necessary to lament. Perhaps there are multiple, even contradictory, ways for the same individual or community to find meaning in suffering. Perhaps the mystery of suffering demands such openness and wonder.</p>
