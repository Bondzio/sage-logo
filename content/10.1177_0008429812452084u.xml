<p>Bas van Os employs a social-scientific approach in order to reintegrate psychology in the search for the historical Jesus. This resurgence and recovery of psychology in historical biblical studies follows on from the work of John Miller (<italic>Jesus at Thirty: A Psychological and Historical Portrait</italic>, 1998) and Donald Capps (<italic>Jesus: A Psychological Biography</italic>, 2000), for example. Os’s monograph is a continuation of this hermeneutical approach for understanding the historical Jesus as it seeks to demonstrate that psychobiography can make a significant contribution in this field.</p>
<p>In the first section of the book (Chapters 1–3), the author outlines the theoretical framework in which psychology can make a positive contribution. Os begins by showing the foundation for the unity between psychology and the historical Jesus and how the century-old monumental work by Albert Schweitzer was one of the first to protest against such practices. For nearly a century, psychology had been banned from historical Jesus research; however, the author is convinced that both disciplines have evolved during this exilic period and therefore are in need of re-evaluation. Os is to be commended for the care with which the subject is approached as he outlines some of the limitations of the methodology especially in relation to the limitedness of available historical data. The author also uses this section of the book to examine and critique recent psychological reconstructions of Jesus from the perspective of his childhood experiences. The author writes that since every restoration of the historical Jesus is a hypothesis, “Every reconstruction of the psychology of Jesus on the basis of the work of biblical scholars is a hypothesis about a hypothesis, or worse, a hypothesis about an eclectic mixture of hypotheses” (26). Despite the limitations, however, the author nonetheless argues that a psychobiographical study of Jesus can prove instructive.</p>
<p>The second section (Chapters 4–6) attempts a plausible theory to explain the literary remains from the first century CE, especially the gospels and Pauline epistles. Using statistical probabilities and insights from demographical studies of late antiquity and new religious movements, the author paints a sociological portrait of Jesus and his earliest followers. Working from what Paul writes in his first letter to the Corinthians (15:3–12), Os employs demographical statistics in order to understand the first-generation followers of Jesus especially with regard to their number, their possible ages, whether they had children, etc. The analyses, “conclude that it is likely that the historical Jesus did indeed have an impact on the beliefs and the tradition of his followers” (99.) Though Os intends this section to provide firmer ground as to who formed Jesus’ early followers and preserved and shaped his traditions, the use of demographical studies is too speculative. The author wishes to add numbers and statistical probabilities to the study of the historical Jesus, and though this is an area which is absent, it may be so for good reason. Despite the author’s awareness of this type of work as uncertain, it is nonetheless framed in order to help the study and at times appears less like a rigid foundation, and more like a house of cards.</p>
<p>In the final section (Chapters 7–11), Os uses a theoretical framework in order to study the psychology of Jesus. This methodological approach uses Attachment Theory, Role Theory, and Rational Choice Theory among others. Using the social insights and information gleaned from the second section of the book, Os postulates a number of psychobiographical analyses of Jesus and the impact he had on his followers during his lifetime. In Chapter 7, for example, Os uses the demographic analysis of his previous chapter to note that it is extremely likely that, as an adolescent or young adult, Jesus experienced the death of siblings and of his father. His followers (who were also young adults) could also have been fatherless and “the idea of God as an attachment figure and his people as brothers and sisters may have caught on quickly with a significant number of people” (123). Throughout his analysis, Os’s conclusions appear to be rational and on point; however, his picking and choosing of biblical source material is problematic for an overall psychological understanding of Jesus. The author is quick to acknowledge the limitations of the study, but nonetheless proceeds. The analyses in this section are often insightful and yet hinge on a number of theoretical probabilities. One wonders if the demographic information which presents typical sociological statistics is in fact representative of Jesus. How much can one build upon such theories before the cards topple over?</p>
<p>Though it takes six chapters before the reader arrives at the heart of the psychological analysis, Bas van Os’s monograph is unique in its approach since it goes beyond previous psychological portraits of Jesus, which have tended to be overly focused upon his childhood and relationship with his human father. This book is recommended for the advanced scholar (since its approach assumes a reader’s familiarity with specific terms, theories and concepts from the field of psychology) and for those interested in social-scientific approaches to the gospels and epistles. Os’s book adds yet another important layer to the resurrection of psychological analyses of the historical Jesus and paves the way for continued study in this field.</p>
