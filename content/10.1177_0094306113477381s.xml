<p>What we understand to be modern sociology emerged from the twentieth century’s chaotic collision among—in no particular order—American midwestern reformers, racial inequality scholars, Progressive empiricists, and European refugees from the Third Reich. The resulting cacophony helps to explain our discipline’s considerable divisions: its location between the logic of the humanities and that of the sciences, its combined concerns with race and class as signal inequalities, and its emphasis on methodological novelty. Christian Fleck’s book focuses on the collision between the latter two groups—European refugees and American empiricists—and demonstrates the ongoing importance of this collision in forming both American and European social research. Its scope is impressive, its detail overwhelming, and its attention to evidence exemplary. However, some key matters are neglected or treated idiosyncratically, making the book more partial than the title and ambition imply.</p>
<p>
<italic>A Transatlantic History of the Social Sciences</italic> begins in the 1920s with the expansion of a particular American brand of academic institution. The empirical research demonstrates the unique growth of American universities through increasing numbers of students, PhD degrees, and professors beginning in the 1920s. During the same period, the John D. Rockefeller Foundation introduced the idea of fellowships for social scientists, first in the United States and later in Europe. Rockefeller’s influence, in turn, ushered in the concept of the <italic>research project</italic> as a unit of social scientific practice paralleling that of research in the natural sciences.</p>
<p>Fleck’s exhaustive account traces this development and its effects on both sides of the Atlantic. Rockefeller’s fellowships supported not just American social scientists but increasingly, European ones as well. Curiously, Fleck pays little attention to the ideological environment in the United States at the time: the Progressive movement was overturning patronage politics, and one of its key tenets was the introduction of scientific approaches to social problems. Rockefeller’s move toward professionalizing sociology and formalizing its results did not emerge out of the blue nor out of the idiosyncratic interests of its robber-baron progenitors. Rather, it was part and parcel of the burgeoning faith in scientific rationalization that characterized the period.</p>
<p>These first four chapters are remarkable in their attention to detail and their sheer scope. Using new archival evidence, a large-scale empirical analysis, and interviews and bibliometric data, it provides a careful analysis of German and Austrian social scientists and the impressive two-way flow of ideas and information between the United States and the German-speaking academy. There is a meticulous calculation of the “index of reputation” of twentieth-century German-speaking social scientists in both Europe and America, which helps delineate the field and show the remarkable fecundity of this group.</p>
<p>The contrast between the breadth of these chapters and the obsessive depth of the next two is somewhat jarring. Here we are treated to a thorough reexamination of the American experience of Theodor W. Adorno and his Frankfurt School colleagues, principally Max Horkheimer. These chapters trace the interactions between Adorno and Paul F. Lazarsfeld over the Princeton Radio Research Project and, more generally, the philosophical status of empirical research.</p>
<p>This ground has been trod before, both in essays by Adorno and Lazarsfeld and by various intellectual historians writing on the Frankfurt School. Fleck brings two new things to his analysis. First, and very important, is a wealth of new information including interviews Fleck conducted and archival research on both sides of the Atlantic. This material provides additional detail and insight into the conflicts between Lazarsfeld’s pragmatic empiricism and Adorno’s systemic critique. Unfortunately, the second thing undermines the first: Fleck’s interpretation of the historical record is entirely one-sided, with Lazarsfeld the hero of hard-nosed empirical science and—quite ungenerously—Adorno the self-serving narcissist taking personal advantage of this ascendant empiricism but unwilling to contribute meaningfully to it. So stark is Fleck’s good-vs-evil contrast that it borders on caricature as he seeks to establish that “Adorno did not fail because of [Lazarsfeld], but because of himself” (p. 166). One can be forgiven for thinking that agenda begs the question: on what grounds should we brand Adorno a failure when he ranks in the top 40 most influential German-speaking social scientists of the twentieth century (p. 156)?</p>
<p>Fleck casts his extensive history of the Frankfurters’ exile as a corrective to “the legend of the years of exile of the Institute of Social Research” (p. 270), which he sees as altogether too positive toward the Institute. Adorno’s thought is presented as petty instead of conflicted, with little more than Fleck’s transparent antipathy to back up the interpretations. For example, the fact that each personality type in <italic>The Authoritarian Personality</italic> bears but one example becomes: “…no more than eleven cases that have been given pompous names” (p. 263). Adorno is faulted for worrying about political repercussions of his work in the United States, even though, as Fleck puts it, “academic social science… of course was no field of interest for the McCarthyites” (p. 250), a claim that certainly would come as a surprise to many scholars at the time who suffered professional and personal setbacks due to McCarthyism.</p>
<p>There are too many other examples to detail here. In this retelling, Adorno and colleagues petulantly refuse to sully themselves with empirical research on individuals even in the face of the clear superiority of that approach. But this narrative requires that we read Adorno’s sociological work from <italic>The Authoritarian Personality</italic> through <italic>Group Experiment</italic> and even the 1968 lectures <italic>Introduction to Sociology</italic> both as essentially disingenuous and as disconnected from his philosophical writings. A more generous—and, I submit, more accurate—reading would recognize that Adorno’s <italic>oeuvre</italic> is largely spent grappling with precisely these problems: how to apprehend social reality through research without being duped by the surface characteristics of the totally socialized society.</p>
<p>The enormous amount of the book devoted to reinterpreting the Adorno-Lazarsfeld conflict and its aftermath in social science obscures other sources of empiricism in contemporary sociology. I have already noted the extent to which Progressive politics played into philanthropists’ interest in the developing field and served to distance it from the discipline founded by midwestern reformers in the late nineteenth century. The other important point is the presence of large-scale empirical studies prior to the Rockefeller funding era. These would include, of course, Durkheim’s <italic>Le Suicide</italic>, which established empirical research as central to European sociological theory by the late nineteenth century. More importantly to the transatlantic argument, W.E.B. Du Bois had published his extensive empirical study <italic>The Philadelphia Negro</italic> nearly contemporaneously with Durkheim’s, demonstrating the American field’s ability to bridge empirical research with social criticism and concern with racial and ethnic inequality. Perhaps understanding this thread in American sociology would have provided greater insight into the four-way collision that produced our current field.</p>
