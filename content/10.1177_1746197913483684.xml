<abstract>
<p>Based on recent ethnographic research, this article explores young people’s opportunities of formal and informal democracy learning and expressions of such learning in the highly market-influenced Swedish upper secondary education. With its ambitious democracy-fostering goals and far-reaching marketisation, Swedish education constitutes an interesting case in this respect. The analysis indicates that ‘voting with the feet’ emerges as an important way of exerting student influence. At the same time, young people’s voice is surprisingly neglected in classroom practice. Increased focus on performance and goal attainment tends to overshadow less ‘rewarding’ aspects of the curriculum, such as democracy teaching and learning, both from the side of teachers and students. Students are also increasingly expected to act as school representatives and to avoid giving negative impressions of their school.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Over the last few decades, Swedish education has been thoroughly transformed, following the general trend of the OECD countries aligning education more closely to the demands of the ‘knowledge economy’ or ‘knowledge capitalism’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1746197913483684">Peters, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1746197913483684">Jessop, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1746197913483684">Ball, 2007</xref>). However, the shift from a uniform, centrally regulated school system to one with far-going decentralisation and market elements, based on ideas of choice and competition, has been more rapid and radical in Sweden than in many other places (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1746197913483684">Bunar, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1746197913483684">Lundahl, 2011</xref>). The entire Swedish education system is now exposed to competition and choice, but marketisation has hitherto been most powerful at the upper secondary level. The question of how Swedish citizenship education and students’ influence are affected by school choice and the needs of schools to market themselves has hitherto been largely neglected.</p>
<p>This article addresses the scope for students to learn about democracy and the expressions of such learning in today’s highly market-influenced Swedish upper secondary education. The aim is explorative: to examine, begin to elucidate and provide foundations for further studies of how the market orientation of schools frames and affects students and other key actors’ perceptions and understanding of democracy, and their willingness and efforts to influence education.</p>
<p>‘Market’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1746197913483684">1</xref></sup> here denotes a situation where several producers compete to accomplish public tasks and/or the existence of internal management systems, modelled on the idea of a business firm. This article primarily focuses on phenomena related to the first of these two aspects, that is, external competition (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1746197913483684">Ball and Youdell, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>The article builds on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1746197913483684">Biesta’s (2003)</xref> distinction between theoretical, formal and informal democracy education in school. Theoretical democracy education refers to schools’ preparation of students to become citizens in a democratic society by, for example, teaching them about the constitution, general elections and parliamentary decision-making processes. Formal democracy education denotes students’ practical experience of direct democratic participation, such as the way it is inscribed in national curriculum guides. It includes activities in both class and school councils and students’ possibilities to influence the everyday work of schools. Informal democracy education refers to fostering democracy indirectly by disseminating certain values and ways of communicating. Here we expand this concept to encompass students’ experiences of schooling more generally, as these experiences are assumed to contribute to beliefs and understandings of what influence and democracy are (and are not).</p>
<p>Theoretically, the analysis departs from the concepts of performance mode and decentred market (DCM)-positioned pedagogic identities introduced by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1746197913483684">Basil Bernstein (2000)</xref>. Empirically, we mainly build on recent Swedish research on upper secondary education, primarily ethnographic classroom studies. These studies did not focus on marketisation, but more generally on theoretical, formal and informal democracy teaching and learning. Some of them were conducted as parts of the research project <italic>Active citizenship? On democratic education in the upper secondary school</italic> (2007–2010), which aimed to develop knowledge about students’ attempts to actively discuss and influence their schooling and the opportunities offered by the teachers and schools to do so (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1746197913483684">Öhrn et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1746197913483684">Rosvall, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1746197913483684">Hjelmér, 2013</xref>). Other relevant sources include the following: a study of students’ learning practices and learner identities during 12 years of ethnographic fieldwork in upper secondary schools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1746197913483684">Beach and Dovemark, 2011</xref>); a doctoral thesis addressing questions of critical thinking versus reproduction of common values (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1746197913483684">Wyndhamn, in press</xref>); a study of student influence by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1746197913483684">Rönnlund (2011)</xref>, although it focuses on phenomena in lower secondary level schools and finally the project <italic>Upper secondary school as a market</italic> (2008–2011), which analysed the prevalence and impact on schoolwork, staff and students in upper secondary schools of market solutions and market steering, although it did not specifically deal with democracy education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1746197913483684">Lundström and Holm, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>The article is structured as follows: First, we give a brief introduction to the changing context and signification of democracy education in Swedish upper secondary education. Next, we introduce Basil Bernstein’s concepts of performance mode and pedagogic identity and outline some of their implications for democracy learning. The section that follows concerns consequences of performance and competition demands on students learning about perceptions of and engagement in democracy, fostered through both formal and informal activities. Finally, we present some conclusions from this analysis.</p>

<title>The changing context of democracy education</title>
<p>According to international comparative studies, democracy education is more broadly defined in Sweden and the other Nordic countries, than elsewhere, as teaching <italic>about, for</italic> and <italic>through</italic> democracy, with a strong emphasis on active participation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1746197913483684">Bronäs, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1746197913483684">Mikkelsen, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1746197913483684">Lister et al., 2007</xref>). The Nordic model of democracy education may be seen in the light of the modern history of these countries. Being prominent examples of social democratic welfare regimes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1746197913483684">Esping-Andersen, 1996</xref>), their policies from the 1930s onwards not only attributed crucial economic functions to education but equally and importantly emphasised their social functions, with citizenship, social equality and integration as core components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1746197913483684">Telhaug et al., 2004</xref>). Furthermore, the Nordic conceptualisation of education <italic>for</italic> democracy can be related to the kind of citizenship that developed in the Nordic social democratic countries in the post-war period, with well-organised labour and other social movements, stable agreements between social partners and high levels of trust between citizens and governments (see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1746197913483684">Fulcher, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1746197913483684">Kuhnle, 2000</xref>). Providing for young people to be responsible and active citizens was regarded as a crucial aspect of the Nordic welfare societies <italic>and</italic> their economies. A normative, collective and society-centred conception of democratic citizenship was prominent in the late 1940s; school should foster the development of citizens able to resist totalitarian ideologies and take responsibility for social development founded on citizens’ own insights and will. A functional rational view of democracy as mainly a representative form of government became prevalent in the 1950s and 1960s. The need to educate committed democratic citizens who could actively engage in and influence social life was again strongly emphasised in the 1970s. Educating children and young people in critical thinking to avoid indoctrination was seen as crucial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1746197913483684">Englund, 1986/2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1746197913483684">Olson, 2008</xref>). A further prominent aim of upper secondary education was to empower students to influence their working environment and studies, thereby enabling them to take a joint responsibility for social and societal matters in the future, both in Sweden and internationally.</p>
<p>Based on neo-liberal ideas of freedom of choice and promotion of quality, a school market emerged in the 1990s and rapidly developed in the 2000s. Today this market not only consists of a fast-growing free-school sector,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1746197913483684">2</xref></sup> dominated by large joint-stock companies, but includes practically <italic>all</italic> upper secondary schools. Far-reaching decentralisation and competition for students has resulted in an abundant array of educational options, and most upper secondary schools invest considerable resources in marketing their services (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1746197913483684">Arreman and Holm, 2011</xref>). The daily work of principals, teachers and other staff has been notably affected by the competition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1746197913483684">Holm and Lundström, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1746197913483684">Lundström and Holm, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>In contrast to its predecessors, the 1994 upper secondary school national curriculum underscored the development of individual responsibility, individual freedom and uniqueness: ‘Schools’ task is to let every single student find his/her unique individuality and thereby enable him/her to participate in social life by doing his/her best to exert responsible freedom’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1746197913483684">Swedish National Agency for Education, 2006</xref>: 5). Schools had an obligation to support the development of students in order for them to become ‘responsible persons who actively participate in, and contribute to, vocational and civic life’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1746197913483684">Swedish National Agency for Education, 2006</xref>: 5). At the same time, it was clearly stated that all who worked in school were to promote democratic structures, and that teachers should ensure that all students ‘have real influence in the work methods, work structures, and educational content’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1746197913483684">Swedish National Agency for Education, 2006</xref>: 15).</p>
<p>‘Employability’ was one of the keywords of the 2009 upper secondary school reform, initiated by the conservative–liberal coalition government, while concepts such as democracy and citizenship were hardly mentioned at all (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1746197913483684">Lundahl et al., 2010</xref>). The reform came into force in 2011, and a new curriculum plan was introduced the same year. Now, entrepreneurship became a mandatory aspect of all programmes. At the same time, existing formulations about educating democratic citizens remained almost unchanged. Ensuring that the young are granted opportunities to know about, to exert and to experience influence in school are also central goals in the 2011 curriculum plan.</p>
<p>To conclude, upper secondary education in Sweden is presently framed in a neo-liberal, market-oriented context. The national curriculum strongly emphasises individual performance, while the goals of democracy education have largely remained intact for a longer time.</p>

<title>Pedagogic identities and performance mode</title>
<p>We build on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1746197913483684">Basil Bernstein’s (2000)</xref> concepts of <italic>pedagogic identity</italic>, related to what he calls a <italic>DCM position</italic>, and <italic>performance mode</italic> when analysing findings from recent Swedish studies of student democracy learning. Bernstein characterises pedagogic identity as a construction of ‘a sense of belonging to and different from, and for the internal sense making and external relationships in time, space and context’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1746197913483684">Bernstein and Solomon, 1999</xref>: 271). The model comprises four positions (Retrospective, Prospective, Market and Therapeutic) that represent different approaches to regulation and management of moral, cultural or economic change and that generate different kinds of pedagogic identities. The positions can appear in combination, in opposition or be excluded from the scene.</p>
<p>Two of the positions (Retrospective and Prospective) generate identities through resources managed by the State (centring resources), while the remaining two (Market and Therapeutic) generate identities through local resources over which local institutions have considerable autonomy. In this article, the identity generated by <italic>the DCM position</italic> is of particular interest. The DCM pedagogic identity is characterised by the institutional or individual actor’s focus on obtaining and maximising its, his or her exchange value in the market. The focus is on short-term rather than long-term gains, and extrinsic rather than intrinsic values.</p>
<p>According to Bernstein, the collective base is, on all educational levels, increasingly dominated by the <italic>performance mode</italic>:<disp-quote>
<p>Market relevance is becoming the key orientation for the selection of discourses, their relation to each other, their forms and their research. This movement has profound implications from the primary school to the university. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1746197913483684">Bernstein, 2000</xref>: 86)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The performance mode especially permeates the management of schools, but it also increasingly affects what counts as knowledge and pedagogical practice in school. At national and international levels, the performance mode is, for example, clearly manifested in the ‘measurement culture’ that has increasingly influenced education over the past 20 years (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1746197913483684">Hopmann, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1746197913483684">Taubman, 2009</xref>). This trend is also clearly discernible in international evaluation initiatives such as Progress in International Reading Literacy Study (PIRLS), Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) and Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS), which aim to develop and apply so-called high-stakes tests (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1746197913483684">Au, 2007</xref>), involving measurements and comparisons of certain aspects of student knowledge.</p>
<p>Departing from Bernstein’s model, we expect to find the following phenomena and orientations at school and classroom levels:</p>
<list id="list1-1746197913483684" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>two kinds of actors – the individual student and teacher (or other staff) on the one hand and the school/firm on the other;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>a focus on the individual’s freedom of choice;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>a focus on individual rather than collective agency;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>a focus on behaviour and activities that may enhance the individual student’s and/or school’s performance and competitiveness; and</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>a focus on image management, that is, behaviour and activities that may enhance the visibility and attractiveness of the individual and/or school.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Implications of this market orientation for democracy education and learning are highlighted in the last part of the article.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1746197913483684">
<title>Democracy education and learning: new contours and contents</title>
<p>In the following sections, we analyse the formal and informal opportunities that market-oriented schools provide for students to exert influence and learn about democracy, student responses to these opportunities and student-initiated actions to influence education. The responses and strategies of the students are viewed in terms of performance mode, that is, performativity, and individual influence, choice, loyalty, exit and voice – the last three stemming from the categorisation of responses to organisations in decline proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1746197913483684">Hirschman (1970)</xref>.</p>
<sec id="section5-1746197913483684">
<title>Prioritised knowledge and forms of influence in the performative school</title>
<p>A number of Swedish and international studies have described the impact of neo-liberal ideas on contemporary education, focusing on individual rights and academic performance (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1746197913483684">Fielding, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1746197913483684">Gordon et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1746197913483684">Olson, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1746197913483684">Hjelmér, 2013</xref>), but have paid less attention to democracy education beyond theoretical aspects, for example, as parts of history or civics. For instance Hjelmér found that teachers felt guilty about their democracy teaching, experiencing that it was something they did not have time to reflect over or plan properly.</p>
<p>A new conception of the successful student has become dominant in Sweden since the early 1990s, that of a self-regulating, autonomous and responsible learner who exerts considerable influence over his or her own personal study situation (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1746197913483684">Lindblad et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1746197913483684">Rönnlund, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1746197913483684">Aldenmyr et al., 2012</xref>). The quotation below from a principal encapsulates both this conception of success and efforts to foster it:<disp-quote>
<p>We want to create (…) freedom of choice for students and teachers, who will take responsibility for the curriculum by controlling content from within a system of choice options. Students can determine where and when they learn (…) Our aim is to help students to be motivated, alert, inquiring, self-governing and flexible users as opposed to just recipients of knowledge. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1746197913483684">Beach and Dovemark, 2007</xref>: 63)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In other words, individual agency, performance and individual needs are strongly emphasised, and this is reflected in the kinds of influence that prevalent routines in schools tend to focus on.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1746197913483684">
<title>School choice and school exit</title>
<p>According to neo-liberal theory and ideology, customers’ rational choices should be the primary factors affecting the goods and services that are offered and, ultimately, which firms survive and thrive. The same thinking is applied to the school market in Sweden, where all students in the ninth grade of compulsory school are expected to make crucial choices (which will notably affect their future career options) from a smorgasbord of upper secondary schools and programmes offered across the country. Furthermore, as student choices have direct economic consequences for the schools, marketing has become a highly prioritised activity. According to our surveys in 60 Swedish municipalities, 9 out of 10 upper secondary schools market their programmes, and half of them spend <italic>considerable</italic> resources on marketing. Nine out of 10 principals and 3 out of 4 teachers and career counsellors are engaged in marketing, and many of the students act as school ambassadors. A wide range of means and channels are used: school fairs, open houses, advertisements, web pages, personal phone calls and various inducements (Lundahl, in press). The students find the wide choices appealing in some respects, but frustrating and stressful in others:<disp-quote>
<p>It’s a choice that will influence your life three years ahead, it’s important you make the right choice. It felt so huge (…) it was such a big choice. You had so many alternatives; there were no limits. (student)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Significant factors that schools highlight, and candidate students consider, are not merely related to the educational programmes. Other important factors are related to the schools’ locations, reputations and images of their students. Hence, the school choice is not just about a programme, it is also about the locus, character, status and image of the school that partly depends on the students who populate the school:<disp-quote>
<p>And then it’s very much about what kind of students go to the school, if you feel that you belong there, that it’s sort of your style to go to that school. That’s the most important reason I believe. (student)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The competing schools that attempt to attract young individuals thus interact with the needs of students to form, try out and confirm their present and future identities (Lundahl, in press).</p>
<p>Students also have considerable potential power as they represent capital – a sum of money – that the school is eager to attain and retain. As one teacher in a public school puts it,<disp-quote>
<p>We want to retain the students at all costs (…) we sometimes almost work too hard to persuade the students to stay here (…) Because a student who leaves costs money (…) Our bosses keep telling us this (…) we shouldn’t have any vacancies.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Approximately 15% of all upper secondary school students change school or programme for various reasons. ‘Voting with their feet’ is their dominant way of having a say in education in Swedish schools today, and young people probably learn that they ‘make a difference’ principally as customers and consumers of education by facing the offers and selecting from them at a smorgasbord of marketed offers.</p>

<title>Voice versus future investment</title>
<p>Despite the ambitious goals to educate students about, for and through democracy, the general picture of current formal and informal democracy education emerging from research is quite gloomy. Students get limited opportunities to influence education and teaching, and their influence is mostly limited to minor aspects, such as the order of course elements and the way assignments are tackled, timing of examinations and the length or frequency of breaks (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1746197913483684">Hjelmér, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1746197913483684">Nyroos et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1746197913483684">Rönnlund, 2011</xref>). Student motivation to exert influence over teaching and schoolwork varies but is mostly low. Initiatives to exert influence are often enacted on an individual rather than on a collective basis, and the outcomes of collective actions are generally meagre. Formal student councils attract little interest from students and teachers and seem to have little effect on more substantive issues and decisions in school matters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1746197913483684">Danell et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1746197913483684">Rönnlund, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1746197913483684">Hjelmér, 2013</xref>).</p>
<p>An ethnographic study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1746197913483684">Öhrn et al. (2011)</xref> showed that students who were dissatisfied with the teaching generally did not take initiatives to talk to the teachers involved. However, the reasons for this varied between academic and vocational programmes. For example, the students in the Natural Science class refrained from taking action because they thought it would adversely affect their marks and future academic prospects. Hence, voicing dissatisfaction was perceived as conflicting with performance goals. In addition, they trusted their teachers to teach in the most effective ways, especially in mathematics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1746197913483684">Öhrn et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1746197913483684">Hjelmér, 2013</xref>). In contrast, the instruction in the vocational programmes was more amenable to student influence. However, dissatisfaction of the vocational students and their efforts to exert influence were often focused on personal relations and lack of well-being rather than teaching matters. Marks and study achievement thus seemed to be weaker driving forces among these students. More generally, opportunities to voice criticism and suggest changes varied between contexts, relating above all to the status of the subjects, programmes and groups of students (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1746197913483684">Högberg, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1746197913483684">Johansson, 2009</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1746197913483684">Beach and Dovemark (2011)</xref> came to similar conclusions and found a marked change over a 12-year period in a study of classroom practices in upper secondary schools. An element of ‘thinking about returns’, that is, of a good share-out of efforts and interests, which in turn can be seen as a culture of self-interest, became increasingly apparent in the descriptions of strategic actions from successful students. The ‘thinking about returns’ seemed to dominate at the end of the research period, particularly in the academic programmes:<disp-quote>
<p>Making the right choices is important (and) competitive behavior is … needed if you are to get on and do well … It helps if you have a good attitude and show initiative (but) what we need (most) is a good return on our effort and interests. (student)</p>
<p>You try to create an image … and reap the rewards of your investments. (another student) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1746197913483684">Beach and Dovemark, 2011</xref>: 316)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Students who did not adopt, or actively rejected, this kind of thinking were seen as failing in the competition and were regarded as less motivated and less smarter than those who accepted it. They were also used by the more successful students as a contrast to those who aimed at university studies and high future positions in society.</p>
<p>The findings by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1746197913483684">Beach and Dovemark (2011)</xref> imply that upper secondary students, especially middle-class students enrolled on the academic programmes, generally act in ways that they believe will maximise returns from invested time and effort, or that at least do not endanger good grades. They tend to regard participating in a student council as a waste of time as it diverts energy and time from more gainful school activities. Individual and collective efforts to affect teaching contents and methods are pursued only if and when they are perceived as beneficial to successful studies. In other words, democracy education is interesting only to the extent that it enhances and improves academic outcomes.</p>

<title>Loyalty to the school and its image</title>
<p>Creating and maintaining a positive image of the school has also become increasingly important in the upper secondary school market. Student satisfaction and high performance are often emphasised in schools’ image management. For example, principals argue that it is no longer sufficient to ensure that students succeed – their school’s excellent performance must also be externally visible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1746197913483684">Holm and Lundström, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Conversely, bad results and declining student numbers are threats to a school’s reputation and attractiveness. Hence, grade inflation has been reported in several Swedish studies (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1746197913483684">Wikström and Wikström, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1746197913483684">Vlachos, 2010</xref>), and this problem is particularly serious at the upper secondary level, where competition for students is more fierce and external control of grading weaker than at the compulsory level. For example, in one of the previously cited ethnographic studies, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1746197913483684">Wyndhamn (in press)</xref> observed that the principal sometimes overruled teachers’ grading of student work, so that the marks of poorly performing students would not harm the image of the school. Furthermore, teachers describe pressures to disregard their professional judgement in order to please and retain the students. This appears particularly prevalent in schools that are fighting for their survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1746197913483684">Lundström and Holm, 2011</xref>), indicating that a new kind of seller–customer relationship between teachers and students is emerging.</p>
<p>The students are important not only as customers of education and the ‘student material’ of the education production line but also as ambassadors of their schools. They are expected to participate in various events, for example, open houses and school fairs, to market their school or programme, and to feel obliged to talk positively about it in their leisure time. A competitive spirit is also reflected in the teachers’ descriptions of the situation that involved concerns such as how to ‘beat’ other public and free schools (Lundahl, in press). Conversely, discrediting the image of the school is rarely tolerated. For instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1746197913483684">Wyndhamn (in press)</xref> describes students being asked to be on their best behaviour when ninth-graders (‘potential customers’) are visiting the school, so as not to give the school a bad reputation. The teachers emphasise that they are school representatives, a message that is frequently given to the students to foster a positive and docile approach among them. Wyndhamn concludes that an emerging normalisation of school marketing contributes to student/representatives of schools being reluctant to criticise or question them.</p>
<p>Schools’ involvement in democracy education and amenability to collective forms of student influence may be used as a marketing argument per se, but this is an exception rather than the rule. Among the eight schools we examined in our study of the upper secondary school as a market, only one (a public school in a region with relatively limited competition) stressed student influence and participation and described its organisation of student democracy as an asset on the school’s homepage (Lundahl, in press). More often, the schools (especially some of the independent free-school companies) try to attract students by highlighting opportunities for individual studies outside of school. This is in line with the aforementioned intimate relationship between the state, education and the economical system that nurtures a discourse of the entrepreneurial, self-governing learner and further the drive to reduce teaching costs in society at a general level.</p>

<title>Concluding discussion</title>
<p>This article explores the degree to which, and how, the emergence of Swedish education as a matter of an advanced school market is reflected in schools’ formal and informal democracy education and democracy learning. The analysis is based mainly on recent Swedish research – particularly ethnographic studies of upper secondary student democracy education and influence, together with our project on the marketisation of upper secondary education – focusing on the consequences of schools’ competition for students and for funding.</p>
<p>We found clear indications that young people’s democracy learning in school, especially their experiences of exerting influence, or trying to exert it, is affected in several ways by changes in the student roles and power in market-oriented schools. First, students experience influence as customers when they are selecting schools and programmes in grade 9 of compulsory school, as the upper secondary schools compete to attract them by different means available. Here the student choices clearly ‘make a difference’. Later, students come to embody a substantial ‘capital’ for the school, which will suffer adverse economic consequences were they to leave. Even if students do not avail themselves of exit options, the mere possibility that they may do so constitutes a threat. The potential to ‘vote with their feet’ thus constitutes a novel form of student power in Swedish schools. Second, students represent a face value to the school by contributing to its marketing as school ambassadors and representatives and by avoiding giving negative impressions of their school.</p>
<p>The emergence of a school market has thus introduced some new forms of student influence, while others have waned in importance, or have been neglected. In particular, young people’s voice is surprisingly neglected when it comes to influencing the forms and contents of their everyday schoolwork. The empirical findings indicate that teachers rarely take student initiatives into serious consideration, even though the students themselves express hope and express and display a willingness to exert influence in school improvement and other school-related matters.</p>
<p>Moreover, the increased focus on measurable performance and goal attainment tends to overshadow more subtle and less easily quantifiable aspects of the curriculum – for example, the very possibilities of exerting formal influence in school, that is, to be given opportunities to voice your concerns in a living democracy as part of a democratic citizenship that is generally promoted. Participants in student initiatives to influence teaching and educational content even run apparent risks of being perceived as obstacles to effectiveness and performance as new key educational quality markers. This seems to particularly be the case in academic programmes than in vocational programmes, and among successful, competitive and determined students rather than among those who are less successful and oriented towards competition.</p>
<p>In this article, we have chosen not to address theoretical democracy education. However, there is reason to believe that this is affected by the dominating performance mode in similar ways. Influence, democracy and citizenship appear to be regarded as matters that are ‘knowable’ and measurable, as illustrated by the stance and objectives of the <italic>International Civic and Citizenship Education Study</italic> (ICCS) 2009. This study aims to measure the readiness among young people in 38 countries to adopt roles as citizens and its educational implications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1746197913483684">Schulz et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1746197913483684">Swedish National Agency for Education, 2010</xref>). The ways in which this is being measured in the ICCS 2009 study testify to a focus on particular aspects of knowledge and pedagogical practice, namely, individual student knowledge (factual and formal) about democracy and their individually initiated and exerted (formal) influence inside and outside of school. These somewhat delimited aspects of young people’s influence constitute the implicitly defined body of young people’s influence and democracy learning inside and outside of school (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1746197913483684">Olson, 2012</xref>). The ICCS 2009 study’s assessment rationale also strongly focuses on individual rather than on collective participation, implying that ‘what counts’ is individually oriented performance modes, that is, individual performativity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1746197913483684">Olson, 2012</xref>). In addition, the ICCS 2009 study’s measurement of young people’s influence and readiness to take on their role as citizens also tends to concentrate on outcomes rather than on the very processes of influence and democracy learning, curricula and teaching methods. The educational over-reliance on such assessment rationales offers a meagre hope to a questioning of the very purpose of certain methods and teaching, and furthermore, of education per se in relation to student influence and learning democracy (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1746197913483684">Au, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1746197913483684">Biesta, 2010</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1746197913483684">3</xref></sup> Hence, the ‘lessons’ of democratic citizenship offered to the students are few and restricted. In conventional teaching, influence, democracy and citizenship are treated as matters that are ‘knowable’ and may be relevant, in some way, in the future. Voting procedures and other formal ‘factual’ aspects of democratic systems at a societal level are prominent examples of the content involved in such lessons in democratic citizenship. The student influence on the subject matters in school seems to be related to the status of the programme; the more ‘academised’ it is, like the Swedish Natural sciences programme, the less space is provided for influencing the content, aims and ways of teaching and learning. Students enrolled on less academic programmes, like the Individual programme or Child and recreation programme, seem to have more influence on at least some aspects of their educational situation.</p>
<p>It should be emphasised that young Swedes’ understanding of influence and change are not exclusively competitive and individualistic. A large majority of young people in Sweden surveyed by the <italic>International Civic and Citizenship Education Study 2009</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1746197913483684">Swedish National Agency for Education, 2010</xref>) held favourable opinions about student influence and the value of collective organisation. Four out of five believed that groups of students could contribute to problem solving and improvements in schools, and an equally large proportion believed that collective student action has more influence than individual action.</p>
<p>To conclude, a DCM position tends to be actualised in Swedish upper secondary school. This position seems to promote new forms of democracy learning while compromising others. The ‘lessons’ in democratic citizenship offered to the students in school – once they have made their choices – are few and restricted. Moreover, both their influence and democracy learning are increasingly delimited to a matter of navigating well among choices. The democratic space or potential is being reduced to influencing ‘packages’ of content, modes or degree of predicated and pre-designed pedagogic frameworks and educational outcomes solely through what they ‘go for’, that is, what they are assumed to account for. Within each of these ‘packages’, there seems to be little space or opportunity for influencing their educational situation and education at large. Are we witnessing the emergence of a kind of citizenship and civic democratic agency that is mainly centred on how we, as individuals, navigate on a bazaar of options, and embody and utilise our power and the capital we have as consumers?</p>
