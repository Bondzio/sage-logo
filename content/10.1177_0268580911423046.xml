<abstract>
<p>Using data from 14 repeated cross-sectional surveys (<italic>N</italic> = 19,961), this study investigated trends in the family role attitudes of full-time, part-time and non-working men and women since the 1980s. The results show that in the Netherlands inter-cohort effects are considerably smaller in magnitude than intra-cohort (period) effects in driving changes in attitudes. Large differences were found between women working in paid employment (both full-time and part-time) and non-working women, and these differences remained remarkably stable over the years. Further, part-time working men seem much more egalitarian in their views on family roles than full-time working men. Although these differences declined somewhat over the years, a substantial gap remains.</p>

<p>À partir de données provenant de 14 enquêtes transversales repétées (N = 19.961), cet article étudie les évolutions depuis les années 80 des mentalités concernant les rôles familiaux des hommes et des femmes qui travaillent à plein temps, à temps partiel et qui ne travaillent pas. Les résultats indiquent qu’aux Pays-Bas les effets au niveau des changements dans les mentalités sont d’une bien moindre ampleur entre cohortes que ceux observés au sein d’une cohorte (sur une période). D’importantes différences ont été relevées entre les femmes qui ont un emploi rémunéré (que ce soit à plein temps ou à temps partiel) et celles qui ne travaillent pas, et ces différences sont restées remarquablement stables au fil des ans. En outre, les hommes qui travaillent à temps partiel semblent avoir des opinions beaucoup plus égalitaires concernant les rôles familiaux que les hommes qui travaillent à plein temps. Bien que ces différences aient quelque peu diminué au cours des années, un écart important demeure.</p>

<title>Resumen</title>
<p>Usando datos de 14 encuestas continuas de sección cruzada (N = 19.961), este estudio investiga las tendencias en las actitudes hacia los roles familiares de hombres y mujeres con trabajos a tiempo completo, a tiempo parcial y sin trabajo desde la década de 1980. Los resultados muestran que en Holanda los efectos de la cohorte son de magnitud considerablemente más pequeña que los efectos intra-cohorte (periodo) en la generación de cambios de actitudes. Se han encontrado grandes diferencias entre las mujeres que trabajan en empleos remunerados (tanto a tiempo completo como a tiempo parcial) y las mujeres no trabajadoras, y estas diferencias se mantienen considerablemente estables a lo largo de los años. Adicionalmente, los hombres trabajadores a tiempo parcial parecen mucho más igualitarios en sus visiones sobre los roles familiares que los hombres que trabajan a tiempo completo. Aunque estas diferencias se reducen ligeramente a lo largo de los años, aún existe una diferencia importante.</p>

<p>A major trend in most western societies in the last quarter of the 20th century was the rise of women’s labour participation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0268580911423046">Blossfeld and Hakim, 1997</xref>). This trend logically coincided with growing endorsement within these societies of an egalitarian division of family roles between men and women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0268580911423046">Fortin, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0268580911423046">Thornton and Young-DeMarco, 2001</xref>). The proportion of people who considered paid employment of women to negatively influence family life substantially declined over the years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0268580911423046">Alwin et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0268580911423046">Bolzendahl and Myers, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0268580911423046">Brooks and Bolzendahl, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0268580911423046">Scott et al., 1996</xref>). Changing attitudes among a nation’s population generally result from cohort succession, within-cohort change (period effects), or a combination of these two processes. The unravelling of such inter-cohort and intra-cohort effects seems especially interesting with respect to family role attitudes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0268580911423046">Alwin, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0268580911423046">Alwin and Scott, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0268580911423046">Brooks and Bolzendahl, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0268580911423046">Mason and Lu, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0268580911423046">Neve, 1995</xref>). First, it may provide us with information on a possible general transformation of society whereby all adults adopt more egalitarian opinions on family roles. Second, it may shed light on whether and to what extent growing up in a specific part of the 20th century causes people from younger cohorts to subscribe more to egalitarian opinions on women’s roles than people from older cohorts.</p>
<p>Most previous research on family role attitudes showed period effects (within cohorts) to be the main force driving the shift to more egalitarian opinions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0268580911423046">Bolzendahl and Myers, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0268580911423046">Mason and Lu, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0268580911423046">Rindfuss et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0268580911423046">Scott et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0268580911423046">Thornton and Young-DeMarco, 2001</xref>). Yet most of these studies disregarded developments resulting from inter-cohort change (cohort succession). There are, however, some relevant exceptions. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0268580911423046">Neve (1995)</xref> showed for the Netherlands that cohort succession is important in determining attitudes towards women’s emancipation, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0268580911423046">Brewster and Padavic (2000)</xref> underscored that in the United States intra- and inter-cohort change were equally important in shifts related to gender ideology (1977–96). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0268580911423046">Brooks and Bolzendahl (2004)</xref> showed cohort replacement in the United States to play an even larger role than intra-cohort change for the 1985–98 period. Finally, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0268580911423046">Lee et al. (2007)</xref> concluded that changes in gender beliefs in East Germany after the 1989 turnover occurred mostly through intra-cohort change, whereas in West Germany intra-cohort and inter-cohort change were almost equally important.</p>
<p>To understand the rise of more egalitarian attitudes towards family roles in-depth, it seems necessary to look at relevant changes in women’s position in the labour market (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0268580911423046">Bolzendahl and Myers, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0268580911423046">Cunningham, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0268580911423046">Fortin, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0268580911423046">Thornton and Young-DeMarco, 2001</xref>). In the Netherlands, the trend of greater participation of women in the labour force basically comes down to a large increase of women working part-time, as the proportion of women working full-time in the Netherlands rose only marginally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0268580911423046">Blossfeld and Hakim, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0268580911423046">Van der Lippe and Van Dijk, 2001</xref>). In this regard it is sometimes noted that men nowadays are also more inclined to work part-time. Although this is true, the number of part-time working men remains rather small (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0268580911423046">Blossfeld and Hakim, 1997</xref>). In the Netherlands in 1995, only 17 percent of all working men were employed part-time compared to 67 percent of all working women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0268580911423046">Van der Lippe and Van Dijk, 2001</xref>). By 2005 these percentages had risen to 23 percent and 75 percent, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0268580911423046">Statistics Netherlands, 2006</xref>). Individuals’ employment status (i.e. working full-time, working part-time or non-working) is believed to be related to the attachment to attitudes towards both paid and unpaid labour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0268580911423046">Kroska and Elman, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0268580911423046">Poortman and Van der Lippe, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0268580911423046">Treas and Widmer, 2000</xref>). Work orientations that leave room for family responsibilities are typically attributed to part-time workers more than to full-time workers. Because full-time workers are oriented more towards work than to family, they likely feel more attached to their occupational career than part-time workers and the non-working (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0268580911423046">Alwin et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0268580911423046">Cunningham, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0268580911423046">Glass, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0268580911423046">Scott et al., 1996</xref>).</p>
<p>The relationship between an individual’s employment status and approval of egalitarian family roles may differ between women and men (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0268580911423046">Bolzendahl and Myers, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0268580911423046">Brewster and Padavic, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0268580911423046">Mason and Lu, 1988</xref>). In general, compared to men, women still are less career oriented and more concerned with the family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0268580911423046">Hakim, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0268580911423046">Rindfuss et al., 1996</xref>). Women may therefore subscribe more to non-egalitarian family roles. Still, the assumption that women’s family role attitudes differ from those of men could mask internal differences for men and women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0268580911423046">Poortman and Van der Lippe, 2009</xref>). It may therefore also be advisable to differentiate between the three employment status groups for both sexes. For instance, unlike full-time working men, full-time working women are believed to be a select group with an above-average work commitment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0268580911423046">Hakim, 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0268580911423046">2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0268580911423046">McRae, 2003</xref>). Consequently this category of women may have particularly egalitarian opinions on family roles. Much empirical research has in fact reported more progressive opinions on women’s roles among full-time employed women compared to non-working and part-time working women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0268580911423046">Alwin et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0268580911423046">Glass, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0268580911423046">Hakim, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0268580911423046">McRae, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0268580911423046">Plutzer, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0268580911423046">Treas and Widmer, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>Bringing these two lines of research together, i.e. the study of attitude change in family roles and the study of employment status and opinions on family roles, an investigation of separate <italic>trends</italic> for different employment status groups seems appropriate. It could well be that part-time working men have changed their opinions on family roles more rapidly than full-time working men, and that full-time and part-time working women differ from non-working women in their attitude development. Although much is known about trends in attitudes on family roles among the general population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0268580911423046">Berridge et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0268580911423046">Brewster and Padavic, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0268580911423046">Brooks and Bolzendahl, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0268580911423046">Neve, 1995</xref>), little is known about specific trends in attitude development among non-working, part-time working and full-time working people. This study is therefore innovative in that it separately examines convergence and/or divergence of gender role opinions of men and women with different employment statuses for both intra-cohort and inter-cohort change. In other words, it investigates the extent to which people of all three employment statuses came to accept more egalitarian family roles between 1981 and 2004, and the degree to which people from each of the three employment status groups hold different opinions on family roles over the cohorts born between 1917 and 1983. The general research questions read as follows: <italic>How have family role attitudes developed over time in the Netherlands? How have such developments differed between non-working, part-time working and full-time working men and women?</italic></p>
<p>To answer these questions, a nationally representative dataset containing information on family role attitudes in the Netherlands over a period of 23 years (1981–2004) was used. The Netherlands is an interesting country for studying attitude change in family roles, because women’s labour participation remained rather low until the early 1990s compared to other western countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0268580911423046">Blossfeld and Hakim, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0268580911423046">Treas and Widmer, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0268580911423046">Van der Lippe and Van Dijk, 2001</xref>). Since the 1990s, however, the number of part-time working men <italic>and</italic> women has grown substantially. In the European context, the Netherlands nowadays leads with respect to women working part-time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0268580911423046">Mandel and Semyonov, 2006</xref>) and men working part-time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0268580911423046">Statistics Netherlands, 2006</xref>). Moreover, since the 1960s Dutch society has rapidly changed, particularly as a consequence of secularization, women’s emancipation, rising economic welfare and individualization. A study on trends in family role attitudes related to men’s and women’s employment status thus expands general knowledge on the development of sociopolitical attitudes in western societies.</p>
<sec id="section1-0268580911423046">
<title>Changes in family role attitudes</title>
<p>Attitudes in society are generally assumed to change in two ways. First, opinions on family roles may shift through cohort succession. This driving force, also called cohort replacement, stresses childhood learning. Because of their specific year of birth, individuals live a particular part of societal history in their formative years, and this produces distinct normative orientations that differ by generation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0268580911423046">Alwin and Scott, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0268580911423046">Inglehart, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0268580911423046">Kraaykamp, 2002</xref>). Such a cohort-specific socialization over the life course is expected to become resistant to change and crystallizes into stable sociopolitical orientations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0268580911423046">Alwin, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0268580911423046">Alwin and Krosnick, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0268580911423046">Glenn, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0268580911423046">Inglehart and Baker, 2000</xref>). The totality of conditions under which each generation matures explains attitude change through the ‘natural’ process of cohort succession: older cohorts in society die out and are replaced by younger cohorts. Since people from the younger cohorts experienced increasing gender equality in their formative years, this replacement process is expected to lead to more egalitarian attitudes towards family roles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0268580911423046">Brewster and Padavic, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0268580911423046">Brooks and Bolzendahl, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0268580911423046">Mason and Lu, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0268580911423046">Neve, 1995</xref>). Cohort effects on family role attitudes are likely to work more strongly among women than among men. Egalitarian family roles are more directed at women, who are the ones profiting most from greater gender equality, thus inter-cohort development towards more egalitarian family role attitudes is believed to be steeper for women than for men.</p>
<p>The second force driving changes in attitude, the alternative to cohort succession theory, is the social structural approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0268580911423046">Brooks and Bolzendahl, 2004</xref>). This view stresses that societal developments lead to changing opinions in all cohorts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0268580911423046">Alwin and Scott, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0268580911423046">Danigelis et al., 2007</xref>). Unlike cohort succession, this period effect perspective considers every adult as open to attitude change produced by so-called ‘social structural conditions’, that is, sociodemographic, economic and historical developments. This approach is consistent with what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0268580911423046">Visser and Krosnick (1998)</xref> refer to as ‘lifelong openness’. Next to structural conditions, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0268580911423046">Brooks and Bolzendahl (2004)</xref> mention ideological learning as an alternative explanation of within-cohort attitude change. From this perspective it is the changing of a general value climate in society that causes more egalitarian family role attitudes to arise in people. One may call this a sociocultural approach. In most western countries, structural and cultural developments that have taken place since the late 1970s help to explain increasing gender equality in family roles. Scholars note that rising divorce rates, declining fertility, the rising age at which women become mothers, educational expansion and women’s labour force participation have dramatically changed the situation within families (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0268580911423046">Brewster and Padavic, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0268580911423046">Mason and Lu, 1988</xref>). Subsequently, adhering to norms of gender inequality has become more costly for women, since the general risk of divorce has increased, their human capital has improved and the need to provide care in the home has declined. I thus expect period effects to have caused women to subscribe more to egalitarian views on family roles over the years. This shift to more egalitarian opinions has probably taken place at a somewhat slower pace for men, since some men feel better-off in a family with an asymmetric division of labour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0268580911423046">Bolzendahl and Myers, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0268580911423046">Mason and Lu, 1988</xref>). Men may, however, respond to women’s altered family role attitudes. After all, if men cling to non-egalitarian opinions on the role of women, serious disagreement may arise within a family, perhaps leading to conflicts of interest that lower the quality of marital life for both spouses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0268580911423046">Kalmijn, 2005</xref>). In this sense, women’s changed attitudes could be instrumental in bringing about changes in men’s perspectives.</p>
<p>Several approaches have been suggested to study cohort replacement and period effects in attitudes. The current study employs the method of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0268580911423046">Firebaugh (1989)</xref>, which has been used frequently in research on attitude change (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0268580911423046">Alwin and Scott, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0268580911423046">Brewster and Padavic, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0268580911423046">Brooks and Bolzendahl, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0268580911423046">Danigelis et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0268580911423046">Neve, 1995</xref>). In this method, period effects (intra-cohort) are represented by the effect of measurement year times the number of years under study.

<title>Employment status and family role attitudes</title>
<p>Family role attitudes often are regarded as normative beliefs about how gender roles should be divided in a family and in society at large (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0268580911423046">Kalmijn, 2005</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0268580911423046">Scott et al. (1996)</xref> underscored the importance of such attitudes as indicators of people’s latent tendencies to respond to opportunities and constraints posed by the structural conditions of life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0268580911423046">Brooks and Bolzendahl, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0268580911423046">Kroska and Elman, 2009</xref>). Experiences in certain social contexts (i.e. employment, education and marriage) particularly modify attitudes directly related to people’s positions in these contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0268580911423046">Cunningham et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0268580911423046">Thornton and Young-DeMarco, 2001</xref>). Hence, family role attitudes regarding mothers working in paid labour and the sharing of family responsibilities are likely to be associated with a person’s non-working, part-time working or full-time working status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0268580911423046">Bolzendahl and Myers, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>A theoretical argument to expect this is that any discrepancy between a person’s actual working hours and their opinion about preferred roles in the family causes a conflict and as a consequence personal strain – an inconsistency between belief and behaviour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0268580911423046">Cooper and Croyle, 1984</xref>). From psychological cognitive dissonance theory it follows that such strain will be relieved by changing either the employment behaviour or the attitude on the preferable family role. The psychological process in which a person’s attitude is brought into concordance with the actual situation is often labelled in terms of adjustment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0268580911423046">Huber and Spitze, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0268580911423046">Jansen and Kalmijn, 2000</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0268580911423046">Bolzendahl and Myers (2004)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0268580911423046">Kroska and Elman (2009)</xref> refer to this process of adjustment in terms of exposure and interest. People are believed to change opinions due to the employment circumstances they experience, and calculating the interests of their current employment situation.</p>
<p>Attitudes towards family roles are likely to be gendered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0268580911423046">Poortman and Van der Lippe, 2009</xref>). A general expectation is that women in full-time employment will have a preference for more egalitarian family roles compared to part-time working women and non-working women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0268580911423046">Hakim, 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0268580911423046">2002</xref>). Indeed, empirical research has shown higher scores for women who are employed full-time (over a longer period) on egalitarian family role items (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0268580911423046">Alwin et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0268580911423046">Cunningham et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0268580911423046">Thornton et al., 1983</xref>). Because of the monetary and psychological rewards derived by full-time employed women, I expect them to favour work obligations over family commitments. In contrast, non-working women likely derive mostly family-related rewards and are thus expected to adhere more to gendered family roles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0268580911423046">Cunningham et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0268580911423046">Hakim, 2000</xref>). For women employed part-time, expectations are more difficult to derive, but it is likely that these women’s work and family commitments will lie in-between those of non-working women and those of full-time working women. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0268580911423046">Hakim (2000)</xref> refers to these women as being adaptive to both work and family demands. These women’s shouldering of both work and family responsibilities is sometimes referred to as the ‘double burden’ of employed women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0268580911423046">Van der Lippe and Van Dijk, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>For men, more or less opposite expectations may be formulated. Full-time working (and non-working) men are likely to endorse more gendered family roles than part-time working men. Since full-time employed men in general perceive themselves as responsible for acquiring a family income, their priorities lie with work, and they are expected to be far less involved in domestic responsibilities and caring. In contrast, part-time employed men typically have given up some labour time to create time for the family (i.e. mostly caring for children). As a result, egalitarian family roles are likely to be more in evidence among men who work part-time than among those who are full-time workers.</p>
<p>Studying the relation between employment status and family role attitudes is not without controversy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0268580911423046">Thornton et al., 1983</xref>). Not only does employment status influence a person’s attitudes, but attitudes about gendered family roles are likely to affect decisions on employment too. Individuals may well choose to work a certain number of hours as a result of their preferences related to family life. Employment patterns then are shaped by previously held attitudes towards preferable family roles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0268580911423046">Cunningham, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0268580911423046">Cunningham et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0268580911423046">Hakim, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0268580911423046">Huber and Spitze, 1981</xref>). Research on the non-recursive effects of family role attitudes, however, is rather inconclusive. Panel research by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0268580911423046">Thornton et al. (1983)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0268580911423046">Jansen and Kalmijn (2000)</xref> showed that women with non-egalitarian opinions about gendered family roles work fewer hours and have more children, but <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0268580911423046">Smith-Lovin and Tickamyer (1978)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0268580911423046">Bielby and Bielby (1984)</xref> reported no significant effects of a person’s view on family roles on employment status in adulthood. More recently, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0268580911423046">Cunningham et al. (2005)</xref> confirmed that among young women (aged 23–31) early family role attitudes have a small but significant effect on their number of working hours.</p>
<p>With a cross-sectional design it is virtually impossible to statistically control for non-recursive effects, which is a serious drawback. There are, however, at least three ways to address this problem. First, in a study such as the current one, which focuses on ‘trends’ in the relation between employment status and family role attitudes, it may be a strategy to presuppose only an association between the two. It is not necessary to make any causal claims. Hence, this study foremost may be seen as one of changing associations and not of changing effects. Second, some researchers claim that meaningful attitudes on family roles crystallize at a certain age, and thereafter only vary due to major life events. A change in employment status is one such plausible occurrence, but there may be others. Major life events like becoming a parent, starting a relationship or breaking up a marriage are factors that may cause a person to modify their family role opinions. By controlling for these major life events, next to employment status, variations found between full-time, part-time and non-working individuals would represent more or less unbiased differences (controlling by looking at <italic>interpretation</italic>). Third, a workable strategy in a cross-sectional design is to control for aspects that indicate previously held views on family roles. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0268580911423046">Hakim (2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0268580911423046">2002</xref>) refers to such views as work–lifestyle preferences. Educational attainment, living in a rural area and having a religious background are characteristics that shape a person’s opinions and moreover predict employment status later in life. By controlling for these features, a large amount of the disturbing influence of non-recursive effects is likely to be eliminated (controlling by looking at <italic>selection</italic>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0268580911423046">1</xref></sup></p>
<sec id="section3-0268580911423046">
<title>Controls</title>
<p>Previous research on the development of family role attitudes over time revealed several meaningful factors that are associated with the endorsement of egalitarian roles. These are utilized here as controls.</p>
<p>First, sociodemographic features are relevant when looking at differentiation in family role attitudes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0268580911423046">Berridge et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0268580911423046">Bolzendahl and Myers, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0268580911423046">Kiecolt and Acock, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0268580911423046">Neve, 1995</xref>). Marital status may contribute to a person’s opinions on preferable family roles. Most profound is the expectation that married men and women hold more non-egalitarian views than single, widowed or divorced persons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0268580911423046">Brooks and Bolzendahl, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0268580911423046">Kiecolt and Acock, 1988</xref>). Non-married people are probably more individualistic and less compelled to discuss the division of the various responsibilities within a family. Accordingly, they are likely to adhere more to attitudes underscoring the equality of men and women in paid and unpaid labour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0268580911423046">Mason and Lu, 1988</xref>). Cohabiting couples, through their type of relationship, exhibit a more individualistic stance that will likely show up in their family role attitudes. Also, the intention to have children unquestionably leads people to reconsider the roles in a family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0268580911423046">Bolzendahl and Myers, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0268580911423046">Kroska and Elman, 2009</xref>). Following Hakim’s preference theory, this reconsideration may result in a return to a more gendered family pattern, with an asymmetric male–female division of paid and unpaid labour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0268580911423046">Hakim, 2000</xref>). Previous research indeed established that the presence of preschool-age children restricts women’s opportunity to work full-time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0268580911423046">Blossfeld and Hakim, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0268580911423046">Van Gils and Kraaykamp, 2008</xref>). So, the expectation seems justified that both women and men with preschool-age children will hold less egalitarian views on family roles than people without children. A final sociodemographic aspect refers to regional differences. In some western countries, differences in family role attitudes are found between urban and rural areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0268580911423046">Plutzer, 1988</xref>). Rural residents express somewhat less egalitarian views on mothers with preschool-age children working in paid employment than urban dwellers.</p>
<p>Second, religion plays an important role in people’s views about employed mothers and the sharing of family responsibilities. Most religious institutions are critical of women working in paid labour, at least when this is believed to harm family life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0268580911423046">Bolzendahl and Myers, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0268580911423046">Hertel and Hughes, 1987</xref>). Participation in religious life (i.e. church attendance) is a relatively good indicator of a person’s involvement in religion. Regular churchgoers are expected to hold less egalitarian family role attitudes than non-churchgoers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0268580911423046">Brooks and Bolzendahl, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0268580911423046">Mason and Lu, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0268580911423046">Rindfuss et al., 1996</xref>).</p>
<p>Third, of all the socioeconomic aspects educational attainment is probably most relevant regarding family role attitudes. Schooling is believed to enhance a person’s frame of reference, increase sociopolitical interests and expand general knowledge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0268580911423046">Hyman and Wright, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0268580911423046">Kalmijn and Kraaykamp, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0268580911423046">Pascarella and Terenzini, 1991</xref>). More highly educated people therefore adhere more to egalitarian opinions about family roles and are more liberal in this respect than the lower educated. Previous research on family role attitudes confirmed this expectation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0268580911423046">Brooks and Bolzendahl, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0268580911423046">Kroska and Elman, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0268580911423046">Rindfuss et al., 1996</xref>). Although most previous research on attitude development in the Netherlands only showed minor associations with material wealth, this study nonetheless includes personal income, because some suggest that higher income groups are more egalitarian in their family role attitudes than lower income groups.</p>

<title>Data and measurements</title>
<sec id="section5-0268580911423046">
<title>Data</title>
<p>To answer the research questions, this study employs data from 14 waves of the Cultural Change in the Netherlands (CCN) survey of the Dutch Social and Cultural Planning Office (SCP). The CCN surveys are especially designed to monitor cultural developments in the Netherlands. Data were collected in face-to-face interviews combined with written self-completion questionnaires between 1981 and 2004. The surveys employed representative samples of the Dutch adult population and are highly comparable with respect to background characteristics and attitude measurements. Individuals between ages 21 and 65 were selected (<italic>N</italic> = 19,961) since these are the people dealing with employment decisions. Response rates for the CCN surveys varied between 64 percent (in 1993) and 80 percent (in 1983) and the number of cases per wave varied between 1181 (in 1986) and 1759 (in 1996). This repeated cross-sectional survey over a period of 23 years constitutes a powerful design to study trends in family role attitudes and to look at differences according to respondents’ employment status.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0268580911423046">
<title>Measurement of family role attitudes</title>
<p>From the CCN data, four items on family role attitudes were selected that were identical over the 23-year period and asked in all 14 survey years. Two items refer to mothers who have young children and are working in paid labour, and two items indicate a respondent’s opinion on an equal division of paid and unpaid labour in the family. All items were recoded in such a way that a high score refers to a more egalitarian family role attitude. The two selected items on mothers doing paid work had three possible answers: ‘unacceptable’ (1), ‘acceptable’ (2) and ‘recommendable’ (3). The two question items were formulated as follows: ‘Do you think it is acceptable or unacceptable for a wife to have a paid job next to her domestic tasks in a family with school-aged children, or would you recommend it?’ ‘Do you think it is acceptable or unacceptable for a wife to have a paid job in a family with preschool-age children (younger than age four), or would you recommend it?’ In employing these questions there surely is a trade-off between comparability over a long period and the less-than-ideal structuring of the answers.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0268580911423046">2</xref></sup> Opinions on the allocation of work were measured with two items with answer categories ranging from ‘completely disagree’ (1) to ‘completely agree’ (5). The items refer to the following statements: ‘Husband and wife should share domestic tasks equally’. ‘Husband and wife should share paid labour equally’. <sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0268580911423046">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>To analyse trends in family role attitudes in a multivariate design, a scale was constructed reflecting egalitarian family role attitudes using the four items described above (α = .63). Before averaging the scores, all items were standardized. Final scale values were multiplied by 10 to make the interpretation of regression coefficients easier. To be included on a scale, a respondent had to have valid scores on all four items (3.4 percent of the cases were excluded). Note that this procedure leads to a measurement that covers the complete 1981–2004 period with great comparability. Analyses on the separate items revealed no large differences compared to a design with a general family role attitude scale.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0268580911423046">
<title>Measurement of the explanatory variables</title>
<p>To investigate shifts in family role attitudes over time, period effects were represented by the continuous variable <italic>year of measurement</italic>, ranging from 1981 to 2004. For reasons of interpretation, year of measurement was centered (0 = 1990). To model <italic>cohort</italic> effects, the respondent’s birth year was used, ranging from 1917 to 1983, again centered (0 = 1950). In analysing trends in family role attitudes it is impossible to include age in the modelling. More specifically, age and cohort effects in repeated cross-section surveys are almost perfectly interchangeable, which makes identification of ‘pure’ age and ‘pure’ cohort effects impossible without additional assumptions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0268580911423046">Brooks and Bolzendahl, 2004</xref>). The inclusion of age analysing family role attitudes, however, theoretically is likely to be related to sociological transitions. Over the life course, age-related events happen which may cause changes in a person’s attitude towards equality in family roles. Hence, any analysis that incorporates most of the relevant life course transitions would address most of the age-related variation in a cohort (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0268580911423046">Alwin and Krosnick, 1991</xref>). This analysis incorporates marital status, having young children, employment status, religious participation and household income as the most relevant age-dependent aspects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0268580911423046">Brooks and Bolzendahl, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p><italic>Employment status</italic> was measured by looking at the number of hours a respondent worked weekly in paid labour. Statistics Netherlands definitions were used to classify full-time work (more than 35 hours), part-time work (12–35 hours a week) and non-working (0–12 hours a week). In the Netherlands, 67 percent of all male respondents between ages 21 and 65 worked full-time compared to only 15 percent of all women (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0268580911423046">Table 1</xref>). Some 26 percent of the men and 59 percent of the women were non-employed, which means they were in pre-retirement, a housekeeper, unemployed or on a disability pension. Interestingly, in the Netherlands in the 1981–2004 period 7 percent of all male respondents worked part-time (26 percent of the women). For men, working part-time became more accepted over the period. In the early 1980s roughly 3 percent were part-time employed, and this figure rose to about 10 percent in the first years of the 21st century.</p>

<p>As to the demographic features, <italic>marital status</italic> of a respondent is represented by three dummy variables indicating a married, single or divorced/widowed status. Divorced and widowed were collapsed into one category since the coefficients of both groups were almost identical (statistically insignificant). <italic>Cohabiting</italic> was measured as a dichotomous variable (1 = <italic>yes</italic>); about 8 percent of the respondents between ages 21 and 65 live in such an arrangement. Because opinions on family roles may result from a family’s configuration, we measured whether there were <italic>children under six years of age</italic> and <italic>children between six and 12 years of age</italic> in the household. This provided an indication of the weight of actual family responsibilities. As a control, <italic>living in a small community</italic> was included as a dichotomous variable indicating whether a respondent’s place of residence had fewer than 20,000 inhabitants. Some 28 percent of respondents resided in such a small town (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0268580911423046">Table 1</xref>).</p>
<p>A person’s <italic>religious background</italic> was represented by three dummy variables indicating church attendance. Respondents who attended church services more than once a month were categorized as ‘frequent churchgoers’. Those who went once a month or less were considered ‘incidental churchgoers’. People who did not attend services at all were classified as ‘non-churchgoers’. Note that the Netherlands has become a highly secular country over the years. Our data suggest that about 17 percent of respondents were frequent churchgoers, whereas no fewer than 57 percent were non-churchgoers (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0268580911423046">Table 1</xref>).</p>
<p>The socioeconomic position of respondents was represented by two factors. <italic>Educational attainment</italic> was measured by three dummy variables ranging from primary education (no high school) and secondary education (high school) to tertiary education (college). Yearly household <italic>income</italic> was treated as a relative indicator of a respondent’s affluence in a survey year. Household income was therefore standardized separately for each year, and proportional rank scores per year were calculated ranging from 0 to 1. Missing observations for annual household income were replaced, calculating the regression on income of education, working hours, age, marital status, number of children and gender separately for each survey year.</p>

<title>Descriptive results</title>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0268580911423046">Figure 1</xref> depicts the trends in attitudes towards mothers working in paid labour for the 1981–2004 period referring to the first two items. Only percentages for the collapsed categories ‘acceptable’ and ‘recommendable’ are presented, reflecting the endorsement of egalitarian family roles. Clearly more egalitarian views on women working in paid labour gained support among the Dutch over the last three decades. Approval of working mothers with preschool-age children increased from 22 percent in 1981 to 68 percent in 2004 for women and from 22 percent to 62 percent for men. Hence, nowadays more than half of the Dutch population approves of mothers combining care for their children with a paid job. Approval is even stronger for women working when their children are in grade school. In 1981, 66 percent of all women approved this choice and by 2004 this had risen to 92 percent (for men approval rose from 59 percent to 88 percent).</p>

<p>Developments reflecting opinions on a more equal division of paid and unpaid labour in a household (the last two items) are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0268580911423046">Figure 2</xref>, and reveal another picture. Percentages for the categories ‘agree’ and ‘completely agree’ (added) are shown. First, most Dutch endorse an equal division of responsibilities within a family; concurrence of men and women with both statements always exceeds 50 percent. Second, a substantial increase in endorsement of more equality in household tasks is observed over time. Acceptance of greater equality in domestic obligations grew from 60 percent in 1981 to 79 percent in 2004 among women (for men from 63 percent to 78 percent). Third, opinions on parity in paid work were remarkably stable over time. Only a small increase of accordance could be observed. In 1981, 57 percent of women endorsed a more equal division in paid work, and this only rose to 62 percent by 2004.</p>

<title>Multivariate results</title>
<p>This study deals with intra-cohort and inter-cohort changes in family role attitudes, as well as how these developments relate to an individual’s employment status. For this, estimates of three OLS regression models were used (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0268580911423046">Table 2</xref>). Model 1 depicts a baseline model that incorporates only aspects of time (i.e. birth cohort and measurement year). This makes it possible to calculate intra-cohort and inter-cohort attitude change before dealing with compositional change over the years/cohorts (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0268580911423046">Table 3</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0268580911423046">4</xref></sup> Model 2 includes respondents’ employment status and the controls. Finally, with Model 3 we analyse separate trends for full-time working, part-time working and non-working respondents (i.e. convergence or divergence), by estimating interaction terms. All analyses were performed separately for men and women.</p>

<title>Trends in family role attitudes: Main effects</title>
<p>Model 1 in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0268580911423046">Table 2</xref> presents coefficients for measurement year and birth cohort. Both aspects indicate increasingly egalitarian opinions on family roles over time. This model also shows that the effects for men and women are of comparable magnitude. Decomposing intra-cohort and inter-cohort change (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0268580911423046">Table 3</xref>), I find that among both sexes egalitarian views on family roles gained support mostly as a result of intra-cohort change (period effects). For men, period effects are almost twice as large as cohort effects. Analysing the years 1981–2004, period effects caused a 3.477 (<italic>23*0.151</italic>) scale point change in the approval of egalitarian family roles, whereas cohort succession led to only a 1.829 (<italic>19.13*0.096</italic>) point change in these successive years. This means that almost 66 percent of the overall trend may be understood in terms of structural change (intra-cohort change). The picture for women is more or less identical. Between 1981 and 2004, period effects contributed to a 3.372 (<italic>23*0.147</italic>) scale point change, while inter-cohort change caused a 2.059 (<italic>19.71*0.104</italic>) point shift towards more egalitarian family role attitudes. Apparently, this trend took place among all of categories of adult women (62 percent), and to a much smaller extent can be seen as the result of the entry of more egalitarian female cohorts in society (38 percent).</p>
<p>Model 2 introduces the controls plus employment status, and most coefficients are as expected. For both men and women, differentiation in attitudes towards family roles occurs due to marital status, as marriage leads people to be more in favour of non-egalitarian opinions when it comes to mothers working in paid labour and an equal sharing of family obligations. Single women are especially egalitarian in their views on family roles (<italic>b</italic> = 1.456), followed by women who are widowed or divorced. Men who cohabit may be characterized as pro-egalitarian when it comes to their family role attitudes (<italic>b</italic> = 1.451). Unforeseen were the small and insignificant coefficients of having young children for both women and men. This shows that opinions are hardly associated (directly) with family restrictions, like the need to nurture young children. In contrast, men and women with older children do seem to be slightly less egalitarian on family matters. It appears that being a parent for a longer time may lead people to focus more on the family and thereby to return to less egalitarian opinions on family patterns. Finally, living in a small town seems to be related to less egalitarian family role attitudes among both men (<italic>b</italic> = −1.150) and women (<italic>b</italic> = −0.719).</p>
<p>The coefficients of religious participation are rather straightforward. Actual churchgoers are far less egalitarian than non-churchgoers (women (<italic>b</italic> = −3.088); men (<italic>b</italic> = −2.830)). Religious institutions thus seem to have succeeded in advocating a more conventional role for women in Dutch society. Note, however, that because of the vast trend towards secularization ever fewer people adhere to religious institutions, making this effect relate to fewer people over time. Furthermore, the more highly educated and more affluent individuals seem to be the most egalitarian when it comes to attitudes towards mothers working and an equal division of paid and unpaid work. Most surprising, the coefficient of having a college degree for women (<italic>b</italic> = 2.797) is almost double that for men (<italic>b</italic> = 1.450), and this difference is significant. Apparently, for most women higher education is a leap towards more progressive attitudes, whereas for more highly educated men the step towards equality in family roles is somewhat harder to make.</p>
<p>Model 2 also presents the estimates of having a certain employment status. Here, some remarkable differences are observed. Part-time working men seem to hold the most egalitarian views on mothers working in a paid job (<italic>b</italic> = 1.819). These men appear to be a highly select group that largely accepts egalitarian family roles for men and women. Non-working men hold slightly more egalitarian opinions on family roles than full-time working men. It comes as no surprise that non-working women adhere to less egalitarian family role attitudes than working women (<italic>b</italic> = −2.269). Women working part-time are those with the most egalitarian opinions on gendered family roles.</p>
<p>Controlling for compositional variation in Model 2 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0268580911423046">Table 2</xref>) underscores the conclusion that intra-cohort change is the main factor explaining increasingly egalitarian family role attitudes. Among men, some 25 percent of the total attitude change is accounted for by compositional change, leaving 75 percent for intra-cohort (46 percent) and inter-cohort (28 percent) change (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0268580911423046">Table 3</xref>). Among women, more than 40 percent of the observed attitude change is accounted for by composition (i.e. women’s rising labour participation, their increasing educational success and secularization). Of the remaining 57 percent attitudinal change, only 14 percent can be perceived as inter-cohort change, whereas 44 percent is denoted as intra-cohort change.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0268580911423046">5</xref></sup></p>

<title>Employment status and family role attitudes: Interaction effects</title>
<p>In Model 3 of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0268580911423046">Table 2</xref>, we analyse how the attitudes of non-working, part-time working and full-time working people have changed over time.

<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0268580911423046">Figure 3</xref> (top panel) displays separate trends for non-working, part-time working and full-time working men between 1981 and 2004. Men employed part-time over the years were the most egalitarian when it comes to their family role attitudes, but there is only a modest development – they were the most egalitarian in the 1980s and they still are. Over the years non-working and part-time working men experienced more or less parallel developments. For full-time working men things are rather different: unambiguous convergence is observed as they crawl up over the years towards the more egalitarian attitudes of part-time working men and non-working men.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0268580911423046">Figure 3</xref> (bottom panel) also shows specific trends among women. A main distinction here is between working women and non-working women. Employed women are far more egalitarian than non-employed women, and the differences that existed in the early 1980s between part-time and full-time working women have more or less disappeared; the trend interaction for part-time working is significant (<italic>b</italic> = −0.067) indicating convergence towards the full-time working women. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0268580911423046">Table 2</xref> further shows that all interactions of cohort with employment status are insignificant. This leads to the conclusion that cohort replacement (inter-cohort changes) does not differ with regard to the various employment statuses.</p>

<title>Conclusion and discussion</title>
<p>This study employed Dutch nationally representative data to answer questions about the family role attitudes of full-time, part-time and non-working men and women. It clearly shows substantial growth of endorsement of egalitarian family roles over the 23 years studied. Growth was mainly due to period effects, as acceptance of mothers working in paid employment and an equal division of family responsibilities steadily received more support. In contrast, cohort succession appears less important; for both men and women, cohort effects are approximately half the magnitude of period effects. This leads to the conclusion that changes in family role attitudes in the Netherlands mainly refer to shifting viewpoints among all adult members of society.</p>
<p>A next question was whether full-time, part-time and non-working people differ in their attitudes. There is reason to think so, since crucial employment decisions (number of working hours) logically are related to attitudes on a preferable division of family roles. People presumably try to reduce any inconsistency between belief and behaviour, bringing employment status and family role attitudes into accordance. The analyses showed large differences between women working in paid labour (either full-time or part-time) and non-working women, with the latter proving far more non-egalitarian. Considerable differences were also found between full-time and part-time working men. Men who chose to work part-time were significantly more egalitarian in their family role attitudes than non-working men, and the opinions of full-time working men were the least egalitarian. Subsequently we dealt with separate trends in family role attitudes for non-working, part-time working and full-time working men and women. Over the years working women were consistently more egalitarian than non-working women. Full-time working women, however, have crept upwards towards the more egalitarian opinions of part-time working women over the years, as substantial convergence was observed. For men the situation is slightly different. Over the years some convergence between full-time workers and part-time workers was found. Part-time working men were the most egalitarian in their family role attitudes, but full-time working men became more egalitarian at a somewhat faster pace. Yet, in 2004 a substantial gap still existed. This study found no substantial variation in cohort effects for the various employment status groups.</p>
<p>The present study answered questions on changing family role attitudes and studied intra-cohort vs inter-cohort change. This research has some drawbacks though. First, in a study on family role attitudes the importance of partner information can hardly be overestimated. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0268580911423046">Kalmijn (2005)</xref> found that partners adjust to each other’s family role attitudes, because long-lasting conflicts on such attitudes might reduce marital quality. Future research should therefore, if possible, analyse family role attitudes at the <italic>couple</italic> level rather than at the <italic>individual</italic> level. A second drawback of the present study might be a lack of information on previous family role preferences. Indeed, recent studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0268580911423046">Cunningham, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0268580911423046">Cunningham et al., 2005</xref>) confirmed that employment not only causes adaptation of family attitudes, but that the same goes the other way around. Although this critique is easily formulated, a workable solution is hard to find in a study on trends in family role attitudes. Most panel research covers only one cohort and often has to deal with panel attrition meaning that only intra-cohort change for a selective group may be investigated. In a study on trends, this seems an even more serious drawback than the eventuality of non-recursive effects. Yet it is clear that prudence is called for when it comes to any causal claims. A third drawback is formulated as a challenge for future research – after all, a study solely on the Netherlands cannot comprehensively describe overall developments in western societies. For this, comparative research on attitude trends in several countries would be indispensable. Only by comparing attitudes in countries with various structural and cultural conditions is it possible to learn whether trends occur in certain countries more than in others and whether period effects are the engine of change in family role attitudes around the globe.</p>

<p>It should be noted that any causal claims dealing with employment and family role attitudes could be problematic. Although there is much to say in favour of employment status influencing family role attitudes, strictly speaking this claim cannot be substantiated. Therefore, in this article I decided not to use the terms effect and/or cause explicitly.</p>

<p>Both items may not be regarded as interval level measurements. They are, however, clearly of an ordinal nature referring to agreement, indifference and non-agreement with the statements posed. Analysing separate items did not reveal large differences of results compared to analysing the scale. Since both items are most distinctive in measuring changes in family role attitudes, and were available for a 23-year period, I chose to incorporate them in the final scaling.</p>

<fn fn-type="other" id="fn3-0268580911423046">

<p>From the wording of both items (term ‘equally’ in the phrasing) some answering tendency towards agreement could be expected. It however is not likely that this affects the association with employment status or varies over time. I could think of no explicit hypotheses on people coming to agree more in later measurement years, or on full-time workers agreeing more than part-time workers.</p>

<p>An interesting issue is to what extent the various controls account for part of the intra-cohort and inter-cohort change. A preliminary answer to this question can be given entering the controls one by one. It shows that among women some intra-cohort change is explained by an increased education level and a growing divorce rate, and inter-cohort change is mediated predominantly by the increased labour force participation of women, an increased educational level and the declining of church attendance. For men it goes that intra-cohort change is partly due to an increase of educational level, whereas inter-cohort change foremost is related to declining church attendance and the growing popularity of cohabitation.</p>
