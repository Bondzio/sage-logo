<p>Wireless pH monitoring is currently employed in the distal esophagus. There are no controlled studies on the feasibility/safety of proximal esophageal wireless pH capsule placement.

<sec id="section4-0194599812438183">
<title>Subjects and Methods</title>
<p>All patients had a wireless pH capsule positioned 6 cm proximal to the gastroesophageal junction. They were randomized into intervention or sham groups after distal capsule placement. The delivery introducer was positioned 10 cm proximal to the distal esophageal capsule, and a second capsule was either deployed (intervention) or not (sham) based on group allocation. Patients were blinded to group assignment. Modified Edmonton Score was used to assess for chest pain, dysphagia, and odynophagia. The primary endpoints were (1) required endoscopic removal because of discomfort and (2) change in chest pain scores, controlling for baseline pain.</p>

<sec id="section5-0194599812438183">
<title>Results</title>
<p>Patients were randomized to either the intervention, proximal esophageal capsule (n = 11), or sham (n = 11). Patients with proximal pH probes had higher odds of having their chest pain (odds ratio [OR], 8.44; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.35-52.6; <italic>P</italic> = .02), odynophagia (OR, 49.5; 95% CI, 4.70-520; <italic>P</italic> = .001), and dysphagia (OR, 14.3; 95% CI, 2.12-96.6; <italic>P</italic> = .006) exacerbated.

<body>
<p>Ambulatory pH monitoring remains a key diagnostic test for gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and is often used in the diagnosis of extraesophageal reflux disease (EER). However, unlike GERD, no objective diagnostic pH criteria exist for EER. Rather, EER is suggested when abnormal proximal esophageal pH is detected. Such findings are used as a surrogate for abnormal reflux beyond the upper esophageal sphincter. However, the sensitivity of catheter-based ambulatory pH testing has recently been challenged, particularly in patients with EER symptoms who are affected by subtle and often intermittent proximal reflux events. In fact, investigations into the reproducibility and reliability of catheter-based dual-probe pH reported moderate to poor sensitivities, 70% and 55%, for distal and proximal pH probes, respectively.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0194599812438183">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>Poor sensitivity of the catheter-based dual probe presents a diagnostic dilemma. Several explanations have been proposed to explain its lack of reliability. Foremost is that reflux events are variable and intermittent by nature, and therefore, false-negative studies occur if subjects do not experience reflux during the 24-hour test period. There is also inherent discomfort in maintaining the transnasal catheter system during this period. An indwelling catheter can and often does alter normal patient behavior and thereby confound results.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0194599812438183">2</xref></sup> Moreover, catheter electrodes are not easily secured within the esophagus. Migration from the initial endoscopically determined placement due to patient movement, esophageal shortening, and gastric distention can affect test consistency and reliability.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0194599812438183">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>Wireless (catheter-free) pH-monitoring devices were developed to improve patient comfort and improve test sensitivity. In this system, a radiotelemetric capsule is deployed in the esophagus where it temporarily attaches to the esophageal mucosa 6 cm above the squamocolumnar junction (SCJ). Probes are programmed to wirelessly record reflux events and transmit occurrences to a small external receiver carried by the subject. The wireless device has alleviated many issues inherent to the catheter-based pH probe. Tolerability is better with the wireless system compared with catheter-based pH monitoring in both randomized and uncontrolled comparison studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0194599812438183">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0194599812438183">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>While the efficacy of wireless monitoring is well established for the distal esophagus, only 1 adult case series describes deployment in the proximal esophagus.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0194599812438183">6</xref></sup> This uncontrolled study demonstrated that proximal placement is possible; however, the study was not designed to assess capsule tolerability when coupled with a concomitant second distal esophageal capsule. Thus, the present single-institution, randomized, single-blinded sham-controlled trial investigates the feasibility and tolerability of dual-proximal and distal-wireless pH probe deployment in an adult population.</p>
<sec id="section7-0194599812438183" sec-type="materials|methods">
<title>Materials and Methods</title>
<p>This study was performed in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, Good Clinical Practice, and applicable regulatory requirements. The Vanderbilt University Institutional Review Board approved the study protocol (IRB 060724).</p>
<sec id="section8-0194599812438183">
<title>Patient Population and Study Protocol</title>
<p>Subjects included were 18 years of age or older and scheduled for planned esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) and wireless pH testing for (1) physiologic assessment of esophageal acid exposure for typical GERD symptoms (ie, heartburn, regurgitation) or for EER symptoms (ie, cough, asthma, throat discomfort). Excluded were those with a history of (1) upper esophageal surgery, (2) bleeding dyscrasia, (3) recent cerebrovascular accident or transient ischemic attack (&lt;6 months), (4) recent gastrointestinal hemorrhage (&lt;6 months), (5) esophageal varices or significant medical illness (ie, congestive heart failure), (6) current pregnancy, or (7) those who did not wish to participate.</p>

<sec id="section9-0194599812438183">
<title>Study Protocol</title>
<sec id="section10-0194599812438183">
<title>First visit</title>
<p>All patients underwent baseline EGD and 48-hour wireless pH monitoring in a standardized manner (described in the following). They were discharged home with instructions and were asked to return to the laboratory 48 hours later.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0194599812438183">
<title>Second visit</title>
<p>Subjects returned and data from recording devices were downloaded. They were thereafter frequency matched based on proton pump inhibitor usage and randomized in a 1:1 single-blinded fashion to receive a second capsule deployed 10 cm proximal to a previous capsule in the esophagus (16 cm proximal to the SCJ) or a sham capsule placement. Identical technique (described in the following) was used to deploy the sham capsule, except it was not vacuum fixed to the proximal esophageal mucosa after insertion. Patients were blinded to whether the second capsule was deployed. Subjects on medical therapy during initial testing continued it throughout the entire study period.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0194599812438183">
<title>Third visit</title>
<p>Assessment of symptoms and any complications were completed 48 hours after the study intervention. Patients were also given contact information to call in case of worsening of symptoms or adverse events postvisit.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-0194599812438183">
<title>Symptom Assessment</title>
<p>The validated modified Edmonton Symptom Assessment Scale<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0194599812438183">7</xref></sup> (see the supplemental appendix available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://otojournal.org">otojournal.org</ext-link>) was used to measure the presence and change in symptoms. The symptoms assessed at the first, second, and third visit included dysphagia, chest pain, odynophagia, nausea, vomiting, shortness of breath, and patient well-being. Assessments were done prior to sedation at the first visit, 48 hours after distal placement, and 48 hours after proximal placement. None were performed under the influence of sedation. Fluoroscopy was used to confirm detachment of the proximal wireless pH monitor 7 days after investigational deployment. If capsules had not detached, fluoroscopy was repeated in 3-day increments until detachment was confirmed. Tolerance to the proximal deployment was determined by comparing symptom scores between groups with (1) distal and proximal and (2) distal and sham deployments.</p>
<p>The 2 primary endpoints used to compare groups were (1) required removal of the proximal device because of pain/intolerance and (2) chest pain. Secondary outcomes were dysphagia, nausea, vomiting, odynophagia, and shortness of breath. Each symptom parameter was rated on a Likert-type visual analog scale from 0 (<italic>no pain</italic>) to 10 (<italic>worst possible</italic>; supplemental appendix).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-0194599812438183">
<title>Wireless pH Monitoring</title>
<p>Ambulatory pH monitoring was performed for 48 hours using a wireless monitoring device (Given Imaging Inc, Duluth, Georgia). Wireless capsules were calibrated by submersion in buffer solutions at pH 7.0 and pH 1.0 and then activated by magnet removal. Subjects underwent EGD with conscious intravenous sedation for visual anatomic inspection and distance measurements from the incisors to the SCJ. Capsules were then placed using the manufacturer’s delivery system 6 cm above the SCJ and attached with vacuum suction of 600 mm Hg. Capsule placement was confirmed with endoscopy. All capsules were placed successfully on the first attempt. After placement, subjects were given wireless pH recorders to wear on their waists or to keep within 3 to 5 feet at all times. Recording devices receive pH data transmitted by the capsule at 433 Hz at 6-second sampling intervals. Subjects were instructed to perform their normal daily activities and dietary practices. Distal esophageal pH recording was conducted for a total of 48 hours. During this time, patients kept diaries of meal times, symptoms, and supine position.</p>
<p>After completion of each 48-hour study period, subjects returned and data from recording devices were downloaded to dedicated computers using Datalink software. Subject diary information was manually entered into the computer-based record. Total, upright, and supine percentage time when esophageal pH was below 4 was measured on day 1 and day 2 of the wireless study. Acid exposure time (% total time pH &lt;4) greater than 4.2% per day was considered abnormal.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0194599812438183">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>For patients randomized to have a proximal pH capsule, the second capsule was deployed 10 cm proximal to the distal pH capsule in the esophagus (16 cm proximal to SCJ) after the initial 48-hour study. The capsule was advanced into the esophagus orally after the use of local oropharyngeal anesthesia (cetacaine). The deployment technique was similar to those described for the distal pH capsule. For patients randomized to sham capsule placement, an identical technique was used to advance the capsule introducer along with the capsule into the esophagus, except it was not vacuum fixed to the proximal esophageal mucosa after insertion. Patients were blinded to whether the second capsule was deployed. Proximal probe position was not confirmed at the second visit; however, the device is designed and historical data have shown detachment to occur consistently after 4 days.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0194599812438183">4</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-0194599812438183">
<title>Data Analysis</title>
<p>All analyses were performed on an intent-to-treat basis. Pre– and post–proximal wireless pH monitor deployment symptom scores were compared using Wilcoxon rank sum tests. Continuous variables (age, symptom scales) were summarized overall and by treatment group using median and interquartile range. Categorical variables (race, marital status, sex, education level, smoking status, alcohol usage) were compared using χ<sup>2</sup> or Fisher exact tests, as appropriate. Multivariable ordinal logistic regression was used to estimate the odds of a more severe score in the intervention groups compared with the sham group. To account for the subject-specific tolerance to standard distal (6 cm above SCJ) wireless pH probe placement, we controlled for chest pain/symptom scores at baseline/first visit and second visit. A reported difference of 3 points on the visual analog scale (1-10) from baseline was determined a priori to represent a clinically significant change in symptom. Power analysis indicated that 20 patients were sufficient to detect a 3-point change in chest pain score with 80% power at significance level .05 (2-sided).</p>

For example, patients complaining of shortness of breath at baseline had a 6.9-fold increased odds of reporting clinically more severe exacerbation of their symptoms at the second visit (OR, 6.9; 95% CI, 2.0-23.9; <italic>P</italic> = .002). In fact, only baseline dysphagia was not significantly aggravated by distal probe placement (OR, 2.62; 95% CI, 0.96-7.12; <italic>P</italic> = .06).</p>

<p>The third visit assessed each subject’s response to the intervention to which they were randomized; either proximal wireless pH probe or sham. Two proximally deployed probes (2/11; 18%) required endoscopic removal because of patient intolerance or discomfort. On both occasions, discomfort resolved soon after removal. Subjects in the intervention group were more likely to report worse chest pain scores than those receiving sham intervention (<italic>P</italic> = .047; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0194599812438183"><bold>Figure 3</bold></xref>). Sixty-six percent reported chest pain scores of 3 or greater in the intervention group compared with only 28% in the sham group. Similarly, for higher levels of discomfort, 32% reported chest pain scores of 7 or greater in the intervention group compared with only 8% in the sham group. Multivariable analysis was performed to determine if patients had greater odds of worse symptoms at the third visit after controlling for their symptom scores at visits 1 and 2. Comparing subjects with the same chest pain score at visit 1 and 2, but differing in intervention group, subjects with proximal probe placement had an 8.4-fold increased odds of more severe chest pain compared with the sham group (adjusted OR, 8.44; 95% CI, 1.35-52.6; <italic>P</italic> = .02; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0194599812438183"><bold>Figure 4</bold></xref>). There were also significantly increased odds of worse odynophagia (adjusted OR, 49.5; 95% CI, 4.70-520; <italic>P</italic> = .001) and dysphagia (adjusted OR, 14.3; 95% CI, 2.12-96.6; <italic>P</italic> = .006) in the intervention group.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Wireless pH monitoring is replacing catheter-based dual pH probe testing for diagnosing GERD. Advantages to the wireless system include enhanced comfort, consistency, and sensitivity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0194599812438183">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0194599812438183">10</xref></sup> However, its utility in the diagnosis of EER is less certain. Traditional wireless monitoring employs a single distal probe, whereas dual-catheter–based pH probes allow recording of reflux from both distal and proximal esophageal positions. EER symptoms are thought to arise from subtle proximal reflux events; therefore, probe measurements from the proximal esophagus are necessary. To obtain proximal measurements, either a traditional catheter-based approach or, as studied herein, a dual wireless approach is required. Impedance testing may also prove useful in the evaluation of EER; however, it is currently a catheter-based system, and its clinical utility for this condition is still investigatory.</p>
<p>The present randomized blinded controlled study is the first designed to prospectively and systematically assess the feasibility and tolerability of dual wireless pH monitoring. As expected, all patients tolerated the conventional distal wireless probe. In contrast, 2 of 11 or 18% of subjects required proximal probe removal because of discomfort. Moreover, subjects randomized to receive the proximal probe were 8 times more likely to have clinically significant exacerbation of chest pain compared with those in the sham group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0194599812438183"><bold>Figure 4</bold></xref>). The experimental group also reported significantly increased odds of odynophagia and dysphagia. Our findings are consistent with the uncontrolled study by Friedman et al,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0194599812438183">6</xref></sup> who reported some degree of chest pain in all 77 patients they evaluated with proximal wireless pH monitoring. In contrast to the present study, none of their patients reported subjective dysphagia. This discrepancy may be related to differences in study design.</p>
<p>Esophageal distention and irritation are known masqueraders of cardiac chest pain. There is incomplete understanding of the neurological pathways involved in this referred pain. We can glean some understanding of this noncardiac chest pain from experience with wireless probe deployment. Traditional wireless pH probes are deployed pneumatically 6 cm above the SCJ onto primarily stratified squamous cell epithelium, which overlies involuntary smooth muscle. This site rarely produces chest pain. Proximal differs from distal esophageal anatomy in that the underlying mucosa is voluntary skeletal muscle. A similar site of proximal deployment in our study and that by Friedman et al,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0194599812438183">6</xref></sup> 16 and 17 to 20 cm above SCJ, was associated with a reproducibly high incidence of chest pain. Underlying volitional muscle may partly explain the increased esophageal sensitivity to proximal deployment as manifested by higher odds of chest pain and swallowing dysfunction. Further corroborating this differential sensitivity, Krarup et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0194599812438183">11</xref></sup> found the distal esophagus to be less sensitive to both mechanical and electrical stimulation. Most pathophysiologic understanding of this phenomenon is extrapolated from animal models, in which higher concentrations of nociceptors and mechanoreceptors have been identified in the proximal esophagus.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0194599812438183">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0194599812438183"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0194599812438183">14</xref></sup> Our findings confirm that even subtle upper esophageal irritation can produce troublesome symptoms.</p>
<p>Deployment of 2 wireless esophageal pH probes is not unique to this study. However, prior studies placed both probes in the distal esophagus. In these studies, healthy asymptomatic patients demonstrated good tolerability.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0194599812438183">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0194599812438183">16</xref></sup> Dual distal deployment reinforced evidence that a gradient of pH and percentage time pH &lt;4 exists in asymptomatic volunteers. The degree of reflux and percentage time pH &lt;4 decreases at sites farther from the SCJ. A pathologic gradient and/or enhanced sensitivity to reflux in the proximal esophagus, larynx, and pharynx form the basis for EER pathophysiology. The present study confirms that proximal placement of a wireless pH monitor is feasible, albeit with associated morbidity. If a proximal wireless study is considered, patients must be counseled that they will likely experience chest pain and subjective dysphagia that will potentially necessitate its endoscopic removal.</p>
<p>It was beyond the scope of this study to assess the sensitivity, specificity, and diagnostic accuracy of dual (distal and proximal) wireless pH probes in the diagnosis of proximal reflux or EER. This is, however, the ultimate purpose. The existence of EER in the absence of distal GERD is contentious and cannot be definitively evaluated without developing more accurate diagnostic tests and an objective definition. Theoretically, a wireless approach is more accurate and could eventually replace the current catheter-based system for dual-site monitoring of esophageal acid exposure. However, the accuracy, consistency, and sensitivity of the probes may be affected if patients have significant discomfort related to their placement. Therefore, to ensure the comfort of our patients, further refinements in wireless pH probe technology will be necessary. Better understanding of the nociceptors and differential esophageal sensitivity will lead to innovations that allow more symptom-free placement of the proximal probe.</p>
<p>There are limitations to the present study that deserve mention. First, the 2 probes were placed at separate visits. It is unclear whether inserting both probes at a single sedated EGD would produce fewer symptoms. Nonetheless, both the feasibility and tolerability of dual placement is challenged by this study’s results, which do not support proximal placement with current technology. Selection bias is a second potential limitation. Patients who volunteered for the study may have worse symptoms and, potentially, altered esophageal sensitivity compared with those who opted out. There were, however, no measured differences in baseline characteristics compared with those who were enrolled. There was heterogeneity to the enrolled patients since some had previously undergone EGD and wireless placement in the past and others were experiencing these procedures for the first time. This potential bias should have been obviated in the randomization process.</p>
<p>In conclusion, we showed that proximal esophageal wireless pH monitor placement is feasible but, with current technology, does result in significant chest pain, odynophagia, and dysphagia that, in some cases, required endoscopic removal. The potential benefit of proximal esophageal monitoring may be hampered significantly by patient discomfort and alternation of eating habits, which could result in suboptimal monitoring of an outcome that depends on patients to be in their “usual” daily habit. Thus, given our data using current technology, we cannot recommend the use of the proximal esophagus wireless pH monitoring.</p>
