<p>I got to hear a lot of stories about Dr. Madeleine Leininger when Dr. Marilyn Ray came to Des Moines, Iowa, in April 2012 to speak about her Theory of Bureaucratic Caring. Dr. Leininger is the founder of transcultural nursing and her theory is titled “Culture Care: A Worldwide Theory of Nursing, Diversity, and Universality.” Marilyn was one of Madeleine’s first doctoral students in transcultural nursing at the University of Utah, and each had backgrounds in anthropology.</p>
<p>Marilyn shared one of her stories. When the grounded theory of bureaucratic caring emerged, Dr. Leininger challenged Dr. Ray of becoming a sociologist. She did not like the connotation the word “bureaucratic” implied. Marilyn retorted, “I’m the researcher and these are my findings. You taught me to stand up for myself.” Madeleine conceded and her dissertation theory stood.</p>
<p>Over the years the two caring theorists have attended and were keynote speakers at many Caring conferences and Transcultural Nursing conferences together. They are passionate about infusing humanistic caring into nursing curricula, health care institutions, and communities around the world. They have both traveled extensively to discuss the importance of caring. And they have stayed connected not only with their life’s work but also with their lives outside of work.</p>
<p>Dr. Ray had received a note in February from Dr. Leininger asking her to visit her at her home. I had suggested that Dr. Leininger travel to Des Moines when Dr. Ray visited Des Moines and Grand View University. Dr. Leininger, however, was unable to travel so it was suggested that we travel the 2-hour journey to Omaha where Madeleine lives.</p>
<p>We made the trip, along with Susan Allen, a doctoral student of Dr. Ray from the University of Cincinnati, School of Nursing and Cincinnati Children’s Hospital, where Dr. Leininger actually contemplated the idea of culture care when she observed and cared for culturally diverse children and their families.</p>
<p>Entering Dr. Leininger’s apartment, I watched them reunite. From the minute we stepped into the room, it was clear that the connection between them was remarkable. They sat on the couch together. Marilyn talked to Madeleine about the International Caring and Peace conference she had just attended in Hiroshima, Japan, and gave her gifts. Madeleine talked about a new book she was writing on her family during the depression, her battle with malignant brain tumors, and her time in New Guinea when she was conducting research as a doctoral student in anthropology. (Madeleine Leininger is the first nurse anthropologist in the world as well as the “mother” of transcultural nursing.) All the books Dr. Leininger had written over her career were displayed on the coffee table.</p>
<p>We were served cake and champagne to celebrate their meeting. Dr. Leininger lit up the room with her enthusiasm and delight while visiting with Dr. Ray. Susan and I got to see history in the making. And if it was possible, Dr. Ray was quiet as they caught up with each other.</p>
<p>At one point in the visit Marilyn laid her head on Madeleine’s shoulder. It was the quintessential moment, which represented the most perfect example of the caring relationship between them. It was a moment that actualized caring as the essence of nursing. I was privileged to bear witness.</p>
