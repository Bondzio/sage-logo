<abstract>
<p>The trabecular microstructure of normal lunates and lunates with Kienböck’s disease was investigated using micro-computed tomography (micro-CT). Five lunates with advanced Kienböck’s disease were obtained during lunate excision and scaphocapitate fusion, and five control lunates were from embalmed cadavers. Microstructural morphometric parameters were measured using micro-CT images. Trabeculations of lunates with Kienböck’s disease were 2.67 times denser and 1.84 times thicker than those of normal lunates. Furthermore, bone surface areas were 1.43 times greater and bone volume 2.67 times greater, and structural model indices were significantly lower in lunates with Kienböck’s disease. The study estimated that high mechanical stress would be applied to lunates with Kienböck’s disease, and suggests that new bone formation and collapse may play important roles in the microstructural changes in the lunate with advanced Kienböck’s disease.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The precise aetiology of Kienböck’s disease remains unknown. Predisposing factors include a loss of blood supply (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1753193411422337">Bochud and Büchler, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1753193411422337">Moran et al., 2005</xref>), an elevated intraosseous pressure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1753193411422337">Jensen, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1753193411422337">Schiltenwolf et al., 1996</xref>), repetitive microtrauma on the lunate over an extended period, and morphological variations, such as negative ulnar variance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1753193411422337">Kristensen and Soballe, 1987</xref>), increased uncovering of the lunate, abnormal radial inclination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1753193411422337">Mirabello et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1753193411422337">Thienpont et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1753193411422337">Tsuge and Nakamura, 1993</xref>), and a trapezoidal lunate shape (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1753193411422337">Tsuge and Nakamura, 1993</xref>). In all likelihood, some combination of these factors may result in the formation of multiple plates or faults within the trabeculae of the lunate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1753193411422337">Watson and Guidera, 1997</xref>). Mechanical stress and other pathological processes, such as bone resorption, repair and remodelling are also known to induce changes in trabecular structure and the corresponding material properties. Furthermore, when the formation of faults outstrips repair in essential areas, blood supply can be disrupted and result in bone necrosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1753193411422337">Watson and Guidera, 1997</xref>). Therefore in Kienböck’s disease the lunate trabecular bone becomes mechanically weakened and collapse, deterioration and microfracture of the trabecular bone structure can occur. A finite-element analysis model of the lunate supports the concept that some lunates are predisposed to Kienböck’s disease because their anatomy induces abnormal internal stresses, which allow an incomplete fracture to progress, under heavy loading conditions, and cause progressive collapse and localized trabecular osteonecrosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1753193411422337">Ledoux et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Standard computed tomography (CT) can be used to assess the cortex and trabecular bone separately, but it is not possible to measure the trabecular bone structure accurately. The morphometric analysis of bone structure using micro-CT has been shown to have a high correlation with the results obtained from conventional histological sections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1753193411422337">Muller et al., 1998</xref>). Despite extensive studies on three-dimensional trabecular microstructure in various diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1753193411422337">McCreadie et al., 2001</xref>), there is little information about the microstructure of lunates with Kienböck’s disease (KD lunates). The purpose of this study was to investigate histomorphometric indices using micro-CT and to compare the trabecular microstructures of lunates with Kienböck’s disease with the normal lunate.</p>

<title>Specimen selection and processing</title>
<p>From July 2007 to December 2009, fragments of lunates were obtained from five patients (four men, one woman; mean age 51.0 years; age range 30–62 years) during salvage surgery for the treatment of advanced Kienböck’s disease. The diagnosis was confirmed by plain radiography and magnetic resonance image (MRI). Lunate excision and scaphocapitate fusion was done in all patients. Complete excision of the collapsed and unreconstructable lunates was attempted via a dorsal wrist incision. However, because of technical difficulties in accessing the palmar aspect of the lunate, only the dorsal one-third of the lunate could be obtained as a block that was suitable for micro-CT examination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1753193411422337">Figure 1</xref>). Five cadaver lunates (mean age 51.2 years; range, 40–60 years, free of macroscopic pathological changes or musculoskeletal disease) from embalmed human cadavers were selected as a control group. To standardize the lunates for the control group, in addition to the gross findings in the lunates and the medical history of the donor cadavers, cross-sectional images obtained by micro-CT scanning were examined. To ensure the same conditions, the dorsal one-third of the cadaver lunates were cut off and used as specimens.</p>

<title>Micro-CT imaging</title>
<p>Each specimen was mounted on the sample holder and scanned using a high-resolution micro-CT system (Skyscan 1072, Aartselaar, Belgium) using a parallel fan beam method. Images were obtained at 80 V and 100 μA with a 1 mm aluminium filter at a magnification of × 11.23 (pixel size = 21.31 µm in all three orthogonal directions). A rotation of 0.90° was used between each image acquisition. A stack of two-dimensional (2D) sections was reconstructed for each lunate sample (the number of sections depending on the sample height), and stored in bitmap format using 256 indexed grey levels (ranging from 0 [black] to 255 [white]). Using imaging software (CT Analyser, Skyscan, Konich, Belgium), a volume of interest (VOI) was selected at a level 5 mm below the dorsal apex in each sample and centred in the AP view to exclude cortical and subchondral bone. A cylindrical VOI of diameter 2.34 mm (110 pixels) and height 1.07 mm (50 slices) was then selected. Three-dimensional (3D) modelling and bone reconstruction were done using ANT software (release 2.05; Skyscan). This software package was also used to obtain the following histomorphometric indices, which reflect the microstructural properties of trabecular bone: bone volume fraction (BVF); bone surface (BS); bone volume (BV); bone surface-to-volume ratio (BS/BV); trabecular number (Tb.N); trabecular thickness (Tb.Th); trabecular separation (Tb.Sp); structural model index (SMI); and degree of anisotropy (DA). These structural parameters were determined using previously published algorithms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1753193411422337">Feldkamp et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1753193411422337">Hildebrand et al., 1999</xref>).</p>

<title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p>Non-parametric analyses were used due to the small sample size. The Mann–Whitney <italic>U</italic> test was used to compare the 2D and 3D parameters of the five lunates with Kienböck’s disease and those of the five normal lunates; <italic>p</italic> values of ≤ 0.05 were considered significant.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>All lunates with Kienböck’s disease were of Lichtman stage IIIB and the radioscaphoid angle was greater than 60° in all cases. The carpal height was lower for KD lunates than normal lunates.</p>
<p>The dorsal one-third of the cadaver lunates and the KD lunates showed some significant differences in trabecular histomorphometry (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1753193411422337">Table 1</xref>). In particular, the BVF was significantly greater in KD lunates as was the Tb.Th. Although Tb.N was 1.10 times greater for KD lunates, this was not significant. The thicker and more numerous trabeculae resulted in the higher BVF values. BS and BV were also significantly higher for KD lunates. The higher BS and BV values also resulted in higher BVF values. In addition, SMI was significantly lower in KD lunates.</p>

<p>A significant decrease in SMI indicated the presence of more plate-like bone in KD lunates than in normal lunates. Tb.Sp, DA, and BS/BV were not significantly lower in KD lunates. A lower DA value reflects greater isotropic orientation of trabecular bone and the presence of mechanically weakened trabeculations.</p>
<p>These results probably correlated with the collapse, sclerosis and flattening of KD lunates that was observed grossly and radiologically. Thicker trabeculae and less trabecular separation were visualized in KD lunates compared with normal lunates in 2D reconstruction images (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1753193411422337">Figure 1</xref>) and thicker, denser, flatter trabeculae were also visualized in 3D reconstruction images of KD lunates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1753193411422337">Figure 2</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>An understanding of the pathophysiological changes in necrotic bone is essential for the prevention of disease progression and the restoration of structure. Many investigators have described the pathological structural changes with avascular necrosis in the scaphoid and femoral head (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1753193411422337">Beckmann et al., 2009</xref>). However, we were unable to find a report about microstructural changes of the lunate with Kienböck’s disease.</p>
<p>In this study we found that lunates with advanced Kienböck’s disease showed greater bone density and volume, greater trabecular thickness and a more plate-like structure than normal lunates. Furthermore, these results correlated with the simple radiographic and MRI findings, and the intraoperative structural observations of collapsed, sclerotic and condensed dead bone in specimens.</p>
<p>The collapse of bone causes more trabeculae to be forced into a limited space, which in turn causes trabeculae to condense and flatten. As a result, the parameters of trabecular density (Tb.Th, Tb.N, BV, and BVF) were increased and those of trabecular space (SMI and Tb.Sp) were decreased. The pathological processes of bone tissue resorption, repair and remodelling also affect the process of lunate collapse in Kienböck’s disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1753193411422337">Aspenberg et al., 1994</xref>). One of the pathological processes responsible for these changes involves the bone formation required to repair necrotic trabecular bone. Primitive mesenchymal cells invade necrotic trabecular bone, differentiate into osteoblasts, and lay down new living bone on top of dead trabeculae, which are later reabsorbed. This phenomenon leads to significant thickening of trabeculae, reduction of inter-trabecular distances and subsequent increases of BVF in necrotic regions, as was shown in a microstructural study of avascular necrosis of the femoral head in a rabbit model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1753193411422337">Hofstaetter et al., 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>New bone formation due to higher mechanical load also drives these microstructural changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1753193411422337">Trumble and Irving, 1990</xref>). In particular the SMI, which represents the mechanical characteristics of bone, is significantly lower in KD lunates than in normal lunates, and a decreased SMI indicates the presence of more plate-like bone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1753193411422337">Ding et al., 2002</xref>). Furthermore, the plate-like trabecular structure of KD lunates is indicative of high mechanical stress, whereas a rod-like structure indicates low mechanical stress. The DA is an index that reflects the orientation of trabecular bone, i.e. whether it is isotropic or anisotropic. The lower DA index values for KD lunates suggest that the orientation of trabecular bone is more isotropic but it should be noted that the decrease in the DA index observed in the present study was not significant. Furthermore, progression of bone necrosis before collapse causes the non-necrotic bone microstructure to adapt to increased compressive stress, which causes the trabecular orientation to become more anisotropic.</p>
<p>When bone necrosis progresses rapidly, compressive forces overcome trabecular resistance and ultimately cause flattening and collapse of trabeculae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1753193411422337">Ciarelli et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1753193411422337">Watson and Guidera, 1997</xref>). Accordingly, decreased DA values indicate that isotropic bone increases as osteonecrosis progresses. Microstructural adaptation to mechanical loading has been described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1753193411422337">Nufer et al. (2008)</xref> in trapezial bones in patients with osteoarthritis of the thumb. Their results compare well with our findings. In particular, Tb.Th, Tb.N, and BVF were significantly higher and SMI and DA were significantly lower in osteoarthritic trapezial bones. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1753193411422337">Nufer et al. (2008)</xref> suggested that Wolff’s law provides an explanation for new bone formation with higher load settings.</p>
<p>Regardless of the aetiology of the necrotic bone repair process observed in avascular necrosis, the end result is new bone formation. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1753193411422337">Beckmann et al. (2009)</xref> reported that patients with osteonecrosis of the femoral head and patients with osteoarthritis have similar numbers, thicknesses and separations of trabeculae. Furthermore, in their study, no significant differences were found between patients with osteonecrosis of the femoral head and patients with osteoarthritis in terms of BV, BVF, connectivity density and SMI. However, the femoral head (a weight-bearing bone) and carpal bones (non-weight bearing bones) have different functional roles and thus the pathophysiology of osteonecrosis may differ between these two bones.</p>
<p>Based on our results, it appears that reduced inter-trabecular space and higher trabecular density may interfere with blood supply in KD lunates and aggravate osteonecrosis and microstructural deterioration.</p>
<p>Some lunates are predisposed to develop Kienböck’s disease because their anatomy induces abnormal internal stresses. These may be influenced by associated morphological factors such as negative ulnar variance, a high lunate uncovering index and angulated trabeculae. A finite-element study has revealed that under these loading conditions a simulated incomplete fracture progressed, the proximal part of the lunate collapsed and localized trabecular osteonecrosis occurred (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1753193411422337">Ledoux et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Most cases of Kienböck’s disease can be diagnosed early and treated by surgical revascularization or decompressive procedures, which create a more favourable mechanical situation in the early stage of Kienböck’s disease and prevent trabecular deterioration. However, in advanced Kienböck’s disease the flattened structure and secondary arthritis irreversibly alter the normal orientation of carpal bones, despite their innate bone-forming potential.</p>
<p>The current study has some limitations. We had only five samples because the KD lunate specimens were the by-products of the uncommon salvage surgery for the few cases of advanced Kienböck’s disease. Other factors such as age, sex, duration of Kienböck’s disease and general bone density, which affect the quality of the carpal bones, were not consistent. Further studies with a larger sample size, consistent specimens and sampling of more regions of the lunate are necessary to standardize the structural parameters. Micro-CT also has some limitations. Micro-CT scanning and reconstruction of the specimen is a lengthy and tedious process, and the equipment is expensive and difficult to operate. Nevertheless, micro-CT scanning and analysis of the structural parameters is a powerful system for studying the trabecular structure of lunates with Kienböck’s disease.</p>
