<abstract>
<p>Academic as well as public libraries nowadays have to face constant change. This paper gives an overview about leadership competences needed to succeed with deliberate large-scale changes in libraries. Most of the needed competences can already be imparted during undergraduate studies toward a bachelor’s degree in library and information science, as can be seen in the example of the University of Applied Sciences Hamburg. The critical success factors of every change project are information, communication and participation. Two qualitative studies concerning leadership in academic libraries and leadership in academic and public libraries in times of change, as well as a quantitative study in an academic library concerning the influence of a transformational and a transactional leadership style of the top management on the middle management as well as on team members including the influence of the organizational culture, emphasize the importance of these success factors, especially the communication competence of leaders in times of change.</p>

<title>Need of competences in change management and leadership for current and upcoming deliberate large-scale changes in libraries</title>
<p>There always have been changes in libraries, but in the last years the rate of change as well as its speed and complexity did increase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0340035212473541">Stewart, 1996</xref>) and is still growing. Continuing change is already and will be the norm in libraries, but this paper concentrates on major, deliberate large-scale changes with a high complexity and the involvement of many members of staff.</p>
<p>After a profound look at the three phases of change by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0340035212473541">Lewin (1947</xref>) it is clear that deliberate large-scale changes in organizations need planning and organizing as well as certain leadership competences.</p>
<sec id="section2-0340035212473541">
<title>Phase 1 – Unfreezing</title>
<p>After the top management has recognized the need to change something in their library or in his or her department, and had a vision about the future demands of users as well as sponsors, the upcoming deliberate large-scale change needs to be announced in the library and especially the reason for the alterations should be known and made clear for everyone affected. Deliberate large-scale changes in libraries, such as the implementation of a Library RFID (Radio Frequency IDentification) Management System or the introduction of team work or of performance-based pay, cannot be understood and accepted without explanations.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0340035212473541">
<title>Phase 2 – Changing / Moving</title>
<p>Also throughout the entire change process information needs to be given about the alteration itself as well as its progress. Moreover it is important in this phase to give those who are affected by this major change the possibility to participate in this process and to bring in own ideas about the inevitable alterations. This is the phase where change managers and promoters of the change are needed as well as volunteers for pilot projects.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0340035212473541">
<title>Phase 3 – Refreezing</title>
<p>After the official ending of the change project there needs to be time given to learn the new processes and to work in them for a while before these new processes as well as the change project need to be evaluated. If some aspects of the alterations need to be changed again, the process begins afresh with Phase 1 – Unfreezing.</p>
<p>During change processes everybody involved should be seen as an individual with certain concerns and fears as well as an expert in his or her own working field. This already shows that some aspects of leadership are needed to handle a deliberate large-scale change in the library.</p>
<p>In <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0340035212473541">Table 1</xref> competences are listed that might help leaders as well as promoters to fulfil their tasks during change projects.</p>

<title>Critical success factors: information, communication, and participation</title>
<p>During change processes team members often ask three questions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0340035212473541">Vahs and Leiser, 2007</xref>):

<title>Information and communication</title>
<p>A change process may stall if there isn’t a regular and consistent exchange of clear and, for everyone, understandable information about the purpose as well as the change project’s strategies and benefits. This information should be given as accurately as known at the given time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0340035212473541">Smith, 2011</xref>). For this – depending on the phase of the change project – leaders should ask themselves the questions illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0340035212473541">Figure 1</xref>.</p>

<p>Communication – of vision, strategies and action – which is transparent, can open the door to an understanding and sharing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0340035212473541">Smith, 2011</xref>). 
</p>

<sec id="section7-0340035212473541">
<title>Participation</title>
<p>Participation should meet the requirements of the group, of the team members affected by a deliberate large-scale change, as well as satisfy the individual team member. For this a two-way-communication should be established, which enables, listens and responds to the team members’ communication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0340035212473541">Stewart, 1996</xref>).</p>
<p>Especially the questions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0340035212473541">Figure 1</xref>) asked in the second phase (‘Changing / Moving’) and in the third phase (‘Refreezing’) should be discussed with the members of staff involved in the change project and team members affected by the major change.</p>

<title>Leadership in libraries</title>
<p>Leadership in libraries has been analysed by a student of ‘Library and Information Science’ at the University of Applied Sciences Hamburg for her bachelor thesis. For this she accomplished four expert interviews with leaders of academic libraries to find out what characterizes their leadership style (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0340035212473541">Berke, 2012</xref>). 
</p>
<p>Three of the four interviewed leaders said of themselves that they prefer and use the cooperative leadership style; only one tends to a more authoritarian leadership style. Interesting is that this leader is the one who would prefer the implementation of Management by Objectives in the library as she thinks that this allows more participation. This shows that sometimes determining factors lead to a leadership style that isn’t truly the one wanted by the leaders themselves.</p>
<p>Those who lead in a more cooperative style see their team members as experts in their working fields and for this let them participate in decisions. Furthermore they delegate tasks to these team members independent of their individual hierarchical status. They see themselves more as coordinators with many conceptual tasks. One said that the authoritarian leadership style is – especially for someone who is new in the position of leader of an already existing team – not enforceable, as he or she is confronted with a team that has been working together for a while and is thus very experienced. Another leader said that the authoritarian style may be needed by someone who didn't get a good education and training or if the parents didn't socialize this person during his childhood years in such a way that he is able to integrate himself in teams or participate in discussions and team working processes. But all in all there should be a liability in the leadership style to give the team members a certain degree of reliance.</p>
<p>All leaders want their team members to work independently. They use a lot of their working time for communication. One points out the importance of the personal dialogue with his team members instead of using mail for communication. Also this one gives everybody access to his online calendar so that his team members can calendar their appointments directly. With this his team members have a great influence on the organization of his daily routine as a leader.</p>
<p>Some leaders work together with their team members on a regular basis, for example at the information desk. This gives them the chance to talk to team members and to know what their tasks are.</p>
<p>Management by Objectives is only implemented in one of the examined libraries, although this is a participative method and three of the four leaders think that this is a reasonable management method, even if it is very time consuming.</p>
<p>In another research project for a dissertation – among others – the influence especially of the leadership style of the top management on the middle management as well as the team members was explored. For this a written survey was carried out with leaders and members of the staff of an academic library that participated directly or indirectly in the development of the library’s strategy or which were affected by the resulting measures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0340035212473541">Düren, 2009</xref>). 
</p>
<p>Transformational as well as transactional leadership (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0340035212473541">Table 2</xref> for detailed information about these leadership styles) of the top management has a positive influence on a trust-based organizational culture (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0340035212473541">Table 3</xref> for details of the trust-based organizational culture). And a trust-based organizational culture leads to a high own initiative and great flexibility of the middle management as well as the team members.</p>

<p>Transformational leadership, therefore, is suitable to handle major changes in libraries. Transactional leadership, which is based on contingent reward behavior, correlates with transformational leadership (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0340035212473541">Avolio, Bass and Jung (1999</xref>), which means that leaders should display both transformational and transactional leadership.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0340035212473541">
<title>Leadership during change processes</title>
<p>In this section some interesting findings of a research project at the University of Applied Sciences Hamburg about leadership aspects during the time of deliberate large-scale changes in libraries can be found (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0340035212473541">Düren, 2013</xref>). For this, expert interviews with middle management leaders of academic and public libraries, as well as change managers in libraries, have been accomplished.</p>
<p>The idea of this research project was to find out what leaders thought throughout their change projects, if they recognized and how they reacted to the anxieties, worries and fears of their team members, how they communicated during the change process and if they thought afterwards that they could or should have done anything better. This of course does not say if a change project was done well, but it shows that leaders nowadays are able to reflect on what they have done, that a lot of them did change their behaviour throughout a change process and that all of them had to cope with new leadership aspects.</p>
<p>How new aspects of leadership – as can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0340035212473541">Figure 2</xref> – can help to master a deliberate large-scale change in a library is shown in the following examples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0340035212473541">Düren, 2013</xref>):

<sec id="section10-0340035212473541">
<title>Leaders and their Vision</title>
<p>To introduce a deliberate large-scale change in a library, leaders should be able to discover trends and new challenges and act proactively instead of only reacting to changes and external pressure. They are in the role of innovators and forerunners.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0340035212473541">
<title>Leaders need to be reliable</title>
<p>During a merger of an academic library with an information service provider, the leaders working for the information service provider questioned the correctness of the evaluation results which had led to their integration in the academic library, and communicated this to their team members. At the same time, these leaders communicated to the director of the academic library their willingness to cooperate. All in all, the team members of the information service provider were given inconsistent information and decisions. This unclear and unreliable leadership resulted in unwillingness of the team members of the information service provider to work together with their leaders and stand behind them any longer. They told them this in one of their regular status meetings, which led to the leaders’ resignations.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0340035212473541">
<title>Leaders as change managers</title>
<p>Leaders should be change managers themselves and for this they need to know the different tools and methods of change management, such as the different phases of a change process, as well as the phases of the staff’s reaction to change<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0340035212473541">1</xref> </sup>and what this means for their leadership style. One leader recognized in the course of his change project a short intermediate phase of euphoria, which was followed by a deep valley of uncertainties, worries and anger, before the phase of acceptance followed, and had to deal with it.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-0340035212473541">
<title>Team members and others working in the library</title>
<p>Their anxieties need to be recognized and those who are directly affected by a deliberate large-scale change should be given a chance to participate in the change project.</p>
<p>One of the most important aspects for the success of a change project is the communication process. Leaders have to communicate much more than before to reduce their team members’ anxieties and concerns regarding the change project. This does not necessarily mean they need to change the communication tools, but they should raise the frequency of providing information. During one change project, a leader learned that some information needs to be given twice or even more times, and that it is essential to communicate the repeated information with the same enthusiasm and conviction as the first time.</p>
<p>The communication process includes the other managers of the library, especially the leader’s own superior. Here it is important to take the time to talk with them – even if the change project is running short of time. One leader has seen in retrospect that it would have been better to have a personal discussion with her superior regarding a very important issue, rather than just using the telephone, or – even worse – via e-mail.</p>
<p>Leaders interviewed for this research project in general emphasized how important it was to listen to what their team members had to say. In extreme situations that affect everybody of the team, such as deliberate large-scale changes, a leader cannot act single-handedly. For this there should always be a personal dialogue between the leader and his or her team members.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-0340035212473541">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Leaders in times of change need special competences to handle major changes in their library. They need not only to know and react to their users’ needs and wishes and to be able to anticipate the future of information services – and with this, of their library. Besides their potential to create a vision and a strategy for their library, leaders have to deal carefully with their team members’ anxieties. Change projects might raise concerns and fears with employees that need to be understood and taken care of.</p>
<p>For this, students of library and information sciences should be prepared for their (potential) future leadership role in leadership and management aspects as well as change management.</p>
<p>Top management as well as middle management leaders operating on the basis of the transformational leadership style – in combination with the transactional leadership style (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0340035212473541">Avolio, Bass and Jung, 1999</xref>) – in a trust-based organizational culture might be able to handle deliberate large-scale changes better than others, especially than those with a more authoritarian leadership style.</p>
<p>All in all, leaders should have a vision, be reliable, act as change managers, recognize their team members’ anxieties and give those team members and others working in the library who are directly affected by a deliberate large-scale change a chance to participate in the change project. Management by Objectives as a participative method can support the handling of major changes.</p>
<p>The most important aspect of leadership in times of change is to communicate with everybody as often as possible!</p>
<p>Further research should include the question of whether modern methods of communication, such as wikis, blogs or Twitter, can support the communication process. The research project at the University of Applied Sciences Hamburg about leadership aspects during the time of major changes in libraries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0340035212473541">Düren, 2013</xref>) did not show an interest in employing these modern communication tools. Also, it might be interesting to find out how leaders can be prepared to communicate better, and especially not only to inform their team members, but to install a communication process which includes a regular dialogue in change projects.</p>
