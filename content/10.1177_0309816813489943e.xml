<p>As one billion people struggle with chronic hunger amidst plenty, <italic>Agriculture and Food in Crisis</italic> is a timely and much needed book. Written for a general audience, the book develops a wide range of themes in relation to the 2008 food crisis, presented in relatively short chapters with very little jargon, which makes it a valuable asset for teaching assignments. The book contains 16 chapters divided into two equal parts (‘Understanding the Agrifood Crisis’ and ‘Resistance and Renewal’), plus an editorial introduction. The central argument of the book ‘is that ‘food for people, not for profit’ should be the underlying principle of a new agrifood system’ (p. 30).</p>
<p>Part I addresses the social, historical and political-economic roots of the crisis, and offers a critical and refreshing approach that shatters the explanatory sterility of the mainstream’s approach to the crisis as a ‘perfect storm’. Walden Bello, Mara Baviera and Philip McMichael set the tone, arguing that widespread socially-produced hunger and famine amidst plenty is endemic to capitalist modernity, and the outcome of long-term vulnerabilities in the countryside. Utsa Patnaik, Sophia Murphy and Deborah Fahy Bryceson offer powerful critiques of the neoliberal paradigm of free trade, which maintains that ‘food security’ is better served through export crops than through self-sufficiency in food grain production. By forcing developing countries to withdraw their support to ‘inefficient’ producers, tear down tariff walls and dismantle government-controlled food stocks and agricultural commodity reserves, the neoliberal food trade architecture has effectively transformed once self-sufficient countries and regions into net importers of food, while creating the basis for mass urbanisation, poverty and undernourishment.</p>
<p>Brian Tokar documents the extent to which the 2008 spike in oil prices not only made explicit vulnerabilities in the countryside, but also triggered a ‘green rush’ towards bio fuel production. This further exacerbated the crisis by creating a strong incentive towards human rights abuses and the displacement of indigenous populations in order to convert lands, forests and grasslands for agro-fuel production. Moreover, the growing power, yielded by corporations and finance capital, over the agrifood system is not only giving way to an oligarchic structure controlling the space between farm and fork, as demonstrated by John Wilkinson, but is also the major vector driving land grabbing, particularly the new ‘scramble for Africa’. Indeed, the organisation GRAIN shows how this corporate version of the Green Revolution is increasingly linking the fragile financial security of households in advanced countries to the organised separation of peasants and communities from their means of subsistence.</p>
<p>April Howard’s study of peasants’ struggles against state-backed industrial farmers in the ‘soy republic’ of Paraguay, a hotbed of land eviction, human rights abuses and the beating and criminalisation of resistant farmers, foreshadows much of the discussions contained in Part II of the book. As Peter Rosset stresses, the fight for life and autonomy is most fundamentally a fight for land, which is the lynchpin of what La Vía Campesina calls ‘food sovereignty’, which not only implies a right to food and therefore a right to land and food production, but also a political will to short-circuit power relations in the market by giving priority to local food producers. State-led reforms in Venezuela are illustrative of this. As Christina Schiavoni and William Camacaro demonstrate, the re-appropriation of food production by local communities has allowed the country ‘to meet the first Millennium Development Goal of halving hunger and poverty ahead of the 2015 target and … cut malnutrition-related death in half from 1998 to 2006’ (p. 279).</p>
<p>Frederick Kirschenmann, David Pimentel and Miguel A. Altieri argue that because they manage fewer resources more intensively, small farms produce more food and a greater diversity than their industrial versions. Moreover, they offer built-in resilience against pests, diseases and climate change, more control over what is produced and consumed, and represent a shift away from both fuel-based chemicals and fuel-powered machinery. As Jules Pretty shows, the adoption of such practices on 286 projects in 57 countries involving 12.6 million farmers on 37 million hectares saw an average of 80 percent increase in crop yields. ‘When rural people eat more food and a greater diversity of food,’ Pretty aptly concludes, ‘it does not show up in international statistics that measure the commercial economy’ (p. 295). At the end, we come back full circle to where the book started, for what the concept of food sovereignty offers is a radical vision of human development and autonomy that denies the separation between production and reproduction through people’s control over their means of subsistence, most importantly the land.</p>
<p>Given the nature of the book, however, the absence of a sustained discussion of the problems associated with chronic hunger and undernourishment is perhaps the most curious omission, and too strong an emphasis on production runs the risk of deflecting attention away from the real subjects of the food crisis. Weight loss, muscle wasting, fatigue, dizziness, headaches and nausea are only few of the symptoms associated with hunger, and as the body slows both physical and mental activities in order to compensate for the lack of energy, the individual’s capacity to concentrate, participate, study and take the initiative are diminished. The effects of hunger are also irreversible when they occur in the first two years of life, causing cognitive impairments, poor health and lower educational achievements. Moreover, of the 850 million undernourished people in 2007, 60 per cent were women, and 146 million children under five were underweight in 2006 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0309816813489943">ECOSOC 2007</xref>: 8; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0309816813489943">UNICEF 2006</xref>). The absence of discussion on the feminisation of poverty and the gendered relations in the distribution of food tends to reinforce the view that hunger is essentially a crisis of production that can be dissociated from power relations, reproductive labour and social norms. Yet the latter have an important impact on how the agrifood crisis is understood and resisted.</p>
<p><italic>Agriculture and Food Crisis</italic> is likely to feed many conversations, since it offers a wide range of perspectives on pressing issues and concrete proposals for resistance and renewal. While the book leaves ample room to envision the foundation of a better society, it makes no mistake in pointing out that our collective will and struggle for a better world, as well as our revolutionary imagination and inspiration, must place agriculture and food production at the centre. While the ‘peasant’ is not an inherently political, anti-capitalist figure, as Eric Holt-Giménez notes, the book makes it clear that peasant agriculture is not, and never was, an archaic sector, and that any critical theory and progressive political project attempting to establish the real foundations to human development will have to engage with food politics.</p>
