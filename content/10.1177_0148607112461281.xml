<abstract>
<p><italic>Background</italic>: The incidence of obesity is rising, and an increasing number of obese patients are admitted to surgical intensive care units (SICUs). However, it is not clear whether obesity is an independent risk factor for increased morbidity and mortality in SICU patients. We examined the effect of obesity on morbidity and mortality in patients admitted to the SICU in this study. <italic>Method</italic>: We reviewed prospectively acquired SICU data in normal and obese patients with an SICU length of stay &gt;24 hours. Comparability of the groups was assessed using a χ<sup>2</sup> test or Fisher exact test, as appropriate, for categorical variables and analysis of variance (ANOVA) or the Kruskal-Wallis test, as appropriate, for continuous variables. <italic>Results</italic>: Of the 1792 consecutive patients evaluated, 711 had a normal body mass index (BMI), and 993 were either preobese or obese. There was no statistically significant difference across the 5 BMI groups with respect to any of the 3 comorbidity indices (Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation III [APACHE III], Simplified Acute Physiology Score, or Multiple Organ Dysfunction Score). There was no statistically significant difference in the intensive care unit (ICU) length of stay and hospital length of stay or time-to-ICU mortality (log-rank test <italic>P</italic> = .054) among the 5 BMI groups. A Cox regression analysis and backward elimination algorithm selected APACHE III to be the most important explanatory variable for survival time. <italic>Conclusion</italic>: Obesity does not affect the mortality of patients admitted to the SICU. We conclude that obesity cannot be used as an independent predictive mortality outcome variable in patients admitted to the SICU.</p>

<title>Clinical Relevancy Statement</title>
<p>Outcome studies of hospitalized obese patients have shown that obesity is associated with an increased risk of complications or death following trauma, orthopedic surgery, and possibly cardiovascular events and procedures. Results of observational studies in critically ill obese patients are less consistent, with some studies finding worse outcomes in obese intensive care unit (ICU) patients and others demonstrating no difference or even lower mortality. This study answers these questions. Obese patients have higher morbidity but no increased mortality in the ICU.</p>

<sec id="section2-0148607112461281" sec-type="intro">
<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The number of patients in the United States with obesity is rising at an alarming rate. Results from the 2007–2008 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) indicate that an estimated 34.2% of U.S. adults 20 years and older are overweight, 33.8% are obese, and 5.7% are extremely obese.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0148607112461281">1</xref></sup> Worldwide, the World Health Organization’s (WHO’s) latest factsheet shows that globally in 2005, approximately 1.6 billion adults (age 15+ years) were overweight and at least 400 million adults were obese. The WHO further projects that by 2015, approximately 2.3 billion adults will be overweight and more than 700 million will be obese.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0148607112461281">2</xref></sup> Annually, about 300,000 obesity-related deaths occur in the United States.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0148607112461281">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0148607112461281">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>Despite a better understanding of the metabolic, physiologic, and physical problems associated with obesity, overall, these patients have worse outcomes than their leaner counterparts.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0148607112461281">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0148607112461281">6</xref></sup> Often acute surgical problems in these patients are difficult to diagnose, and even when correctly diagnosed, the postoperative care of these patients even in the intensive care setting remains a major challenge.</p>
<p>Although the body of literature surrounding the impact of obesity on health continues to grow, only 1 study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0148607112461281">6</xref></sup> specifically examined the impact of obesity on surgical intensive care unit (SICU) patients, yet this group of patients constitutes a significant proportion of hospital admissions. The aims of this study are to examine the effect of obesity on morbidity and mortality in patients admitted to the SICU and to identify potential predictors of outcome in obese patients.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0148607112461281">
<title>Study Design</title>
<p>This is a retrospective, single-institution, observational study designed to assess the effect of body mass index (BMI) on the outcome of surgical patients admitted to a 12-bed intensive care unit (ICU) in a tertiary teaching hospital unit (Long Island Jewish Medical Center, New York). Data were accrued prospectively in all patients admitted to the SICU, and their BMI was recorded on admission to the unit. In accordance with the recommendation by the International Obesity Task Force of the World Health Organization (WHO) and adopted by the National Institutes of Health (NIH),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0148607112461281">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0148607112461281">2</xref></sup> we defined obesity based on BMI (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0148607112461281">Table 1</xref>). The protocol was approved by the institutional review board of the Long Island Jewish Medical Center.</p>

<title>Data Collection</title>
<p>Data collection on admission included demographic data, serum albumin, and comorbidities. Additional data recorded included indication for admission to the SICU, admission status (either elective or emergent), length of stay in the SICU, length of mechanical ventilation, failure to wean, associated ventilator-acquired pneumonia, invasive procedures and associated complications, line-related sepsis, Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation III (APACHE III) scores, Simplified Acute Physiology Score II (SAPS II), and outcomes. To estimate APACHE score, clinical and laboratory data required for the estimation were reported for worst entry obtained during the preceding 24 hours. All patients were followed until death or discharged from hospital. The degree of obesity was assessed by the BMI using the following formula: BMI = body weight (kg)/height<sup>2</sup> (m<sup>2</sup>). Exclusion criteria included SICU length of stay &lt;24 hours and a BMI &lt;18.5 kg/m<sup>2</sup>.</p>
<p>The Multiple Organ Dysfunction Score (MODS) was used daily to determine organ function/failure.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0148607112461281">7</xref></sup> Missing data in APACHE II and the MODS were assumed to be normal for scoring purposes.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0148607112461281">
<title>Statistical Methods</title>
<p>Patients were classified into 1 of the 5 possible BMI obesity groups:</p>
<list id="list1-0148607112461281" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Normal (BMI: 18.5 to &lt;25 kg/m<sup>2</sup>)</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Overweight (BMI: 25 to &lt;30 kg/m<sup>2</sup>)</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Obese I (BMI: 30 to &lt;35 kg/m<sup>2</sup>)</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Obese II (BMI: 35 to 40 kg/m<sup>2</sup>)</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Obese III (BMI: ≥40 kg/m<sup>2</sup>)</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Comparability of the 5 groups was assessed using either a χ<sup>2</sup> test or a Fisher exact test, as appropriate, for categorical variables (eg, sex, condition on admission) and analysis of variance (ANOVA) or the Kruskal-Wallis test, as appropriate, for continuous variables (eg, age, comorbidity index [APACHE II, APACHE III, SAPS, MODS]). The outcome variables investigated were ICU mortality, hospital mortality, ICU length of stay (time to discharge from the ICU), hospital length of stay (time to discharge from the hospital), need for ventilation, and ICU discharge status.</p>
<p>Time to death in the ICU was analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method. A Cox regression analysis was then carried out to analyze mortality among different groups. Continuous data are presented as mean ± SD and categorical as number (%), unless otherwise indicated. All statistics were 2-tailed, and a <italic>P</italic> value of &lt;.05 was considered statistically significant.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>During the study period, 1792 consecutive patients were admitted to the SICU, of whom 88 (4.91%) patients were considered “underweight” (ie, BMI &lt;18.5 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) and excluded from the study, leaving 1704 patients for main analysis. In our study population, 33 (1.8%) patients were African American, 57 (3.2%) Asian, 1487 (83.0%) white, and 215 (12.0%) Hispanic.</p>
<sec id="section7-0148607112461281">
<title>Prevalence of Obesity</title>
<p>Forty-two percent (711/1704) of the patients had “normal” BMI, whereas 58% (993/1704) were either preobese or obese. The patients with above-normal BMI were in the preobese (n = 593; 34.8%), obese I (n = 257; 15.1%), obese II (n = 84; 4.9%), and obese III (n = 59; 3.5%) groups.</p>
<p>Overall, 57% of the males and 59% of the females were obese (<italic>P</italic> = .28). Obesity (includes preobesity) was significantly more prevalent in patients younger than 65 years (<italic>P</italic> = .002). Of the 490 patients younger than 65 years, 314 (64%) were preobese or obese, compared with the 679 of 1214 (56%) aged 65 years and older. There were significantly more men in the obese III group than in the normal group (67.8% vs 48%; <italic>P</italic> = .0042).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In our study, 58% (993/1704) of patients admitted to the SICU were either preobese or obese. The patients with above-normal BMI were in the preobese group (n = 593; 34.8%), obese I group (n = 257; 15.1%), obese II group (n = 84; 4.9%), and obese III group (n = 59; 3.5%). This prevalence of obesity in surgical patients in our study is less than U.S. population rates, which may be affected by geographic location.</p>
<p>The recent increase in the percentage of obese people in the Western world is paralleled by the rise in the number of obese patients requiring care in the SICU. The physiologic changes associated with obesity may impair the ability to withstand the stress of critical illness, and particularly in surgical postoperative patients, the effects on cardiovascular and respiratory systems may translate into prolonged time on a ventilator or ICU survival. The relationship between obesity and a patient’s outcome in the ICU has been looked at by many researchers, particularly in medical patients, and all possible conclusions have been reached. Some studies have found obesity to be related to increased mortality and morbidity,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0148607112461281">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0148607112461281"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0148607112461281"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0148607112461281">10</xref></sup> whereas others showed either no association<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0148607112461281">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0148607112461281"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0148607112461281">13</xref></sup> or even decreased mortality and morbidity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0148607112461281">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>Interestingly, most of the studies have looked at the ICUs with patients admitted for medical illnesses, and the effect of obesity on the outcome of surgical patients admitted to SICUs is not well documented. Nasraway et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0148607112461281">6</xref></sup> analyzed 1373 critically ill surgical patients, of whom 6.8% were extremely obese, 19.8% were obese, and 29.7% were overweight, and found that the extremely obese patients (BMI &gt;40) in the subgroup of prolonged-stay patients had significantly increased ICU and hospital mortality rates. They concluded morbid obesity (BMI &gt;40 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) to be an independent risk factor for death in surgical patients.</p>
<p>Our study aims to examine the effect of obesity on outcome in the general surgical patients in the SICU. In our patient population, we did not find any statistically significant difference in mortality of obese patients in comparison to the patients with normal BMI. But our data reveal that the patients with a BMI higher than 40 had more days on mechanical ventilation and a trend toward increased mortality.</p>
<p>In a recent meta-analysis of 14 studies, Morohunfolu et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0148607112461281">15</xref></sup> found that obesity in critically ill patients is not associated with excess mortality but is significantly related to prolonged duration of mechanical ventilation and ICU length of stay.</p>
<p>We did find that patients with a higher BMI had a longer dependence on mechanical ventilation, but it was not statistically significant. The fact that patients older than 65 years were significantly less likely to require ventilatory support might be due to the lower prevalence of obesity in this age group.</p>
<p>Our findings suggest that BMI is not an independent predictor of mortality in the critically ill obese patients. Instead, we have found that SAPS and APACHE score are better predictors. In addition, there was a trend toward decreased ICU mortality in the obese group, which might suggest a protective role of obesity. Our finding supports the report by Ray and associates,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0148607112461281">10</xref></sup> who observed that an increased BMI is not associated with poorer outcomes after critical care.</p>
<p>The duration of ventilatory support increased progressively with increasing BMI; although not reaching a statistically significant value, it is important to mention because the morbidities associated with longer mechanical ventilation are potentially devastating.</p>
<p>Although the length of stay in the SICU tended to increase with increasing BMI, there was no statistically significant difference in the SICU length of stay and hospital length of stay among the 5 BMI groups, except the combined nonnormal BMI group having a statistically significant longer length of stay than the normal group. There are pitfalls of using BMI as proxy for “obesity,” but they are easily recordable and reproducible data that can be compared with other available literature; also, BMI may not reflect the true nutrition status of the patient, but other markers of nutrition such as serum albumin levels were also not significantly different in our study.</p>
<p>One limitation of our study is that the results of our study may apply only to other hospitals with a similar patient mix as our hospital (ie, the patient mix shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0148607112461281">Table 5</xref>). This may possibly exclude generalizability to specialty hospitals such as those specializing in orthopedics alone, or cardiac cases alone, since patient outcomes may differ according to the type of surgery performed. Thus, the results of our study may not apply to other hospitals with a different patient mix than our institution.</p>

<p>The prolonged requirement of mechanical ventilation and SICU length of stay of obese patients would eventually be translated into more resource utilization and would point toward significantly higher adjusted total costs, and this needs to be examined in future studies.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Mortality rates were not statistically significant among different obese groups when compared with the group with normal BMI. Therefore, we conclude that obesity does not affect the mortality of surgical patients. Obesity cannot be used as an independent predictive outcome variable in patients admitted to the SICU. The combined nonnormal BMI group had a statistically significant longer length of stay in the SICU in comparison to the normal group.</p>
