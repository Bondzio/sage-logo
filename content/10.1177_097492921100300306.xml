<p>A panel discussion on ‘Microfinance—A Panacea for Financial Inclusion?’ was held during the last session of the conference. The discussion was moderated by Shubhashis Gangopadhyay (India Development Foundation [IDF]) and the panellists were D.S.K. Rao, Regional Organiser for Asia Pacific Microcredit Summit Campaign, Mudit Kapoor, Assistant Professor, Indian School of Business (ISB), Vivek Kulkarni, formerly in the civil service and founder of MD Brickwork Ratings India Ltd, and Bappaditya Mukhopadhyay, Fellow, IDF.</p>
<p>The main points of the discussion included the evolution of the microfinance sector over the last 10 years and whether the sector can be a panacea for financial inclusion. All the speakers felt that the sector can be a panacea if the definition of the sector is broadened to include services other than just credit, such as financial literacy, health awareness, insurance, loans for agriculture, long-term loans, as well as to include sectors that provide similar services such as the chit fund sector. However, if the ambit of the sector is only microcredit, then it cannot serve as a panacea for financial inclusion.</p>
<sec id="section1-097492921100300306">
<title>Microfinance Sector and Its Growth</title>
<p>To begin with, the speakers discussed the functions of the microfinance institutions (MFIs) and their growth over the years. In terms of absolute numbers, there were about 3 million microfinance clients in 2005, which grew to 27 million clients by 2010. The outstanding portfolio of various MFIs increased more than 10 times during that period.</p>
<p>In terms of the financially excluded population, the Invest India Survey, 2007, shows that 52 per cent households do not have bank accounts, 61 per cent do not have life insurance, while 97 per cent households do not have any medical insurance. There are about 60,000 villages with population 2,000 and above with no banking facility. About 68 per cent of all borrowers borrow from non-institutional sources.</p>
<p>Given the extent of financial exclusion, self-help groups (SHGs) with their linkages to the banks serve as an option for poor households as an avenue for savings. The SHG–bank model involves groups of no more than 15 women who are expected to regularly save money. The banks lend money to one or two members in a 15-member group, especially to those who can demonstrate some good business proposals. The loans taken by the members are guaranteed by the entire group.</p>
<p>The MFIs, in contrast, give loans to all members in the group (instead of to only some members in the group as in the SHG model). This is called the joint liability model. Since the SHGs were already formed, it was easy for MFIs to form groups; they grew by almost 40 per cent to about 90 per cent. A lot of MFIs received money from private equity, including IFC Temesi (Government of Singapore), who pushed these MFIs for higher growth, which led to a huge concentration of lending such as that seen in Andhra Pradesh. This happened because there were many MFIs competing amongst themselves. People would then take money from one MFI to return the loans from another MFI, hoping to borrow later from some other MFI, and so on. The MFIs were set for failure because of this indiscriminate lending and focusing too much on growth. In fact, because of an overlap in lending, defaults started increasing.</p>
<p>Hence, one has to look at the incentive structure and regulation of this sector more carefully. At the same time, given the need of the unbanked population for services provided by MFIs and similar institutions, even if the bottom-most poor do not get these services, they should still be encouraged.</p>

<title>Microfinance as a Panacea for Financial Inclusion</title>
<p>The speakers felt that by broadening their definition to include other similar institutions, such as the chit fund sector, and by expanding their services (insurance, financial literacy, etc.), MFIs can help achieve financial inclusion. Note that MFIs are often active where banks do not operate. So, if these institutions can provide services similar to banks, then the unbanked population can avail of these services. People with no access to banks are, usually, among the poorer sections of the population and mostly, in the informal or unorganised sector. So, even if the MFIs do not cover the bottom-most poor, they do cover a large part of the economically disadvantaged groups.</p>
<p>All panellists felt that an essential aspect was financial literacy among the poor. A simple study of people who borrow from MFIs revealed that not many people were able to calculate the effective interest rate on the loans they have. So, very often, they ended up with loans they would not have taken if they knew the true economic cost.</p>
<p>It was in this context that the speakers felt that MFIs need to provide many more services than just credit if they have to make a mark. They should consider not just short-term loans but also longer-term ones. They should also consider introducing loans to the agricultural sector and not just for consumption and small businesses. To broaden its scope, the MFIs should also include other similar institutions such as the chit fund industry as it provides loans to low-income households and is regulated by the government. If one includes traders’ credit that provides micro-finance, moneylenders that provide small token loans and chit fund operators, one can see that they cover at least 70–80 per cent of the population, which is already been provided with microfinance services. And, making their clients more financially literate will make the job easier for the MFIs more targeted towards the poor.</p>
<p>The chit fund industry is important since it is a financial intermediary that provides finances the formal banking sector does not provide. The unorganised business sector is thought to be credit constrained and not to have access to financial services. However, a survey of the unorganised manufacturing sector revealed that the sector is growing and employing people, and has access to the chit fund industry, which is a major source of finance for this sector. In five states that were under study for chit funds and their members, the amount of money that was circulated by registered chit fund industry was roughly to the tune of INR 17,000–20,000 crore in 2006. This industry has grown at around 10–15 per cent. It has now approximately grown to INR 30,000–35,000 crore.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The discussion ended with the conclusion that ‘one should work towards an enabling system such that if the poor want to get out of poverty the society does not stand in its way’.</p>
