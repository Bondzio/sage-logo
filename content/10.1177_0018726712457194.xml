<p>This article assesses the extent to which the foreign-controlled subsidiaries of multinational firms have the discretion to establish their employment relations policies. Drawing on a survey of the activities of foreign-controlled multinational companies in Canada, it considers three lines of analysis: the parent company’s country of origin, the subsidiary’s specific organizational capabilities and its position in global value chains. While our results confirm that US-controlled subsidiaries have lower discretion than those from continental Europe and Asia, they also highlight the need to go beyond country-of-origin analysis. Organizational capabilities and the subsidiary’s role in global value chains are also important predictors of subsidiary discretion on employment relations policy.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Are the subsidiaries of multinational companies (MNCs) simple organizational replicas, following a grand business plan developed and monitored by their headquarters? Or are they active decision-makers, taking part in the economic and social life of their host country, drawing on its policies, resources and institutions, and able to exercise relative discretion in various policies and practices? As noted by Almond and Ferner, the general problem of headquarters’ control and subsidiary autonomy remains ‘one of the most complex issues in the management of employment relations in multinationals’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0018726712457194">2006</xref>: 197).</p>
<p>Too often, there is a tendency in the literature to treat MNCs as a ‘black box’; whereas ‘what goes on inside the firm matters a lot’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0018726712457194">Coe et al., 2008</xref>: 277). The interpretative lens of the varieties of capitalism literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0018726712457194">Hall and Soskice, 2001</xref>) is a case in point because MNCs are frequently portrayed as monoliths, their practices attributed to the logic of home or host national business systems. Recent studies enlarge the focus to local actor strategies and to the micro-political dynamics of subsidiary discretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0018726712457194">Dörrenbächer and Geppert, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0018726712457194">Morgan and Kristensen, 2006</xref>). Institutions continue to matter but so, too, do micro-politics. The challenge therefore is to understand how these different types of determinants combine to explain relative degrees of subsidiary discretion. This appears all the more important as subsidiaries seek to craft a role within the increasingly complex and highly differentiated value chains of their parent corporations.</p>
<p>Canada provides an interesting case because dependence on foreign-controlled corporations, primarily US capital, is a matter of policy and practical concern. The policies of MNCs in Canada cannot be understood without considering the structuring influence of US capitalism, but other forces are also at play.</p>
<p>Drawing on a survey of the activities of MNCs in Canada, this article explores the factors that shape the extent to which foreign-controlled subsidiaries of multinational companies have the discretion to establish their employment relations policies (ERP). It bridges what are often seen as distinct dividing lines in research on MNCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0018726712457194">Collinson and Morgan, 2009</xref>) and integrate country-of-origin, subsidiary capabilities and global value chain effects in a single framework.</p>

<title>In the Elephant’s shadow: Subsidiary discretion in Canada</title>
<p>In the study of control over decision-making within multinationals, it is useful to establish an analytical distinction between the latitude granted to foreign multinationals, considering the institutional features of a given host country, and the discretion that different MNCs will actually allow their subsidiaries in this country. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0018726712457194">Gooderham et al. (2006</xref>: 1507) introduce the notion of ‘institutional latitude’ to analyse how different institutional settings in Europe and Australia influence the implementation of HRM practices within firms of US origin. This refers to the institutional traits that characterize a given host country. It is understood that every single multinational still has to develop means to take more or less advantage of this latitude, hence allowing more or less discretion to subsidiaries.</p>
<p>Two features characterize the Canadian case. First, the Canadian economy is very open and of modest size. As noted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0018726712457194">Krahn et al. (2011</xref>: 11), in comparison with Britain and the United States, Canada’s industrialization occurred later and was shaped by immigration and dependency upon resource industries. This context led to the creation of Canadian ‘branch plants’ of US and British firms under the tariff protections of the National Policy in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Hence, not only did the activities of multinational companies make Canada one of the most open economies in the globe but they have been a vector of its development. Second, the public policies and institutional regulations set by the governments have been of neo-liberal orientation, particularly over the last decade. Canada is seen to facilitate foreign investment and the operations of multinationals.</p>
<p>This relatively high degree of institutional latitude in Canada is substantiated by social research. The ‘varieties of capitalism’ (VOC) approach developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0018726712457194">Hall and Soskice (2001)</xref> contrasts the institutional arrangements of two different types of national business system: liberal market, such as the US, the United Kingdom and Canada; and coordinated market, such as continental Europe (Austria, Germany and the Nordic countries). On a VOC scale, there would appear to be little difference between Canada and the United States. According to an index of the extent of labour relations coordination developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0018726712457194">Hall and Gingerich (2009</xref>: 458), where the US is the archetype of liberal market economies with a score of 0 and Austria the archetype of coordinated market economies with a score of 1, Canada and New Zealand are the second most proximate cases to the US (scoring .09), preceded only by the United Kingdom (.04). A different approach contrasts traditions of common and civil law regulation of company law (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0018726712457194">La Porta et al., 1998</xref>) to assess how these traditions of legal regulation are manifested in employment law, collective labour relations law and social security provisions in different countries. According to the index developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0018726712457194">Botero et al. (2004)</xref>, Canada and the US are proximate cases. On a 0−1 scale measuring employment law, the scores of common law traditions, such as Canada (.26) and the US (.21), contrast markedly with that of a civil law tradition such as Germany (.70). In terms of collective labour relations, Canada (.19) and the US (.25) are very alike, in contrast with Germany (.60).</p>
<p>The major neo-liberal barometers of competitiveness offer similar conclusions. The <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0018726712457194">World Bank’s (2012)</xref> ‘ease of doing business’ report ranks Canada 13th out of 183 countries in its overall measure of ‘the regulations that enhance business activity and those that constrain it’. Similarly, in its decidedly business-friendly take on labour market ‘efficiency’ (defined as ‘the flexibility to shift workers from one economic activity to another, rapidly and at low cost, and to allow for wage fluctuations without much social disruption’), the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0018726712457194">World Economic Forum (2011</xref>: 7, 20) ranks Canada fifth out of 142 countries.</p>
<p>This ‘special relationship’ between Canada and the United States, the archetype of the liberal market economy, can only be understood in the light of Canada’s geopolitical location and its deep integration within, and dependency upon, the world dominant economy. This is likely to exert limiting effects on discretion in employment relations policy.</p>
<p>First, relative discretion within the subsidiaries of MNCs in Canada cannot be divorced from a political economy of relative dependency. These two economies are closely integrated, but their relationship is rather asymmetric. As measured in 2010, more than half (54.5%) of the stock of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) in Canada originated from the US and 70.3 per cent of exports and 61.6 per cent of imports were with the US (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0018726712457194">Foreign Affairs and International Trade Canada, 2011</xref>: 36, 75). Although Canada is the US’s largest trading partner, the year-on-year trade statistics indicate that 19 per cent of US exports and 14.9 per cent of US imports are with Canada (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0018726712457194">US Census Bureau, 2011a</xref>). Only 9 per cent of the stock of FDI in the US in 2008 originated from Canada (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0018726712457194">US Census Bureau, 2011b</xref>). Moreover, not only does one country (Canada) depend more on the other (the US) but the US is seen to be dominant at an international level. This translates into what have been labelled dominance effects, namely the convergence of MNC subsidiary practices from a variety of home countries to the standards set by the main purveyor of global best practice, in that case the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0018726712457194">Smith, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0018726712457194">Smith and Meiksins, 1995</xref>).</p>
<p>Second, the integration of these two economies is reflected to some extent in corporate structures. The role of MNC subsidiaries in Canada, and US subsidiaries in particular, was linked historically to national tariff protections. This path dependency created a set of Canadian subsidiaries with particular competencies to serve the Canadian market but likely to be impacted strongly by the dismantling of these tariff protections under successive free-trade treaties. The gradual decrease in multilateral tariffs was encapsulated regionally in successive free-trade agreements between Canada and the US (1988) and between the three partners of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) (1994). Irrespective of the legal shells that such subsidiaries occupy (i.e. that they continue to exist for purposes of legal incorporation), the ‘hollowing out’ thesis advanced by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0018726712457194">Arthurs (2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0018726712457194">2009</xref>) points to a gradual erosion of policy autonomy and even cultural specificity in the Canadian operations of US MNC subsidiaries.</p>
<p>Third, besides economic dependency, geographical proximity effects are also at play in the relationship between Canadian subsidiaries and their US parent companies. This dimension of economic activity is particularly well documented in the cases of ‘cross-border regions’, such as the Windsor−Detroit corridor for the automobile industry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0018726712457194">Rutherford and Holmes, 2012</xref>) or the border of British Columbia for the forest products industry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0018726712457194">Sweeney, 2010</xref>). More generally, in the literature on multinationals, ‘geographic distance’ is seen as a major factor in shaping the firms’ strategies and decisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0018726712457194">Rugman and Oh, 2012</xref>: 2−6). Rugman and D’Cruz argue that, considering economic integration and geographical proximity, managers of Canadian operations should see the markets of both the United States and Canada as a stepping stone to a broader stage ‘in the development of globally competitive Canadian business’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0018726712457194">1993</xref>: 29). Their analysis applies to the operations of both Canadian and US-based corporations. In particular, given the strategic importance of their Canadian operations, they argue that ‘U.S. multinationals need to take vigorous measures to make these businesses globally competitive’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0018726712457194">Rugman and D’Cruz, 1993</xref>: 35). This dynamic is likely to influence the ways US MNCs deal with their Canadian operations. Consistent with the transaction costs economic approach that Rugman and colleagues applied to multinationals (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0018726712457194">Rugman and Verbeke, 2005</xref>), US MNCs are likely to exert more control over ERP in Canadian subsidiaries, while companies that are more distant geographically and not entangled into this regional dynamic may find it more convenient not to engage with the details of subsidiary employment relations policy, in a context in which they are not familiar. Regional economic integration arguably further exacerbates these geographical proximity effects. The variety of adjustments taking place in this context, ranging from subsidiary closures to diminished or enhanced regional product mandates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0018726712457194">Rugman et al., 2011</xref>), highlights how the autonomy of Canadian subsidiaries is at play.</p>
<p>Canadian subsidiaries of MNCs therefore offer an interesting case study of the interplay between institutional and organizational dynamics, and a particularly interesting geographical perspective on US MNC subsidiaries. MNCs of US origin may be more likely to exploit the institutional latitude discussed above in order to limit the discretion of their subsidiaries located in Canada. Given the weight of the proximate political economy that is the US, the exploration of MNC subsidiaries in Canada offers the possibility of going beyond first-order institutional attribution to consider how the different forces at play might contribute to a fuller understanding of the extent and nature of discretion in MNC subsidiaries.</p>

<title>The country-of-origin thesis</title>
<p>Country of origin refers to the characteristics of the institutions and business system of the country from which the MNC emerged, and which may shape its structures, policies and behaviour in host countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0018726712457194">Almond, 2011a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0018726712457194">Ferner, 1997</xref>). Although MNCs interact with host country institutions in different ways, recent empirical research, based on field research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0018726712457194">Almond and Ferner, 2006</xref>) and survey data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0018726712457194">Fenton-O’Creevy et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0018726712457194">Ferner et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0018726712457194">Gooderham et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0018726712457194">Pudelko and Harzing, 2007</xref>), consistently indicates that the country of origin remains a significant factor in shaping multinational practices worldwide.</p>
<p>For some years, studies of MNCs have tested the general proposition that multinationals of US origin exert more control over decision-making in foreign subsidiaries than those from other origins. Case studies of US MNCs operating in four European countries confirm that, irrespective of variations in headquarters’ influence across host countries, ‘for American MNCs at least, embeddedness in the country of origin continues to matter’ and that US MNCs operate in a ‘relatively centralized manner’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0018726712457194">Almond and Ferner, 2006</xref>: 272−273; also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0018726712457194">Ferner et al., 2004</xref>). Survey evidence now offers more empirical support for this proposition, with particular reference to human resource management. In particular, the findings of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0018726712457194">Gooderham et al. (2006</xref>: 1507) show that US MNCs ‘attempt to take with them and apply their own, nationally idiosyncratic, repertoire of HRM practices to their subsidiaries in foreign countries’. And the survey findings presented by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0018726712457194">Ferner et al. (2011)</xref> support the hypothesis that the UK subsidiaries of US firms have less discretion over HR policy than those from other countries of origin. While some studies seek to compare the extent of control by US MNCs in host countries associated with liberal market economies (LME) or coordinated market economies (CME) (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0018726712457194">Farndale et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0018726712457194">Fenton-O’Creevy et al., 2008</xref>), this remains an open empirical issue that our study of a single host country cannot help resolve.</p>
<p>The overwhelming tilt of the literature certainly points towards reduced discretion in, and greater control of the subsidiaries of US MNCs. This is consistent with the historical development of the US business system, including in the field of human resource management (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0018726712457194">Jacoby, 2005</xref>). As we argued above, this tendency of controlling subsidiaries more closely may be particularly acute in Canada. Considering the asymmetric relationship within the highly integrated economies of these close neighbours, our first hypothesis is that US MNCs are more likely to take advantage of the institutional latitude found in Canada than firms from other origins:<disp-quote>
<p><italic>Hypothesis 1</italic>: ERP discretion will be lower in US-based subsidiaries in comparison with those from other countries.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0018726712457194">
<title>Organizational capabilities</title>
<p>Two recent collective works have taken stock of the progress realized in the study of MNCs as socio-political organizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0018726712457194">Collinson and Morgan, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0018726712457194">Dörrenbächer and Geppert, 2011</xref>). These political processes have been studied at different levels, with particular attention to relations between headquarters and subsidiaries. Our article contributes to this research agenda.</p>
<p>Organizational capabilities are seen to be a key pillar for subsidiaries to gain space for decision-making within the MNC. Birkinshaw shows how ‘valuable capabilities are built at multiple levels inside the firm and in the firm’s external network of relationships’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0018726712457194">2000</xref>: 5). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0018726712457194">Bouquet and Birkinshaw (2008)</xref> elaborate a framework for understanding how subsidiaries, conceptualized as ‘low-power actors’, may gain influence by going beyond deference and by making sure their compliance is not taken for granted. From the viewpoint of the subsidiary, they contrast corporate embeddedness with external embeddedness, i.e. the density of relations with outside stakeholders. Similarly, in their exploration of micro-political resistance and cognitive hurdles in the transfer of knowledge-based practices across multiple units of MNCs, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0018726712457194">Fenton-O’Creevy et al. (2011</xref>: 132) highlight the importance of ‘the skilled agency of individuals in bridging roles’.</p>
<p>For <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0018726712457194">Kristensen and Zeitlin (2005</xref>: 171), ‘the successful pursuit of positional strategies by local players’ depends on the development of a capacity for collaborative action at three complementary levels: the MNC, the local economy and the site. Albeit developed from different perspectives, both the models of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0018726712457194">Kristensen and Zeitlin (2005)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0018726712457194">Bouquet and Birkinshaw (2008)</xref> present these various dimensions of organizational capabilities as a positive-sum, as mutually reinforcing processes for gaining subsidiary influence and autonomy.</p>
<p>However, recent literature suggests there may be tensions between these political forces and indicates further lines of analysis that we are able to test empirically. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0018726712457194">Meyer et al. (2011)</xref> conceptualize the complex interdependencies between the various constituents of the multinational as a form of ‘multiple embeddedness’. At the level of the corporation, the firm has to devise structures and organizational networks to interact with a large number of subsidiaries located in different host contexts, seeking to coordinate efficiently. At the level of the subsidiary, the challenge of multiple embeddedness consists in ‘balancing the forces’ that require both an adjustment to the local environment and some integration within the larger corporation. Hence, ‘subsidiaries must be “externally embedded” within each local context while also being sufficiently “internally embedded” within the MNE network’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0018726712457194">Meyer et al., 2011</xref>: 236). Rather than presenting the competing forces at play as adjusting naturally or in a systemic fashion, Meyer et al. rightly conceive such ‘dual embeddedness’ on the part of the subsidiary as a ‘delicate balancing act’ leading to unsolved challenges and ‘trade-offs between external and internal embedddedness’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0018726712457194">2011</xref>: 237, 245).</p>
<p>For <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0018726712457194">Morgan and Kristensen (2006)</xref>, these strategic choices characterize micro-politics within MNCs. As they point out, the best strategy for subsidiaries to gain and to preserve autonomy and influence is not necessarily to be good followers of headquarters’ decisions. They contrast ‘Boy Scout subsidiaries’, who ‘follow the demands of the head office and do not seek to develop or go beyond their existing mandates’, and ‘subversive strategists’, who ‘are likely to be led by local managers deeply embedded in local networks and unwilling to capitulate to head office demands that may undermine these local networks’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0018726712457194">2006</xref>: 1479−1480).</p>
<p>The literature points to the difficulty of achieving both internal and external embeddedness, as ‘increased embeddedness in the MNE corporate network may be detrimental to its position within the host country milieu, and its positioning within social networks’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0018726712457194">Meyer et al., 2011</xref>: 245). This is also the rationale of the distinction between ‘Boy Scout’ subsidiaries and ‘subversive strategists’ who ‘may treat the MNC as just one arena of many in which they participate’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0018726712457194">Morgan and Kristensen, 2006</xref>: 1480). In short, centrality may come at a price for subsidiary policy discretion. It is therefore expected that high embeddedness within the MNC will reduce, in time, subsidiary discretion.</p>
<p>In contrast, embeddedness within the local economy can enhance subsidiary autonomy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0018726712457194">Almond, 2011b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0018726712457194">Bélanger et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0018726712457194">Kristensen and Zeitlin, 2005</xref>). In exploring the inherent tensions between the strategic role assigned to a subsidiary by its parent company and its role within a local network of relationships with customers, suppliers and other business partners, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0018726712457194">Johanson et al. (1996)</xref> found that greater dependence on local business networks, as opposed to the MNC, reduced HQ control over the subsidiary. Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0018726712457194">Kristensen and Zeitlin (2005)</xref> explored how a Danish subsidiary was able to use its long-established connections with local economic agents and institutions to reinforce its leverage with corporate headquarters. It is therefore expected that subsidiaries that have stronger embedding capabilities within the local economy, as opposed to within the parent company, are likely to manifest greater ERP discretion:<disp-quote>
<p><italic>Hypothesis 2</italic>: Discretion on ERP will be higher in subsidiaries that are more strongly embedded in local economy networks and more weakly embedded in their parent MNC networks.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In their study of initiative-taking of subsidiaries of German MNCs in France, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0018726712457194">Dörrenbächer and Geppert (2009)</xref> focus on the development of subsidiary-specific capabilities. Dörrenbächer and Gammelgaard further highlight the role of key foreign subsidiary managers and what they label ‘micro-political bargaining power’, which is mainly based on two factors, namely ‘information retrieval from headquarters and […] the ability to leverage such information in issue selling or conflict handling processes’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0018726712457194">2011</xref>: 40−41). Ling et al. define issue-selling within multinationals as ‘the discretionary behaviour used to direct top management’s attention toward, or increase their understanding of, strategic issues’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0018726712457194">2005</xref>: 638). This selling of the subsidiary role concerns not only MNC managers but also other ‘local players’, notably the subsidiary workforce whose collaboration might well be paramount to the presentation of subsidiary specificity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0018726712457194">Kristensen and Zeitlin, 2005</xref>). With particular relevance to employment relations, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0018726712457194">Edwards and Bélanger (2009)</xref> envisage the MNC as a ‘contested terrain’ between various political agents and loci of power, not least at the point of production, where labour cooperation has to be negotiated in some way. Internal management capabilities have to do with the mediation of these competing interests at the subsidiary level and their representation within the corporate structure. This leads to a third hypothesis:<disp-quote>

<title>Global value chains</title>
<p>The notion of global value chain locates what MNC subsidiaries do in the context of the evolving spatial logic of their parent companies that concentrate different sets of activities in particular countries and regions of the world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0018726712457194">Gereffi et al., 2005</xref>). The related concept of global production networks is defined by Coe et al. as ‘one whose interconnected nodes and links extend spatially across national boundaries and, in so doing, integrates parts of disparate national and subnational territories’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0018726712457194">2008</xref>: 274). The activities of the subsidiaries studied here are increasingly integrated into these global production networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0018726712457194">Coe et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0018726712457194">Herrigel and Zeitlin, 2010</xref>). The key intuition of these approaches, which we use interchangeably for the purposes of this study (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0018726712457194">Bair, 2008</xref>), is that the analysis of MNC subsidiary discretion must take account of the types of activities particular firms do in one country or region as opposed to another and of the resources on which they can draw in order to do so. Our objective is therefore to consider the position of the subsidiary operations in the global value chain/production network and to assess how these features influence subsidiary discretion on employment relations policy. As there has been little empirical research, we draw on related studies to consider two aspects of subsidiary position in global value chains: the type of activities undertaken by the subsidiary and the quality of resources that it can mobilize.</p>
<p>As suggested by an OECD report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0018726712457194">2007</xref>), the challenge for both industrializing and industrialized economies is to ‘move up the value chain’. This concerns the scope of subsidiary activities. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0018726712457194">Barner-Rasmussen and Björkman (2005)</xref> found that the scope of activities (ranging from manufacturing to marketing and sales, to services and to R&amp;D) is significantly related to the intensity of communications between subsidiaries. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0018726712457194">Björkman et al. (2004</xref>: 450) also found a similar positive relationship on the extent of knowledge transfer from the subsidiary to the broader corporation. MNC subsidiaries can be seen here as mandate maximizers, seeking to expand the scope of their activities within their MNC’s value chain. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0018726712457194">Pilat et al. (2006)</xref> identify the importance of the link between manufacturing and R&amp;D as a source of innovation and added value. In their study of the autoparts industry in southern Ontario, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0018726712457194">Rutherford and Holmes (2008)</xref> highlight how financial pressures working their way through global auto production networks were pushing manufacturing offshore and thereby decoupling a crucial link between manufacturing and R&amp;D. This leads to a fourth hypothesis:<disp-quote>
<p><italic>Hypothesis 4</italic>: Discretion on ERP will be higher in subsidiaries that undertake a wider range of value-added activities.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>While much policy attention has shifted to how MNCs leverage the resources of regions, most often in competition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0018726712457194">Christopherson and Clark, 2007</xref>), the quality of its local resources are also likely to impact subsidiary discretion. Hence, in his model on ‘sub-national embeddedness’, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0018726712457194">Almond (2011b)</xref> pays particular attention to the skills and knowledge available in the local community. Case studies of the loss of subsidiary mandates also point to the inadequacy of subsidiary resources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0018726712457194">Birkinshaw, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0018726712457194">Dörrenbächer and Gammelgaard, 2010</xref>). In their overview of strategies available to low-power subsidiaries seeking to enhance their leverage within MNCs, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0018726712457194">Bouquet and Birkinshaw (2008</xref>: 487) contrast low-power subsidiaries, such as marketing satellites or rationalized manufacturers that are characterized by weak external links, with subsidiaries that have stronger external links ranging from local innovators to centres of excellence. Our final hypothesis posits a positive link between subsidiary discretion and the quality of its local resources:<disp-quote>
<p><italic>Hypothesis 5</italic>: Discretion on ERP will be higher in subsidiaries that are characterized by a high quality of local resources.</p>

<title>Research method</title>
<p>This article draws upon data collected in a study of MNCs operating in Canada. This involved three stages. First, in tandem with a UK team, we developed a questionnaire that served as a model for international comparison. In addition to a common core of questions, and in contrast to much of the literature do date, the Canadian survey also sought to explore the location of MNC subsidiaries within global value chains and to assess the range and nature of their organizational capabilities. The questionnaire was designed for the most senior HR manager, i.e. the person ultimately responsible for the management of all the firm’s employees in Canada.</p>
<p>Second, each national survey population includes all domestic- and foreign-controlled MNCs having at least 500 employees worldwide, with a minimum of 100 employees in the host country and a minimum of 100 employees in other countries. From a wide variety of sources (Dun &amp; Bradstreet and other company rankings and case-by-case verification through internet searches) we identified a population of 1398 MNCs with activities in Canada that match these criteria. We also validated this population and identified potential respondents through a telephone survey.</p>
<p>Third, a paper copy of the Canadian questionnaire was sent by mail to every company in our database, but respondents were also offered the possibility to complete an electronic version through a dedicated web site. By January 2007, we received 208 completed and valid questionnaires, for a 15 per cent response rate on what was a highly demanding questionnaire targeting a very time-challenged group of respondents. Of this total, 164 respondents are from foreign-controlled and 44 from Canadian-controlled companies. Of the 208 valid responses, 54.8 per cent were completed electronically and 45.2 per cent by mail. The method of response did not reveal any significant differences by major control variables such as country of origin, size, sector, respondents’ profile etc. When we compare the main characteristics of our survey respondents to the population of MNCs in Canada, with the exception of a slight under-representation of the service sector, our data provide a good representation of the major characteristics of the population as a whole (including country of origin and size). This article draws exclusively on the data from foreign-controlled MNCs (<italic>n</italic> = 164).</p>
<p>Two features highlight the originality of this dataset. First our survey targeted a key interlocutor able to provide insight into the subsidiary−corporate interface. In fact, 76.4 per cent of respondents indicated that they were the most senior person responsible for human resources and employment relations issues in Canada. Just under half of the respondents (48.2%) reported directly to the CEO in Canada and a similar percentage (47.4%) indicated that they report to an HR manager outside of Canada who spends the majority of his or her time on HR matters.</p>
<p>Second, our survey integrates multiple lines of analysis (country of origin, organizational capabilities, position in global value chains) and rests on a rich data set. Variables are measured through questions about basic features of the organization and of employment relations policies.</p>
<p>Our aim to generate a representative sample of MNCs operating in Canada was clearly facilitated by a single respondent method, which is no doubt why so many studies adopt this approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0018726712457194">Farndale et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0018726712457194">Ferner et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0018726712457194">Gooderham et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0018726712457194">Parry et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0018726712457194">Pudelko and Harzing, 2007</xref>), but this also presents potential problems. Following the recommendations of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0018726712457194">Chang et al. (2010)</xref>, we applied a number of ex ante remedies to limit this risk.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0018726712457194">1</xref></sup></p>

<title>Discretion</title>
<p>Subsidiary discretion was measured in 12 ERP areas on a five-point scale with three anchor points: 1) No discretion: The Canadian operations must implement policy set by a higher organizational level; 3) Some discretion: The Canadian operations can develop policy within the guidelines/framework set by a higher level; and 5) Full discretion: The Canadian operations can set their own policy. The overall average for the 12 items was 40.9 on a 60-point scale (3.41 on the scale from 1 to 5), suggesting that Canadian subsidiaries have some discretion. The standard deviation of 10.7 indicates that there is much variation between subsidiaries. Roughly 30 per cent of the respondents report a high level of discretion over ERP (scoring an average of 4 or higher on the five-point scale), while another third indicate a low level of discretion (scoring an average of less than 3 on the five-point scale).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0018726712457194">
<title>Country of origin</title>
<p>Of the 164 foreign-controlled MNCs that participated in our study, 65 per cent are headquartered in the USA, 9.2 per cent in the United Kingdom or Australia, 17.8 per cent in Continental Europe and 8.0 per cent in either Japan or South Korea.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0018726712457194">
<title>Organizational capabilities</title>
<p>We make a distinction between two sets of capabilities: embeddedness within the MNC and the local economy, and internal management capabilities. Embedding capabilities within the MNC are measured by the frequency of contact between HR managers in the Canadian subsidiary and those in the rest of the worldwide company. Embedding capabilities within the local economy concern the participation of the subsidiary (its Canadian operations) in local industry forums to discuss labour market issues and in the activities of local industry employer associations. While a strong proportion of subsidiary HR managers participate at least on a yearly basis in regular meetings (57%), international conferences (39%), task forces (44%) or conference calls (61%), there is much variation across our sample on the frequency of these contacts and on participation in industry forum and employer associations.</p>
<p>We distinguish four configurations of these embedding capabilities: weak embedding capabilities within the MNC and the local economy (35.2%); strong embedding capabilities within the MNC and the local economy (22.2%); weak embedding capabilities within the MNC but strong in the local economy (18.5%); and strong embedding capabilities within the MNC but weak in the local economy (24.1%).</p>
<p>Internal management capabilities are measured by an assessment of the extent to which the three following factors contribute to the development of the Canadian subsidiary within its parent MNC: the ability of senior managers to ‘make the case’ for the Canadian operations within the multinational, the capacity of the Canadian operations to innovate in the development of goods, services or processes, and the quality of the labour relations climate. While managers have a tendency towards a positive evaluation of these internal capabilities, there is variation across our sample on this measure (mean 7.67 on a scale of 0−12 with a standard deviation of 2.20).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0018726712457194">
<title>Value-chain variables</title>
<p>Our survey offers insights into the role played by subsidiaries within their parent company’s global value chain. The types of activities performed in the Canadian subsidiary are assessed by the role of R&amp;D. We distinguish subsidiaries engaged in both manufacturing and R&amp;D (43%), those involved in R&amp;D without manufacturing (9.6%) and those that do not engage in R&amp;D (47%). The quality of local resources is measured by the availability and quality of local suppliers and by the concentration of special competencies and skills in the subsidiary. Half of the respondents consider that they have access to the set of skills and competencies they need, while 42 per cent make the same assessment regarding the quality of suppliers. Twenty-five per cent of the respondents estimate that they have access to both the special skills and the quality of suppliers that could help in obtaining new investment and mandates for the subsidiary.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-0018726712457194">
<title>Control variables</title>
<p>A first set of control variables relates to the size and the age of the subsidiary. As suggested by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0018726712457194">Ferner et al. (2011)</xref>, while there is support for the use of these variables in the literature, their implications for discretion are somewhat ambiguous.</p>
<p>A second set of control variables concerns corporate control mechanisms. We need to stress the distinction between on the one hand our dependent variable, which is relative discretion as experienced by subsidiary managers, and on the other control mechanisms actually deployed by the MNC. We take account of three types of control mechanisms. The first concerns the extent of monitoring by higher levels of management outside Canada, on the assumption that benchmarking represents a form of indirect control by the headquarters. Across our sample, the monitoring of management career progression (59%) and of employee attitude and satisfaction (46%) is quite widespread in contrast to the monitoring of workforce diversity (28%). The second control mechanism concerns the approach of the worldwide company towards management succession planning in the subsidiary. We distinguish between an ‘outsider’ approach, where top positions in Canada are filled by managers who previously worked for the MNC in its home country or where decisions about the career progression of senior managers in the Canadian operations are made outside Canada, and an ‘insider’ approach where this is not the case (on insider and outsider approaches, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0018726712457194">Zhang and Rajagopalan, 2004</xref>). These two approaches are distributed evenly in our sample. The third control mechanism is related to corporate structure and, in particular, the presence in Canada of a subsidiary or regional division head office. The presence of such offices could impact the distribution of resources and ultimately power relations within MNCs. In our study, 57 per cent of subsidiaries reported either a national or a regional head office in Canada.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>In order to test these three lines of analysis, we performed a linear multiple regression analysis with discretion on employment relations policy as our dependent variable. Tolerance values for multi-collinearity between independent variables are all within acceptable limits (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0018726712457194">Table 2</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0018726712457194">Table 3</xref>, the adjusted <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> continually increases through each of the models, where the independent variables explain 34.7 per cent of the total variance in ERP discretion in the final model. Overall, our study yields significant results for three of the five hypotheses and partially supports the two others.</p>

<p>Model 1 takes account of a first set of control variables: the size and age of the subsidiary. These variables are not significant at the 5 per cent level and remain so in subsequent models. In other words, variations in ERP discretion cannot be attributed to the size or age of the Canadian subsidiary.</p>
<p>The second model considers the impact of three control mechanisms introduced by MNCs in relation to their Canadian subsidiaries. While the extent of monitoring is significant in Model 2 (and also in Model 3), its effects abate in subsequent models. An outsider approach to succession planning is negatively related to subsidiary discretion in Model 2 and in each of the successive models. When decisions about the career progression of senior managers are made outside Canada or top positions in the Canadian subsidiary are filled by managers who previously worked for the WWC in its home country, then the subsidiary exhibits a lower degree of discretion on ERP. The presence of corporate intermediary structures in Canada is not significantly related to discretion on ERP.</p>
<p>The third model examines the impact of country of origin (Hypothesis 1), with US-controlled subsidiaries as the reference group. US-controlled subsidiaries are more likely to have lower discretion in comparison to those controlled by MNCs from continental Europe and Asia. The impact of country of origin on ERP discretion is constant through succeeding models and remains an important predictor, irrespective of the introduction of capability and value chain variables. However, the differences between US-controlled subsidiaries and MNCs from Anglo-Saxon countries (UK or Australia) are not statistically significant throughout the five models. This finding partially supports Hypothesis 1 that US-controlled MNCs in Canada exhibit lower levels of discretion in comparison with those from other regions.</p>
<p>The fourth model takes account of subsidiary capabilities. First, embedding capabilities within the local economy and the MNC are related to ERP discretion. Subsidiaries integrated strongly in the local economy and weakly within the MNC have more discretion than subsidiaries embedded strongly within the MNC and weakly in the local economy. These results highlight for subsidiaries the complexity of trade-offs between embeddedness in the local economy and in MNC networks. As suggested by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0018726712457194">Meyer et al. (2011)</xref>, regular contacts with the HR managers of the worldwide company may be beneficial in some ways, but also appear to constrain local management. By developing stronger ties with corporate management, local managers may have to be seen in line with the discourse and programs of the parent company. However, there is no statistical difference between subsidiaries integrated strongly in the local economy and weakly within the MNC and those either weakly embedded in the local economy and the MNC or strongly embedded in both. These results partially confirm Hypothesis 2. Second, the existence of strong internal management capabilities is significantly related to ERP discretion. Subsidiaries have more discretion when their senior managers have developed strong internal capabilities. Hypothesis 3 is therefore confirmed.</p>
<p>The fifth model takes into account the nature of the subsidiary’s role in global value chains and the quality of local resources that it can mobilize. The variables measuring the nature of the activities performed in Canada are significantly associated with ERP discretion and do not affect the level of significance of country of origin or the relative importance of embedding capabilities within the MNC and internal management capabilities. Discretion in employment relations policies is higher in subsidiaries having a wider range of value-added activities in Canada, i.e. those engaged in both manufacturing and R&amp;D. Subsidiaries that report a high quality of suppliers and a concentration of special competencies or skills in their operations also exhibit higher levels of ERP discretion. Our data therefore provide support for both Hypotheses 4 and 5 with regard to the value chain effects on subsidiary discretion.</p>
<p>It is worth stressing that Model 4, incorporating organizational capabilities, has the largest <italic>F</italic>-value variations and accounts for 13.7 per cent of the variation in ERP discretion, while Model 5, adding global value chain variables, explains 9 per cent of the variation. Our results confirm the need to go beyond country-of-origin analysis even though it remains an important predictor (8.3% of the variation). The results highlight the importance of institutions, agency and resources in the understanding of ERP discretion and the need to better understand their interconnections. This is an interesting result in the light of recent efforts to probe the links between these different types of explanation of subsidiary behaviour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0018726712457194">Dörrenbächer and Geppert, 2011</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Our survey supports the three lines of analysis that inform this article. ERP discretion appears to result from a combination of factors that suggest that, beyond country-of-origin considerations, subsidiaries that have stronger resources and capabilities also have higher discretion. The analysis of the interplay between these different factors is, of course, subject to the limits of both single-respondent, cross-sectional data and measures that cannot easily capture the complexity of subsidiary relations with both their parent companies and their local economies.</p>
<p>With this limit in mind, our results show that US-controlled subsidiaries are likely to report lower discretion over ERP than subsidiaries from continental Europe and Asia, but the differences with Anglo-Saxon countries (UK and Australia) subsidiaries are not statistically significant. The association between US ownership and ERP discretion remains so, irrespective of the introduction of other lines of analysis. This result indicates that US ownership plays a role in the dynamics of subsidiary discretion and further confirms the literature, pointing to a tendency for US-based MNCs to control foreign subsidiaries more systematically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0018726712457194">Almond and Ferner, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0018726712457194">Ferner et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0018726712457194">Pudelko and Harzing, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Our results indicate that US MNCs are less likely to concede discretion to their Canadian subsidiaries than are MNCs originating from coordinated market economies (continental Europe and Asia). This confirms that US MNCs are in a particularly good position to take advantage of the institutional latitude granted to foreign multinationals in Canada. Further comparative analysis might reveal to what extent this reduced discretion in US subsidiaries in Canada is informed by the political economy of continental dominance or by the more generic traits of the US business system.</p>
<p>Two types of organizational capability are significantly associated with subsidiary discretion on ERP. These are internal management capabilities and embeddedness within the MNC and the local economy. Our measures of internal management capabilities reflect the ability of local managers to develop positive relationships with the employees, to foster innovation, and to represent favourably the subsidiary within the broader structures of the firm. Such social resources are likely to promote investment in the subsidiary and to obtain more strategic mandates from headquarters. The positive relationship between these organizational capabilities and ERP discretion indicates that subsidiaries can seek to enhance their degree of discretion over decision-making. This finding is reinforced by an outsider approach to succession planning, which is negatively related to ERP discretion and is also negatively associated with internal management capabilities (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0018726712457194">Table 2</xref>). This highlights the importance for subsidiaries of building their own capabilities and reinforces the contention that personal relationships are important in the construction of subsidiary mandates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0018726712457194">Dörrenbächer and Geppert, 2009</xref>). In other words, the determinants of subsidiary discretion on ERP policy appear multi-layered and possibly often cross-cutting. More specifically, this negative relationship observed between ERP discretion and outsider approaches to succession planning suggests that strategies to enhance subsidiary discretion must also contend with the political contingencies of corporate control.</p>
<p>As expected, our study finds that discretion is higher in subsidiaries strongly integrated into the local economy and weakly within the MNC than in subsidiaries integrated weakly in the local economy and strongly within the MNC. This finding lends strong support to recent contributions on the politics of MNCs, suggesting that closer ties within the corporation can play against subsidiary discretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0018726712457194">Meyer et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0018726712457194">Morgan and Kristensen, 2006</xref>). Considering the tensions between internal and external embeddedness, local managers may gain more discretion if they focus more on developing networks and alliances in their own environment.</p>
<p>Global value chain perspectives also contribute to an understanding of the forces at play. Our results indicate that the quality of local resources, as measured by the quality of suppliers and the set of skills and competencies, is positively associated with ERP discretion. This discretion is reinforced in the case of subsidiaries with higher value added in the nature of their activities, as measured by the presence of both manufacturing and R&amp;D as opposed to other possible productive configurations (R&amp;D without manufacturing or no R&amp;D). These results highlight how the set of activities that corporations perform in particular countries or regions have implications for the distribution of power and autonomy within firms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0018726712457194">Gereffi, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0018726712457194">Sturgeon et al., 2008</xref>). From this perspective, what subsidiaries do in value chains and the quality of their resources both reflect and underlie their capacity for taking decisions within the corporation.</p>
<p>It has been argued that, in the context of economic integration fostered by NAFTA and globalization more generally, US-owned firms have reduced the autonomy of their main centres of decision-making in Canada (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0018726712457194">Arthurs, 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0018726712457194">2009</xref>). While our non-longitudinal study cannot address the contention of diminished discretion over time, it both supports and challenges the hollowing out argument. First, it is clear that US-controlled subsidiaries report less discretion than do subsidiaries from the continental European and Asian regions. Second, the presence of a head office or a regional (North American) head office in Canada is not significantly related to ERP discretion. Third, it appears that it is not so much the presence of head offices as the capabilities developed by Canadian subsidiaries and the role they play in value chains that matter. As argued by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0018726712457194">Herod et al. (2007)</xref>, firms are far more ‘rooted’ into host economies than is often assumed. As our results indicate, the development by subsidiaries of particular sets of capabilities and resources, such as R&amp;D activities, quality suppliers and special competencies and skills in their labour force, are associated with increased discretion over decision-making.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>There are many distinct variables at play in the making of subsidiary discretion, and our methodology and dataset allow for the testing of some of these connections. By opening the analysis to a broader set of relationships, both inside and outside the operations of foreign-controlled subsidiaries in Canada, our results have implications for understanding the patterns of control within contemporary MNCs and for the broader political economy.</p>
<p>In seeking to integrate and test country-of-origin, organizational capability and global value chain effects in a single framework, we have sought to bridge what are often seen as distinct dividing lines in research on MNCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0018726712457194">Collinson and Morgan, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0018726712457194">Morgan, 2011</xref>). In contrast to much of the research literature, our results suggest that these three lines of analysis can be seen as complementary. Although country-of-origin effects remain a significant and influential factor, it does not overdetermine other lines of analysis. The key to understanding these dynamics may have to do with the connections between what subsidiaries actually do in a given country (their position in global value chains) and how they draw on the resources and skills available to operate efficiently in this spatial environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0018726712457194">Fenton-O’Creevy et al., 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>The data presented here confirm that the subsidiaries that conduct a broader set of activities in Canada, namely manufacturing and R&amp;D, are likely to have more discretion in the shaping of employment relations policy. These results have further implications. While capital is obviously much more geographically mobile than labour, multinationals have a vested interest in making the most of their assets in a specific spatial environment. These assets must be considered broadly, much beyond investment in capital and technology. Besides providing access to natural resources and to markets, subsidiaries develop a broad set of capabilities over the years, including skills, know-how and social capital on the part of managers, engineers and production workers, access to government agencies and other institutions, and ways to operate in a given spatial environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0018726712457194">Almond, 2011b</xref>).</p>
<p>In the study of these organizational capabilities, our data throw light on a key analytical point. There is a tendency in the literature to conceptualize embeddedness as a positive sum, where different levels of strategic action are reinforced through addition (for instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0018726712457194">Bouquet and Birkinshaw, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0018726712457194">Kristensen and Zeitlin, 2005</xref>). Hence, Bouquet and Birkinshaw present ‘corporate embeddedness’ and ‘external embeddedness’ as jointly contributing to the highest level of influence within MNCs, as a result of the ‘creation of strong connections with all categories of influential actors, in both types of strategic networks’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0018726712457194">2008</xref>: 487−488). In contrast, our results indicate that closer connections within the multinational, and weaker integration in the local economy are associated with lower discretion on employment relations policy. This gives weight to recent work discussing the tensions and choices associated with ‘multiple embeddedness’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0018726712457194">Meyer et al., 2011</xref>). In keeping with the interpretation advanced by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0018726712457194">Morgan and Kristensen (2006)</xref>, our results point to the need for local managers to show some independence from headquarters in order to build their own basis of influence locally.</p>
<p>The originality of this study is the simultaneous integration of organizational, institutional and value chain considerations in the understanding of the dynamics of subsidiary discretion. These results also point to the need to go beyond explanations focusing on the distinctive traits of home and host country institutional environments to embrace more broadly the interface between actors at different levels within the corporation.</p>

<p>These ex ante remedies concerned the design and administration of the study. In particular, the scales and anchors varied throughout the questionnaire. The dependent and independent variables are measured through reporting of organizational practices rather than attitudes and perceptions. Respondents were also assured of confidentiality and that the research focused on understanding the variety of practices (i.e. that there were no good or bad responses). Moreover, all the variables concerned with management discretion were strongly contextualized in relation to specific firm practices.</p></fn>
