<abstract>
<p>On Christmas Eve in 1909, 21-year-old Kagawa Toyohiko (1888–1960) rented a room in Kobe’s worst slum and, aside from two years of study in the United States, remained there with his wife and co-worker Haru more than ten years. In the slum, they engaged in pastoral work, evangelism, social reform movements, and literary activities. After publishing a best-selling novel in 1920 and donating all of the royalties to their many projects, Toyohiko began to draw the attention of people from around Japan and the world. He was often compared with his contemporaries Mahatma Gandhi and Albert Schweitzer. Arguing that spiritual reform must accompany genuine social reform, he proposed the “third way” of cooperative economics as an alternative to the materialism he perceived in capitalism and Marxism. The Kagawas founded Kobe Co-op in 1920, which today has 1.2 million members. To support the spiritual life and social commitment of young Christians, they started the “Friends of Jesus” in 1921, a lay Protestant order linking Franciscan and Jesuit traditions. They helped lead relief efforts in Tokyo after the Great Kanto Earthquake in 1923 and Toyohiko led the Kingdom of God Movement from 1926–34, a massive ecumenical effort that fused evangelism with social activism. Toyohiko was a lifelong reader of natural science and saw no conflict between science and faith. His lifelong passivism was sorely tested as Japan headed into world war. By 1940, he had responsibility for 4 settlement houses, 6 cooperatives, 6 slum kitchens, 3 hospitals, 17 kindergartens, 3 tuberculosis sanitaria, 3 gospel schools, 1 domestic science school, 2 magazines, a farm, and 19 churches. Publishing over 300 books in his lifetime, he was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Literature twice, and the Nobel Peace Prize three times. This piece considers why Kagawa and his enduring legacy have been forgotten.</p>

<sec id="sec1-0040573613484755" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Sometime in the early 1920s, a young Japanese woman visited the Kagawas in the Shinkawa slum of Kobe, where they had lived and worked for years. After finding the Kagawa’s home down a narrow alleyway, she let herself into the entrance. As she later recalled,<disp-quote>
<p>Kagawa entered the room … His good eye was rimmed with red, as though the entering light hurt it. Living and working in the slums, he had contracted trachoma (a terrible eye disease) … At his suggestion, I followed him into the slum alley.</p>
<p>In the slums were nests of paupers, former criminals, beggars, prostitutes, drug and alcohol addicts—the wrecks and dregs of society. The sorrows and sighs of the defeated, forgotten by the world, lay stagnant in the heavy air. On both sides of the alley, hovels, half-buried, slanted into the ground. Families of from five to ten persons lived in huddled houses six feet square. For about every thirty houses there was a community kitchen and a community toilet.</p></disp-quote>After showing her the dispensary they had opened with profits from the sale of his best-selling novel, Kagawa led her on to the section of the slum reserved for the lowest social class called the <italic>Burakumin</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0040573613484755">2</xref></sup> As they walked on, the young woman recalled one of Kagawa’s poems about the harsh reality of life in the slums, and she began to seriously doubt that she would be able to join them in their work:<disp-quote>
<p>At suppertime Kagawa said, “If you really want to test yourself, you might go tonight to the slum bathhouse. Do you have the mind to go?”</p>
<p>A cold shiver ran down my spine at the idea of going to a public bathhouse of the diseased … When supper was finished, I was taken by Madame Kagawa to the public bath … Standing in the bathroom foggy with steam, I closed my eyes and resolutely put one leg into the tub. As my foot touched the bottom of the wooden tub, I felt the smeary slime … Madame Kagawa, as though swimming, went around the tub greeting people.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0040573613484755">3</xref></sup></p></disp-quote>To the witness of this young woman, I want to add the appraisal of another eminent graduate of Princeton Theological Seminary. Francis J. Grimké (1850–1937, PTS class of 1878), the well-known African American church leader and pastor of 15th Street Presbyterian Church in Washington, D.C., expressed great admiration for Kagawa.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0040573613484755">4</xref></sup> Grimké wrote,<disp-quote>
<p>Here is a man of another race that, in the qualities that go to make up greatness of the highest order, is without a superior anywhere … On this highest plane of noble character and life this man, a Japanese, stands and challenges the attention of the world … As this man moves about; as he lives his simple, beautiful, self-sacrificing life of love, he is a standing rebuke to race prejudice, and all narrowness and bigotry based on race or color everywhere.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0040573613484755">5</xref></sup></p></disp-quote>With these images and tribute in mind, I want to state explicitly what my Japanese predecessors in this lectureship were somewhat reticent to say. Think of the great spiritual leaders of the twentieth century—Mahatma Gandhi, Albert Schweitzer, Martin Luther King, Jr., Mother Theresa—and you will have a sense of the immense notoriety Kagawa Toyohiko achieved during his lifetime and also of his many lasting accomplishments. Pastor, evangelist, advocate for the rights of the poor, children, and women, best-selling novelist, poet, religious educator, liberation theologian, labor and union organizer, imaginative interdisciplinary thinker, cooperative movement leader, economic theorist, advocate for racial justice, philosopher, peacemaker, apologetic theologian, and prophetic provocateur, Kagawa was founder of several still-thriving educational, social welfare, medical, financial, labor, agricultural, cooperative, and Christian institutions, two-time nominee for the Nobel Prize in Literature (1947 and 1948), and three-time nominee for the Nobel Peace Prize (1954, 1955, and 1956). A graduate of the Princeton Theological Seminary class of 1916 and clearly among the most illustrious graduates in its 200-year history, Kagawa was that rare individual with a sense of vocation to bear the hardest burdens and articulate the best hopes of an entire generation by focusing the powers of his intuition, intellect, and will on one goal. In his case, that singular goal was to practice the redemptive love of Jesus.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-0040573613484755"><title>Why Has Kagawa Been Forgotten?</title>
<p>The first three Kagawa lecturers, Professors Furuya, Koyama, and Morimoto expressed regret that Kagawa has been forgotten by the churches and theologians of Japan and the United States. In 2009, several symposia were held in Japan to commemorate the centennial of Kagawa’s move into a Kobe slum, but it is too early to tell whether or not these events will create any serious renewal of interest. During my 13 years on the faculty of Tokyo Union Theological Seminary, there was only one master’s thesis written on Kagawa.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0040573613484755">6</xref></sup> By contrast, looking over the English translations of his works that I have borrowed from the Princeton Seminary library, it is clear that there was a “Kagawa boom” in the 1950s.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0040573613484755">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>The missionaries who worked closely with Kagawa were so deeply impressed by his manner of life, devotion, message, and ministry that their writings about him often border on uncritical hagiography. Robert Schildgen is surely right to point out that the “Kagawa success story” was in some sense used to justify the massive expenditures and mixed results of the Protestant missions in Japan.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0040573613484755">8</xref></sup> While I am not as uncritical as those missionaries who translated Kagawa’s books into English or wrote his biographies, I must confess that I have found in Kagawa’s massive writings an enduring witness to one of the towering, creative, and challenging religious figures of the twentieth century who is still worthy of serious consideration.</p>
<p>Especially because Kagawa was so well known around the world during his own lifetime, it does seem all the more puzzling that he has been forgotten today. I think the most obvious explanation for this is that the bulk of his writings are in Japanese. If more of his works were in English, we would likely not need a Kagawa Lecture at Princeton Theological Seminary, because there would be an international academic field called Kagawa studies. Since only 20 of his more than 300 books have been translated into English, a comprehensive and balanced evaluation of Kagawa still awaits the sustained cooperative work of future generations of scholars in and beyond Japan. But, beyond this formidable linguistic challenge, I want to touch on a more basic reason for this forgetfulness related to the particular history and character of Japanese Protestantism and how Kagawa came into conflict with the Protestant establishment from early on in his career.</p>
<p>From the 1870s, the Protestant missionaries had attracted the attention of some of the promising sons of recently disenfranchised, elite samurai clans who had been dispatched to the port cities to learn English as a means of securing the future of the family name and fortune. Some were baptized and these converts tended to believe that their new faith, especially when enhanced by the traditional samurai code of ethics (<italic>Bushido</italic>), would help hasten the day when their beloved Japan could stand tall, an equal among the dominant Western colonial and imperial powers, as Asia’s first modern, industrial nation state.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0040573613484755">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>Also born into a former samurai family, Kagawa came to Christian faith about thirty years after the first generation of samurai converts. Hence, we should think of him as a second generation Protestant leader. He lost both his father Junichi and mother Kameko, Junichi’s concubine, when he was only four years old, spent his childhood in what he later called the “loveless” family of his father’s wife, was diagnosed with pulmonary tuberculosis at 13, and experienced the financial ruin of his family at 15. Beyond the unimaginable psychological effects of these personal traumas, Japan’s social, economic, and political situation had changed drastically by the time the 15-year-old Kagawa was baptized in 1904.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0040573613484755">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>On the one hand, the Meiji government oligarchs had succeeded in mustering Japan’s material and human resources in building East Asia’s first modern nation state and emergent global empire. Following the promulgation of its constitution in 1889, Japan went on to defeat China’s Qing Dynasty in 1895, overcome the Russian Navy at the Chinese port of Dalian in 1904, and colonize the Korean Empire in 1910. Kagawa was a brooding and bookish teenager as his beloved homeland was entering the new century with a growing sense of its unique destiny and power in Asia and the world. On the other hand, the government’s <italic>Fukoku Kyōhei</italic> (“Wealthy Country, Strong Military”) policy had produced some serious negative social and economic consequences. Tenant farmers who had fled in record numbers to the cities in hopes of finding factory work faced horrific working and living conditions. For families to survive, children were often pressed into labor or prostitution. Overcrowded and highly unsanitary slums appeared in all of the major industrial port cities.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0040573613484755">11</xref></sup> Kobe’s Shinkawa slum was among the worst of these squalid breeding grounds for a wide range of new social problems.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0040573613484755">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>Smitten by Tolstoy and Ruskin and drawn to Christian pacifism and a gradualist socialism, the young Kagawa was awakened to a vision for world peace and troubled by the injustice of an economic system that exploited unprotected workers while lining the pockets of the rich. On Christmas Eve, 1909, the young idealist dramatically departed his dormitory at the Kobe Theological School and took up residence in Kobe’s Shinkawa slum. After several years of living and working in the slum, disrupted only by a study leave at Princeton Theological Seminary and Princeton University (1914–16), in 1921 Kagawa ran into conflict with communist labor union leaders for insisting that spiritual reform must accompany social and economic reform. Coming increasingly under the influence of the nineteenth-century British Guild Socialists and the cooperative movement of the Rochdale Weavers, he began proclaiming Cooperative Economics as a positive “third way” between the alternatives of monopoly capitalism and communism. He thought that capitalism and communism shared a spiritless materialism and both were powerless to mitigate human greed, in the first instance, and violence, in the second.</p>
<p>In July, 1930, Kagawa delivered an address in China entitled “Following in His Steps.” As always, he emphasized that Jesus did not just preach or teach but embodied the gospel in practice. Striking an interpretive note that later liberation theologians would also sound,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0040573613484755">13</xref></sup> he said,<disp-quote>
<p>In the sense in which Jesus Christ used the word, the “Gospel” means “<italic>emancipation</italic>.” When he went into the synagogue at Nazareth, Christ took the book of Isaiah, and read the following verses: “The Spirit of the Lord is upon me; because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor; he hath sent me to heal the broken-hearted; to preach deliverance to the captives; and recovering of sight to the blind; to set at liberty them that are bruised; to preach the acceptable year of the Lord” (Luke 4 : 18–19). The Gospel of emancipation meant five things:</p></disp-quote>
<list id="list1-0040573613484755" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Economic emancipation (preaching to the poor).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Psychological emancipation (healing the broken-hearted).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Social emancipation (preaching deliverance to the captives).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Physical emancipation (recovery of sight to the blind).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Political emancipation (setting at liberty them that are bruised).</p></list-item>
</list><disp-quote>
<p>The Gospel of Christ means not merely individualistic mental healing. It means a healing of everything. It means every kind of emancipation, from all sorts of evil.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0040573613484755">14</xref></sup></p></disp-quote>In contrast to Kagawa’s proto-liberationist views, the Japanese Protestantism of the first generation had been primarily a “spiritual movement”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0040573613484755">15</xref></sup> that generally steered clear of critical political or economic commentary and calls to action, and it is in his persistent opposition to this reticence that we should read Kagawa’s criticisms of the “pulpit Christianity” of Japan’s churches and theoretical in-fighting of theologians. Here he rails against the church’s failure to inspire the young by preaching and doctrine alone:<disp-quote>
<p>Unfortunately the Protestant church is giving the nation a Christianity which makes the pulpit and preaching central. Japanese youth, dissatisfied with this emphasis, are drifting away from the church. Their recent flight to communism is caused by this situation. The communists are bent on realizing love in a social order based on materialism and buttressed by violence as its compelling force. To this the youth of Japan responds. They are on the wrong road. But they will positively not return to a Christianity which deals only in doctrine. It was their recoil from this doctrine that drove them into the communistic fold.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0040573613484755">16</xref></sup></p></disp-quote>His break with the older Protestant establishment had begun when he took up residence in the Shinkawa slum at the age of 21. Living with the poorest of the poor, he strived to articulate the gospel in terms that would be recognizable to all people, regardless of social or economic class. He was making his appeal to the working classes, while the older churches seemed to limit their gospel to the educated middle class. Hence, Kagawa regularly offered up criticisms of what he saw as the church’s excessive individualism, formalism, intellectualism, insularity, and elitism.</p>
<p>By the early 1920s, Kagawa had gained national attention for his best-selling novel <italic>Shisen wo Koete</italic> (<italic>Beyond the Death Line</italic>) and was becoming the target of criticism from some in the Protestant establishment. In 1920, the famous Christian leader Ebina Danjō wrote, “The reason the slums have not disappeared in spite of so many years of Kagawa’s efforts is because his project is half-hearted.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0040573613484755">17</xref></sup> Kagawa responded,<disp-quote>
<p>The slums have not disappeared because there has been nothing but criticism with few offering a helping hand. If public opinion was aroused and the row houses reformed, the slums would disappear immediately. I am happy because my staying here for so long has made people who had never given this problem a single thought begin to think about the slums.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0040573613484755">18</xref></sup></p></disp-quote>The years in Shinkawa were foundational to Kagawa’s comprehensive vision of social and spiritual reformation.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-0040573613484755">19</xref></sup> Kagawa wrote,<disp-quote>
<p>Christ, who died for sinners, summons us to become the concrete expression of this redeeming love to the so-called scum of society. In Colossians 1 : 24 Paul calls us to carry redemptive love on to its God-given goal: “I am now rejoicing in my sufferings for your sake, and in my flesh I am completing what is lacking in Christ’s afflictions for the sake of his body, that is, the church.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-0040573613484755">20</xref></sup></p></disp-quote>Kagawa could not conceive of the benefits of redemption in purely individualistic terms and was convinced that all people and indeed all creation were implicated in the reconciling work of the crucified Jesus Christ. Whatever its successes and failures, Kagawa’s wide-ranging ministry may therefore be best understood as a sustained effort to enact these words of Col 1 : 24, to make contemporary, real, operative and hence salvific, the embodied love of God in Jesus Christ for all people, and most especially for those who are oppressed, exploited, abused, forsaken, or despised. He wrote, “The cross of Jesus means permanent progress toward God’s true Kingdom. It means a process of permanent sacrifice by the individual to help lift society up to God’s level of consciousness and love.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-0040573613484755">21</xref></sup> As Japan raced toward the goal of modernization, Kagawa thought his beloved country was in danger of losing its soul in the process. He dared to believe, imagine, and act as if the brightest possible future for his people belonged to Jesus Christ, who took the suffering of sinners and the suffering of the poor as his own suffering.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-0040573613484755">22</xref></sup></p>
<p>Inasmuch as he perceived in the cross of Jesus the sole and sufficient source of the knowledge of God’s love and the power of salvation, Kagawa’s view may be characterized as a thoroughgoing, yet original contextual <italic>theologia crucis</italic>. He did not see the cross as standing for some remote historical event whose benefits are passively enjoyed by believers, but rather as a present world transforming reality into which every follower of Jesus is summoned to participate, thereby sharing in God’s ongoing redemption of an evolving world. He believed that the redemptive love of the crucified Jesus is reenacted again and again in the lives of his followers, especially as they bear in love the pain and suffering of their neighbors in greatest need. A commitment to the primacy of the practical expression of cruciform love is illustrated by the following story that Kagawa told to motivate his Christian hearers.<disp-quote>
<p>Christianity introduced from the West, because of its individualism, fails to understand the group life of the Japanese. This failure has greatly retarded Christian progress in this land. The parents of an eminent actress were murdered by burglars. A Christian pastor called after hearing about this tragedy. He entered very formally by the front entrance and endeavored to comfort her with the tenets of his faith. A Shinto believer also called. She entered by the back door, cleaned up the kitchen and brought order out of the chaos caused by the incident. The outcome was that this actress espoused the Shinto faith. Her reason is interesting. She declared, “Christian teaching is sublime but too difficult for me to grasp. The Shinto believer was kind, not over-dignified, and friendly, so I accepted her faith.” The Protestantism, introduced into Japan from Europe was strongly intellectualized and over-emphasized its theology. This left a gap between Christianity and the uneducated masses. There is danger therefore of it becoming merely the religion of the intelligentsia, a minority group.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-0040573613484755">23</xref></sup></p></disp-quote>In his recent reassessment of Kagawa’s theology, Kuribayashi Teruo reflects on the tensions between Kagawa and mainline church leaders and theologians.<disp-quote>
<p>If we think of the boast of Uemura Masahisa, the leader of the Japanese church in the Meiji and Taisho Eras, who said, “My churches don’t need the likes of rickshaw drivers or factory workers,” Kagawa proclaimed, “The poorest of the poor are the heart of the church. The most obscure must become the treasure of the church,” it is no surprise that pastors did not welcome him. When Kagawa said, “Faith is not about intellectually swallowing the creeds,” it is no surprise he was not viewed favorably by Japan’s systematic theologians.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-0040573613484755">24</xref></sup></p></disp-quote>But it would be unfair to lay all of the blame for this tension at the feet of the established churches. In a cultural milieu that values the core virtues of respect, loyalty, and fidelity in regard to one’s predecessors, teachers, and colleagues, Kagawa often sounded excessively contrarian and critical. While he was an ordained pastor in the Presbyterian Church, in 1921 Kagawa initiated what he called a “Franciscan-Jesuit Protestant Order” called the Friends of Jesus to support the spiritual life and social commitment of young Christians. Economist and lay Christian leader Sumiya Mikio says, “This religious movement was a progressive reform movement against the churches who restricted faith to the spiritual world and enshrined the gospel in the church alone.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-0040573613484755">25</xref></sup> On the one hand, Kagawa was bitterly disappointed in the established churches. At the same time, he had discovered a new and limitless source of hope in the imitation of the self-emptying love of the crucified Jesus. But given his provocative, reformist, and sometimes self-righteous tone, it is indeed little surprise that the mainline Japanese churches “buried him and moved on.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-0040573613484755">26</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec3-0040573613484755"><title>A Twentieth-century Apologist</title>
<p>By the early 1930s, many of Japan’s leading academic theologians had completely fallen under the spell of German dialectical theology. But Kagawa was not at all taken with Barth’s theology of revelation.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn27-0040573613484755">27</xref></sup> Now fully engaged in his nationwide Kingdom of God evangelistic campaign, he knew that Christians represented a tiny, struggling minority of less than one percent of the Japanese population. Only 39 percent of Japan’s Protestant churches were self-supporting,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn28-0040573613484755">28</xref></sup> and clearly the gospel had yet to find a home in the hearts and minds of the common people. Given this situation, Japan had no legacy of Christendom from which it needed to be liberated by a Barthian clarion call. While Kagawa generally had little time for theological polemics, there is an oblique reference to dialectical theology in his <italic>Meditations on the Holy Spirit</italic> (1939):<disp-quote>
<p>The Christianity of the present age, in proportion to the emphasis it lays on the teaching about God, leaves out the Holy Spirit. In modern times, a certain theology that has raised great questions in theological circles explains the absolute God, yet it has a tendency to make light of the indwelling God. But Paul thought that to become a Christian and receive the Holy Spirit, and to be a believer in the Christian religion were the same thing.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn29-0040573613484755">29</xref></sup></p></disp-quote>While Japanese intellectuals were entranced by dialectical theology, Kagawa sought to creatively express the gospel through the aesthetic, philosophical, and ethical modes of knowing in which he and his fellow Japanese had been nurtured.</p>
<p>This does not mean that he ignored modern theological trends. In conversation with Schleiermacher’s notion of the unique God-consciousness of Jesus, Wrede’s and Schweitzer’s views of the messianic secret, and Rauchenbusch’s social gospel and emphasis on the Kingdom of God, Kagawa’s gospel was not simply an imported version of Western theological liberalism, because he refracted his close reading of Scripture and Western theological trends through his own inherited cultural traditions and pressed them into the service of a tireless evangelical program for Japan’s spiritual, social, economic, and political reform.</p>
<p>For example, in <italic>Meditations on the Cross</italic> (1931), Kagawa says that the other-centeredness of Christ flows from what he calls his “consciousness of collective responsibility,” which was present in Christ in a unique way but is also the shared inheritance and calling of his followers.<disp-quote>
<p>We can in a measure understand Christ’s “consciousness of collective responsibility” from our own feelings today. Though I myself do not have the memory of telling a lie, or having done anything wrong, and though I think myself innocent, yet when anyone else commits a robbery … I feel a relationship to that crime, and that I must ask forgiveness of God for it. The Jesus who thought like that was truly the King of Truth.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn30-0040573613484755">30</xref></sup></p></disp-quote>Kagawa wrote with Japanese lay readers in mind, hence his portrayal of Jesus as a virtuous King who perfectly embodied the “consciousness of collective responsibility,” while sounding fresh and perhaps even exotic to English-speaking readers, is best read as a contextual apologetic intended to appeal to his readers’ Confucian ethic of social solidarity.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn31-0040573613484755">31</xref></sup> Kagawa continues,<disp-quote>
<p>This [consciousness of collective responsibility], then, is the secret of Jesus Christ. And this we can fit into our daily lives. And advancing one more step, taking the “filling up of the measure of what is lacking in the suffering of Christ” as our responsibility, we must make the world’s sorrows our own. That is Christianity. The moment we are saved, we must set ourselves to saving others. The way Christ became the Atoning Lamb was by hanging on the Cross and dying there. And Christianity for me means to dedicate myself to serve others even unto death. Christianity means to save others. That is the way of the Cross, and the true way of Christ.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn32-0040573613484755">32</xref></sup></p></disp-quote>His crucified Jesus perfectly embodies the Confucian ideal of right action (<italic>rei</italic>) as the One who willingly gives his life for the Many (<italic>messhi hōkō</italic>). Thus, Kagawa seamlessly weaves together close biblical reading, modern theological insights, traditional Japanese religio-ethical norms, and a program of social reconstruction as he gently prods his readers to follow Christ by loving as he loved.</p>
<p>Another example of this theological creativity and freedom was his willingness to seriously reflect on what the latest scientific breakthroughs might mean for Christian thought. Unlike some of the North American missionaries who set Christian faith in opposition to the insights of modern science, Kagawa had no anxieties or hesitations whatsoever about exploring the consequences of modern evolutionary theory for Christian faith. Again, he felt it an evangelical duty to seriously explore the new trajectories in science and other fields that had arrested the world’s attention. In his biography of Kagawa, Yokoyama Haruichi recounts a story when Kagawa was a BD student at Princeton Theological Seminary (1914–16).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn33-0040573613484755">33</xref></sup> Kagawa had to sit for an examination that qualified him to enroll in advanced biology courses at Princeton University. Yokoyama writes,<disp-quote>
<p>Because Kagawa was not officially enrolled at Princeton University, he was required to take a qualifying examination. The exam question required him to list the current bibliography and write a brief summary on the current state of evolutionary theory. Kagawa had been interested in evolution since his days of secondary school and had read most of the books on the subject in the Meiji Gakuin Library, so this test question really hit the bull’s eye. When he had finished writing and was staring out the window at the barely visible scenery, the exam proctor came in. He took up Kagawa’s exam and let out a sound of admiration. Naturally he found Darwin and Lamarck, but also Edmond, Wallace, Johannsen, etc. In fact, Kagawa had listed 41 titles along with their summaries. After a long pause, the exam proctor stared at Kagawa and firmly offered his hand in search of a handshake.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn34-0040573613484755">34</xref></sup></p></disp-quote>Evolutionary theory had come to Japan soon after the first Protestant missionaries arrived in 1859. But converts like Kagawa were puzzled that many of the missionaries portrayed modern science as an enemy of religious faith. He felt this polarization was one of the main reasons the Japanese had chosen modern science over the gospel.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn35-0040573613484755">35</xref></sup> He wrote,<disp-quote>
<p>Religion never contradicts science. Science is simply another window for consciousness. To me the theory of evolution never was contradictory to the idea of creation. The scientist may study the phenomena of life but cannot create or alter the laws and conditions governing these phenomena of life. God provides the laws and conditions.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn36-0040573613484755">36</xref></sup></p></disp-quote>One of the courses on Kagawa’s Princeton Seminary transcript was “Evolution and Its Theological Applications and Effects,” presumably taught by B.B. Warfield whose engagements with evolutionary theory were more positive than some of the missionaries who had befriended the young Kagawa.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn37-0040573613484755">37</xref></sup> It simply made no sense to Kagawa to proclaim the redemptive love of the incarnate Son of God and then reject the emerging scientific insights into the same creation that God in Christ had so intimately embraced.</p>
<p>Kagawa sought to positively correlate biblical revelation with contemporary scientific insights whenever possible. To do this effectively and intelligently, he kept abreast of breakthroughs in scientific theories. While he was a pastor and evangelist and not a scientist, his faith in the incarnation inspired him to seek signs of redemptive love wherever they might appear. He wrote,<disp-quote>
<p>So closely do the Japanese feel themselves akin to nature and her ways that their thought of God takes on cosmic dimensions. Therefore, to bring home to the Japanese Christ’s revelation of God as Father we must teach, as Oswald does, that matter also has definite direction. We must show, as Driesch does, that there is harmony among organic bodies. We must stress the fact, as J.H. Fabre does, that God’s purpose is built even into animal intuition. If we fail to make these things convincingly clear the Japanese will not believe in a God of love. Even the urbanized Japanese are never weaned from nature. A religion, therefore, which fails to interpret nature will not win their allegiance. No matter how much they are taught regarding human love, unless shown that there is love in nature they will not find faith possible.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn38-0040573613484755">38</xref></sup></p></disp-quote>On the one hand, you could say that Kagawa still held to the old Reformed theology of the “two books,” but his views were also shaped and nuanced by Shinto reverence for nature, Buddhist contemplation, Neo-Confucian and Taoist monism as well as a lifelong study of natural science and Western philosophy.</p>
<p>As a culmination of a life of study and reflection on the question of finality, Kagawa’s last book, <italic>Cosmic Purpose</italic> (1958),<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn39-0040573613484755">39</xref></sup> marshals every resource from the full range of the sciences (physics, chemistry, biology, astronomy, geology, botany, psychology, etc.) to refute H.G. Wells’s claim that<disp-quote>
<p>Variation is at random; selection sifts and guides it, as nearly as possible into the direction prescribed by the particular conditions of environment. Once we realize this, we must give up any idea that evolution is purposeful. It is full of apparent purpose; but this is apparent only, it is not real purpose. It is the result of purposeless and random variation sifted by purposeless and automatic selection.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn40-0040573613484755">40</xref></sup></p></disp-quote>By contrast, Kagawa saw the evolving cosmos as a beautifully ordered, immensely complex, deeply purposeful, sometimes troubling, and intelligible whole. Of course, Kagawa had his own biases, but <italic>Cosmic Purpose</italic> is not a proof for the existence of God in any traditional sense. Further, though he did use the word “design,” neither is it an early argument for so-called intelligent design, which of course is an attempt to refute evolution. Kagawa was an ardent supporter and well-informed student of evolutionary theory. He was, however, critical of the philosophical materialism in Darwinism, seeing the inordinate influence of Malthus and others. Kagawa also drew on Kropotkin and others to suggest a “mutual aid” or cooperative factor at work in evolution that Darwin’s followers tended to miss by stressing tooth-and-fang survival. In the manner of Søren Kierkegaard or Nishida Kitarō, the founder of the Kyoto school of philosophy, Kagawa sought to transcend either–or and subject–object oppositions, seeing directionality and tacit purpose alongside of apparent randomness or absurdity. <italic>Cosmic Purpose</italic> was Kagawa’s final rhetorical plea to awaken in his well-educated Japanese readers, many of whom were tending toward a radical materialism in the postwar era, an aesthetic sense of wonder in the face of the mysteries of life, consciousness, and intelligibility in an evolving universe.</p>
<p>In this way, his approach to Christian faith is reminiscent of the early apologists of the Greco-Roman world, reading Scripture bifocally in the light of the inherited noetic categories and philosophical intuitions of Japan and the reigning ideas of his day. While remaining fully committed to the uniqueness of Jesus Christ, he articulated a positive view of contemporary intellectual trends as an enhancement and not a threat to religion, and maintained a profound knowledge of and critical respect for Japan’s religious, philosophical, and ethical traditions.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn41-0040573613484755">41</xref></sup> Unlike others of his generation, he did not feel beholden to some Western interpretation of theological orthodoxy, but picked up in an ad hoc manner on what he saw as salient developments in theology that would resonate with the <italic>habitus</italic> and missiological context of the Japanese people. As his books were translated into English and other languages, it seemed as if Kagawa was proclaiming Christ in a new and fresh light, and this, I believe, is the key to his immense popularity as an inspirational spiritual leader, writer, and speaker, especially in the United States.</p>
<p>Some accused him of naturalism, immanentalism, or pantheism for his focus on the continuity, rather than the discontinuity, between God and creation. Here is his response to such criticisms:<disp-quote>
<p>Someone may ask this question: “Are God and the universe one? And are God and human beings one?” Pantheism takes that stand. But I am not a pantheist. I am a believer in the Holy Spirit. No, beyond that I am one who rejoices in the Spirit-filled life. Is the child of the womb identical to the mother? Although conceived in the mother, the child is a different person from the mother. The mother is superior to the child and the child is living in the mother. And the child comes from the mother. In like manner the absolute God is superior to human beings while embracing human beings, and human beings are made by God. I think that we can think of the relation of God and the universe in the same way. The material world is not God himself; but God transcends it, dwells in it, and through it manifests himself. I wonder if it is not most appropriate to think of the material world as the clothing of God.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn42-0040573613484755">42</xref></sup></p></disp-quote>His core perception and conviction of a deep spiritual, material, aesthetic, and ethical continuity between all human beings and indeed all living things, even in the face of the increasing fragmentation of modern life, was no doubt in part indebted to his early reading of the personalism and socialism of Tolstoy, Ruskin, Carlyle, Bergson, Bowne, and others, but above all it was grounded in his view of the crucifixion of the incarnate Son of God.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn43-0040573613484755">43</xref></sup></p>
<p>While he was a voracious reader, he had no interest in simply importing the translations of European and North American academic theology into Japan’s very different missiological situation. Rather, to get a firm grasp of the broader intellectual currents and spirit of the day, he felt compelled to read widely. This is evidenced by his own translations and work in an wide variety of academic disciplines, including education, economics, literature, philosophy, natural science, history, and sociology. The practices of daily reading and study of Scripture and silent contemplation complemented his broad reading across disciplines.</p>

<sec id="sec4-0040573613484755"><title>Some Concluding Thoughts</title>
<p>In closing, as we turn to ponder Kagawa’s enduring witness and, even more broadly, the reception and use of European or North American theological ideas in places like Japan, I wish to note that in the face of the crisis of the rising militarism and ultranationalism that preceded World War II, it was the apologetic evangelist Kagawa and not the Japanese Barthians, who dared to speak truth to power at the risk of his own life. In 1938, Japan’s leading Barthian, Kumano Yoshitaka, contributed an essay entitled “Current Thought Trends in Japan” to <italic>The Japan Christian Yearbook.</italic> The previous year had seen the outbreak of the second Sino–Japanese War in July, followed by the Nanking Massacre in December. The tone of Kumano’s essay is scholarly, generalized, and on the relation of theology and the church, defensive of the status quo and even self-congratulatory. He says,<disp-quote>
<p>Speaking broadly, the point of view of modern liberalism has virtually lost all attraction for Christian thinkers in this country. On the other hand, the faith of the Reformers is receiving ever more and more detailed study. The influence of Karl Barth is going through a process of development from that of a passing intellectual fad to a deep interest engaging the earnest study of a number of scholars … It may safely be said that in the world of thought, the Protestant Church in this country has set itself in a wholesome direction.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn44-0040573613484755">44</xref></sup></p></disp-quote>Kagawa also contributed an essay to the same issue of <italic>The Japan Christian Yearbook</italic> entitled “The Church and Present Trends.” When placed next to Kumano’s essay, it is difficult to believe that these two Christian leaders were living in the same country at the same time. The contrast between their views could not be starker. Kagawa’s essay sounds like a prophetic alarm: He begins, “This all-pervading war spirit has been the means of erecting a huge dam in the stream of Japan’s Christianity whose ideal heretofore has been world peace.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn45-0040573613484755">45</xref></sup> He goes on to delineate three reasons for the downturn in baptismal inquirers and other difficulties facing the churches: the opposition to internationalism, opposition to pacifism, and the revival of (state) Shintoism. While we do not have time to present his argument in detail here, as Japan headed into a disastrous war, the so-called “crisis theology” of Europe curiously became a “crisis-avoiding” theology in the radically different missiological and theological context of Japan. Tellingly, during the war years Kumano felt compelled to abandon his work on Barth and turned instead to the less controversial Troeltsch. Kagawa, on the other hand, was an object of suspicion and suffered significantly for speaking out. In 1940, he was detained 18 days by the special police for questioning, and in 1943 was imprisoned again in Kobe for his anti-war stance.</p>
<p>What might today’s lay people, pastors, and theologians learn from this eminent alumnus of Princeton Theological Seminary? I want to mention five habits that continually renewed the vision and work of this remarkable pastor and global evangelist:
<list id="list2-0040573613484755" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>He enjoyed a lifelong sense of mystical wonder in the presence of God and God’s creation;<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn46-0040573613484755">46</xref></sup></p></list-item>
<list-item><p>He exercised a lively biblical imagination and aesthetic sensitivity to the Word of Scripture;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>He read broadly across the humanities, natural, and social sciences to discern the intellectual <italic>Zeitgeist</italic>;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>He unapologetically embraced his Japanese subjectivity embodied in the spiritual and philosophical modes of knowing in which he had been nurtured; and</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>He practiced regular silent mediation.</p></list-item>
</list>In spite of the Reformed reticence about claims of mystical participation or union, as when people such as Kagawa perceive the entire cosmos to be indwelt by and to indwell the Divine Presence, or when social reformers like Kagawa take personally the pain of their marginalized neighbors as the pain of God, thus committing themselves to “lost” causes often at huge personal cost, Kagawa’s witness endures as a sign that a robust religious tradition and hence a robust theology will not long survive without aesthetic wonder and ethical commitment that are grounded in religious experience and imagination. Kagawa perceived the divine forgiveness and beauty of Christ’s cross everywhere and in every person and dared to be a public embodiment and prophetic provocateur of that cruciform Presence, even in the face of illness, ridicule, imprisonment, and the threat of death. On behalf of the love he perceived in the crucified Son of God, Kagawa worked and advocated his whole life for the rights of poor workers, children, women, minorities, refugees and many others, as Kosuke Koyama said, at the periphery of an industrializing society that had systematized and rationalized exploitation of its most vulnerable members. Kagawa had no patience with any theology that could no longer engender the perception of the Divine Presence in every person or thing, however small, or any theology that could no longer evoke a vision of the present and coming kingdom of God and commitment to the transformation of the unjust orders of society.</p>
<p>In an age when theology is perceived by many as an intramural exercise of theologians engaging in impenetrable debates with other theologians, and hence a discourse completely cut off from society and often even the churches, Kagawa’s witness reminds us that there remains an ongoing and pressing apologetic task for our churches and theologians to seek positive ways to bring the gospel into conversation with the intellectual currents of the day and to bring the intellectual currents of the day into conversation with the gospel. Kagawa’s witness is a clarion call to a practical and robust recommitment to the two-way trafficking of the demanding apologetic task. Whatever successes or failures were engendered by his efforts, Kagawa’s apologetic vision was prophetic in as much as he firmly grasped a future that was as yet not present, embodying a radical hope of a robust Japanese Christian subjectivity that yet to been born.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn47-0040573613484755">47</xref></sup></p>
<p>The church’s failure to own a witness as powerful as Kagawa’s suggests our tent is too small. In spite of our confession, that we should “be imitators of the saints’ faith and virtues, to share eternal salvation with them, to dwell eternally with them in the presence of God, and to rejoice with them in Christ,”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn48-0040573613484755">48</xref></sup> we Presbyterians have yet to work out effective ways to remember and honor our exemplars like Kagawa. Still, we should take heart that the Episcopal Church and the Evangelical Lutheran Church of America have seen fit to honor this great Japanese Presbyterian with a day on their liturgical calendars (April 23, marking the day of his death in 1960).</p>
<p>I close with a Lenten prayer poem Kagawa wrote during World War II:<disp-quote>
<p>Via Dolorosa<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn49-0040573613484755">49</xref></sup></p>
<p>With sorrowful heart,</p>
<p>Yet for the joy of making atonement,</p>
<p>You walked, O Christ, to the cross.</p>
<p>Even if this was the lot fixed for you,</p>
<p>To pity even the least of these on earth,</p>
<p>Like God, unimaginable without love,</p>
<p>O precious event of the cross!</p>
<p>Even if the stars ceased to twinkle</p>
<p>And the sun forgot to shine,</p>
<p>The ever-increasing rays of God’s love</p>
<p>Would find an earthward passage</p>
<p>Through you.</p>
<p>O Christ,</p>
<p>A thousand Nine Hundred Years</p>
<p>Have passed since you died there,</p>
<p>And still humanity gasps with fear and greed;</p>
<p>Draw us into the orbit of your love.</p>
<p>Hasten the day</p>
<p>When we forget borders of countries and color of skin,</p>
<p>When all will praise your love.</p>
<p>O, please may we feel more vividly,</p>
<p>The blood of your love shed on that cross.</p></disp-quote></p>

To support this rather absurd claim, he pointed out that the poor would never talk about their homes and birthplaces and inferred it was because they were from the Buraku (Kagawa, 1915, pp. 85–86). Kagawa’s uncompromising Buraku-determinism for Japan’s urban poverty, which he defended vehemently at the expense and character of the people of Buraku, is an unfortunate scar in his otherwise praiseworthy career as a social reformer.” Masayoshi Chūbachi and Koji Taira, “Poverty in Modern Japan: Perceptions and Realities,” <italic>Japanese Industrialization and Its Social Consequences</italic>, ed.

After 150 years since the first missionaries arrived, Christians still represent only 1 percent of the population, and Protestantism, which accounts for roughly half of those Christians, is viewed as an individualistic preference of the educated, urban middle class and continues to seem foreign to most Japanese.</p></fn>

Kagawa surely knew that the association of the Friends of Jesus Society with certain Roman Catholic traditions would not go over well with Protestant leaders. “The Friends of Jesus Society, described recently by Mr. Kagawa as a ‘Francisco-Jesuit-Protestant Order,’ revives the loving service of the poor of St. Francis of Assisi, the loyalty to the Church of the Jesuits, and embodies these ideals and others in a practical program of Christian living designed to fit the needs of modern life in Japan. It does not take young people out of the world; it carries the spirit of the monastery into home and office, and makes every common duty an act of worship …  The little group has grown to a thousand and three hundred, about half of whom are women. No special propaganda has been carried on for expansion, and the Society is rather slow to admit new members, requiring a three years period of novitiate. The first year one is a Friend, the second a Brother, and the third and highest class is that of the Servants. Certain reading is required, including the Old and New Testaments, Bunyan’s <italic>Pilgrim’s Progress</italic>, ‘a Kempis’ <italic>Imitation of Christ</italic>, etc .…” <italic>Friends of Jesus</italic>, 1928, 2.</p></fn>

But one element is clear: the radicalism of Barth’s theology. This radicalism can be a hindrance in a society where Christianity is deeply rooted. In such a society the common sense view of Brunner’s theology is more persuasive, and Barth’s theology appears too radical. But in a society like Japan, where Christianity is not yet indigenized, common sense theological thought is more likely to be despised. It is rather radicalism which is more interesting, attractive, and praiseworthy. This is the secret of dialectical theology, especially of Barth’s theology, which has enjoyed an overwhelming influence in Japan.” Toshio Satō, “The Second Generation,” <italic>A History of Japanese Theology</italic>, ed.

Achan’s sin caused the defeat of the whole army, and the death of his entire family.

This work is conducted by means of assigned reading, under stimulus, direction and advice of the Professor in personal conference.’ This particular course is with the list of reading courses given ‘in conference with Dr. Warfield and Dr. Hodge,’ so the expectation that it was Warfield who directed his reading in this area is quite plausible.

The Barthian rejection of natural theology means that Japanese religious or philosophical perceptions and reflections, as well as the vast literatures these have produced, are <italic>de jure</italic> excluded from theological discourse.</p></fn>

<fn id="fn46-0040573613484755"><label>46</label><p>In the summer of 1907, the 19-year-old Kagawa had a near-death experience that changed him forever. Before beginning seminary training at the Kobe Theological School, he was preaching in the slums of Toyohashi, a small town east of Nagoya. On the fortieth day of his street-preaching campaign, he was on the verge of collapse. “I began to feel horribly cold, but I determined, whatever happened, to finish my sermon. ‘In conclusion,’ I cried, ‘I tell you God is love, and I will affirm God’s love till I fall. Where there is love, God and life reveal themselves.’” He had developed a fever of 104 degrees, and the doctor told him he was unlikely to recover from this attack of tubercular pneumonia. His condition worsened, and fearing the end was near, the doctor told him to call his friends. Kagawa recalled the scene. “The sun was setting in the west. I could see its reflection on my pillow. For four hours I prayed, waiting for my last breath. Then there came a peculiar, mysterious experience—an ecstatic consciousness of God; a feeling that God was inside me and all around me. I felt a great ecstasy and joy. I coughed up a cupful of clotted blood. I could breathe again. The fever was reduced. I forgot to die. The doctor came back at nine-thirty. He was disappointed. He had written a certificate for my cremation and feared the people would call him a quack.” In Bradshaw, <italic>Unconquerable Kagawa</italic>, 82–83. He retold this story of divine healing in his autobiographical novel, <italic>Shisen wo Kowete</italic>, which was published in 1920, three years after his first trip to America and his studies at Princeton Theological Seminary and Princeton University. This novel went through 280 editions and sold 1,400,000 copies. While he was never one to wear his piety on his sleeve, throughout his life Kagawa practiced daily meditative Bible reading and silence and claimed to regularly enjoy an immediate and intuitive consciousness of God’s presence. Here is one such account of his sense of being “bathed in the light”: “I have had my share of religious exaltation that comes from being bathed in the light over many times. It is an ecstasy that defies description. We feel intuitively an absolute joy, which neither sex nor selfish desire nor covetousness nor fame can ever give us.” From Mutō Tomio, <italic>Complete Works of Kagawa Toyohiko</italic>, vol. 3 (Tokyo: Christian Sinbunsha, 1966), 67.</p></fn>

At the same time we do not despise the saints or think basely of them. For we acknowledge them to be living members of Christ and friends of God who have gloriously overcome the flesh and the world. Hence we love them as brothers, and also honor them; yet not with any kind of worship but by an honorable opinion of them and just praises of them. We also imitate them. For with ardent longings and supplications we earnestly desire to be imitators of their faith and virtues, to share eternal salvation with them, to dwell eternally with them in the presence of God, and to rejoice with them in Christ. And in this respect we approve of the opinion of St. Augustine in <italic>De Vera Religione:</italic> ‘Let not our religion be the cult of men who have died. For if they have lived holy lives, they are not to be thought of as seeking such honors; on the contrary, they want us to worship him by whose illumination they rejoice that we are fellow-servants of his merits. They are therefore to be honored by the way of imitation, but not to be adored in a religious manner, etc.’”</p></fn>
