<p><italic>Objective</italic>. To study the impact of family-centered rounds for general pediatrics inpatients. <italic>Methods</italic>. An observation tool and participant surveys was developed. The authors analyzed rounding time and rounds participants. Associations between family presence and participants’ satisfaction were analyzed. <italic>Results</italic>. Data were collected on 295 patients and from 257 staff members. Average rounding time was reduced with increased family and nurse presence (8.7 minutes with both, 12.7 minutes without family, <italic>P</italic> = .0001). Families reported high satisfaction regardless of participants. Families present on rounds reported increased knowledge of team members’ roles (54% vs 35%, <italic>P</italic> = .04). Attending physicians more often reported ease in managing rounds with families present. Senior residents perceived decreased autonomy with high family participation (11%) versus low family participation (70%; <italic>P</italic> = .02). Improved nurse satisfaction was associated with increased family and nurse participation. <italic>Conclusion</italic>. Family participation may shorten inpatient rounds. Families and staff were satisfied with family-centered rounds, though senior resident autonomy requires attention.</p>

<p>Patient- and family-centered care involves patients and families partnering with providers to make health care decisions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0009922811421002">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0009922811421002">2</xref></sup> In pediatric inpatients, family-centered rounds (FCRs) represent a key component of family-centered care. Bedside rounds historically included physicians only, whereas FCRs involve multidisciplinary teams and solicit family contributions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0009922811421002">3</xref></sup> The American Academy of Pediatrics advocates that “(hospital) rounds in the patients’ rooms with the family present be standard practice.”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0009922811421002">4</xref></sup> Recent work suggests that FCRs represent the most common format used by U.S. pediatric hospitalists.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0009922811421002">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>Research on FCRs in pediatrics has been limited, and a Cochrane review concluded that insufficient evidence existed to evaluate its impact.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0009922811421002">6</xref></sup> In 2007, Cincinnati Children’s Hospital described implementation of FCRs in mostly qualitative terms; they found families eager to participate in rounds and a trend toward earlier discharges.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0009922811421002">7</xref></sup> Another qualitative study of general pediatrics inpatients found that parents’ experiences participating in rounds were positive.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0009922811421002">8</xref></sup> Studies investigating details of FCRs such as rounding time and participant perspectives have focused on specialized populations: adolescents,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0009922811421002">9</xref></sup> children with cancer,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0009922811421002">10</xref></sup> critically ill children,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0009922811421002">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0009922811421002">13</xref></sup> and those undergoing cardiothoracic surgery.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0009922811421002">14</xref></sup> These studies suggest that FCRs may take slightly longer,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0009922811421002">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0009922811421002">12</xref></sup> but staff and parents may prefer them, whereas learners may feel that some aspects of teaching suffer.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0009922811421002">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0009922811421002">15</xref></sup> Nurses seem to strongly endorse FCR.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0009922811421002">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>Randomized trials of an FCR intervention are hindered by the inevitable cross-contamination of rounds participants. We designed an observational study that we believed would most objectively compare the impact of FCRs versus non-FCRs on participant perspectives of rounds. We tested the hypotheses that family participation during rounds is associated with (<italic>a</italic>) longer duration of rounds, (<italic>b</italic>) higher family satisfaction, and (<italic>c</italic>) staff perception of more difficulty managing rounds and less teaching. We also tested the hypothesis that greater nurse and family participation on rounds are associated with higher nurse satisfaction.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<sec id="section2-0009922811421002">
<title>Design</title>
<p>We conducted an observational study of attending rounds at an academic children’s hospital from June 2009 to February 2010. At our institution, there are 3 general pediatrics inpatient teams, each composed of an attending physician, senior resident, 2 interns, and 1 to 4 students covering an average of 10 patients. Attending physicians change service weekly, on Mondays. Formal attending rounds discuss those patients for whom the attending physician (hospitalist or academic generalist) is responsible. Rounds may include a bedside nurse, the unit’s nurse manager, a pharmacist, dietician, social worker, or interpreter. Attending physicians elect a rounding style; FCRs are encouraged but not mandated. All rounds involve walking around the unit, regardless of whether families participate. To encourage FCRs, our institution hosted Grand Rounds by a representative from Cincinnati Children’s Hospital 2 years before study onset.</p>
<p>We piloted all study procedures during June and July 2009. We collected data from July 24, 2009 through February 3, 2010 except mid-November 2009 through mid-January 2010 because of unusual staffing (changes in nurse/physician coverage combined with unusual patient cohorting procedures during the H1N1 influenza epidemic and severe snowstorms). Overall, we collected data for about 12 weeks. A research assistant completed an observation instrument on each team’s rounds once weekly. Observations occurred on Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays; we believed that data collected on Mondays could be affected by attending physician changes and data on Fridays could be affected by end-of-week resident and student evaluations. The study was approved by the hospital’s institutional review board, and informed consent was obtained from participants.</p>

<title>Measures</title>
<sec id="section4-0009922811421002">
<title>Rounds observation tool</title>
<p>We created an observational tool (available on request) to record information about rounds for each patient. The tool was developed after a literature review,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0009922811421002">3</xref></sup> modified with physician input, and piloted. It included a patient identifier and information about rounds participants. The research assistant used a stopwatch to record rounds start time (when the care team first started talking about the patient) and end time (when the final question or teaching point was completed) for each patient. This total time included any teaching relevant to the patient’s case, even if this occurred in the hallway or while walking to the next patient’s room. We also measured the time between the end of one presentation and the start of the next; we referred to this as “transition time” to the next patient. Any interruptions of rounds were included as time spent with the patient being rounded on, though typically pages were handled by a team member not directly involved in the presentation. For the day’s last patient, the moment when the team disbanded was recorded as that patient’s rounding end time.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0009922811421002">
<title>Family satisfaction with rounds</title>
<p>We developed a family satisfaction survey (11 questions, Likert-type scale 1-5) based on a literature review of existing instruments.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0009922811421002">16</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0009922811421002">19</xref></sup> Following rounds, the research assistant gave each parent/guardian a survey about “today’s rounds.” Each participant was given a study description in Spanish or English indicating that we were studying how doctors communicate with patients and families. Rounds were defined for families as “when the doctors came to discuss your child’s plan for the day.” Surveys were administered verbally via interpreter for non-English speakers. Family surveys were coded with a patient identifier linked to that patient’s observation data.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0009922811421002">
<title>Staff satisfaction with rounds</title>
<p>Based on existing measures of learners’ satisfaction with education and patient care,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0009922811421002">20</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0009922811421002">23</xref></sup> we created rounds satisfaction surveys for attending physicians, senior residents, interns, medical students, and nurses. Evaluators received nearly identical questions, though the nursing questionnaire included questions specific to nurses’ experiences. Surveys were piloted and modified during June and July 2009. Final surveys contained 7 questions and used a Likert-type scale of 1 to 5 with 1 being <italic>strongly disagree</italic> and 5 being <italic>strongly agree</italic>. All surveys were self-completed, pencil-and-paper questionnaires completed after rounds. Participants were asked about satisfaction with “today’s rounds.” Respondents were asked to reflect on the entire morning’s rounds—not those for any specific patient. Staff surveys were anonymous, but linked to the date.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0009922811421002">
<title>Analyses</title>
<p>For each rounds observation, we coded whether family and/or a nurse were present. We assigned each patient’s rounds data to 1 of 3 categories: no family present, family present but no nurse present, and family and nurse both present. We calculated the time spent discussing the patient using the start and stop times for each presentation. We also calculated the “transition time” for each patient. We used analysis of variance to compare mean times per patient for the three categories of rounds.</p>
<p>To test the relationship between rounding style and family satisfaction, we used χ<sup>2</sup> to compare the percentage who “strongly agreed” with each survey item for those who participated in formal attending rounds versus those who did not.</p>
<p>To test the relationship between rounds and staff satisfaction, we created a proxy variable to reflect the degree to which family participation occurred that day. We manually calculated the percent of that day’s patients for whom the family participated in rounds, and entered a “family participation” variable for each staff survey based on the associated date. Based on the observed distribution, we categorized family participation for each date as follows: ≤25%, 26% to 50%, or &gt;50%. We used χ<sup>2</sup> to test the relationship between the percentage of respondents who strongly agreed with each question on the staff survey versus the categorized “family participation” variable.</p>
<p>To test the relationship between FCR and nurse satisfaction, we created a proxy “nurse and family participation” variable for that day. For each day, we calculated the percentage of patients for whom the nurse and family participated in rounds, and categorized each day into ≤25%, 26% to 50%, or &gt;50% of that day’s rounds as including nurses and families. We used χ<sup>2</sup> to test the relationship between the percentage of respondents who strongly agreed with each survey item versus the categorized “nurse and family participation” variable. We created a composite nurse satisfaction score that was coded positively if the nurse strongly agreed with at least 3 of 4 questions dealing with his or her experience during rounds.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>Data were collected over 35 nonconsecutive days, reflecting rounds on 295 patients. A family member was present for 117 patients (40%) and a nurse present for 172 patients (58%). A nurse and family member were present for 76 patients (26%). The average daily census for observed teams was 8.3 (standard deviation [SD] = 1.7).</p>
<sec id="section9-0009922811421002">
<title>Time Spent on Rounds</title>
<p>Rounds lasted from 1 to 28 minutes per patient, with a mean of 9.2 minutes (SD = 5.6). Both time spent rounding per patient and transition time were significantly shorter when families were present during rounds (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0009922811421002">Table 1</xref>).</p>

<title>FCR and Staff Satisfaction</title>
<p>Staff completed 257 surveys (78 by medical students, 60 by interns, 59 by nurses, 31 by residents, and 29 by attending physicians). Family presence during attending rounds on any one day ranged from 0 to 92%. Overall, 34% of staff surveys were for days when ≤25% of patients had family present during rounds, 34% were for days where 26% to 50% of patients had family present, and 32% were for days where &gt;50% of patients had family present during rounds. Patient census was higher on days when more families participated in rounds (9.2 vs 8.6 vs 7, <italic>P</italic> &lt; .0001). Staff satisfaction with rounds did not vary by the team’s census.</p>
<p>Overall, staff agreed/strongly agreed that “it was easy to manage length of rounds,” “family contributions were helpful,” “families participated in decision making,” and disagreed that “patients and family concerns took too much time.” Staff more often strongly agreed that managing the length of rounds was easy for days when more families participated. Family participation was not consistently associated with responses to any of the other statements (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0009922811421002">Table 3</xref>). Perceptions of teaching were generally favorable, with most respondents reporting a sense of autonomy in patient management, comfort discussing cases with families present, and satisfaction with teaching quantity (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0009922811421002">Table 4</xref>). Senior residents were less likely to strongly agree they had enough autonomy on days when more families participated in rounds (11% vs 60% vs 70%, <italic>P</italic> = .02).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, the inclusion of families during formal attending rounds appeared efficient, as measured by residents’ and attending physicians’ perceptions that managing the length of rounds was easy. Indeed, FCRs were implemented more consistently when the census was higher, and total time spent discussing each patient’s case—including teaching time—was shorter when families were present. Studies in the intensive care unit suggest that FCRs do not take significantly longer than non-FCRs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0009922811421002">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0009922811421002">13</xref></sup> Family satisfaction was high and was not associated with participation in formal attending rounds. Similar to our previous experience,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0009922811421002">15</xref></sup> issues of senior resident autonomy arose.</p>
<p>FCR is believed to improve patient and family satisfaction by involving them in clinical decisions. In a small study of adolescents, researchers surveyed patients and staff during 2 weeks, the first featuring non-FCR, the second featuring FCR, and found that families were satisfied during both weeks.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0009922811421002">9</xref></sup> In another study, parents reported a “positive” experience with FCR, especially when nurses were included.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0009922811421002">8</xref></sup> Our study, which objectively compares satisfaction for families experiencing FCR versus non-FCR, found that families in each group were equally satisfied, although families experiencing FCR reported a better understanding of team members’ roles. This study was not powered to detect small differences observable in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0009922811421002">Table 2</xref> as statistically significant. We analyzed the family satisfaction data for differences by nurse presence during rounds and still found no differences in family satisfaction (data available on request). This lack of difference in family satisfaction with FCRs may suggest that the structure of rounds is not critical to families’ satisfaction. Further research can hopefully help further elucidate families’ experiences with different rounding styles and family-centered care generally. In this study, we did not characterize details of communication between providers and families; future studies could use audio and videotaping to assess these interactions.</p>
<p>In previous studies, residents and medical students have appreciated bedside rounds<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0009922811421002">24</xref></sup> but may fear being “grilled” by the attending physician in front of the family.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0009922811421002">25</xref></sup> FCRs may impair didactic teaching but improve nondidactic teaching, including offering communication modeling, and depends highly on the attending physician.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0009922811421002">15</xref></sup> The current study reinforces concerns about senior resident autonomy, suggesting that FCR facilitators pay special attention to this issue. We note the apparent distinct response pattern between interns and senior residents. Why medical students found family contributions less helpful with increasing family presence is uncertain; FCR’s impact on medical students has not been studied in detail.</p>
<p>Nurses have historically endorsed improved multidisciplinary communication.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0009922811421002">26</xref></sup> Our findings of improved nurse satisfaction on days with greater FCR implementation suggest that efforts to solicit nurse participation in FCR can be beneficial to nurses. Further studies should explore the impact of nurse and family participation in rounds on patients’ clinical outcomes.</p>
<p>Limitations of this study include the single site design. For example, our finding that FCRs are shorter may relate to the observation that attending physicians at our institution rarely examine patients during FCR. Also, the low incidence of complete FCR (family and nurse present) did not allow subgroup analyses to explore how factors such as a particular physician’s style or patient/family factors (language/child age) affected the relationship between FCR and participant satisfaction. Although our survey instruments were based on validated instruments, they were not independently validated. Because of our approach using percentage of family presence to estimate that day’s family-centeredness, one extreme encounter might have biased responders for the entire day. We used this approach because during the pilot we found that asking staff to complete a survey after every patient was too burdensome. Because surveys were anonymous, we could not adjust for multiple responses by the same staff member, though we reduced the likelihood of this bias by observing each team only once weekly. Whether a resident had continuity clinic that day may have influenced his or her responses, though a previous study suggested this was not a critical factor in residents’ satisfaction with FCR.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0009922811421002">15</xref></sup> Residents were never post-call because of our “night float” system. We did not control for patient acuity or social factors, and we did not observe rounds on weekends or holidays. There may be confounding factors associated with providers themselves; for instance, an attending physician with a stronger tendency toward FCR might conduct them more efficiently while giving senior residents less autonomy. With accounting for these limitations, we believe this objective observational study provides useful insights into the benefits and risks of FCR in a natural “nonlaboratory” environment.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>FCRs may take less time than non-FCRs. Overall we found that families and staff are satisfied with FCR, though particular attention should be paid to senior residents’ autonomy.</p>
