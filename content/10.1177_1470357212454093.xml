<abstract>
<p>In this study, the author draws upon a social semiotic framework, exploring the ways in which students can use visual semiotic resources while composing texts in literacy classroom contexts. His multi-case study involving three cases of students in primary-level classrooms focuses specifically on how several focal students created, accessed, and assembled sets of visual semiotic resources that they used while engaged in the literacy processes at hand. This study defines and develops the concept of a visual composing resource, and qualifies the range, scope, and type of visual resources that were available to the students while they engaged in literacy processes in various classroom settings. The author also illustrates how the students brought these sets of visual composing resources into a complex interaction with the semiotic assemblages that they were producing in each context, revealing important aspects of early literacy processes that incorporate visuality.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>In this article, I carve out an inquiry that specifically highlights the visual mode as it is used in connection with reading and writing processes in classroom settings. Literacy scholars have explored the promise of the visual mode for supporting, extending, and enabling student engagements with literacies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1470357212454093">Heath and Wolf, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1470357212454093">Mavers, 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1470357212454093">2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1470357212454093">Pahl, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1470357212454093">Ranker, 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1470357212454093">2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1470357212454093">Van Leeuwen, 2000</xref>). For example, researchers have explored how drawing and other types of visual information can serve as important resources for young students who are learning to write (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1470357212454093">Anning, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1470357212454093">Genishi et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1470357212454093">Hopperstad, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1470357212454093">Kenner and Kress, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1470357212454093">Pahl, 2003</xref>). Literacy scholars have also explored how young students use drawn elements from their interests in video games, webpages, television programs, and comic books in order to realize their narratives in classroom contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1470357212454093">Dyson, 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1470357212454093">2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1470357212454093">Ranker, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Another related area of interest amongst literacy researchers has been the unique visual affordances of various digital media. Since digital media are often highly dependent upon the visual mode, they offer new opportunities for students to engage in literacy processes. For example, literacy researchers have looked at how students intermix visuality and language through creation of digital videos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1470357212454093">Ranker, 2008</xref>), websites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1470357212454093">Walsh, 2007</xref>), and Powerpoint presentations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1470357212454093">Mahiri, 2006</xref>). Literacy scholars have also productively used a semiotic framework in order to understand how modes besides language can be a part of student literacy development and processes at school (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1470357212454093">Harste et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1470357212454093">Hull and Nelson, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1470357212454093">Labbo, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1470357212454093">Siegel, 1995</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1470357212454093">2006</xref>).</p>
<p>In this article, I explore this terrain by presenting examples from a cross-case analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1470357212454093">Merriam, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1470357212454093">Stake, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1470357212454093">Yin, 2009</xref>) of three cases of students (ages 5–11) composing meanings in literacy contexts in public school classrooms. In this study, I apply the social semiotic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1470357212454093">Kress, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1470357212454093">Van Leeuwen, 2004</xref>) concept of a ‘semiotic resource’ in order to examine visual aspects of the composing processes of young students engaging with literacies in classroom contexts. According to social semiotic theory, through their meaning-making processes (speaking, writing, drawing, etc.), individuals use various semiotic resources that are available within the social context in an ongoing process of producing and communicating meanings. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1470357212454093">Van Leeuwen (2004</xref>: 285) defined semiotic resources as ‘the actions, materials and artifacts we use for communicative purposes … together with the ways in which these resources can be organized’. In addition, he made a distinction between a sign and a resource (the latter being a broader and more flexible term): ‘In social semiotics the term “resource” is preferred, because it avoids the impression that “what a sign stands for” is somehow pre-given, and not affected by its use’ (p. 3). In this study, I explore and develop the concept of a semiotic resource in a way that is applicable to classroom composing contexts, asking what constitutes such a resource and how students use visual semiotic resources in these contexts.</p>

<title>Visual Composing Resources</title>
<p>Focusing on broader contexts of semiosis than I do in this article, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1470357212454093">Jewitt and Oyama (2001)</xref> provided examples of visual semiotic resources, such as point of view, contact, distance, salience, etc. These are resources of the visual mode that meaning makers can use in various ways to achieve visual meanings within social contexts. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1470357212454093">Mavers (2009)</xref>, focusing specifically on a literacy classroom context, identified the semiotic resources of drawing, for example, as including such elements as lines, shapes, positioning, and orientation. I seek to build upon these valuable insights into the character of visual semiotic resources by specifying visual composing resource use across the three case studies that I present. The definitions of visual semiotic resources noted above are useful in capturing broad and design-related modal affordances that occur through the use of visual media. However, within the micro-semiotic and ‘situated’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1470357212454093">Barton and Hamilton, 2000</xref>) visual semiotic processes of primary-level literacy classrooms, particular types of visual semiotic resources come into view – a topic that I explore in this article.</p>
<p>One of my primary interests in this study is thus to build upon the concept of a visual semiotic resource by defining what I am calling a <italic>visual composing resource</italic>: a visual semiotic resource that students use in composing contexts at school. I do this by examining how the students used visual semiotic resources in connection with reading or writing processes in order to engage in school-based literacies. I introduce this concept since, by definition, semiotic resources can be used for any communicative or representational purpose, and their forms will depend upon those particular purposes. When examining any particular type of situated semiotic process, particular forms of and ways of conceptualizing visual semiotic resources become more relevant than others. Visual semiotic resources from different domains of practice, such as fashion design, painting, webpage design, broadcast journalism, or advertising, for example, will take on different forms, since the purposes of semiosis are specific within each domain. I thus define visual composing resources as a subset of visual semiotic resources that pertain to a particular domain of situated practice: composing texts in literacy classrooms. Throughout this article, I use the term ‘visual composing resource’ (rather than the broader term, ‘visual semiotic resource’) in order to capture a specificity that is relevant for pedagogical insights into classroom composing contexts. Naming visual composing resources as a specific subset of visual semiotic resources emphasizes the insight that there is an extremely broad spectrum of possibilities for what might constitute a visual semiotic resource, with many different possible subtypes depending upon the domain of situated practice under question. This approach also emphasizes the socially situated character of semiotic processes. In addition, though many aspects of the students’ composing processes could also have been described using the term ‘design’, I incorporate the term ‘composing’ since it resonates directly with discourses on literacy education where text construction is the purpose at hand, and the processes involved with arriving at a completed text are of pedagogical interest (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1470357212454093">Murray, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1470357212454093">Smagorinsky, 2006</xref>).</p>

<title>Focus of Study</title>
<p>In this study, since I examined the ways in which the students used visual semiotic resources in order to compose texts as semiotic ensembles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1470357212454093">Kress, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1470357212454093">Mavers, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1470357212454093">Pahl, 2009</xref>), conceptualizations of ‘text’ deriving from social semiotics played a key role in framing my notion of a visual composing resource (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1470357212454093">Halliday, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1470357212454093">Kress, 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1470357212454093">2010</xref>). In literacy classroom contexts, where textual composition is the focus, visual semiotic resources take on particular forms that I explore, qualify, and illustrate in this article. Within a social semiotic perspective, ongoing processes of semiosis are ‘punctuated’ or ‘momentarily brought to standstill in textual form’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1470357212454093">Kress, 2001</xref>: 141). I thus understood the students’ compositions at various points in time as movements toward punctuations of their visual composing processes, representing ‘cross-sections’ of their overall and ongoing semiotic (composing) processes. My central research questions in this study were: What constitutes a visual composing resource in each case? What types of visual composing resources do the students access, create, assemble, and use? How do the students arrange visual composing resources in their literacy processes?</p>
<p>As I pursued these questions, I found that that the students accessed, created, and assembled sets of visual composing resources that differed in origin, type, and scope. These resource sets consisted of all the visual composing resources that I identified as surfacing while the students composed a single multimodal text, thus constituting much of the visual–multimodal potential available to the students while composing that text. Because of my focus on the students’ establishment of these visual <italic>resource sets</italic>, I refer to the aspects of their composing processes relating to these resource sets as assemblage processes. As a type of arrangement process, the notion of semiotic assemblage captures a particular type of semiotic process involving the collection of individual semiotic resources over time in the process of creating some type of textual arrangement.</p>
<p>The character of many of the visual composing resources that I identified, such as drawings and photographs, were modally specific (visual). Others, such as movies and video games were, in actuality, multimodal, yet highly visual or visually inflected. However, because of my focus on the visual mode and the role it played in the students’ composing processes, I also categorized these visually inflected, multimodal resources as visual composing resources. The types of visual composing resources that I identified included the following: discrete visual textual elements/features, visual textual components/designs, and visually inflected texts as a whole. Examples of whole texts that the students used as visual resources included the following: movies, video games, photographs, student-produced drawings, comic books, and class video drafts. I identified discrete textual elements as individual parts of the specific text at hand, such as the following: specific movie and video game segments or plot elements, specific elements of drawings, individual characters in books, and individual images from webpages. I defined textual components, occurring within a ‘broader’ level of discourse than the discrete resources, including organizational elements such as visual designs, story grammars, or genre features that played a structural role in the students’ text formation. These resources included genre and design-level textual components such as the following: battle sequences, book covers, comic book frames/panels, plot/story elements, and a video composing software interface. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1470357212454093">Table 1</xref> summarizes my definitions and examples of the three types of visual composing resources that I identified.</p>

In developing these case studies, I drew upon qualitative (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1470357212454093">Corbin and Strauss, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1470357212454093">Glesne, 1999</xref>) and qualitative case study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1470357212454093">Dyson and Genishi, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1470357212454093">Merriam, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1470357212454093">Yin, 2009</xref>) research methods.

<p>I selected the individual cases based upon the criterion that the students were engaged in composing processes—such as writing, reading (including visual reading), drawing, and digital video production—that significantly involved the visual mode and visual semiotic resources. I also selected cases representing primary school students engaged in literacy processes across a range of composing contexts so that a wider range of visual resources could come into view. My selection of one case study that involved primarily visual reading, and another that incorporated visual reading, was consistent with my aim to examine a range of semiotic processes in order to broaden my development of the concept of a visual composing resource. I thus conceive of the process of reading as a process of composing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1470357212454093">Squire, 1983</xref>) or designing meaning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1470357212454093">Kress, 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1470357212454093">2010</xref>) that is similar to other types of semiotic, meaning-making processes that I examined (drawing, writing, and digital video production).</p>

<sec id="section6-1470357212454093">
<title>Data analysis</title>
<p>My unit of analysis was the visual semiotic resource, which I specified through this study as a visual composing resource. This unit emerged as the three case studies that I draw upon in this article were related to one another through cross-case analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1470357212454093">Merriam, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1470357212454093">Stake, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1470357212454093">Yin, 2009</xref>). Due to my theoretical focus on visual resources and semiotic arrangement, the case studies that I draw upon in this article were ‘formalized’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1470357212454093">Firestone and Herriott, 1984</xref>) over time. This meant that the cases were drawn upon for their contribution to this theoretical focus rather than their ‘intrinsic’ characteristics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1470357212454093">Stake, 2006</xref>). This led to my focus on the students’ uses of visual semiotic resources in their composing processes, rather than a focus on each case study more generally.</p>
<p>Using methods of coding and constant comparison (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1470357212454093">Corbin and Strauss, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1470357212454093">Glaser and Strauss, 1967</xref>), I developed the following analytical subcategories: type of visual resource, origin of the visual resource, and medium of the resource. Since the concept of ‘text’ serves as a key grounding idea in social semiotic approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1470357212454093">Halliday, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1470357212454093">Kress, 2010</xref>), and was central to the students’ classroom-based literacy processes, I used it to sharpen my definition of what constituted a visual composing resource. As a result of this focus, I identified three types of visual composing resources as part of the students’ semiotic arrangement processes: discrete textual features, textual components, and whole texts. I identified the students’ semiotic arrangement processes by triangulating my data sources in order to locate composing junctures as incidents in the data where the students identifiably used visual semiotic resources in concert with one another and/or with textual resources while engaged in socially defined composing processes. I then analyzed these visual resources in relation to one another in order to characterize the visual semiotic arrangement processes and resource sets that the students used in the process of participating in the literacy practices at hand.</p>

<title>Young Students’ Uses of Visual Composing Resources in a Variety of Classroom Settings</title>
<p>In this section, I will present each of the three case studies that were summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1470357212454093">Table 2</xref>. I describe the students’ composing processes, highlighting the types of visual composing resources that they accessed and used. I will do this by presenting a description of a focal composing juncture or event from each case study. Within my description of each focal composing juncture, I will illustrate the students’ visual semiotic assemblage processes, the character of the visual resources that they assembled, and the visual composing resource sets as they emerged within these events.</p>
<sec id="section8-1470357212454093">
<title>Young students assembling visual semiotic resources while composing meanings about animals</title>
<p>In this section, I will focus on a juncture in the composing processes of two kindergarten students, Sarianna and Jennifer. During the project featured in this section, the students worked in pairs to study various animals (Sarianna and Jennifer’s focal animal was spiders). As part of the project, the students engaged in activities involving reading, writing, talking, and drawing, as the class collaborated in the production of a whole-class video on the topic of animals. They wrote and drew in response to visually studying the books, creating drawings that were scanned and inserted into the digital video. This digital video comprised short sections featuring each of the animals. The students’ own writing and drawings, which represented their findings about their animals, served as referents/scripts as they audio-recorded their narration for the video.</p>
<p>The first visual composing resource that I identified in analyzing the focal composing juncture that I feature in this section was the draft of the class video. On that same morning, the class had viewed the video draft, which included scans of several of the students’ drawings of their focal animals. After the class watched the video draft, the teacher instructed the students to use the books to gain information (visual and, when possible, linguistic) about the focal animal’s appearance (size, color, etc.). She also prompted the students to use writing to label various aspects of their drawings of animals. The students’ task was thus to use the books about animals in the course of drawing their focal animal, labeling various parts of the drawing, and attempting to write the animal’s name, color, and size. After the teacher had set up the inquiry and composing task, the students then set to work.</p>
<p>With the overall purposes of the whole-class video as a visual backdrop, during the focal composing juncture, Sarianna and Jennifer assembled additional visual composing resources. For example, they referred to photographs of spiders in books from the local public library as they completed their own drawings of spiders. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1470357212454093">Figure 1</xref> features the area where Jennifer and Sarianna worked that day. The students used the open book at the left of the figure (with a depiction of a spider visible on its open pages). On the table, at the bottom-left of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1470357212454093">Figure 1</xref>, is Jennifer’s writing and drawing work, and Sarianna’s work is to the right of this. Referring to the picture as they drew, the available images of the spider served as important visual semiotic resources for the students as they created their own drawings.</p>

<p>As they continued to engage in these semiotic assemblage processes, the students introduced their own drawings of their focal animals as visual resources. The meaning potential of their drawings was thus brought into a relationship with the already-available visual resources (the class video draft and photographs in the books). These drawings are featured in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1470357212454093">Figure 2</xref>. In addition, specific parts of their drawings served as visual resources for their literacy processes as they labeled them with writing. The following is a bit of the students’ conversation as Sarianna consulted with Jennifer and Veronica, a student seated nearby, about how to write the word ‘eyes’ as she labeled the eyes of the spider in her drawing.</p>
<speech>
<speaker>Sarianna:</speaker>
<p>That was easy! All I had to spell was ‘eyes’. The ‘I’ and the ‘S’ spells eyes.</p></speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Veronica:</speaker>
<p>eyes [slowly pronouncing the word in an effort to hear phonemic units].</p></speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Jennifer:</speaker>
<p>Y—there’s a ‘Y’ at the end.</p></speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Sarianna:</speaker>
<p>eyes [slowly pronouncing].</p></speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Jennifer:</speaker>
<p>Can I do something?</p></speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Sarianna:</speaker>
<p>That makes it a ‘T’.</p></speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Jennifer:</speaker>
<p>No. It’s an ‘I’. It’s a capital ‘I’ like this.</p></speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Veronica:</speaker>
<p>eyes [slowly pronouncing].</p></speech>
<p>As seen in this conversation, the students used specific parts of their own drawings as focal points for their own writing. For example, next to her drawing, at the top of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1470357212454093">Figure 2</xref>, Sarianna has labeled the body (‘BODE’) and eyes (‘ISYS’) of her drawing of a spider. In Jennifer’s drawing, at the bottom of the figure, she has labeled the spider’s legs (‘LESH’). Thus, as the students began to write, they were prompted to focus more intently on aspects of their own drawings, adding another type of resource to their visual composing resource set.</p>

<title>Visually reading a comic book: a young student’s visual semiotic assemblage processes</title>
<p>In this section, I will illustrate how Jeremy, a first-grade student, collaboratively engaged in semiotic assemblage processes in order to visually read a comic book issue featuring the Incredible Hulk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1470357212454093">Marvel Comics, 2005</xref>). Though he could not read the written text, he assembled visual composing resources drawn from across home and school contexts in a way that allowed him to unlock the meaning of the comic book. In the comic book issue that Jeremy read, Hulk enters into a confrontation with the Abomination, another monster-like creature. Hulk enters the story as Bruce Banner, Hulk’s human form. Bruce travels by bus to witness the destruction that the Abomination has wrought on a small town, seeking out the Abomination in order to convince him to cease his destruction. Bruce had known the Abomination’s human form, Emil, since they had worked together in a laboratory some time ago. When their laboratory experiment went awry, Bruce and Emil accidentally released a radioactive substance that initiated their ability to transform. However, something went wrong with Emil’s exposure to the substance and he did not acquire the ability to transform back into his human form. He is therefore stuck in his form as the Abomination. As Bruce and the Abomination begin to talk, the Abomination becomes angry, blames his state on Bruce, and begins to attack him. This initiates Bruce’s transformation into the Hulk, and the epic battle between Hulk and the Abomination ensues.</p>
<p>There are several subtleties to this story that Jeremy was able to decode through his uses of various visual composing resources. First, Jeremy identifiably used the panels that are characteristic of comic books in order to identify points of focus in the story. For example, at a particularly important juncture in the reading event, Jeremy was looking intently at a panel in which the results of the Abomination’s destruction were apparent, depicting smashed-up cars, roads, and buildings. Below is a bit of conversation from this juncture in Jeremy’s reading of this <italic>Hulk</italic> issue. (As I observed Jeremy reading, I asked questions to elicit his understandings of the story.) Jeremy’s classmate, Noel, was reading nearby and joined in with the conversation.</p>
<speech>
<speaker>Jeremy:</speaker>
<p>He did that [pointing to Bruce Banner, indicating that he, as the Hulk, caused the damage depicted in the focal comic book panel].</p></speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Noel:</speaker>
<p>He didn’t do that.</p></speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Author:</speaker>
<p>You don’t think he did that?</p></speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Noel:</speaker>
<p>No, there was another one. Another guy who did that.</p></speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Jeremy:</speaker>
<p>Yeah, he did [flipping pages to look back at the cover]. <italic>He</italic> did that [pointing to a large illustration of the Abomination].</p></speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Noel:</speaker>
<p>No, it was him [pointing to an illustration of the Hulk]. Maybe it was <italic>him</italic> pointing to the Abomination].</p></speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Jeremy:</speaker>
<p>Yeah, it was. He’s [the Abomination] bigger than him [Hulk].</p></speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Author:</speaker>
<p>Who is that guy [pointing to the Abomination]?</p></speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Jeremy:</speaker>
<p>That’s his friend.</p></speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Noel:</speaker>
<p>Yeah, that’s his friend.</p></speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Jeremy:</speaker>
<p>That’s his friend—because in the game [video game] that’s his friend.</p></speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Author:</speaker>
<p>Why is he fighting his friend?</p></speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Jeremy:</speaker>
<p>Because he wasn’t like that and he didn’t used to have problems. But they put some stuff on him and it made him change. I saw the movie.</p></speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Noel:</speaker>
<p>Me, too.</p></speech>
<p>During this conversation, Jeremy began by incorrectly identifying Bruce Banner as the source of the destruction that is depicted in the panel, and then subsequently altered his interpretation on this point. This act of interpretation revealed several visual resources that Jeremy assembled as he read. For example, as Noel entered into the conversation, he questioned Jeremy’s identification of Bruce Banner (the Hulk) as the cause of the depicted destruction. As a result, in order to further explore his interpretation, Jeremy brought the cover of the comic book as a visual resource into interaction with the other available visual resources. Using the comic book cover as a point of reference, Jeremy then incorrectly indicated to Noel that ‘he [the Abomination] did that [the destruction]’. The cover of the comic book issue featured a close-up, full-cover illustration of the Hulk and the Abomination engaged in battle, which allowed Jeremy to definitively identify the two main characters of the story.</p>
<p>As seen in the conversation above, Jeremy then provided more information about the Abomination, indicating that he is the Hulk’s friend in a video game that features the two characters. This was the next visual resource that was visible at this juncture as part of the semiotic arrangement processes that Jeremy was using to visually read the comic book. Because I was unfamiliar with the story at the time, and because it seemed counterintuitive to me that Hulk should be engaged in combat with his friend, I asked, ‘Why is he fighting his friend’? At this point, Jeremy explained that the Abomination ‘wasn’t like that and he didn’t used to have problems. But they put some stuff [radioactive substance] on him and it made him change. I saw the movie.’ A movie featuring the Hulk was thus the next visual semiotic resource that became visible as part of Jeremy’s visual semiotic resource set. Specifically, he used this movie (a highly visual resource) as an additional source of information about the Abomination, and the relationship between the Hulk and the Abomination.</p>
<p>Jeremy also used the visual representation of the iconic figure of the Hulk himself as an interpretive aid and interactant in his visual semiotic arrangement processes during this reading event. Iconic characters are a feature prominent in comic books that allow for quick recognition so that the narrative can move straight into action rather than character development, which is not necessary due to the recognizability of the character (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1470357212454093">McCloud, 1993</xref>). The available depictions of the iconic character, the Abomination, also served as visual resources in this iconic way and were thus part of Jeremy’s visual composing resource set.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1470357212454093">Table 4</xref> summarizes the set of visual composing resources that were part of Jeremy’s visual resource set at this composing juncture: iconic character depictions of the Hulk, iconic character depictions of the Abomination, comic book panels, the comic book cover, a Hulk movie, specific segments of a Hulk movie, a Hulk video game, and segments of a Hulk video game. Moving from left to right across <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1470357212454093">Table 4</xref>, the columns also indicate the type and origin of each of the individual visual resources that I identified as part of his semiotic resource set. Jeremy assembled all three types of visual semiotic resources that I identified: discrete textual resources, textual components, and whole texts. Some of the resources, such as those associated with the comic book he was reading, were immediately present during the focal composing juncture. Others, such as the video game and movie, were not physically present and originated with experiences at home with these media.</p>

<title>Student uses of visual composing resources while creating a digital video</title>
<p>This example features two fifth-grade students, Kendra and Nicole, as they composed a digital video together about three prominent females in US African-American civil rights history: Fannie Lou Hamer, Charlayne Hunter-Gault, and Coretta Scott King. The students used digital images of the focal women that they found on the web and imported them into the digital video-production program as visual resources for their composing. These were visual resources that originated as texts and textual elements of webpages, which the students then transformed into visual elements within their own video. Based upon what images were needed (to correspond with their emerging written text), the girls conducted web searches to locate images. The students saved the images in a file on the computer and then imported them into the video and correlated them with audio tracks, which the students authored, based upon their book and web-based research.</p>
<p>The video-composing program that the students used afforded a particular set of constraints and possibilities. The video composing interface, and the unfolding drafts of the video that it afforded, served as visual resources that influenced the students’ composing pathways. These visual resources, in contrast to the digital images as resources, came in the form of an ongoing design grammar that influenced the students’ work in important ways. As seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1470357212454093">Figure 3</xref>, this interface afforded a large focal screen that the user can use to zero in on a particular image. In the figure, this large focal screen features the students’ current work on a title slide for their chapter on Charlayne Hunter-Gault, an influential African-American female journalist whom the students studied. In addition, it afforded a ‘clipboard’, or a place where images could be stored and later inserted and arranged within a timeline (small rectangles at the right-hand side of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1470357212454093">Figure 3</xref>). The timeline, along the bottom of the screen, was divided into the following ‘tracks’ (from top to bottom), as seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1470357212454093">Figure 4</xref>: still images, moving video, title slides, spoken audio, and music.</p>

<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1470357212454093-fig4.tif"/></fig>
<p>As Nicole and Kendra composed the video, they assembled bits and pieces of these various tracks as they became available (by either finding them or producing them). Two of the images of Charlayne Hunter-Gault that the students had imported into the still image section of the timeline are visible in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1470357212454093">Figure 3</xref>. As certain areas of the tracks were filled in with images and sound recordings, there were blank spaces left in the timeline that served as visual resources, cueing the students into accessing or producing other resources (both linguistic and visual). This interface offered the students a set of spaces and mechanism for importing and arranging images in relation to one another in order to communicate the meanings that they were authoring about their subject matter. For example, as they discussed their work (seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1470357212454093">Figure 3</xref>), they realized that they needed to move back to writing an audio narrative that they could import into the video and coordinate with the images of Charlayne Hunter-Gault. Below is a bit of their conversation as they searched for images in this way:</p>
<speech>
<speaker>Nicole:</speaker>
<p>Okay, I need to make this one go a little longer [referring to the length that an image was to remain on the screen]. Wait, we don’t have the talking in there for her. Did you write the part for her?</p></speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Kendra:</speaker>
<p>I’m not done yet, but it’s gonna be long. So you can put lots of time for her. That’s what I can do—get back to working on that.</p></speech>
<p>The students’ visual work within the video production program prompted further research and writing, which they worked on during the next few work sessions as they wrote narration for the audio track on Charlayne Hunter-Gault. As they realized that they needed more information, they returned to book reading, web-based research, and note taking. In this way, they moved seamlessly back and forth between the linguistic and visual mode in their accessing and uses of the available composing resources. In another sense, the drafts of the final video themselves—shaped by the program interface and constantly changing in form—served as visual resources. As their movie display changed, based upon their ongoing composing, this visual resource afforded the students a means of visually conceptualizing their project and the work that needed to be done next in order to complete their video.</p>
<p>Through the process of creating their video, the students assembled and linked uses of a variety of visual resources: discrete images from many different web sources, drafts of the videos (which fed back into further images searches), and the video composition program’s interface itself. This visual semiotic resource set is summarized, along with an indication of the type and origin of the individual resources, in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-1470357212454093">Table 5</xref>. These visual resources were assembled over time in relation to one another, and came into close interaction with written resources as the students researched and wrote their narratives to accompany the images in their video. Their accessing of resources was patterned according to the designs offered up by the composing interface, as well as the school-based purpose of creating a documentary video about a research topic.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The array of visual composing resources that it is possible for students to use in their assemblage processes at school differ significantly in scope and size, and afford distinct possibilities according to the purposes of the composing processes at hand. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1470357212454093">Figure 5</xref> features a summary of the types of visual composing resources that I identified in this multi-case study. I have created this typology as a heuristic for conceptualizing visual composing resources and adding to the range of what might constitute a visual semiotic resource. It is meant to add to and complement other approaches to understanding visual semiosis by offering a typology centered specifically around the concept of texts (and student construction of school-based texts) as a defining element. Given the complexity of social semiotic processes in situated contexts, this heuristic is not as a categorization that accounts for all possible ways of conceptualizing visual composing resources. Other angles on this phenomenon and approaches to understanding visual semiotic resources will have overlaps with, yet slightly different foci than I presented in this article. For example, what I refer to as textual components also resonates with visual semiotic resources such as point of view, salience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1470357212454093">Jewitt and Oyama, 2001</xref>) orientation, positioning, etc. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1470357212454093">Mavers, 2009</xref>), as well as ‘available designs’, which include ‘the “grammars” of various semiotic systems: the grammars of languages, and the grammars of other semiotic systems such as film, photography, or gesture’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1470357212454093">New London Group, 2000</xref>: 20). These ‘grammars’ resonate with concepts of genre and style and other patterned ways of textual organization.</p>

<p>When considering this heuristic, it is also important to reiterate that what I named as visual composing resources were, in fact, often highly visual multimodal resources—what I referred to as visually inflected multimodal resources. However, foregrounding the visual mode allowed me to explore its specific potential in multimodal composing processes. Such an approach is sometimes necessary to produce modally specific knowledge, since all semiotic processes are, ultimately, multimodal in one way or another. For example, the acts of writing or reading are often characterized as linguistic processes. However, gestural and visual modes also play major roles during reading and writing processes since written language is presented visually on the page or screen, and produced gesturally using a pen or a keyboard. Highlighting or foregrounding one mode, as I did in this article, allows a temporary analytical focus that lifts one mode up out of the highly complex multimodal backdrop in order to examine the potential or specific characteristic of that mode as it operates within a multimodal backdrop, thus allowing mode-specific knowledge to be produced.</p>
<p>This cross-case analysis indicated that visual composing resources originate from both in-school and out-of-school contexts. In addition, visual resources emerge or are created during the composing process. For example, as they are being composed, drafts of videos can serve as a referent or framework for making meaning through writing. Some of the focal students in this cross-case analysis also produced their own written and drawn texts and textual features, which they then used in further composing processes. They also used these created resources in conjunction with already-available visual resources, such as digital images found on the web or images in books. During visually inflected composing processes, students can access and combine available visual resources (from various texts and contexts) and bring them into an intertextual relationship with the text (or unfolding draft) that they are currently composing. Students’ composing processes can thus be conceptualized as semiotic processes in which texts, textual components, and discrete textual features are taken up from the composing context and re-assembled within new texts.</p>
<p>The visually inflected resources that the students assembled came through a variety of media that both were and were not physically present during the composing junctures. Many of the media that Jeremy used, for example, including the comic book, film, and video game, were not immediately present, but rather originated from experiences with these media at home and during past events. These ‘internal’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1470357212454093">Kress, 2010</xref>) visual meaning potentials that he had created based upon past experiences with these media, however, became visible during the focal composing juncture as he used them to compose meanings about the comic. Visually inflected media that are immediately present or created within semiotic junctures can also provide visual semiotic resources to students. For example, as Sarianna and Jennifer composed meanings about animals, they used immediately present media such as books and their own drawings. They also used a resource that was not physically present at the focal composing juncture: the class video draft as a sort of ‘backdrop’ or ‘framing’ resource. Visual resources thus also occur as different types according to their use and scope: some are used in a diffuse way over time, while others are used at discrete points in time and then abandoned.</p>
<sec id="section12-1470357212454093">
<title>Visual composing resources in composing processes and arrangements</title>
<p>As I charted out how the students brought visual composing resources into interaction with one another, I found that some of these visual composing resources were included in the final textual arrangements that the students created, while others were only used in the process of creating these texts. On this point, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1470357212454093">Kress (2010</xref>: 145) indicated the following:<disp-quote>
<p>That is the issue: ‘making meaning material’ in some way, making meanings real in ‘realizations’. Meanings-as-resource become material ‘arrangements’ as <italic>texts</italic> and other semiotic <italic>objects</italic> … <italic>Fixing</italic> and <italic>framing</italic> entails a momentary interruption of the ceaseless flow of semiosis, provoked by some event, action, process …The flow of semiosis is ‘punctuated’ in some way.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1470357212454093">Kress (2010)</xref> noted above, at moments of punctuation, arrangements take on material forms as texts and other results of semiotic processes. In this cross-case analysis, as in many literacy classrooms, the textual result or goal of the flow of students’ semiosis at any given semiotic juncture constituted the moment of punctuation defined by the social context. The characteristics, values, and discourses around text production defined the moment of punctuation as key junctures where texts came into form or became completed by a certain required point in time, such as the end of the project or work period. Kendra and Nicole’s punctuated textual arrangements were the video drafts, written pieces, and the finished video. Jennifer and Sarianna’s punctuated ensembles or arrangements were the written and drawn pieces that they submitted after the various work sessions to be included in the class video. In Jeremy’s case, his punctuated arrangement was his overall reading of the comic book.</p>
<p>My cross-case analysis also indicated that students used broader sets of visual semiotic resources in the <italic>process</italic> of producing visual–textual arrangements. Punctuated semiotic arrangements—as contrasted with the semiotic arrangement processes using visual resources that result in these arrangements—are characterized by their coherence as texts or acts of communication. As the students composed toward a textual result or moment of punctuation, they used various semiotic resources from the resource set, collecting and arranging them as the composing juncture unfolded, and using them in relation to one another as needed. The visual resource sets and their resulting arrangements thus depended upon one another, interacted with one another, and constituted one another. The interactive relationship between semiotic arrangement processes and their resulting arrangements is thus complex. For example, some visual semiotic resources appeared as elements of both resource sets and their resulting arrangements, while others were only used temporarily or as part of the process of composing, not making it to the moment of punctuation.</p>
<p>For example, some of the images that Nicole and Kendra found on the web ended up in the final text, while others did not. In addition, in their case, other visual composing resources, such as the video drafts and the video-composing program, were not part of the punctuated text, but, rather, left their traces on the moment of punctuation. In Jennifer and Sarianna’s case, their arrangements needed to be realized in written/drawn form on a piece of paper by the end of each work session so that they could be scanned and imported into the class video. Visual resources such as the photographs of spiders and the class video drafts were accessed and used while composing, leaving traces on the punctuated text, yet not materially realized as part of the text. In Jeremy’s reading processes, the relationship between his visual composing resource set and his arrangement at the moment of punctuation took on a slightly different form due to his engagement in a different semiotic process (reading). Since his arrangement did not take on a graphic form, the composing resources that were part of his accessed visual resource set were present only as traces left in his discussion as he discussed the meaning he was making of the comic book story.</p>

<title>Literacy implications</title>
<p>Though my analytical focus was on the visual, it is in the interaction between the students’ uses of visual resources and their uses of written or printed resources from other modes that the implications for conceptualizing multimodal literacies comes into view. As the students engaged in multimodal composing processes, they brought linguistic semiotic resources into complex sets of linkages with visual composing resources. These linguistic and visual semiotic resources were intricately intertwined and part of the same meaning potential. The linguistic semiotic resources that the students coordinated with their uses of visual composing resources included the following: their own writing, specific aspects or parts of their own writing, their own spoken utterances, written texts from webpages, certain aspects of written texts from webpages, and narrative elements of stories, amongst others. These semiotic linkages were created as the students arranged their own writing and reading processes with elements of their video drafts, drawings, and other types of created and available visual representations.</p>
<p>A conceptualization of what constitutes a visual composing resource has the potential to assist literacy educators as they identify the available visual resources in a given composing context and consider how to strategically add more useful visual resources. Such an approach would involve a heightened deliberateness to make photographs, drawing materials, visual technologies, etc. available, as well as considering the subcomponents of these visual texts as potential resources for making meaning in relation to written language. As their own students are engaged in literacy processes, literacy educators can also use knowledge about the character of visual composing resources in order to conceptualize which resources their students are using and creating. In addition, since visual composing resources emerge during the composing process, often from unexpected sources or in unexpected ways, curricula with permeable boundaries that allow out-of-school cultural terrains to enter into the school space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1470357212454093">Dyson, 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1470357212454093">2003</xref>) would support student efforts to compose with visual resources. Permeable curricula also allow for visual resources that originate out-of-school to move into interaction with composing resources that originate from within the classroom context.</p>
<p>Allowing students to create their own resources (through drawing and video production, for example) during literacy events at school can open up the range of possible visual composing resources available to students. The findings from my cross-case analysis also indicated that the students needed ample time and opportunity in order to access and produce visual composing resources that exceeded what was provided or made already available. A certain amount of divergence and exploration of multiple possible composing directions was also central to the students’ ability to access and produce resources that could not be anticipated by a teacher in advance. Not all accessed and produced composing resources will make their way into the final composition, arrangement, or text—yet they still play important roles in the process of getting to these end points. The interconnectedness of composing resources within and across modes also indicates that allowing for resource sets to build over time enables units of meaning to accumulate in a way that greatly impacts and benefits future composing, which can rely upon this accumulated meaning and relation of composing resources. This indicates that designing literacy curricula with an integrative force or purpose for composing can facilitate students in creatively assembling visual and textual resources. These findings lend insights to educators who are engaged in the challenge of finding new and creative ways to position students as assemblers of meaning. The curricular frameworks and contexts that I featured in this article—compositional writing, research/inquiry, digital video creation, and comic book reading—proved promising for providing a wide variety of visual composing resources to the students and opportunities for combining them in creative ways.</p>
