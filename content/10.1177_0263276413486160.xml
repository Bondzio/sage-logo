<abstract>
<p>This paper explores the distinctive features of the critical agenda associated with the ‘Social Life of Methods’. I argue that although this perspective can be associated with the increasing interest, often associated with scholars in Science and Technology Studies, to reflect on how methods can become objects of inquiry, it also needs to be rooted in the current crisis of positivist methods. I identify the challenge for positivism in terms of the decreasing ability of its procedures to effectively organize increasingly ‘lively’ sources of standardized data, which can now be assembled using aesthetic registers. In developing this argument, I dispute the idea that this development is due to historical shifts linked to the way that methodological devices are playing an increasingly significant role in contemporary social life, which might be argued by writers such as Thrift or Castells. I also argue that by opening up issues of method to the aesthetic, we also recast the relationship between theory and method, pointing to the exhaustion of a certain kind of cultural theory within the social sciences. I contextualize these issues by considering how methods are implicated in the intellectual differentiation between scientific and humanities expertise. Rather than conceiving the ‘Social Life of Methods’ in terms of the rise of instrumentalist modes of governance, it is preferable to place it within the dialectic of transparency and the relationship between the implicit and explicit. These issues are addressed through introducing the papers in the special issue.</p>

<sec id="sec1-0263276413486160" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>The papers in this special issue examine the contemporary significance of digital devices drawing on the perspective that has become identified as the ‘Social Life of Methods’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0263276413486160">1</xref></sup> The aim of my introductory paper is to reflect on the stakes involved in this approach in introducing key elements of the papers in this special issue. My intention is therefore to draw out some connections between the papers as a means of showcasing the broader potential of this approach to illuminate our understanding of contemporary social and cultural change, and particularly to reflect on important new insights on the relationship between theory and method.</p>
<p>This paper is my own reflection on why questions of method have now become central to social and cultural debate. My perspective, from someone who is not an expert in science and technology studies but who approaches these issues from interests in methodologies to study social stratification, is partisan and might not be shared by all the authors of this special section. My argument is that the ‘Social Life of Methods’ arises as part of a dual movement. These are, firstly, an increasing interdisciplinary interest in making methods an object of study. I will show how this is intellectually indebted to researchers in science and technology studies and anthropology. I explore how this current poses a topical challenge to dominant instrumentalist readings of methods which currently predominate in social science research. The second aspect of this interest is, however, less commented on, but in my view equally important. This is the crisis, increasingly evident in the ‘research methods community’ regarding positivist forms of knowledge,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0263276413486160">2</xref></sup> as forms of standardized data exceed the capacity of standard quantitative procedures to process and analyse them. The proliferation of ‘lively’ data has created an emergent space in which there is a dramatic potential to rethink our theoretical and methodological repertoires (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0263276413486160">Law, 2004</xref>, for one influential statement on methods ‘after method’). This move, I will argue, also radically energizes the study of method.</p>
<p>My paper firstly explicates this claim about the dual processes behind the interest in the social life of method. In the second part of my paper I distance myself from the view that methods are somehow more significant than in the past, whereby they can be seen as a response to the growing politics of audit and metrics. Indeed, I argue against forms of ‘epochalist’ thinking which see new methods as bound up with the rise of digital communication, and place more attention on the specific crisis in the positivist deployment of numbers. In the third part of the paper I consider how the ‘Social Life of Methods’ allows new possibilities for the role of cultural theory and opens up fascinating new issues for inquiry. Throughout the paper I weave in a discussion of issues raised by the papers in this special issue.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-0263276413486160"><title>1. What is the Social Life of Methods?</title>
<p>In a very short time period, over the past few years, the ‘Social Life of Methods’ has come to be an attractive vehicle for offering an innovative critical perspective on the social sciences. Rather than methods being seen as rather dull, a required training that new cohorts of social researchers have to undergo, they can now be seen as a fascinating object of inquiry. And, rather than differentiating between theory and methods, in which the latter are deemed to be tools to investigate theoretical questions which are held to be prior to and independent of methodological considerations, methods can thereby be identified as the very stuff of social life. Social networking sites, audit processes, devices to secure ‘transparency’, algorithms for financial transactions, surveys, maps, interviews, databases and classifications can be seen as modes of instantiating social relationships and identified as modes of ‘making up’ society. This move is indeed apparent in the pages of <italic>Theory, Culture &amp; Society</italic> itself (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0263276413486160">Hayles, 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0263276413486160">2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0263276413486160">MacKenzie and Vurdubakis, 2011</xref>) and is part of a striking rethinking of the relationship between theory, culture, and method which is currently under way in contemporary academic research and which has potentially dramatic implications for our understanding of contemporary expertise.</p>
<p>Yet, what exactly is meant by ‘the “Social Life of Methods”’? Is it just a loose analogy? To be sure, part of its appeal, in many nations and especially the UK, can be traced to mundane institutional developments which appear to have made the power of methods more visible. Governmental institutions in many parts of the world have placed a greater emphasis on ‘evidence based policy’, and on making data visible (as with the American ‘Census Bureau Homepage’). The proliferation of digital codes allows new assemblages and possibilities for social organization at mundane levels, which Featherstone usefully labels as ‘ubiquitous media’ (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0263276413486160">Featherstone, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0263276413486160">Kittler, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0263276413486160">MacKenzie and Vurdubakis, 2011</xref>, and see more generally <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0263276413486160">Adkins and Lury, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>In this most simple sense, then, the ‘Social Life of Methods’ is a response to the increasing salience of methodological devices. It facilitates critical engagement with social research methods by resisting the instrumental framing in which they are simply seen to be technically ‘better or worse’ means of doing social research. The focus is on the affordances and capacities which are mobilized in and through methods themselves. Through this move, methods become both the object of social scientific interest as well as the inevitable vehicles for social scientists of different hues to practise their trade.</p>
<p>There is no shortage of important work in this vein to build on. A major inspiration comes from historians and historical anthropologists who have extended their understanding of modes of governance through a focus on how methods are implicated in forms of ordering and power. Thus, post-colonial historians have developed powerful understandings of the implication of methodological devices in imperial projects, focusing on the deployment of maps, censuses, and surveys in imperial projects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0263276413486160">Prakash, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0263276413486160">Mitchell, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0263276413486160">Dirks, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0263276413486160">Joyce, 2003</xref>). Historians of science have become increasingly interested in the genesis of specifically social science methods such as the community study or the sample survey (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0263276413486160">Igo, 2008</xref>). Anthropologists have considered how methodological devices such as network analysis inscribe particular cultural forms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0263276413486160">Riles, 2000</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0263276413486160">Knox et al., 2006</xref>, and more generally <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0263276413486160">Strathern, 1992</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0263276413486160">2000</xref>). A further influence has been through Foucauldian inspired sociologists such as Nikolas Rose who have explored how ‘inscription devices’ ranging from psychological tests to child development charts have instantiated normative forms of subjectivity. Researchers in Science and Technology studies (STS), one of the most dynamic and innovative areas of contemporary inquiry, have played a key role through extending their interests in the natural sciences to the social sciences. Here, a focus on how methods are crystallized as inscription devices which stabilize fluid and heterogeneous elements into more durable ‘assemblages’ has led to some pioneering studies of the power of economic devices (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0263276413486160">Callon, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0263276413486160">Mackenzie, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0263276413486160">Law, 2009</xref>). The paper by Law, Ruppert and Savage in this special section articulates these concerns and how they might inform an analysis of methods. Within cultural studies, Tony <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0263276413486160">Bennett (2007a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0263276413486160">2007b</xref>) has similarly called for a form of ‘culture studies’ which is attentive to the technical and methodological make-up of cultural relations, and Marie Gillespie’s paper reflects on how these concerns can extend to media studies.</p>
<p>There is, however, an additional crucial ingredient that gives these interests in the ‘Social Life of Methods’ additional specificity, and that has been raised under the slightly different banner of the ‘politics of method’ (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0263276413486160">Steinmetz, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0263276413486160">Savage, 2010</xref>). This contests the hegemony of positivist quantitative methods which have become hegemonic over the past 50 years and which are associated with the proliferation of codified, standardized data, notably that associated with sample surveys but also including censuses, accounts, and registers (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0263276413486160">Porter, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0263276413486160">Desrosieres, 1998</xref>). This positivist hegemony involves the deployment of standard statistical techniques associated with regression and ‘the general linear model’ as the taken-for-granted tools to analyse standardized quantitative data. This process involves both means of ordering research, through linking theory and data collection, but also means of organizing social relations through their instantiation in a research apparatus of surveys and interviews which fed into routine policy-making in both public and private sectors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0263276413486160">Savage, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>The social life of method picks up from the recognition that standardized data today, especially that facilitated by digitalization, allows it to take on a lively form which exceeds the straitjacket imposed by positivist statistical procedures (on the debate about this issue with respect to sociology: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0263276413486160">Savage and Burrows, 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0263276413486160">2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0263276413486160">Crompton, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0263276413486160">Webber, 2009</xref>). This is, indeed, a theme of several of the papers of this special section, notably Beer and Burrows’ demonstration of the ubiquity and mobility of information, and Mackenzie and McNally’s reflections on the proliferation of scientific multiples from new data sources. These developments therefore unsettle traditional disciplinary and methodological divides, and raise the possibility that quantitative forms of analysis can now be recast in a non-positivist frame.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0263276413486160">Table 1</xref> provides some arresting evidence to explore the theme of the crisis of positivism. It draws on data from the Google ngram package which reports the proportion of references to a given phrase across all its digitalized book collection in various periods of time. It is not incidental that my data here comes from a digital source, and that it takes less than a second to run an analysis of this kind. I have scored the ratio of references to four different methods, setting the ratios against that of factor analysis in the year 1950, so that it is possible to detect trends over time.

<p>The trends are highly revealing in indicating the rise and fall of social scientific positivism. In 1950, factor analysis, a technique for quantitative data sorting which is closely associated with psychology, eugenics, and the classification of ‘types’, easily dominated amongst the four specific methods. Ethnography was mentioned slightly more frequently than linear regression. Up to 1970 there is a clear pattern of methodological growth, with factor analysis continuing its lead, but linear regression and ethnography also growing. By 1980, factor analysis is falling away, and regression analysis has reached a plateau, whilst ethnography continues its upward path, overtaking factor analysis in 1990 and being dominant by 2000. But we also see that data mining, a technique for the analysis of digital data, comes from nowhere in the 1990s to overtake both factor analysis and regression by 2008.</p>
<p>We might of course cavil with <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0263276413486160">Table 1</xref>, which is based on a simple textual search and has all the problems which data mining techniques raise. But in fact, its ability to so rapidly render knowledge in terms of secular trends is precisely the point I wish to emphasize here. It reveals, perhaps counter-intuitively, how standard social scientific quantitative methods are being dually challenged both by the rise of ethnographic sensibilities and by forms of digital analysis.</p>
<p>We need to move beyond a familiar kind of external critique of this positivist apparatus, so that the provenance of qualitative method is also the object of analysis. This will avoid the danger that the ‘Social Life of Methods’ becomes simply a re-iteration of a familiar social constructionist critique of standardized methods. By contrast, the ‘Social Life of Methods’ can more importantly be read as taking the critique of the positivist apparatus into a different dimension, in which social constructionist thinking cross-fertilizes with radical and heterodox currents within the quantitative research methods community. This involves forging an alliance with researchers using ‘descriptive’ methods (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0263276413486160">Savage, 2009a</xref>) who are critical of what Andrew <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0263276413486160">Abbott (1988</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0263276413486160">2001</xref>) has identified as the ‘general linear model’. This is a kind of ‘immanent critique’, deployed by those who are familiar and confident with quantitative and digital analysis, but dissatisfied with the limitations enshrined in standard multivariate methods (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0263276413486160">Martin, 2011</xref>, for an exemplary recent manifesto). An important feature of this move is therefore an interest in the precise procedures and operations embedded in methods themselves, rather than a more general meta-critique. Several of the papers in this special section demonstrate the potential of drawing upon this more heterodox form of quantitative analysis. Mackenzie and McNally write as experts in computer analysis, and reflect on the specific use of computer algorithms. Beer and Burrows similarly deploy an interest in the novel forms of archiving and storing of data made possible in digital interactions.</p>
<p>Having made my claim that we need to see the ‘Social Life of Methods’ as part of a twin process, involving an interest in methods as an object, and a specific concern with the contemporary instability of positivist methods, the rest of my paper explicates the stakes involved in more detail. In the next section I consider what is entailed in the argument that we can make methods the object of inquiry. Here I will pursue my argument that the ‘Social Life of Methods’ is not simply a reworking of STS, or critical intellectual history, but instead points towards a challenging re-configuration of expertise. I will argue that the relationship between theory and methods, and between the sciences and humanities, are all called into question. The ‘Social Life of Methods’ grows out of a certain exhaustion of cultural theory, a recognition that the cultural turn has folded into a more materialist frame of analysis, and that the tension between instrumentalist and critical reasoning needs to be recast.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec3-0263276413486160"><title>2. Methods as Object of Inquiry</title>
<p>At first glance, the ‘Social Life of Methods’, draws obvious parallels with the now familiar material turn in cultural anthropology and cultural history, initially announced to considerable acclaim in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0263276413486160">Appadurai’s (1986)</xref> edited <italic>The Social Life of Things</italic>. Here, the key challenge is to the economist’s abstraction between use and exchange value, arguing that commodities need not be seen as objects of trade and exchange, but as endowed with their own meaning and agency which needs to be recognized in its specificity.<disp-quote>
<p>Economic exchange creates value. Values are embodied in commodities that are exchanged. Focusing on the things that are exchanged, rather than simply on the forms or functions of exchange, makes it possible to argue that what creates the link between exchange and value is <italic>politics</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0263276413486160">Appadurai, 1986</xref>: 3, emphasis in original)</p></disp-quote>Appadurai’s work thereby resists an economistic reading of transactions in favour of a political analysis. It picked up on the increasing interest in what might be termed ‘object biographies’, and itself encouraged the dramatic growth of concern in the study of consumption and material culture which has had wide repercussions in sociology, anthropology, cultural studies and history.</p>
<p>In one respect, then, the ‘Social Life of Methods’ largely repeats this now familiar move. In insisting that social research methods also have a social life, a further ‘object’ is made amenable to critical, political analysis. And, following in the shadow of Appadurai’s arguments, it can thus be a means of resisting the familiar emphasis that the choice of method is only a technical or instrumental matter. Its point of departure here is the investment of powerful agencies in various methodological devices: ranging from clinical trials to evidence-based policy and the like.</p>
<p>Bubbling away here, there is also a critical reflection on the role of economics, which suggests a more focused response to a positivist framing of the commodity. The ‘Social Life of Methods’ can thus be a means of challenging intellectual jurisdictions. It is not simply a means of extending pre-existing critical frameworks to take on a new object of analysis.</p>
<p>All the papers in this special section take as a central focus the proliferation of new devices for social research. These range over digital renderings of scientific proteins (Mackenzie and McNally), popular digital devices which permit crowdsourcing and mobilization of information (Beer and Burrows; Wyatt et al.), real-time media monitoring (Gillespie), and the detection of deforestation in the Amazon (Rajão and Vurdubakis). It would be possible to see these papers as testifying to the existence of a distinctive new era in which digital data proliferates. However, as is brought out in my contribution with Ruppert and Law, it is necessary to distance this account from a simple historical epochalism.</p>
<p>In the early 21st century, evidence that methods exercise a profound social significance is easy to find amidst the abundance of digital methods. Methods to purchase commodities (such as Amazon) or to elaborate communication infrastructure (such as Twitter and Facebook) demonstrate how values are tied up with the processing and organization of flows of digital data and things. The power of such methods to ‘make up’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0263276413486160">Hacking, 2006</xref>) social relations appears clear and manifest. In an influential intervention, Donald <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0263276413486160">Mackenzie (2008)</xref> suggests that the Black-Scholes-Merton equation helped construct the organization of options markets in finance. I have written about the role of the social survey and the interview in the organization of government practices and in encouraging an awareness of the ubiquity of classifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0263276413486160">Savage, 2010</xref>). In a similar vein, Michael <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0263276413486160">Power (1996)</xref> has explored the rise of the <italic>Audit Society</italic> through the proliferation of accounting devices.</p>
<p>However, the ‘Social Life of Methods’ framework needs to be distinguished from an inherent concern with the digital, and needs, indeed, to be read as a critical response to some of those who write about it. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0263276413486160">Castells’ <italic>The Rise of the Network Society</italic> (1996)</xref> is a particularly important reference point, through his concern to link the rapid deployment of information technology with the formation of new models of subjectivity and identity. The link that he drew between the computer network and the wider dissemination of network sociality and organization has been traced in domains ranging from business organization to social networking and interaction (see notably <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0263276413486160">Boltanski and Chiapello, 2003</xref>). The emergence of Web 2.0 has proliferated debates of these kinds, and Beer and Burrows offer an extended engagement with these concerns here.</p>
<p>The ghost which haunts this machine is that of technical determinism, an issue which has been critically posed with respect to Castells’ work, and which has been a major target of criticism from researchers in science and technology studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0263276413486160">Bijker and Law, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0263276413486160">Bowker and Star, 2000</xref>). The problem here is that methods, as materialized in information technology, cannot be treated as a ‘given’ but are themselves subject to multiple mobilization. Thus, the formation of information networks is not inherent to the computer and, indeed, was a novel development in the 1990s with the creation of the World Wide Web.</p>
<p>This issue has been more effectively dealt with by subsequent writers, notably Nigel <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0263276413486160">Thrift’s (2005)</xref> account in <italic>Knowing Capitalism</italic> which focuses on the development of feedback loops between forms of information gathering and organizational activity. Developing currents in cybernetics, Thrift emphasizes how organizations of all kinds have become ‘self-monitoring’, able to modify themselves in the light of information they produce on their environment and actions. For these reasons, capitalism is itself dependent on myriad sensing devices and methods.</p>
<p>Thrift’s framework is underscored by many examples, for instance drawn from the role of economic algorithms in financial calculations, or in the way transactional data can be drawn upon by organizations to respond rapidly to patterns of changing consumer demand. It has the merit of recognizing the centrality of self-monitoring systems linked to digital communication without reducing them to their technical underpinning. Yet this perspective is open to question: it exaggerates the extent to which monitoring systems can be made automatic, and neglects the role of strategic agency. It also needs to appreciate the extent to which methods were implicated in forms of governance in earlier historical periods.</p>
<p>This concern can be traced also in debates in media and research on identity regarding the emergence of ‘knowingness’. Here, it is widely attested that social agents are increasingly aware of the social classifications which they work with, and are increasingly concerned to position themselves with respect to such classifications. A very influential body of literature in cultural sociology thus argues that the traditional divide between ‘snobs’ and those enjoying popular culture has been eclipsed by the rise of the ‘cultural omnivore’: those who position themselves critically with respect to both snob and popular culture and seek a more hybrid and eclectic identity which takes elements of both positions. It is for these reasons that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0263276413486160">Prieur and Savage (2011)</xref> argue that the nature of cultural capital is being redefined so that it takes a ‘knowing’ form (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0263276413486160">Savage et al., 2001</xref>). In similar ways, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0263276413486160">Skeggs and Wood (2008)</xref> examine how media representations are knowingly and informatively drawn upon by audiences, so that our understanding of social class, for instance, is linked to the proliferation of representations and classifications – in the form of chavs, posh, etc. Similarly <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0263276413486160">Ball (2003)</xref> examines how parents use examination results, league tables and school reports to understand the social desirability of schools.</p>
<p>For all its intuitive appeal, this approach to the ‘Social Life of Methods’ as some kind of commentary on the current dominance of methodological repertoires is ultimately limited. Its appeal lies as a kind of ‘epochalism’, a further way of announcing radical changes which have previously been trumpeted in other formats and guises (through the figure of the post-industrial, the post-modern, the cosmopolitan and so forth; see more generally <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0263276413486160">Savage, 2009b</xref>). It is true that, on the face of it, classical sociological theorists of modern social change did not focus on methods as agents of change and instead identified dynamics that were based in social systems – ranging from the imperative of a capitalist economy, through urbanization, industrialization, and the differentiation of roles in complex societies (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0263276413486160">Kumar, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0263276413486160">Joas and Knobl, 2009</xref>) and so forth. A central feature of these classical sociological theorists was a concern with how modernity transformed the human condition, thus prioritizing a fundamentally humanist focus on changing experience. Methods become implicated in these accounts of modernity insofar as they are yoked to an account of the loss of the face-to-face community. This is announced clearly in Walter Benjamin, in his celebrated writings on the shattering of experience as a result of the mass reproducibility of cultural forms, as well as other media theorists such as Marshall McLuhan.</p>
<p>However, counter examples which attest to the role of methodological devices in pre-modern historical periods are ready to hand. Weber famously argues that double entry bookkeeping was central to the Protestant Ethic and hence the formation of modernity itself. Franco <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0263276413486160">Moretti (2006)</xref> has demonstrated that the emergence of the novel as a method of writing itself is implicated in the development of new kinds of subjectivities and identities. Michel <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0263276413486160">Foucault’s (1977</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0263276413486160">1979</xref>) writing offers further examples. Focusing especially on how new forms of capillary power are associated with the emergence of methods of drilling, inspection and classification, Foucault opened up new sensitivities to the performative role of expertise bound up in methods.</p>
<p>Foucault’s work is of particular relevance because of its concern to avoid epochalisms, which was especially marked through his advocacy of genealogical methods, which, following Nietzsche, were determined not to locate origins and hence teleologies. For these reasons he was resistant to distinguishing forms of change in the contemporary period. Yet, despite his own preference, Foucault’s thinking has been appropriated to an epochalist frame, especially through its deployment as a theory of neo-liberalism (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0263276413486160">Han, 2002</xref>, for Foucault’s deployment of historical analysis, and more broadly <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0263276413486160">Rose, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0263276413486160">Bennett et al., 2007</xref>). It is perhaps within actor network theory, for instance through Latour’s insistence that <italic>We Have Never Been Modern</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0263276413486160">1993</xref>), that there is the most manifest concern to avoid the epochalist temptation.</p>
<p>These are not simply scholastic concerns. Our point here is that these interests in methods thus played into a familiar binary in classical social thought, which differentiated the human from the machine and thus saw methods as bound up with rationalization, the shattering of community and human experience. This problematic rendering of methods as tied into the instrumentalism of social life thus helps to produce the very sequestration of methods from social and human affairs, and as purely technical devices which the framing of the ‘Social Life of Methods’ seeks to resist. By questioning the association of the methodological with the technical, we also call into question the epochalist framing of social theorists. We are instead left to recognize that the material, technical and methodological are omnipresent in human society and that we need a more nuanced way of approaching our analysis of method which is not premised on the view that this is a specifically new or novel concern.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-0263276413486160"><title>3. The Changing Role of Cultural Theory</title>
<p>Having criticized the view that the ‘Social Life of Methods’ can be explained as a response to the contemporary proliferation of methodological devices, I now argue that it grows out of a profound intellectual re-organization of academic disciplines. I provocatively want to identify this in terms of challenges to the project of cultural theory. This is a bold claim. I am not claiming that cultural theory is in decline, but that its fortunes need to be contextualized. It prospered, from the 1980s onwards, at a moment when issues of theory were increasingly differentiated from those of method, and it traded on this freedom from the empirical. However, the current uncertainties about new forms of digital knowledge and information play into questions about whether cultural theory needs now to be re-engaged with the empirical and the ‘messy’ world of method.</p>
<p>Earlier, I have argued that by identifying method with the instrumental, social theorists held it apart from the cultural – seen as the arena of the interpretative and ‘bildung’. Within this framing cultural theory provided synthetic accounts of social change which hovered above and beyond particular concrete empirical details. This rendering of cultural theory as a critical commentary has been hugely influential, generating enduring interests in the ordering of social life, yet it depends on operating at a remove from research in a more empirical register.</p>
<p>The emergence of cultural theory as a distinctive form of inquiry requires a fuller analysis than I can give here, but a simple account might run as follows. Until the mid 20th century it is not feasible to distinguish social or cultural theory from philosophy more generally. Thinkers such as Marx, Simmel, Adorno, Mead and Weber were operating simultaneously across these boundaries and would not have distinguished between these realms. The emergence of a more distinctive form of cultural theory took place through an innovative double reaction which gathered speed from the 1950s, against both instrumental and rationalistic philosophy on the one hand, but at the same time also against the familiar humanist critique of this paradigm, as embedded in the existentialism of Sartre or Heidegger. Thus, the structuralism of Levi-Strauss and Althusser, the genealogical analysis of Foucault, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0263276413486160">Deleuze and Guattari’s (1987)</xref> monadology, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0263276413486160">Bourdieu’s (1985)</xref> field analysis all share this common provenance.</p>
<p>We get some further clues from a Google ngram that compares the relative popularity of the terms ‘social’, ‘cultural’ and ‘sociological’ theory over the past 58 years (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0263276413486160">Table 2</xref>). It shows that the rise of any of these currents after 1950 is less marked than for any of the methods’ terms, all of which rise considerably over their 1950 scores (compare with <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0263276413486160">Table 1</xref>). We can see that cultural theory remains marginal down to the 1980s, and then rises considerably, at the same time that sociological theory falls away. By 2000, cultural theory is referenced more commonly than sociological theory, a very striking shift from 1980 when sociological theory was eight times more commonly mentioned.

<p>It is clear that this ‘moment’ of cultural theory took place at the same time that sociological theory retreated in prominence, and somewhat after the time that ‘standard’ social science research methods, in the form of the interview and the survey, were becoming codified. This seems to be part of a current of increasing distance of theory from more empirical forms of sociology which now needs to be rethought with the proliferation of lively data.</p>
<p>How, then, do we restore interests in the interplay between theory and method? We need to remind ourselves that these debates were much stronger amongst earlier generations of sociological theorists including Max Weber as well as leading members of the Frankfurt School who were involved in methodological developments, notably in the elaboration of focus groups and interview methods. Even though some of this new generation also retained an involvement in innovative methods, such as Bourdieu’s use of multiple correspondence analysis, or Foucault’s concern with discourse analysis, this tended to be obscured in the critical reception of their work.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0263276413486160">3</xref></sup> Only in specific specialist areas, such as in ethnomethodology and conversation analysis, did the link between these arenas persist.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0263276413486160">4</xref></sup> A particularly striking example of this increasing lack of engagement between theory and methods was the way that actor network theory within Science and Technology studies engaged only minimally with researchers using social network analysis. In like vein, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0263276413486160">Kittler (2009)</xref> has also explored philosophy’s lack of ease with the ontology of the media.</p>
<p>The distinctive project of cultural theory also became articulated into a more familiar divide between the sciences and the humanities, the key features of which were institutionalized from the 19th century ‘Methodenstreit’. Drawing on highly contested positions pitting rationalist against romantic visions, its resolution laid the platform for a powerful intellectual division of labour which dominated research and social thought throughout the 20th century. In reflecting on the relationship between scientific and humanities expertise, it was thus agreed that scientific expertise could hold sway over the instrumental and technical realms of inquiry, whilst the humanities were allowed to hold jurisdiction over the questions of the ultimate goals and values of life. This distinction between ‘means’ and ‘ends’ was institutionalized in the increasing separation of the sciences from the humanities in the 20th century university, and all leading intellectual currents situated themselves with respect to it, though usually agonistically. Diverse champions of ‘bildung’ ranging from Heidegger, Sartre and the Frankfurt School clashed with rationalists associated with analytical philosophy and rational choice theory. Others, such as Weber, sought some kind of a middle way. And in fact, these intellectual conflicts should not be taken to be as intense as they sometimes appeared. In reality, coexistence has been the order of the day: it remains the case that universities nearly always contain disciplines from both groups, and it is no accident that so few specialist universities have emerged which concentrate on one of these domains. It could suit scientists to say that they were only providing neutral tools because this then allowed them to abdicate responsibility for their use and application. And it could suit humanities scholars to say that they ultimately had more to say about the purpose of social life than scientists could.</p>
<p>The specific terms of this intellectual stand-off do not concern us here. What is more intriguing is the surrogate way that questions of method entered this debate by being identified, explicitly or not, as part of the scientific canon, at one remove from issues of theory. I have already discussed this in Section 2 by observing how methods were invariably identified with the technical and held to be in contrast with the human and cultural. A fundamental result was that those affiliated to the humanities tended to see questions of method as not part of their terrain. Down to the present day, humanities scholars resist the teaching of methods to graduate students. Insofar as humanities scholars retained methodological interests, these were as means to champion their reading of idiographic particularities, as for instance in the deployment of case studies and in narrative. In place of method, it has been questions of theory which have illuminated the concerns of this critical project.</p>
<p>My claim in this paper is, however, that it is the severing of the association between positivism and standardized data entailed by digitalization that has made this familiar stand-off obsolete. Here, the critique of positivist methodology from heterodox American sociologists represents a very significant moment. John Levi <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0263276413486160">Martin’s (2011)</xref> recent recasting of modes of social explanation, away from conventional counter-factual models which seek to delineate causal ‘variables’ is instructive. Martin, influenced by pragmatism, the Chicago School and Bourdieu’s phenomenological rendering of field analysis, resists forms of knowledge that distance themselves from knowing social agents. He is thus critical of the project of social theory which seeks to abstract from first order forms of knowledge, and emphasizes the need to focus on the ordinary devices and understandings. We find similar currents in the post-Latourian authors such as Fabian Muniesa who have also shown a new interest in pragmatism. These trends require that we rethink our understanding of the relationship between theory and methods so that the two are seen to be closely associated. We can elaborate this point in several ways.</p>
<p>Firstly, methods are not specifically allied to instrumental framing except in the weakest meaning, in which any purposeful inquiry (including that in the humanities) can be said to have some end goal in sight. As scholars such as John <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0263276413486160">Pickstone (2000)</xref> have reminded us, much methodological expertise is tied up with forms of classification, modes of arraying difference, which have no necessary instrumental end in sight. For this reason, they are not necessarily arrayed with modes of rationalistic thinking, and can be equally bound up with imparting wonder, distress, etc. This suggests the need to broaden our analytical awareness of methods, in a manner akin to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0263276413486160">Foucault’s (1971)</xref> deployment of Linnaeus’s 18th century classification as part of what he calls the classical episteme which is concerned with measurement and order.</p>
<p>A particularly important point here regards the significance of quantification, which is sometimes held to entail forms of abstraction and a commitment to reductive metrics (compare <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0263276413486160">Porter, 1995</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0263276413486160">Desrosieres, 1998</xref>). A well known instance here lies in the genesis of statistics in eugenic thinking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0263276413486160">Mackenzie, 1981</xref>), where statistical techniques were used to differentiate and thereby pathologize racial groups. Yet in fact, as all the contributors to this special section demonstrate, quantitative analysis can be arrayed in numerous ways, which need not have an instrumental rendering (e.g. Beer and Burrows’ analysis of digital data assemblages). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0263276413486160">Hacking’s (1990)</xref> well known account of the genesis of statistical reasoning is important here. We need to distance ourselves from the view that statistics is a necessarily deterministic mode of thinking. In fact, its introduction in the 19th century was seen to elaborate a new recognition of ‘chance’, with statistical reasoning proceeding from the assumption that there is inherent error in its observations, and that random, stochastic processes are to be expected. Yet, from this starting point, statistical procedures can establish whether forms of regularity can be found, indicating partial ordering and hence the delineation of ‘laws’. In the hands of Quetelet, followed by Durkheim, the search for ‘social averages’ then inappropriately sought general laws out of diverse observations (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0263276413486160">Hacking, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0263276413486160">Goldthorpe, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0263276413486160">Martin, 2011</xref>). Nonetheless, this latter step is not an inherent feature of quantification itself, and we need to be alive to alternative ways in which statistical approaches can be used. Typically assumptions within statistics, ranging from the chi-squared test to the examination of levels of significance, assume lack of order as their default, expected, state of affairs.</p>
<p>Secondly, and building on this point, methods are not necessarily about generalizing or extrapolating. They can equally well be forms of rendering specificity and particularity, and thereby can be allied to an anti-instrumentalist reading. This is evidently true for overtly descriptive methods such as multiple correspondence analysis or social network analysis, but is also true even of apparently linear methods such as regression, in which outliers and residuals can be identified (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0263276413486160">Abbott, 2001</xref>). They can be modes of visualizing and display which juxtapose and contrast. This concern with using methods to isolate outliers is an important feature of digital data sources (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0263276413486160">Ruppert and Savage, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Thirdly, questions of method cannot be avoided in any branch of inquiry. There has been a notable shift of emphasis in the past decade from qualitative researchers, moving away from an overly ‘humanist’ reading of their position, which argues that qualitative research is necessary because of the necessarily interpretative dimension of social life, towards a recognition that qualitative methods also involve assembling, analysing and inscribing forms of data. The means that researchers may use in this process may be implicit or rule of thumb, but this does not mean that they do not exist. In a similar way, the textual turn within narrative and literary analysis has led to a growing recognition of the salience of devices within theoretical repertoires.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-0263276413486160" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title>
<p>In this paper I have sketched out a critical agenda associated with the ‘Social Life of Methods’. This radically interdisciplinary work seeks to unpick the hegemony of the positivist assemblage not only through a critical engagement with the agency of social research methods, but also through expanding the methodological repertoires, through recognizing the increasing problems of positivist frameworks to order and organize proliferating data sources. Throughout this discussion I have sought to emphasize how we have no pivot outside methods themselves on which to conduct our inquiries. My concluding suggestion is that, following the anthropological lead of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0263276413486160">Strathern (1992)</xref> and others, we might say that questions of method can best be tied up with issues of ‘making explicit’, and with resulting concerns over transparency. Here, questions of formal method can be associated with ‘making explicit’ what might otherwise be implicit. However, it should not be thought that this process of making explicit somehow eradicates the implicit – it simply displaces it.</p>
<p>It is preferable to see questions of method in these terms because it allows for a more fluid rendering of methods which puts them into tension more effectively with questions of theory. Firstly, it roots questions of method into specific modes of knowing embedded in particular cultural configurations, notably that of Anglo-American cultures, so recognizing their complicity in these geo-political issues. Through this means questions of power, and more specifically empire, can be recognized.</p>
<p>Secondly, the terms of engagement between the explicit and implicit are transformed. Rather than the explicit being concerned with instrumentality, we can also argue that certain kinds of instrumentality can be bound up with the implicit. The implicit, far from being unsullied, or held to be a ‘cultural’ realm which is more attuned to human value, can also be the realm of forms of domination, notably those which are naturalized and thereby ‘taken for granted’. In my study of post-war social science (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0263276413486160">Savage, 2010</xref>) I have explored these tensions in terms of competing forms of ‘gentlemanly’ and ‘technical’ expertise, which can reinforce each other.</p>
<p>This leads to the third value of placing this debate on methods into this register. Strathern emphasizes that the explicit, with its search for transparency, can never fundamentally remove the implicit. In any procedure there remain forms of discretion and autonomy. This, indeed, lies at the heart of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0263276413486160">Collins’s (1985)</xref> argument that replication is actually not possible in the natural sciences (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0263276413486160">Rees, 2009</xref>). The ‘Social Life of Methods’, then, is an exploration of the changing historical boundaries between the implicit and the explicit, and explores the mechanisms and devices which can produce formal knowledge. It does not and should not assume that the contrast with this formal knowledge is any more necessarily tied up with domination than implicit realms of social life, but it does recognize that the stakes and affordances which may be generated by such formal methods have the capacity to generate distinctive forms of agency. We are thus in a position to see the question of method as raising fundamental theoretical questions about the limits of knowledge itself, and to reflect on new ways of understanding the relationship between the cultural, social, and material.</p>
