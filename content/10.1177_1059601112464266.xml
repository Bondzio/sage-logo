<abstract>
<p>Using a sample of 243 undergraduate business students assigned to 71 virtual teams, this study explored the relationships between the Big Five personality factors, leader emergence, team trustworthiness, peer rated member performance contributions, and team performance. As predicted, agreeableness and conscientiousness were positively related to the task- and social-oriented dimensions of leader emergence, respectively. Contrary to expectations, emotional stability was not related to either dimension of leadership emergence. Evidence of the predicted relationships between emergent leadership and peer ratings of member contributions to team performance was obtained for task- but not social-oriented behaviors. At the team level, aggregated social-oriented leadership behaviors predicted aggregate perceptions of team trustworthiness. Only aggregated task-oriented emergent leadership behaviors predicted virtual team performance.</p>

<p>As virtual teams have become a pervasive element of modern work, research into the factors that impact team performance in virtual settings has grown exponentially (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1059601112464266">Algesheimer, Dholakia, &amp; Gurau, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1059601112464266">Bell &amp; Kozlowski, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1059601112464266">Martins, Gilson, &amp; Maynard, 2004</xref>). Despite such scrutiny, our understanding of how individual attributes and emergent team processes, including leadership, combine to influence virtual team outcomes, remains underdeveloped (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1059601112464266">Hertel, Geister, &amp; Konradt, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1059601112464266">Ocker, Huang, Benbunan-Fich, &amp; Hiltz, 2011</xref>). Indeed, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1059601112464266">Hambley, O’Neill, &amp; Kline (2007</xref>, p. 2) note that “[a]lthough some research on virtual leadership styles is emerging, there is still a need for research assessing how certain leadership styles interact with communication technologies to affect team processes and outcomes.”</p>
<p>Leader emergence is defined “as both an individual’s completion of leader-like work duties and occupying positions of leadership or authority either within or outside of the work domain. Leader emergence, rather than effectiveness, is often a product of others’ perceptions of an individual’s abilities. If the target individual is perceived to be ‘leader-like,’ then others will be more likely to elect or appoint the target individual into leadership positions (i.e., leader emergence, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1059601112464266">Reichard et al., 2011</xref>, p. 472). We believe one of the oldest perspectives on leadership—the trait approach—is also one the most promising for enhancing our understanding of leader emergence within virtual team settings.</p>
<p>While the universal perspective on traits fell out of favor following a highly influential critical review by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1059601112464266">Stogdill (1948)</xref>, the focus on individual differences and leadership has shown a marked resurgence from the 1980s onward (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1059601112464266">Zaccaro, 2007</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1059601112464266">Bono and Judge (2004)</xref> found that 12% of the articles on leadership since 1990 included the keywords <italic>personality</italic> and <italic>leadership</italic> (p. 901). Studies reveal a moderate relationship between personality traits and leader emergence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1059601112464266">Ilies, Gerhardt, &amp; Le, 2004</xref>) despite inconsistent assessment of personality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1059601112464266">Judge, Bono, Ilies, &amp; Gerhardt, 2002</xref>). Judge, Bono and Big Five colleagues (2002a) classified the extant research on personality as it relates to leadership using the Five Factor model of personality traits (i.e., the Big Five; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1059601112464266">Barrick &amp; Mount, 1991</xref>), coming up with much stronger evidence in support of the relationship.</p>
<p>Although the impact of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1059601112464266">Stogdill’s (1948)</xref> critique suggested otherwise, he did not argue for the cessation of trait research into leadership. Instead, he stressed the need for an integrated approach to leadership research that accounts for both the situation and the leader’s individual differences. The purpose of our study derives from Stogdill’s suggestion and was driven by a gap in the literature with regard to leader emergence, personality, and virtual teams.</p>
<p>While there is a burgeoning literature on leadership in virtual teams (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1059601112464266">Balthazard, Waldman, &amp; Warren, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1059601112464266">Carte, Chidambaram, &amp; Becker, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1059601112464266">Ocker et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1059601112464266">Purvanova &amp; Bono, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1059601112464266">Shuffler, Wiese, Salas, &amp; Burke, 2010</xref>) and a separate developing research stream on leader emergence and personality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1059601112464266">Bono &amp; Judge, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1059601112464266">Ilies et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1059601112464266">Judge, Bono et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1059601112464266">Reichard et al., 2011</xref>), there are no studies that explore whether the Big Five factors influence leader emergence in virtual teams and the implications for performance. Our study addresses this knowledge gap in three ways. First, we examine an integrated input-process-output (I-P-O) model of leader emergence within virtual teams. That is, we model the Big Five factors as antecedents (inputs) to leader emergence within virtual teams and leader emergence as a team process that relates to team and individual performance. Prior virtual team research has examined antecedents of leadership (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1059601112464266">Balthazard et al., 2009</xref>) or the impact leadership has upon team performance (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1059601112464266">Ocker et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1059601112464266">Purvanova &amp; Bono, 2009</xref>) but not an integrated IPO model. Second, we examine the extent to which the relationship between leadership emergence and team performance is moderated by team trustworthiness. Lack of trust is common within virtual teams due to diminished communication relative to face-to-face settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1059601112464266">DeRosa, Hantula, Kock, &amp; D’Arcy, 2004</xref>). While trust is a common topic in virtual team studies (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1059601112464266">Jarvenpaa, Shaw, &amp; Stapes, 2004</xref>), the role of leadership emergence in creating perceptions of member trustworthiness is under explored. Third, we advance a rationale as to how each of the Big Five factors relate to leadership emergence within virtual settings. Prior studies of the Big Five factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1059601112464266">Balthazard et al., 2009</xref>) have not considered how all five potentially relate to leadership emergence in virtual teams. Since team members exhibit all of the Big Five factors to varying degrees it is important to examine how each one relates to leader emergence within virtual teams.</p>

<title>Leader Emergence and Virtual Teams</title>
<p>Given the complexity of today’s uncertain, global environments, work is often carried out by team members dispersed across time and space who interact only through computer-mediated communication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1059601112464266">Bell &amp; Kozlowski, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1059601112464266">Hertel et al., 2005</xref>). We refer to such teams as virtual teams, defined as “<italic>teams whose members use technology to varying degrees in working across locational, temporal, and relational boundaries to accomplish an interdependent task</italic>” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1059601112464266">Martins et al., 2004</xref>, p. 808; italics in the original). In general, research shows two types of leadership functions necessary for virtual team functioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1059601112464266">Bell &amp; Kozlowski, 2002</xref>): (a) developing and shaping team processes; and (b) monitoring and managing team performance. These distinctions are mirrored in much of the leadership research. Notable examples include consideration and initiating structure (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1059601112464266">Fleishman, 1973</xref>), supportive and directive leadership (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1059601112464266">House, 1971</xref>), and transformational and transactional leadership (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1059601112464266">Bass, 1985</xref>). A meta-analysis conducted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1059601112464266">Judge, Piccolo, and Ilies (2004)</xref> that examined the relationships between consideration, initiating structure, and key work outcomes confirmed that both dimensions of leadership are positively related to job performance and group-organization performance.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, empirical research on virtual team leadership emergence is scarce. Several studies have focused primarily on exploring transformational leadership (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1059601112464266">Balthazard et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1059601112464266">Hambley et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1059601112464266">Purvanova &amp; Bono, 2009</xref>), while others have looked at more generalized leadership behaviors (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1059601112464266">Flammia, Cleary, &amp; Slattery, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1059601112464266">Ocker et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1059601112464266">Wakefield, Leidner, &amp; Garrison, 2008</xref>). Only a handful of studies focused on the task- and social-oriented aspects of emergent leadership and their relationships with team outcomes within a virtual setting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1059601112464266">Carte et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1059601112464266">Tyran, Tyran, &amp; Shepherd, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1059601112464266">Yoo &amp; Alavi, 2004</xref>).</p>

<title>Research Framework</title>
<p>The Virtual Team Competency Inventory (VTCI) advanced by Hertel and associates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1059601112464266">2005</xref>) provided the conceptual foundations for our research. The VCTI model identifies individual member variables, including personality (e.g., conscientiousness, agreeableness, emotional stability), which reflect <italic>teamwork-related</italic> and <italic>taskwork-related</italic> member attributes. Together, these attributes, along with member cognitive abilities, professional/technical knowledge, skills, and attitudes (KSAs), and attributes relevant to <italic>telecooperation</italic> (e.g., cooperation within a virtual setting), are posited to predict the criterion variables of potential and actual team performance.</p>
<p>Drawing on this framework, the model that guided the current research was developed (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1059601112464266">Figure 1</xref>). Conscientiousness and emotional stability constitute taskwork-related attributes that are posited to be positively related to task-oriented emergent leadership, whereas agreeableness and emotional stability are teamwork-related attributes that are expected to foster social-oriented emergent leadership. Task- and social-oriented emergent leadership, in turn, are posited to relate to individual member contributions to team performance (as reflected by peer assessments). At the team level, both task- and social-oriented emergent leadership are expected to relate positively to aggregate perceptions of team trustworthiness and team performance. Team trustworthiness is also predicted to partially mediate the relationships between the emergent leadership behaviors and virtual team performance. Finally, consistent with the VTCI model, we expect that team member cognitive abilities (grade point average [GPA], class rank), professional/technical KSAs (computer self-efficacy, academic self-efficacy, work experience), and attributes relevant to telecooperation (positive and negative attitudes toward computers, propensity to trust) may be related to the focal individual and team performance outcomes. Accordingly, the utility of including these constructs as control variables is assessed.</p>

<title>Literature Review and Hypotheses</title>
<sec id="section5-1059601112464266">
<title>Leader Emergence and Personality</title>
<p>While earlier studies used a variety of personality conceptualizations, recent literature on leadership emergence and personality builds on the Big Five model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1059601112464266">Judge, Bono et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1059601112464266">Reichard et al., 2011</xref>). The most comprehensive meta-analysis to date showed that the Big Five traits as a set were correlated significantly with leadership (<italic>r</italic> = .48), and all but agreeableness correlated specifically with leader emergence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1059601112464266">Judge, Bono et al., 2002</xref>). In the next sections, the relationships of each of the Big Five traits with leadership are discussed. At the end of each section, we indicate if the trait is expected to relate to leader emergence in virtual teams, and if so, advance hypotheses. As in prior research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1059601112464266">Bell &amp; Kozlowski, 2002</xref>), leader emergence varies along two dimensions: (a) leader communication oriented toward the team task (i.e., task-oriented emergent leadership); and (b) leader communication oriented toward members’ social needs (i.e., social-oriented emergent leadership), and the hypotheses are worded accordingly.</p>
<sec id="section6-1059601112464266">
<title>Extraversion</title>
<p>Persons scoring high on extraversion are talkative, active, upbeat, and seek excitement and social affiliation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1059601112464266">Barrick &amp; Mount, 1991</xref>). The latter quality is important in face-to-face team settings, as extraversion is related to a desire to work with others and reflects social skills that facilitate effective interactions with teammates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1059601112464266">McCrae &amp; Costa, 2008</xref>). Extraversion has been positively related to transformational leadership (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1059601112464266">Balthazard et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1059601112464266">Bono &amp; Judge, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1059601112464266">Judge &amp; Bono, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1059601112464266">Lim &amp; Ployhart, 2004</xref>) and in some cases was the strongest of all five factors in predicting leadership (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1059601112464266">Judge, Bono et al., 2002</xref>) and leader emergence (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1059601112464266">Ilies et al., 2004</xref>). Indeed, a longitudinal study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1059601112464266">Reichard and colleagues (2011)</xref> revealed that adolescent extraversion accounted for significant variance in adult workplace leader emergence and transformational leadership beyond that explained by adolescent intelligence.</p>
<p>Since persons high on extraversion are outgoing, they may be less likely to emerge as team leaders when face-to-face contact is limited because they find the use of asynchronous communication to coordinate team activities impersonal. Consistent with this notion, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1059601112464266">Balthazard et al. (2009)</xref> found that extraversion was related to transformational leadership in face-to-face but not virtual teams. Moreover, given the inner-orientation of persons high on introversion, they too are not expected to emerge as leaders within a virtual context. Accordingly, extraversion is not expected to predict either task- or socially-oriented leadership within virtual teams.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1059601112464266">
<title>Agreeableness</title>
<p>Persons high on agreeableness tend toward affiliation, compassion, and cooperation rather than conflict and are both trusting and trustworthy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1059601112464266">McCrae &amp; Costa, 2008</xref>). Agreeableness arises as a key trait within teams where collaboration is required (Morgeson, Reider, &amp; Campion, 1995). Further, more agreeable persons focus on cooperation rather than competition within teams (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1059601112464266">LePine &amp; Van Dyne, 2001</xref>). Although leader agreeableness has been positively related to satisfaction with supervision (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1059601112464266">Smith &amp; Canger, 2004</xref>) and team performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1059601112464266">Lim &amp; Ployhart, 2004</xref>), the link to leadership emergence is inconclusive. In <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1059601112464266">Judge, Bono et al.’s (2002)</xref> meta-analysis, agreeableness obtained the weakest relationship to leadership of the Big Five traits, presumably because it reflects passivity and compliance. Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1059601112464266">Reichard et al. (2011)</xref> found that agreeableness was unrelated to adult leader emergence.</p>
<p>In contrast to the research on leadership in general, several studies have found positive and strong relationships of agreeableness with transformational leadership (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1059601112464266">Bono &amp; Judge, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1059601112464266">Judge &amp; Bono, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1059601112464266">Lim &amp; Ployhart, 2004</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1059601112464266">Bono and Judge (2004)</xref> offer several explanations for the positive relationship they identified. First, leaders high on agreeableness tend to be concerned with others’ well-being and developmental needs (individualized consideration). Second, because of their trustworthiness, they may be seen as role models and score high in idealized influence. Finally, because of their needs for affiliation and cooperation, they tend to be readily available to followers (and thus score low on laissez-faire leadership).</p>
<p>The qualities associated with agreeableness (cooperation, trust, kindness, and altruism) seem to retain their importance within a virtual workplace. In fact, it may be more important for members to be forgiving and trusting within a virtual than a traditional team. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1059601112464266">Meyerson, Weick and Kramer (1996)</xref> coined the term <italic>swift trust</italic> to relate to temporary teams whose members share a common purpose and task that is bounded by a finite time frame. It reflects a willingness to suspend doubt about other members and maintain a positive attitude about group outcomes. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1059601112464266">Pauleen (2004)</xref> found that leaders of virtual teams emphasized the importance of taking time to build trust within their teams early on. Similarly, Tyran and associates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1059601112464266">2003</xref>) found that the emergent leaders in virtual teams were more likely than other members to be rated high on trust by teammates. Hence, the tendency of persons high on agreeableness to both extend and engender trust (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1059601112464266">Costa &amp; McCrae, 1992</xref>) suggests that agreeableness is a key predictor of emergent leadership. However, the facets of agreeableness discussed above, including trust, seem to be more directly connected to social- rather than task-oriented leadership (and are thus more in line with the established relationship of agreeableness with transformational leadership).</p>

<title>Conscientiousness</title>
<p>Persons high on conscientiousness exhibit caution, self-discipline, hard work, and a strong sense of direction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1059601112464266">McCrae &amp; Costa, 2008</xref>). Meta-analyses show that conscientiousness is positively related to activities which support the social and psychological environment of a team and job performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1059601112464266">Barrick &amp; Mount, 1991</xref>) and thus should be related to leader effectiveness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1059601112464266">Judge, Bono et al., 2002</xref>). Consistent with this reasoning, leader conscientiousness has been positively related to team performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1059601112464266">Kickul &amp; Neuman, 2000</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1059601112464266">Judge, Bono et al. (2002)</xref> found it to be positively related to leadership and the second strongest Big Five factor (next to extraversion) to predict leader emergence in their meta-analysis. However, it was <italic>not</italic> a strong predictor of transformational leadership, although <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1059601112464266">Bono and Judge (2004)</xref> broke out the subdimensions and found a stronger relationship for individualized consideration alone than transformational leadership as a composite. They argued that there is no reason to expect conscientiousness to be related to the visionary, enthusiastic, or creative behaviors shown by transformational leaders. However, they did provide theory for why conscientiousness would be related to the transactional leadership factor of management by exception-active.</p>
<p>Conscientiousness may be even more important in virtual environments than in traditional ones. The organized, efficient, and planful nature of persons high on conscientiousness allows them to create the precise and complete objectives and procedures needed within virtual teams (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1059601112464266">Bell &amp; Kozlowski, 2002</xref>). The reliable and thorough behaviors of those high in conscientiousness are also likely to cause them to persist even when encountering technological difficulties, increasing the likelihood of their emergence as a leader in virtual team settings where technology provides the only means of communication. While <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1059601112464266">Judge, Bono et al (2002)</xref> found a positive relationship between leader emergence and conscientiousness, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1059601112464266">Reichard and colleagues (2011)</xref> found no evidence of such a relationship, after controlling for adolescent intelligence. Nevertheless, we predict a positive relationship between conscientiousness and the emergent task-related behaviors that encompass providing direction and setting goals for team members. Because members high on conscientiousness are focused on goal achievement, they are expected to exert task-directed influence over other members as necessary to ensure task completion. However, this may be done with disregard for the feelings or desires of individual team members. While such behaviors have been shown to increase performance, they also decrease affective commitment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1059601112464266">Smith &amp; Canger, 2004</xref>). Overall, these findings suggest that conscientiousness will be related to the task-oriented, but not the social-oriented, aspects of leader emergence in virtual teams.</p>

<title>Emotional stability</title>
<p>Individuals low on emotional stability (also called adjustment or negatively scaled as neuroticism) experience negative feelings such as anger, anxiety, guilt, sadness, and vulnerability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1059601112464266">McCrae &amp; Costa, 2008</xref>). This trait has been positively and strongly associated with high self-esteem and general self-efficacy (Judge, Erez, Bono, &amp; Thoresen, 2000) as well as job performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1059601112464266">Barrick &amp; Mount, 1991</xref>). With self-confidence as a precursor to leader emergence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1059601112464266">Judge, Bono et al., 2002</xref>), it follows that persons high versus low on emotional stability would be more likely to be perceived as leaders. In contrast, leaders low on emotional stability are viewed as anxious, self-pitying, tense, touchy, and unstable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1059601112464266">McCrae &amp; John, 1992</xref>).</p>
<p>The emotional stability trait has yielded mixed findings with leadership emergence, however. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1059601112464266">Judge, Bono et al.’s (2002)</xref> meta-analysis found low emotional stability to be negatively related to leader emergence. While <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1059601112464266">Lord, DeVader, and Alliger’s (1986)</xref> meta-analysis revealed a corrected correlation of .24 between emotional stability and perceived leadership, the estimate could not be distinguished from zero. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1059601112464266">Judge and Bono (2000)</xref> found the relationship of emotional stability with transformational leadership to be insignificant, but then found meta-analytically that it did hold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1059601112464266">Bono &amp; Judge, 2004</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1059601112464266">Lim and Ployhart (2004)</xref> reported a positive relationship of transformational leadership with emotional stability in a military setting. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1059601112464266">Reichard et al. (2011)</xref> found that adolescent emotional stability was unrelated to adult leadership emergence or transformational leadership, when controlling for adolescent intelligence.</p>
<p>Consistent with prior research (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1059601112464266">Ilies et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1059601112464266">Judge, Bono et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1059601112464266">Lim &amp; Ployhart, 2004</xref>) that has identified a positive relationship between emotional stability and leader emergence, we predict that more versus less emotionally stable persons will be more likely to emerge as leaders in virtual settings. Since the lack of face-to-face interactions within virtual teams can increase the chances of miscommunication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1059601112464266">Bosch-Sijtsema, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1059601112464266">Pauleen, 2004</xref>), it is important for members to effectively interpret messages and monitor their responses accordingly. The touchy behaviors of less emotionally stable members make them susceptible to misinterpretations of electronic communication, and such misperceptions are likely to inhibit their emergence as leaders. Thus, the characteristics that make low emotional stability a barrier to leader emergence within traditional settings are likewise expected to be operative within virtual settings. In contrast, we expect the calm and stable demeanor of emotionally stable persons to promote task- and social-oriented behaviors and facilitate their emergence as leaders.</p>

<title>Openness to experience</title>
<p>Persons high in openness to experience are imaginative, curious, and creative (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1059601112464266">McCrae &amp; Costa, 2008</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1059601112464266">Judge, Bono et al. (2002</xref>, p. 773) described this factor as “the most controversial and least understood.” Openness to experience is not commonly related to organizational outcomes but is related to leadership (Judge, Bono et al., 2002a). It has been positively related to the three transformational leadership dimensions as a set (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1059601112464266">Bono &amp; Judge, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1059601112464266">Judge &amp; Bono, 2000</xref>) and leader emergence (Judge, Bono et al., 2002a).</p>
<p>Working in a virtual environment often calls for creativity in solving communication problems and other issues that may not exist in traditional settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1059601112464266">Bosch-Sijtsema, 2007</xref>). The imaginative nature of persons who are high in openness to experience could prove to be very valuable within virtual teams, but we have no theory on how this factor would be related to leader emergence. Moreover, empirical research suggests a different picture. While <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1059601112464266">Bono and Judge (2004)</xref> found that a composite of transformational leadership was positively related to the leader’s openness to experience, the individual dimensions (intellectual stimulation, individualized consideration, and charisma) were not. This pattern was mirrored for the more task-oriented transactional leader behaviors (contingent reward, management by exception-active and passive). Finally, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1059601112464266">Reichard et al. (2011)</xref> found that adolescent openness to experience was unrelated to adult leadership emergence and transformational leadership, when controlling for adolescent intelligence. Thus, available theory and research is not sufficient to justify predicting relationships of either task- or social-oriented leader emergence with openness to experience.</p>

<title>Leader Emergence and Perceptions of Team Trustworthiness</title>
<p>In the VCTI model, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1059601112464266">Hertel, Konradt, &amp; Orlikowski (2004</xref>, p. 8) view interpersonal trust as a basic component of team members’ motivational processes, which they define as “an expectancy of members that their efforts will be reciprocated and not exploited by other team members.” In our article, the focus is on member perceptions of the trustworthiness of other team members, which is related to, but conceptually distinct from trust (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1059601112464266">Frazier, Johnson, Gavin, Gooty, &amp; Snow, 2010</xref>). While trust reflects an intention to make oneself vulnerable to another, trustworthiness involves a character-based assessment of the extent to which another party is worthy of one’s trust. We posit that, at the team level, task-oriented aspects of emergent leadership will elevate members’ perceptions of team trustworthiness by reassuring them that peers care about the task. Furthermore, the social-oriented aspects of emergent leadership are expected to foster heightened perceptions of team trustworthiness because they demonstrate a concern among peers for the personal well-being of other members and the overall emotional health of the team.</p>
<p>These predictions are based, in part, on the shared leadership literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1059601112464266">Pearce &amp; Conger, 2002</xref>), which suggests that the dispersion of leadership responsibilities and activities within a team can foster higher perceptions of trust and trustworthiness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1059601112464266">Avolio, Jung, Murry, &amp; Sivasbramaniam, 1996</xref>). Moreover, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1059601112464266">Shuffler et al. (2010)</xref> posit that shared as opposed to traditional hierarchical leadership will serve to enhance the social climate (which reflects perceptions of team trustworthiness) and performance of virtual teams. Accordingly, we predict that when teams have sufficient levels of task- and social-oriented leadership behaviors in the aggregate, members will consider their teammates to be trustworthy. This assertion is supported by the extensive literature that demonstrates effective leadership elicits greater trust among members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1059601112464266">Burke, Sims, Lazzara, &amp; Salas, 2007</xref>), including members of virtual teams (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1059601112464266">Hertel et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1059601112464266">Peters &amp; Karren, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1059601112464266">Tyran et al., 2003</xref>).</p>

<title>Performance Outcomes</title>
<p>As <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1059601112464266">Figure 1</xref> indicates, both individual and team level performance outcomes are included in our research model. At the individual level, the model builds upon <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1059601112464266">Hertel et al.’s (2004)</xref> assertion that the taskwork and teamwork attributes of team members will enhance their performance contributions to the team. Note that this assertion is consistent with extensive leadership research that documents task- and social-oriented leadership behaviors are viewed as valuable contributions to team performance by other members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1059601112464266">Fleishman, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1059601112464266">Judge et al., 2004</xref>). Hence, we view the task-oriented aspects of emergent leadership (e.g., goal setting, providing direction, exerting influence) as behaviors that contribute to the attainment of team goals, and expect other members to recognize these contributions. The social-oriented aspects of emergent leadership (e.g., providing praise, showing empathy) likewise represent potential contributions to team performance and other members are expected to recognize them as such.</p>

<p>At the team level, we again build upon the VTCI model which includes team performance as the ultimate outcome. In doing so, both the VCTI and current models draw from the team leadership (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1059601112464266">Day, Gronn, &amp; Salas, 2006</xref>) and virtual team (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1059601112464266">Hambley et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1059601112464266">Shuffler et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1059601112464266">Tyran et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1059601112464266">Wakefield et al., 2008</xref>) literatures which identify leadership as a key determinant of team performance. In addition, the shared leadership literature suggests the dispersion of leadership responsibilities and activities among members will foster higher levels of collective performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1059601112464266">Avolio et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1059601112464266">Pearce &amp; Conger, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1059601112464266">Shuffler et al., 2010</xref>). Thus, virtual teams that collectively exhibit higher levels of task-oriented leadership are expected to achieve higher levels of performance. Furthermore, virtual teams that collectively display higher levels of social-oriented leadership are more likely to foster a healthy social climate that promotes effective team functioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1059601112464266">Shuffler et al., 2010</xref>).</p>

<p>“Perhaps the most frequently mentioned precondition of successful virtual teams in the literature is the development of mutual trust within the team because opportunities for mutual control are reduced as virtuality increases” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1059601112464266">Hertel, Konradt, &amp; Voss, 2006</xref>, p. 482). As such, we anticipate that aggregate levels of perceived team trustworthiness will be positively related to team performance. Once again, this assertion is consistent with the shared leadership literature which postulates that the elevated levels of trust that arise from the diffusion of leadership roles enhance team performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1059601112464266">Avolio et al., 1996</xref>).

<title>Participants</title>
<p>Participants were 328 undergraduate business students from a large public southwestern university involved in a 12-week virtual team project as a course assignment. One advantage of our use of student project teams is that doing so facilitated the collection of data on both team processes (emergent leadership, team trustworthiness) and outcomes (member performance contribution, team performance). Team members were enrolled in four upper division sections of three different management courses. Students from the various sections were randomly selected and matched with students from other sections to form teams. Formal team leaders were not assigned. Of the students’ overall course grade, 10% was determined by this team project.</p>
<p>Participation in the surveys was voluntary, and students were given nominal extra credit for participating. The written and verbal instructions emphasized the importance of answering truthfully. Survey 1 was completed at Time 1 by 282 participants for a response rate of 85.9%. However, due to attrition over subsequent surveys and listwise deletion of missing values, complete data were obtained from 243 respondents for an effective response rate of 74.1%. Note that this constitutes a higher than average response rate for organizational research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1059601112464266">Baruch &amp; Holtom, 2008</xref>). Two hundred and twenty-two subjects reported their age and gender. Of those, the average age was 22.6 years (<italic>SD</italic> = 3.82) and 55.2% were male. Two hundred forty-two subjects responded about their current work status, and of those, 58.7% indicated they were employed at the time of survey administration. Of the 241 students reporting on race, 66.4% were White, 12.9% were Asian, 7.1% were Black, 6.6% were Hispanic, and 5.0% Native American; the remaining 2% classified themselves as “other.”</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-1059601112464266">
<title>Procedure</title>
<p>Seventy-one virtual teams were formed with 3 to 5 members (average team size was 4.5 members). The project task involved a written case analysis of a fictitious organization facing an ethical challenge. Participants completed the project via an electronic communication tool (Blackboard), which allowed threaded discussion groups, email, online chats, and document sharing. While it was possible for team members to communicate via other media, they were given explicit instructions that all team communications were to be made through electronic media only. Team interactions were captured from the various means of communication during the project (6,327 communications in total). An examination of text of their electronic communications revealed no references to outside communications using other media.</p>
<p>A longitudinal, multisource design was used for data collection. At Time 1 (the beginning of the semester), basic demographic data (gender, age, race), indicators of cognitive ability (GPA, class rank) and measures of professional/technical KSAs (academic and computer self-efficacy, work experience) and telecooperation (attitudes toward computers, propensity to trust) were assessed. At Time 2, approximately eight weeks later, the personality measures were collected. Approximately six weeks later, at Time 3 (toward the end of the semester but prior to the completion of the team project and peer appraisals), the measure of team trustworthiness was administered. At Time 4 (the end of the semester), the team project was turned in along with peer appraisals. Team electronic communications were exchanged and captured throughout the 12-week project; a trained coder assessed these communications following the completion of the semester. Thus, self-report (demographics, personality, cognitive ability, KSA’s, attributes relevant to telecooperation), archival (team communications), other team members (peer appraisals), and instructor (team project grades) sources of data were all employed in this study.</p>

<title>Measures</title>
<sec id="section17-1059601112464266">
<title>Personality</title>
<p>The 60-item revised NEO-PI-R (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1059601112464266">Costa &amp; McCrae, 1992</xref>) was used to measure the Big Five traits. Twelve items are included for each dimension and are counterbalanced to control for acquiescence effects. Sample items include: “I try to be courteous to everyone I meet” (agreeableness); “I laugh easily” (extraversion); “I often feel inferior to others” (neuroticism); “I often try new and foreign foods” (openness to experience); and “I try to perform all of the tasks assigned to me conscientiously” (conscientiousness). The scales employ 5-point Likert-type response formats (<italic>strongly disagree</italic> = 1; <italic>strongly agree</italic> = 5). Prior estimates of internal consistency were .68 (agreeableness), .77 (extraversion), .86 (neuroticism), .73 (openness to experience), and .81 (conscientiousness; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1059601112464266">Costa &amp; McCrae, 1992</xref>). Our coefficient alpha internal consistency estimates were consistent with previous research: .77 (agreeableness), .82 (extraversion), .84 (neuroticism), .71 (openness to experience), and .79 (conscientiousness).</p>

<sec id="section18-1059601112464266">
<title>Leadership ratings</title>
<p>After reading the electronic communications, one of the authors, a management doctoral student enrolled in another university who was knowledgeable of leadership theory, not part of the instructional team, and blind to the research hypotheses, made an assessment of each member’s leadership emergence. Leadership was coded with eight items previously used in virtual teams research (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1059601112464266">Kayworth &amp; Leidner, 2001</xref>). The rater assigned scores (from one to seven) for each virtual team member, reflecting the extent to which the person emerged as a leader on each item. Consistent with leadership theory historically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1059601112464266">Judge et al., 2004</xref>), we expected that some of these items would reflect leadership oriented toward the project task, while others would be oriented toward supporting team members. Accordingly, we factor-analyzed the eight items, obtaining two factors (with eigenvalues greater than one, loadings greater than .40, and no substantial cross-loadings; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1059601112464266">Ford, MacCallum, &amp; Tait, 1986</xref>) using principal axis factoring and varimax rotation. The factor loadings are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1059601112464266">Table 1</xref>. Factor I had thematic elements reflecting a task orientation (five items), while Factor II was related more to a social-oriented approach (three items). Coefficient alphas of .89 and .71 were obtained, suggesting that the scales are internally consistent and reliable.</p>

<p>To further assess the reliability of the coding scheme, a second coder completed the rating scale for a subset of 54 teams and 197 team members. Coefficient alphas for the task- and social-oriented leadership scales for the second rater of .90 and .71 were obtained. To assess the extent to which the ratings of the secondary coder were internally consistent with those of the primary coder, the five task-oriented and three social-oriented items as scored by each rater for the 197 commonly coded team members were combined and examined jointly to compute new coefficient alphas. Coefficient alphas of .91 and .77 were obtained, suggesting that the emergent leadership coding system is reliable. Since complete data on all 71 teams was available from the primary coder only, that data was used exclusively in the analyses.</p>

<title>Control variables</title>
<p>As noted above, we consider the cognitive abilities (class rank, GPA), professional/technical KSAs (academic and computer self-efficacy, work experience), and attributes pertinent to telecooperation (propensity to trust, attitudes toward computers) of team members to be potential predictors of team performance. Hence we administered measures of these variables for inclusion as potential control variables in the analysis.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1059601112464266">Compeau and Higgins’ (1995)</xref> 10-item computer self-efficacy scale asks individuals to rate their ability (with a 7-point response format—very low to very high) to accomplish a computer-related task using different levels of assistance. A sample item is “if there was no one around to tell me what to do as I go.” This measure has demonstrated adequate psychometric properties in prior research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1059601112464266">Compeau &amp; Higgins, 1995</xref>); coefficient alpha in our sample was .93.</p>
<p>We adopted a 10-item academic self-efficacy scale that was derived from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1059601112464266">Riggs, Warka, Babasa, Betancourt, and Hooker’s (1994)</xref> general self-efficacy scale and adapted for an academic context by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1059601112464266">Finn and Frone (2004)</xref>.

<title>Analytical Approach</title>
<p>The hypothesized relationships can be partitioned into two separate sets. The relationships among the personality characteristics, emergent leadership variables, and member performance contributions comprise relationships among individual-level variables. Alternatively, the relationships among aggregate emergent leadership, aggregate perceptions of team trustworthiness and team performance comprise relationships among team-level variables. More specifically, each of the individual-level and team-level sets of relationships are specific to a single level, and there are no cross-level relationships that are specified. As such, the analyses of each of the individual-level and team-level hypotheses were conducted independently. But because participants were nested within teams, nonindependence in the data may be an issue when testing relationships among the individual-level variables (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1059601112464266">Bliese, 2000</xref>). With respect to the dependent variables measured at the individual level, the following ICC(1) values (which mark the amount of between-team variance or dependence; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1059601112464266">Bliese, 2000</xref>) were obtained: Task-oriented aspects of leader emergence = .00, social-oriented aspects of leader emergence = .22, peer ratings of member performance contribution = .00, and perceptions of team trustworthiness = .20. In some cases, there is no dependence in the data. This is the case for task-oriented aspects of leader emergence and peer ratings of member performance contribution. In the case of the latter, this is an artifact. Because the total peer ratings of member contributions must sum to 100 within each team, there would necessarily be no between-team variance. There was no theoretical reason to expect between-team differences in aspects of leader emergence, but where these arose, an analytical approach was chosen to control for such properties.</p>
<p>Because there were team-level properties in some of the data, to remain consistent in our analytical approach, random coefficient modeling using the Hierarchical Linear Modeling software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1059601112464266">Raudenbush, Bryk, &amp; Congdon, 2007</xref>) was used to test all hypotheses involving relationships among individual-level variables. In such cases, the individual served as the unit of analysis, but we accounted for any dependence owing to team membership. Specifically, relationships involving the Big Five traits, task- and social-oriented aspects of leader emergence, and member performance contributions (spanning Hypotheses 1, 2, 3a, 3b, 5a and 5b) were examined within this framework. Following the recommendation of Hofmann and Gavin (1998), all predictors were grand-mean centered in these analyses.</p>
<p>Alternatively, hypotheses involving relationships among team-level variables were assessed using ordinary least squares (OLS) regression with the team as the unit of analysis. Specifically, relationships involving aggregate levels of task- and social-oriented aspects of leader emergence, aggregate perceptions of team trustworthiness, and team performance (spanning Hypotheses 4a, 4b, 6a, 6b, and 7) were examined within this framework. The decision to adopt this approach was driven by interest in how these variables predict team performance. Because team performance varies only between teams, it can be predicted only by variables that vary between teams, and is captured by aggregates of leader emergence and team trustworthiness.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>Intercorrelations among the study variables are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1059601112464266">Table 2</xref>. Correlational analyses revealed that class rank, work experience, and computer self-efficacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1059601112464266">Compeau &amp; Higgins, 1995</xref>) were positively related to member performance contributions, while academic self-efficacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1059601112464266">Finn &amp; Frone, 2004</xref>) was negatively related. Hence these variables were included as controls in the analyses for which member performance contribution served as the outcome. Because propensity to trust was positively related to team trustworthiness, it was included as a control in the analyses predicting team trustworthiness. In the full models predicting team performance, in which perceptions of team trustworthiness was included as a predictor, propensity to trust was also included as a control.</p>

<p>When modeling peer ratings of member performance contributions as an outcome, the control variables included class rank, work experience, academic self-efficacy and computer self-efficacy. Only work experience and computer self-efficacy emerged as significant predictors. The task-oriented and social-oriented aspects of leader emergence as well as the Big Five factors were then added as predictors. The Big Five factors were included to allow for direct effects of personality on member performance contributions, under the assumption that not all of the effects of the Big Five factors are carried through leader emergence. In this model, task-oriented emergent leadership was related to member performance contributions, providing support for Hypothesis 5a. However, Hypothesis 5b was not supported, as social-oriented emergent leadership was not related to peer ratings of member performance contributions. No other predictors, including the Big Five factors, emerged as significant.</p>
<p>Because the hypotheses collectively suggest that the Big Five factors will have an indirect effect on member performance contributions via both dimensions of emergent leadership, all ten indirect effects were assessed in a supplemental analysis. Using the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1059601112464266">Sobel (1982)</xref> test, only the indirect effect of conscientiousness on member performance contributions via task-oriented emergent leadership was significant (unstandardized estimate = .04, <italic>p</italic>≤ .05).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1059601112464266">Table 4</xref> includes the OLS regression results from the analysis of the interrelationships among aggregate leader emergence and aggregate perceptions of team trustworthiness, as well as team performance. In the initial model of team performance, aggregate computer self-efficacy and negative attitudes toward computers were first entered as controls. Neither was significantly related to the outcome. To test Hypotheses 6a and 6b, aggregate task-oriented and social-oriented aspects of leader emergence were added as predictors. Aggregate task-oriented emergent leadership was significantly and positively related to team performance, providing support for Hypothesis 6a. However, Hypothesis 6b was not supported, as aggregate social-oriented emergent leadership was not related to team performance.</p>

<p>In modeling aggregate perceptions of team trustworthiness, aggregate propensity to trust was first entered as a control. It was significantly and positively related to aggregate perceptions of team trustworthiness. Next, both the aggregate task-oriented and social-oriented aspects of leader emergence were included as predictors. Aggregate social-oriented emergent leadership was significantly and positively related to aggregate team trustworthiness, providing support for Hypothesis 4b. Hypothesis 4a was not supported, as aggregate task-oriented emergent leadership was not related to aggregate perceptions of team trustworthiness.</p>
<p>A final model of team performance was assessed to examine the relationship between aggregate perceptions of team trustworthiness and team performance. This model also included aggregate task- and social-oriented leadership emergence to allow for their direct effects on team performance. As a first step, aggregate computer self-efficacy, negative attitudes toward computers, and propensity to trust were included as controls; none emerged as significant. Next, aggregate task- and social-oriented emergent leadership and perceptions of team trustworthiness were added as predictors. Contrary to Hypothesis 7, aggregate team trustworthiness was not significantly related to team performance. Only aggregate task-oriented emergent leadership was significantly related to team performance, providing additional support for Hypothesis 6a.</p>
<p>As a final supplemental analysis, we examined the indirect effects of aggregate task- and social-oriented leadership emergence on team performance via aggregate perceptions of team trustworthiness. Although implied by our hypotheses, these indirect effects were not significant.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Our findings regarding the posited relationships between the Big Five factors and leader emergence were mixed. As expected, agreeableness predicted the social-oriented aspects of leadership, as more versus less agreeable persons were more inclined to exhibit social-oriented leadership. However, no support for the posited direct and indirect (through social-oriented leadership) effects of agreeableness on peer ratings of member performance was obtained.</p>
<p>The identified relationship between agreeableness and social-oriented emergent leadership is consistent with evidence that it relates positively with transformational leadership (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1059601112464266">Bono &amp; Judge, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1059601112464266">Judge &amp; Bono, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1059601112464266">Lim &amp; Ployhart, 2004</xref>). Perhaps agreeableness contributes to the emergence of individualized consideration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1059601112464266">Bass, 1985</xref>), an element of transformational leadership that may be especially important within virtual settings where technological barriers may impede social support from teammates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1059601112464266">Purvanova &amp; Bono, 2009</xref>). Further research is needed to explicate the relationship between agreeableness and specific forms of leadership (e.g., transformational leadership) within virtual settings, as well as the extent to which contextual factors (e.g., task goal, task interdependence, group size, technology, geographic dispersion of members; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1059601112464266">Martins et al., 2004</xref>) impact the strength of this relationship.</p>
<p>Our analysis also provided support for the predicted positive relationship between conscientiousness and task-oriented emergent leadership. Furthermore, while conscientiousness was not directly related to member performance contributions, an indirect effect through task-oriented emergent leadership was revealed. It appears that, as is the case in face-to-face teams (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1059601112464266">Judge, Bono et al., 2002</xref>), the sense of direction, organizational skills, and reliability of highly conscientious persons are as important, or perhaps even more important (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1059601112464266">Bell &amp; Kozlowski, 2002</xref>), to the emergence and performance of task-oriented leaders within virtual settings. Future research should focus on the degree to which particular attributes of virtual teams (e.g., task interdependence, media richness, external leadership support; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1059601112464266">Martins et al., 2004</xref>) mediate the relationships between conscientiousness and emergent task-oriented leadership.</p>
<p>We expected the factors that contribute to the inhibiting effects of neuroticism on leader emergence in face-to-face settings would be as strong, or perhaps even more potent, in virtual settings where the potential for miscommunication by insecure persons may be more pronounced due to technological limitations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1059601112464266">Bosch-Sijtsema, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1059601112464266">Martins et al., 2004</xref>). However, the results revealed that emotional stability was not significantly related to either dimension of emergent leadership. Hence, no evidence of the predicted positive relationships between emotional stability and the task-oriented and social-oriented aspects of emergent leadership was obtained. One possible explanation for these nonsupportive findings is that the detrimental effects of low emotional stability are less pronounced within a virtual team setting simply because the relatively lean communication media (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1059601112464266">DeRosa et al., 2004</xref>) available provide fewer opportunities for neurotic persons to communicate negative emotions such as anger and anxiety. Indeed, in contrast to face-to-face settings, where negative affect is more readily apparent through nonverbal communications, virtual media serve to filter out nonverbal cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1059601112464266">DeRosa et al., 2004</xref>). Hence, research is needed to explore the extent to which media richness mediates the negative relationship between neuroticism and leader emergence, such that these effects are less pronounced or absent for lean versus rich media. Some initial support for this explanation is provided by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1059601112464266">Balthazard and colleagues (2009)</xref>, who found that neuroticism was negatively related to transformational leadership in face-to-face but not virtual teams. If further evidence that the relatively lean media of virtual teams mitigate the normally adverse effects of neuroticism on leader emergence is forthcoming, the merits of encouraging less emotionally stable persons to use virtual media more extensively should be considered.</p>
<p>Support for the prediction that members who exhibit high versus low levels of emergent leadership behaviors would be perceived by peers as making greater contributions to team performance was obtained for the task- but not the social-oriented aspects of emergent leadership. Apparently, only task-directed behaviors were viewed by members of these virtual teams as contributing to task accomplishment. Note that this interpretation is consistent with the results of two qualitative studies of leadership within virtual teams which revealed that task-oriented behaviors were especially valued by teammates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1059601112464266">Flammia et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1059601112464266">Sivunen, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Although the social-oriented aspects of emergent leadership were unrelated to perceptions of individual performance, our results indicate that, in the aggregate, they have positive effects on team processes. Specifically, our predication that aggregate social-oriented leadership behaviors would produce elevated perceptions of team trustworthiness was supported. This finding is consistent with research that suggests the specialized distribution of leadership roles through shared leadership fosters elevated levels of member trust (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1059601112464266">Avolio et al., 1996</xref>). Our findings suggest that social-oriented leader behaviors may be necessary to convince members that their teammates are trustworthy. However, our finding that the task-oriented emergent leadership was unrelated to team trustworthiness, suggests that more research is needed to tease out how the specific functions of shared leadership relate to perceived team trustworthiness.</p>
<p>We posited positive relationships to team performance for both dimensions of emergent leadership at the aggregate level. However, only the predicted relationship between aggregate task-related emergent leadership and team performance was significant. Hence, our findings are consistent with DeRosa and colleagues’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1059601112464266">2004</xref>, p. 227) contention that the “spatial and temporal distances inherent in virtual teams demand that managers focus more closely on actual results and performance than may be the case in face-to-face management arrangements.” However, given the preponderance of research that suggests social-oriented leadership can serve to enhance leader effectiveness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1059601112464266">Judge et al., 2004</xref>), additional research into contextual factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1059601112464266">Martins et al., 2004</xref>) that may operate to heighten their importance within virtual team settings is warranted.</p>
<p>As previously noted, the importance of mutual trust as a precondition for virtual team performance is well established (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1059601112464266">Hertel et al., 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1059601112464266">2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1059601112464266">2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1059601112464266">Jarvenpaa et al., 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1059601112464266">2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1059601112464266">Peters &amp; Karren, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1059601112464266">Sarker, Ajuja, Sarker, &amp; Kirkeby, 2011</xref>). Our study is somewhat unique, however, in that it examined the extent to which team performance is related to perceptions of team trustworthiness (i.e., a character-based assessment of the extent to which team members are worthy of trust), rather than team trust (i.e., the intention of team members to make themselve vulnerable to other members; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1059601112464266">Frazier et al., 2010</xref>). Tests for aggregation (ICCs) indicated that perceptions of team trustworthiness exist at the collective level, suggesting that this is a promising team level construct that may provide insight into the role that trust plays within virtual teams. Indeed, it appears that high levels of agreement among team members regarding the trustworthiness of teammates contributed to enhanced team performance. Further research is needed to further explore the determinants of team trustworthiness within virtual contexts.</p>
<sec id="section26-1059601112464266">
<title>Limitations and Future Research Directions</title>
<p>A notable limitation of our study stems from our exclusive use of a student project team sample. Although this practice is shared by many virtual team studies (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1059601112464266">Carte et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1059601112464266">Flammia et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1059601112464266">Hambley et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1059601112464266">Ocker et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1059601112464266">Purvanova &amp; Bono, 2009</xref>), such samples limit the potential generalizability of our findings. Some argue, however, that the problems arising from student samples in organizational research are overblown. Indeed, while legitimate concerns have been raised (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1059601112464266">Gordon, Slade, &amp; Schmitt, 1986</xref>), a consensus has emerged that this practice is appropriate when the research focuses on basic individual and/or group processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1059601112464266">Anderson, Lindsay, &amp; Bushman, 1999</xref>). Because our research questions involved the influence of basic personality traits and emergent leadership processes on team trustworthiness and performance within a generic virtual team context, we consider college students to be an appropriate sample. Nevertheless, we encourage replications within field settings to assess the generalizability of our findings to more applied virtual team contexts.</p>
<p>A second limitation is that the virtual teams studied were composed of members from a single university. In practice, however, “global virtual teams” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1059601112464266">Jarvenpaa et al., 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1059601112464266">2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1059601112464266">Sarker et al., 2011</xref>) composed of geographically dispersed members with diverse cultural backgrounds are becoming more common. It is unclear to what extent the personality traits of agreeableness and conscientiousness identified as being related to leader emergence would emerge in more culturally diverse virtual teams. Hence, future research that explores the relationships of personality to leadership within global and diverse virtual teams is warranted.</p>
<p>Other limitations arise from the task (a case analysis) and the time horizon for the team project (12 weeks). Research indicates that task attributes and time constraints serve as important inputs that impact virtual team processes and outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1059601112464266">Bell &amp; Kozlowski, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1059601112464266">Martins et al., 2004</xref>). Hence, future research that explores the extent to which our findings would hold for more or less complicated or interdependent tasks with shorter or longer time horizons is needed.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>With the rise of virtual teams across the organizational landscape (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1059601112464266">Algesheimer et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1059601112464266">Hertel et al., 2005</xref>), and growing recognition of the importance of leadership processes to the success of such teams (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1059601112464266">Carte et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1059601112464266">Hambley et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1059601112464266">Shuffler et al., 2010</xref>), greater attention to the antecedents that contribute to leader emergence and its effects within virtual contexts is needed. Our findings suggest that, when assembling virtual teams, consideration should be given to the inclusion of both highly conscientious and agreeable persons. Doing so will increase the likelihood that leaders will emerge to engage in the types of task- and social-oriented activities that our results suggest enhance team performance and team trustworthiness, respectively. If replicated, these findings may help organizations adopting virtual teams to more fully realize their potential to promote brave new forms of work and leadership.</p>
