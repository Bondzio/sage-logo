<p><italic>Shaping the Scriptural Imagination: Truth, Meaning, and the Theological Interpretation of the Bible</italic></p>
<p>Donald H. Juel, edited by Shane Berg and Matthew L. Skinner</p>
<p>Waco: Baylor, 2011. 216 + xi pp. $34.95</p>
<p>This collection of essays and sermons by the late Don Juel, edited by Shane Berg and Matthew Skinner, poignantly reminds us that in his untimely death, we lost all too soon a wise, faithful, and creative reader and teacher of the Bible, who himself was deeply shaped by the Scriptures that he studied and taught. Throughout this collection one finds themes and emphases characteristic of Juel’s writing and work, reflecting his passion and his passions. But as Matthew Skinner notes in his fine introduction to the volume, while the collection of essays aspires to make Juel’s writing and views more widely available, it is above all a book “about God and the Bible” (1). Indeed, for Juel it was impossible to study and write about the Bible without writing or speaking about God. The God who is the subject of the Bible is not a God who can be manipulated, controlled, limited, or reduced to less than the God who persistently pursues people, even when (and perhaps especially when) that makes them uncomfortable and resistant. God will not leave us alone. And that is unsettling, but good news.</p>
<p>Juel acknowledged the problem of biblical illiteracy in the Church: people do not know the stories of the Bible. He was, however, more interested in another kind of illiteracy: churches do not actually engage regularly in the practice of reading the Bible. In other words, the problem of biblical illiteracy would not be solved by telling people what is in the Bible, but by reading it with them, waiting to be surprised and reoriented by the insights of others as they hear the text afresh. Juel was keenly interested in particular readers – not “readers” in general or in the abstract – and how their actual experiences in reading the Bible could reshape his and their own understanding of the text and of God.</p>
<p>The Gospel of Mark played a significant role in shaping Juel’s approach, and illustrations drawn from reading it together with other texts are sprinkled throughout this collection. For example, the “tearing open” of the skies at Jesus’ baptism and of the temple curtain at his death in Mark showed that God was “on the loose” in the world. The hard words accompanying Mark’s parables, suggesting that God had the power to hide and conceal, are troubling and arouse human resistance to such a God. Hearing an actor recite Mark from memory led to new questions and insights about how the text should be read: Should the centurion’s acknowledgment of Jesus as “son of God” be laden with irony? And the scribal efforts to produce a more satisfying ending to the Gospel of Mark than the best attested words, “for they were afraid,” signals the human need for closure, even if that led to pedestrian readings and a pedestrian faith, such as is found in the so-called “longer ending” (Mark 16:9–21). Virtually all these readings of Mark arose out of conversations with persons actually engaged in reading the Bible or having it read to them. Juel’s obvious delight in rehearsing these encounters bears witness to his equally obvious willingness to hear Scripture afresh and to delight in the prospect that such hearing could happen again and again.</p>
<p>While Juel contributed important work to academic interpretation of the Bible, he worried that scholars trained in linguistic and historical study often labored under the illusion that “meaning” was locked in the past. Reading the Bible should not primarily be concerned with the past, but with the present and the future, because the Bible bears witness to the trustworthiness of the God who makes promises in Scripture. Such an understanding of Scripture and of God points forward, not backward, in the expectation and hope that God will indeed be faithful to those promises.</p>
<p>For those unfamiliar with Juel’s work, these essays and sermons, gracefully written, often epigrammatic in style, understated and yet bold, are a fine introduction to Juel’s emphases and concerns. They are worth reading, pondering, and savoring not only for their insights into specific texts, but also for their insistence that the Bible belongs in the congregation and that reading the Bible in that setting may produce unexpected results. The framing introduction and conclusion by Skinner and Berg are both fine testimonies to the influence of their teacher. I am grateful for their efforts to allow us to hear Don Juel speak once more.</p>
