            <p>Parenting a child with complex needs or disabilities is a challenging proposition. This study, which drew upon of the experiences of the parents of 34 children (in 33 families), set out to explore the themes of impact, need for help and support and meaning/sense-making as they were related by parents. Data were collected using semi-structured interviews, and an emerging theoretical framework was validated through the use of a series of mind-maps<sup>®</sup> which were presented to individual parents as the basis for a second round (verificational) interview. Parents were nominated into the study by health care professions who were asked to identify the subject children to one of three separate sub-groups: children with a disability; children with a life-limiting/life-threatening illness or children with a technology dependence. Comparisons were made between the three study sub-groups in order to identify areas of consistency and of inconsistency. A fourth study theme – ‘battleground’ emerged from entirely within the data set. Sense-making occupied a central position within the overall theoretical framework for the study and parental perception of ‘battleground’ presented as significant element of parental sense-making, particularly in the context of their relationships with professional staff.</p>

         <title>Introduction</title>
         <p>Parenthood presents many challenges. For parents of children with disabilities and complex health needs those challenges are often very considerable indeed. The study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1367493512447089">Whiting, 2009</xref>) reported in this article is concerned with the experiences of the parents of 34 such children, in 33 families, who participated in a qualitative research study, the principle aim of which was to identify areas of consistency and of difference in parental experiences in relation to three key study themes: ‘impact’; ‘need for help and support’ and ‘sense-making’.</p>

            <title>Impact</title>
            <p>A range of impacts upon family life associated with childhood disability and complex health needs have been highlighted in previous research. Studies undertaken by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1367493512447089">Beresford (1995</xref>), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1367493512447089">While et al.

               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1367493512447089">While et al. (1996</xref>) and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1367493512447089">Contact-a-Family (2004a</xref>) identified how childhood disability impacted upon parental physical and mental ill health. In 2006, Mencap reported that in a study of 253 families 60 per cent of parents who identified their own physical health as poor and 70 per cent of parents who identified their own mental health as poor linked this directly to caring for their disabled child. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1367493512447089">Kirk and Glendinning (1999</xref>) reported that parents identified particular difficulties in being able to spend time together as a couple as putting a strain on their relationship. Studies by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1367493512447089">Contact-a-Family (2004a</xref>) and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1367493512447089">Mencap (2006</xref>) have reported how parents identify the lack of a break from caring for a disabled child as a significant contributory factor in marital breakdown.</p>
            <p>Parental concerns relating to the loss of social opportunity have been widely reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1367493512447089">Baldwin and Carlisle, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1367493512447089">Kirk and Glendinning, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1367493512447089">Sloper and Turner, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1367493512447089">Townsley et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1367493512447089">While et al., 1996</xref>).

            <title>Need for help and support</title>
            <p>Research involving the parents of children with disability and complex health needs, highlighted several aspects of help and support which were relevant to this study, including the provision of multi-agency support, key working and advocacy, emotional and psychological support, and respite.</p>
            <p>Team based multi-agency support around the child and family is widely advocated as best practice in caring for children with disabilities and complex health needs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1367493512447089">DfES, 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1367493512447089">2004</xref>). A number of studies have reported positive parental experience of this approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1367493512447089">Carter et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1367493512447089">Kirk and Glendinning, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1367493512447089">Limbrick, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1367493512447089">Townsley et al., 2004</xref>). The role of the key worker as a source of support to parents has been the subject of considerable scrutiny from a range of research perspectives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1367493512447089">Hewitt-Taylor, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1367493512447089">Marchant et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1367493512447089">Mukherjee et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1367493512447089">Sloper et al., 2006</xref>). In addition, the key worker or lead professionals have been found to take on the role of advocate on behalf of both the child and the family as a whole (Cash et al.,1994; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1367493512447089">Contact-a-Family, 2004a</xref>).</p>
            <p>The particular challenges faced by the parents of children with disabilities and complex health problems in terms of unmet need for psychological and emotional support have been widely reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1367493512447089">Beresford, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1367493512447089">Cash et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1367493512447089">Contact-a-Family, 2004a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1367493512447089">Townsley et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1367493512447089">While et al., 1996</xref>).</p>
            <p>One area which has attracted considerable research scrutiny and has consistently been identified by parents as an area of unmet need is the provision of respite, a break from caring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1367493512447089">Contact-a-Family, 2004a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1367493512447089">Kirk and Glendinning, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1367493512447089">MacDonald and Callery 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1367493512447089">Mencap 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1367493512447089">While et al., 1996</xref>).</p>

            <title>Sense-making</title>
            <p>This theme was both the most complex and least well differentiated in the literature concerning childhood disability and complex health needs, however a number of concepts seemed to be of relevance to this study. For each parent, prior experience of disability and of people with disabilities, and of parenting, including their own experience as both a child and as a parent, and of relationships in general, will all influence how they interpret their situation as the parent of a child with disabilities and complex health needs. Parents draw upon a range of personal, social and cultural experiences in order to make sense of their situation.</p>
            <p>Culture is a multi-faceted phenomenon, described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1367493512447089">Helman (1994</xref>: 2) as: ‘a set of guidelines (both explicit and implicit) which individuals inherit as members of a particular society and which tell them how to view the world, how to experience it emotionally and how to behave in it in relation to other people’. This aspect of parental sense making seemed to be important. Parenting is, itself, a complex concept and several theoretical perspectives appeared to be relevant in considering how parents made sense of their situation, including psycho-analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1367493512447089">Winnicott, 1988</xref>), neuro/endocrine biology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1367493512447089">Stern, 1989</xref>), and social construction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1367493512447089">Arendell, 1997</xref>). The notion of coping, and in particular the symbolic interactionist perspective (see for instance the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1367493512447089">Antonovsky, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1367493512447089">Lazarus, 1966</xref>) – which seeks to explain how behaviour is governed by the ways in which individuals interpret their situation, recognizing that each person is self aware, is able to see themselves from the perspective of others and therefore adapts their behaviour according to the situation – seemed to be potentially relevant in terms of how parents make sense of their situation.</p>
            <p>The sense-making theme can be summarised in a quote which seemed to be relevant across all three of the study themes:
<disp-quote>
                  <p>Some families cope well with the most distressing problem, whereas others are devastated by disabilities that in purely medical terms are less severe. The differences are to be found in the personalities and life experiences of the child and their parents, the functioning and strength of the family unit and the effectiveness of their network of support among relatives, friends and professional services. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1367493512447089">Hall and Hill, 1996</xref>: 1)</p>

         <title>Study method/approach</title>
         <p>This study set out to identify areas of consistency and of difference between the three study sub-groups in the context of the three key study themes. This was considered important because of the author’s observation that services provision for children with disabilities and complex health needs seemed in part to depend upon whether the child’s need for help and support, and their parents’ views on that need for help and support corresponded with professional judgements as to whether the child satisfied the necessary (locally operating) definition/criteria for provision of services to children within one or more of the three identified study sub-groups. Using an approach which drew significantly upon the grounded theory method first developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1367493512447089">Glaser and Strauss (1967</xref>), the study sought to gain insight into parental experience and perception in this regard.</p>

            <title>The study samples</title>
            <p>The study was undertaken within a single English County. Ethical approval for the study was provided by the Local Research Ethics Committee (NHS). Research governance approval was secured through two local NHS Hospital Trusts, three local Primary Care Trusts and the local non-NHS Children’s Hospice. Parents who were nominated to the study were asked to provide written consent to their participation. Professional staff (hospital-based children’s nurses, health visitors, school nurses, community children’s nurses and children’s palliative care nurses) were asked to nominate children from their own caseloads to one of the three study sub-groups:<list list-type="bullet">

            <p>Fieldwork for this study was undertaken in two stages. Stage 1 was an initial semi-structured interview with the parents of 34 children from 33 families, 11 families in each of the three study sub-groups (one family included two children with the same life-limiting illness). A summary of the diagnostic group/area of technology dependence of the children is included in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1367493512447089">Table 2</xref>. Stage 2 was a follow-up interview with the parents of 11 children (one-third of the total study cohort) who were randomly selected from each of the three sub-groups using a stratified sampling frame (four follow-up interviews were scheduled for each of the sub-groups (12 interviews in total) but one interview did not take place due to a coincidental family bereavement in one of the study families).</p>

            <p>The initial interviews lasted for between 33 and 62 minutes. An outline semi-structured interview schedule was devised in advance and included a series of short open-ended questions based upon the three key study themes. The schedule of interview questions was consistently followed, with variation in the wording and order of the questions made only to maintain conversational flow. This allowed for the maintenance of focus upon the identified study themes whilst at the same time encouraging the participants to develop the conversation in areas which they considered important.</p>

Interviews were transcribed from the digital audio recording, and qualitative data analysis of the interview transcripts was undertaken using the accepted grounded theory approach of comparative analysis involving open coding, axial coding and selective coding of a total data-set of some 250,000 words.</p>
            <p>This process generated a series of data items from each of the interview transcripts. The total set of data items for each sub-group was then transferred onto a large single sheet of paper. The three study theme headings: ‘impact’, ‘meaning/sense making’ and ‘help/support’ were incorporated into the data at this stage, in order that they were clearly identifiable within the emerging framework. As the data were mapped onto the single sheets, the process of constant comparison continued, facilitating the inductive differentiation of categories and sub-categories and the identification of relationships within and between categories and sub-categories in the context of the three study themes.</p>
            <p>Data which had been ‘clustered’ into categories and sub-categories were then ‘mind-mapped’ onto a series of drawings using a computer software package ‘inspiration’<sup>®</sup>. The mind-maps<sup>®</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1367493512447089">Buzan and Buzan, 1993</xref>) facilitated the organisation of data within a visual hierarchy representing levels of importance of the categories and sub-categories within the overall framework.</p>

            <title>Follow-up interviews</title>
            <p>The mind-maps<sup>®</sup> were also utilized within the follow-up interviews in which parents were invited to affirm the categories and sub-categories identified through the constant comparative data analysis and in so doing to ‘verify’ a proposed theoretical framework. This was presented to parents in the form of 12 mind-map<sup>®</sup> drawings (further details of this second stage interview process and of the use of mind-maps<sup>®</sup> in the verification of qualitative research data have been reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1367493512447089">Whiting and Sines, 2012</xref> in press)).

         <p>In the discussion of the study findings which follows, summary tables have been provided alongside each of the four study themes in order to illustrate areas of consistency and difference between the three study groups. Brief parental comments have been incorporated into the discussion of the categories and sub-categories which were revealed through the comparative data analysis (these are coded with an alphabetical component which corresponds with the sub-group within which children were referred to the study (TD, LLI or D) and a numeric component (from 001 to 035)).</p>

            <title>Impact</title>
            <p>Three categories ‘time’, ‘multiple roles’ and ‘the disabled family’ and a total of 18 sub-categories, which were revealed through the data analysis capture fully the range of impacts described by parents. The categories ‘time’ and ‘multiple roles’ were strongly related to each other in the accounts offered by parents in all three sub-groups. In addition, analysis revealed an array of relationships across all three categories (and sub-categories) as well as between these categories and those within other study themes (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-1367493512447089">Table 5</xref>).</p>

            <p>The category time emerged consistently within all three sub-groups. This was experienced by parents in a number of ways, though the most consistent area of concern raised by parents related to the additional time demands which arose as a result of the child’s need for additional care.
<disp-quote>
                  <p>I suppose when you get used to it, you just, sort of, get on with it … You don’t really, until you sit and really think about it. Maybe at times like this, you just, sort of, realise that, you know, everyone else does things and that … four times quicker than you. (LLI032)</p>
               </disp-quote>As a result of the additional time demands, parents reported a loss of their own ‘free time’ (D10), and the lack of opportunity for a break from caring for the child:
<disp-quote>
                  <p>And it would be nice to be able to get out, once in a while, in the evening, without [X], as a regular thing, to meet people et cetera and make friends … that sort of thing. (D016).</p>
               </disp-quote>A significant additional time commitment for many parents arose as a result of the multiple roles which they have to take on. Some of these roles relate specifically to the child’s disability, though others are in many ways similar to activities undertaken by parents in families which do not include a disabled child, for instance, simply being a parent, a partner or a ‘taxi driver’ (TD005). Parents in all three sub-groups identified how they took on a wide range of different roles when caring for their child. This includes being an ‘expert’ in the care of their child, for instance in relation to their child’s very particular care needs, knowledge about the medicines they are receiving and in the undertaking of clinical/technical care. Parents also described their role as a ‘nurse’ or ‘physiotherapist’, or as a parent who had to undertake a nursing or physiotherapy role.
<disp-quote>
                  <p>And you stop being just a Mom, because I’m now a Mom and a nurse and physio all in one … [later] So, if [X] was an 18-year-old man, you know, needing to have intravenous antibiotics, they [community nurses] would come and do them. But because he is paediatric, they won’t. So then it falls to parents to take on that role of the nurse. (LLI003)</p>
               </disp-quote>Parents offered a range of perspectives and experiences in the context of their being part of a disabled family. For many of the study participants this included many positive experiences for the family, however there were also significant challenges to family life, as one parent observed: <italic>‘</italic>You become a dysfunctional family, definitely, totally dysfunctional from day one’ (LLI032). The father of another study child commented ‘You know, somebody once said “if you’ve got a disabled child, you’ve got a disabled family” … and that is very, very true’ (LLI027). One parent observed that having a child with a disability changes the way that professionals perceive the whole family.
<disp-quote>
                  <p>There seems to be this big idea that because [X] is disabled we are all disabled as a family. We don’t do anything, we don’t go anywhere, we don’t need to do anything, we don’t need a life erm, and that [X] gets up in the mornings, is put into a chair, that’s where she will stay and then she will go to bed. There is, you know, ‘Oh, you mean you put her on the floor, Oh, you mean you play, you mean she wants, she needs to get into the garden’. I just find that really sad, that people who are supplying or advising on the equipment have got that attitude. (TD020)</p>
               </disp-quote>Although the experiences reported by parent as they related to the impact of their child’s disability or complex health needs were very different, detailed analysis of the data revealed significant areas of consistency within and between the three study sub-groups. This consistency was also evident as parents related impact to the second of the study themes, the need for help and support.</p>

            <p>Parents in each of the sub-groups identified a wide range of people whose provision of help and support emerged as a crucial indicator of ‘good service’. This seemed to be of pivotal importance across the three key study themes. One parent described the community nurse as ‘ … my rock … she is my knight in armour’. (D012). Another parent, in describing her General Practitioner observed<italic>: </italic>‘And she has written letters for me, she has supported me all the way, and without her, I would have gone under’ (TD002). Other parents offered further insight into this helping relationship:
<disp-quote>
                  <p>My community [epilepsy specialist] nurse is excellent, and I can’t fault her, but she only works Monday, Tuesday and Thursday, I don’t consider her just a nurse. I consider her now to be a friend … (LLI003)</p>
                  <p>Especially the doctor at [A] [Local hospital], I mean, she has given me her mobile number, and she has been brilliant, and she said to me any time at all that I am worried about them, you know, I can go straight to her if I want. Not that I ever have, but it is just nice her telling me that, and that has made a big difference, knowing that I have got her support. (D011)</p>
               </disp-quote>In addition, parents offered a number of examples of helping behaviours and supportive characteristics of the people whom they identified. These were related particularly when discussing statutory services providers and included the establishment of ‘ trust’ within the relationship, including the valuing/believing of parental ‘instinct’; longevity of the relationship; being prepared to ‘go the extra mile’, ‘work beyond the job description’ or to be available out-of-hours.</p>
            <p>Parents identified a number of particular processes and resources that they had found helpful including access to specialist or tertiary health care, the provision of social care support and access to specialist education. However, one specific resource was perhaps the single most consistently reported area of need (and of unmet need) across all three study sub-groups and that was the provision of respite – a break from caring. This was often related in the context of the ‘multiple roles’ that parents undertook in caring for their child and also as a concern related to the category ‘time’.</p>
            <p>Parents in all three sub-groups related how they had experienced difficulties when seeking to secure appropriate sources of respite for their child: ‘you just can’t book a babysitter when you have got a child with special needs’ (D014), ‘he was a baby that just screamed the whole night … some carers just couldn’t cope with that, they would just walk out in the middle of the night and say: “We can’t cope with that”’ (D018). For some parents there were particular practical obstacles to be surmounted in securing respite for their child: ‘but now, because [X] is on oxygen at night, and obviously, we have it piped in our house, erm he couldn’t go there [Nan’s house], unless we had a big cylinder to take and he could have it there’ (LLI003). Several parents specifically commented on their experiences related to the allocation of respite based upon a number of locally operating criteria, identifying issues of ‘prioritizing’<italic> (</italic>D016) and ‘entitlement’ (TD005) as barriers to the provision of a break from caring. Other parents identified a mismatch between the nature of the respite that was on offer and that which they considered would best meet their (and their child’s) needs.</p>
            <p>This aspect of parental experience, the difficulty in securing a break from caring, provided a significant ‘signpost’ to a fourth study theme which emerged from within the overall data-set: ‘battleground’. This will be examined further following an exploration of the third of the study themes: meaning and sense-making.</p>

            <title>Meaning/sense-making</title>
            <p>Analysis of the parental interviews led to the identification of two categories within this theme, ‘diagnosis’ and ‘personal, cultural and personality factors’ (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table7-1367493512447089">Table 7</xref>). These categories and sub-categories within then were consistent across all three study sub-groups, though there were a number of areas of difference between the sub-groups at the more detailed, (sub-category) level of analysis.</p>

            <p>In the context of sense-making, ‘diagnosis’ is a significant issue for many families. Early diagnosis was consistently identified by parents as a positive factor in how they had made sense of their situation: ‘They could actually tell us from day one, from then, from seven months old, what her outcome was going to be’ (D007), whereas delayed diagnosis, particularly when parents were seeking answers, seemed to adversely impact upon sense-making ‘I was told to go away. “First-time mum, nothing wrong with her, normal baby, go away”’ (TD008).</p>
            <p>In order to make sense and develop their own understanding of their child’s difficulties, some parents felt that it was important to be able to assign a ‘label’, to ‘name’ the child’s condition:
<disp-quote>
                  <p>I wanted a label, I needed a label, because that was my background [as a residential social worker for adults with learning disabilities] and if I know what I’ve got, I know what I am dealing with. (LLI031)</p>
               </disp-quote>Many parents identified how elements of their own personality or character assisted them in making sense of things. For some this involved ‘normalising’ their situation: ‘Most of the time she is just a normal little girl isn’t she?’ (TD034), whereas for others, sense-making was explained in terms of the development of personal strength or resilience:
<disp-quote>
                  <p>It has made me very strong; I am a very strong person now. I don’t know, but he has brought a lot of love in the home as well, the bond between the whole family is much stronger. (D018)</p>
               </disp-quote>Parents identified their own coping styles as being important in terms of how they had made sense of and continued to deal with their situation. For many parents this seemed to be more than simply coping in the context of the child’s disabilities and was expressed as a wider personality trait: ‘whatever is thrown at us we deal with it and get on with it’ (D006), ‘I’m quite a strong person anyway’ (LLI025), ‘I am quite an independent person, quite a strong character’ (TD022).</p>
            <p>This part of the conversations with parents often seemed to feature the most emotionally intense phase of the interview – the transcripts contained more pauses, silences (and tears) in response to the question ‘How have you made sense of your situation?’ than in any other part of the interview. Whilst the question was never asked in the form ‘What sense have you made of the fact that your child is different?’ this was the <italic>real</italic> question that the study was seeking to explore. Striking the delicate balance between probing for a rich and meaningful response whilst not wanting to cause unnecessary upset or anxiety was, at times, quite a difficult task.</p>

            <title>Battleground</title>
            <p>Detailed and systematic examination of the mind-maps<sup>®</sup> for the three study sub-groups revealed a fourth overarching theme ‘battleground’ (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table8-1367493512447089">Table 8</xref>). This then included the categories ‘professional mistrust’ and ‘labelling/meeting criteria’ which related to several categories within the ‘need for help and support’ and ‘sense-making’ themes. It is important to acknowledge that the ‘battleground’ theme did not present consistently across all families, however, the words ‘fight’ or ‘battle’ occurred several times during the course of just over one-third of the study interviews. The label that has been applied to this theme reflects the importance which parents attached to this issue. Much of the parental commentary is best summed up in three short quotes:
<disp-quote>
                  <p>I feel that everything I have achieved for [X] has been through a battle. (TD002)</p>
                  <p>You are up against the system all the time and you just haven’t got time to spend hours and hours and hours trying to find the person that you spoke to last time about … Oh! (throwing up hands in exasperation) … just everyday things. (LLI032)</p>
                  <p>They [Primary Care Trust] tried to get Social Services to pay for some [respite]. I think we did actually put this in one of the letters, it seems it is not about looking after the interest of sick children at all, it is about running their organisations efficiently and being within their budget. (D007)</p>
               </disp-quote>Several parents related their ‘battleground’ experiences in the context of a <bold>loss of trust</bold> in their relationship with professional staff. A number of the examples provided by parents stemmed from a single event, often a number of years previously, which seemed to be important in the context of how they described their current concerns with the provision of services to their child. This included the lack of ‘local’ expertise in the context of a child with a particularly rare condition (TD008), the giving of ‘information’ which subsequently proved to be inaccurate (TD013) and a ‘lack of preparation’ (a doctor failing to read the child’s notes) in advance of an ‘important’ clinic appointment (TD034).</p>

            <p>Parents expressed exasperation, misunderstanding and, at times, anger about the problems which they had experienced in terms of the need for their child to have a designated diagnosis or label or to meet specific criteria in order to qualify for receipt of a particular benefit or service. For a number of parents, the absence of such a label meant that their child was denied access to one service or another. This was particularly evident in relation to two aspects of services provision. The first of these related to respite/palliative care through the local children’s hospice, whose provision was predicated upon the child being given a life-threatening/life-limiting illness diagnosis. The second issue related to the local provision of continuing care, the criteria for which were based, in large part, upon the child’s dependence upon specific technology.</p>
            <p>It is important to acknowledge that the battleground theme was evident within only one-third of the first round interviews. However, when the battleground mind-map<sup>®</sup> was presented to the second-round interview participants, there was extensive recognition by this randomly selected sample of parents of both the battleground theme itself and also of the three constituent categories.

Systematic analysis of the study data revealed areas of parental experience which were consistent with the findings of the research literature discussed above, particularly in respect of parental perceptions of impact and need for help and support. In addition, the analysis revealed major areas of consistency within the reported experiences of parents of children with a disability, those with a life-limiting/life-threatening illness and those whose children were technology dependent.</p>
         <p>Where areas of inconsistency between the sub-groups were revealed, this was generally related to quite detailed and specific areas of individual parental experience. A particularly useful illustration of this can be seen in the way that parents in the three sub-groups presented their experiences of sleep deprivation and how they related this in the context of their need for the provision of respite care. Detailed examination of this aspect of the parental interviews revealed that the opportunity to access respite care (‘a break from caring’) was inconsistently experienced across the three sub-groups. For some children, access to respite care was contingent upon the successful negotiation of either the referral criteria for hospice care (as identified by parents in the life-limiting/life-threatening illness and technology dependence sub-groups) or the meeting of locally applied continuing care criteria (parents in the technology dependence sub-groups). This finding is clearly important for professional staff and service providers.</p>
         <p>In light of the above, it is perhaps not surprising that difficulties in gaining access to respite care was most evident amongst parents of children in the disability sub-group. It is, however, also noteworthy that there were significant differences between the sub-groups in respect of the original source of referral into the study. Of the 11 families in each sub-group, nine of the disability sub-group children were referred by health visitors, nine of the life-limiting/life-threatening illness children were referred by either the specialist palliative care Community Children’s Nurse (CCN) or the children’s hospice team and 10 of the technology dependent children were referred by the ‘generalist’ CCNs. It was not clear from this study whether it was the application of specific eligibility criteria by service providers or the particular knowledge/gate-keeping roles played by particular professional groups in ‘sign-posting’ families which influenced whether individual children were able to access respite care. Perhaps this element of the study requires further examination.</p>
         <p>It is important to acknowledge that this was a small study based upon the experiences of a small group of parents within only one single English County. The extent to which the findings might have a wider implication beyond this small sample is certainly one of the limitations of the study.</p>
         <p>A further limitation of this study was its use of a previously untested approach to the validation of qualitative research data through the innovative use of mind-maps<sup>®</sup>. The study participants responded very positively to the mind-maps<sup>®</sup> with which they were presented. In addition, there was a very strong affirmation within the second-stage interviews of the categories and sub-categories as presented in the sequence of 12 mind maps which made up the full theoretical framework for the study. However, the extent to which such an approach can be used in order to establish validity and trustworthiness in the findings of qualitative research will require more extensive testing.</p>

         <title>Conclusion</title>
         <p>Through the application of a qualitative investigative approach, this study set out to examine three important aspects of the experience of parents of children with disabilities and complex health needs. Parents of 34 disabled children within 33 families were engaged in semi-structured interview conversations which sought to explore their experiences in terms of three key themes – impact, need for help, and support and sense-making. A fourth study theme – ‘battleground’ – emerged entirely from within the study data set and this seemed to be an important determinant of how parents perceived their relationships with a range of health, social care and education professionals.</p>
         <p>Further detailed analysis of the study interview transcripts highlighted how meaning and sense-making were absolutely pivotal in determining both how parents experienced the impact of childhood disability and complex health-related problems upon family life, and also how they perceived their need for help and support in caring for their child.</p>
         <p>Parental sense-making is clearly a multi-faceted phenomenon, and one which is influenced by a wide range of personal, cultural and personality factors. For many parents, the ‘battle-ground’ factor appeared to be significant in terms of how they experienced all three of the original study themes, though perhaps this was most important in the context of parental sense-making. Professional staff who are working with parents in such circumstances need to be clearly cognisant of the importance of parental sense-making as it relates to parental experience and perception. In addition, staff need to consider how the sense that parents make of their situation might inform the whole basis of their relationship!</p>
