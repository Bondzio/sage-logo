<p>Since I joined the editorial team of <italic>Human Resource Development Review</italic> in 2008, we have tried to publish articles that push the traditional limits of the field. Most of the issues published in the past several volumes include at least one article that is a bit “outside the box” for the field. This issue is no exception. Although each article in this issue of the journal offers new insights to the field, two articles in particular stood out for me as we prepared this issue because they spoke to my own research interest while being “outside the box.”</p>
<p>Veliquette’s article explores the role of Anthony Giddens’ structuration theory in Human Resource Development (HRD). As Veliquette notes, few HRD scholars use structuration to frame their works and even fewer publish their works in the four core journals under the umbrella of the Academy of Human Resource Development. Perhaps one reason for this is the strong influence of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1534484313479098">Swanson’s (2001)</xref> three-legged stool metaphor of HRD which emphasized that there are only three categories of theory that inform the field—economics, psychology, and systems. As structuration is a structural sociological theory, and not a functionalist “systems” theory of sociology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1534484313479098">Turner, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1534484313479098">Wallace &amp; Wolf, 1995</xref>), the three-legged stool metaphor excludes it as a source of knowledge to frame our understanding of HRD research and practice. Since I am one of those few HRD scholars who regularly uses sociological theories, such as Giddens’ structuration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1534484313479098">Callahan, 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1534484313479098">2009</xref>) and Bourdieu’s cultural conflict (Hlavin &amp; Callahan, in press), I welcome this call to have other HRD scholars stand in the gap to use theories about “how and why humans behave, interact, and organize themselves in certain ways” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1534484313479098">Turner, 1991</xref>, p. 1).</p>
<p>Thory’s article touches on several areas of my own interests—emotions in collectives, critical HRD, and gender. A decade ago, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1534484313479098">Bierema and Cseh (2003)</xref> noted that studies explicitly focusing on gender as an analytic category were “nearly absent from the literature” (p. 5). Almost a decade later, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1534484313479098">Bierema’s (2010)</xref> subsequent research on diversity found that not much had changed. She notes that the field has continued to focus on performance-based research that devalues any topic that might threaten to disrupt the “dominant masculine structure that values instrumentalist goals over all others” (p. 570). And, yet, Thory confronts that instrumentalist application of emotional intelligence (EI) so frequently seen in HRD research. She uses sociological conceptions of emotion and gender to challenge the way EI is typically applied to privilege men in masculine structures of organizations. Her work reminds us to be more mindful about the implications of emotional intelligence when HRD professionals embark on the “EI” bandwagon.</p>
<p>One of my goals when becoming editor with Volume 11 was to increase the number of critical theory manuscripts that were submitted to the journal while remaining open to publishing dominant paradigm manuscripts. Now that we are working through Volume 12, we are indeed seeing more manuscripts that take a critical perspective, as this issue indicates. Perhaps more importantly, we are seeing an overall increase in submissions to the journal. The total number of manuscripts received in 2012 is the highest in the history of the journal and is 20% higher than the previous high record in 2011. Certainly the transition to an online journal management system played a role in the increase in manuscripts. Regardless of the reason, we’re pleased that the increase included new authors from new disciplinary fields who offered new topics of interest—all contributing to the diversification of the journal. I hope you’ll enjoy this issue of reaching outside the box.</p>
