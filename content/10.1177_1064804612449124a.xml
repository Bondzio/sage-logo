<p>This book, a concise and highly readable view of the human factors/ergonomics field, can be used as an introductory text but perhaps has more value for informing general readers of the existence of the HF/E field and what it contributes to equipment and system design and development. Barnes provides examples of poor customer experiences resulting from faulty or inadequate consideration of HF/E. <italic>At Work With Human Puzzles</italic> is a good book to recommend to someone to explain the nature and value of our field.</p>
<p>There are four chapters, or “puzzle pieces,” as Barnes calls them: “Personnel,” “Training and Expertise,” “Technology Insertion and Interface Design,” and “Systems Engineering.” In each section, the reader is provided with a concise overview of the issues and the state of the art.</p>
<p>Regarding personnel selection, the only selection device of which the general public seems to be aware is the Myers-Briggs Type Inventory (MBTI). A mother-daughter duo developed this personality and style inventory test on the basis of writings of the psychoanalyst Carl Jung. Although Jung’s theories have fallen out of favor, the MBTI lives on. Wide dissemination of <italic>At Work With Human Puzzles</italic> could remedy this shortcoming.</p>
<p>Barnes presents the currently agreed-upon “Big 5” factors of personality: extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, emotional stability, and intellect-imagination. He also provides the Web site for the O*NET-SOC system, which is the nation’s primary standard for occupational classification. Current personnel selection practices used for job placement in government and industry are presented.</p>
<p>All of the sections are very well done, but my favorite is “Technology Insertion and Interface Design.” Barnes notes that it took 38 years for radio to reach 50 million users, 13 years for television to reach 50 million users, and only 5 years for the Internet to reach 50 million users. Typically, most industrial and governmental work organizations are critically dependent on technology, but technology can work well only if people can use it effectively. Where and how technology is inserted into an organization are important considerations; thus, business technologies should be viewed in terms of how they can be employed to leverage human potential. Training requirements can often be reduced or even eliminated through careful, effective interface design. Barnes also examines these issues from the point of view of the customer. Ineffective interface design, including the design of interactive Web sites, can cost businesses money.</p>
<p>Barnes introduces Harry Helson’s theory of adaption level, which concerns how people’s expectations change as a result of their prior experience. I congratulate Barnes on recognizing the relevance of Helson’s work addressing the issue of rapid changes in technology.</p>
<p>The author provides good coverage of psychological and behavioral issues. I found the “Systems Integration” section, including discussion of the issue of customer relations, to be helpful. In that section, Barnes also discusses project-level risks along with appropriate mitigation strategies. The same approach is taken with respect to design-level risks. Helpful references and Web sites are included.</p>
<p>The book is highly interesting and easy to read. Although I am familiar with most of these topics, reading <italic>At Work With Human Puzzles</italic> was refreshing and well worth my time. Handing it to others who need to know about the HF/E field and its contributions could help avoid the questions professionals in this field receive about what they do for a living.</p>
