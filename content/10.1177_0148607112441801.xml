<p><italic>Aim</italic>: To evaluate the effect of obesity on mortality, length of mechanical ventilation, and length of stay (LOS) in critically ill children. <italic>Methods</italic>: Retrospective cohort study in 2- to 18-year-olds, admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) at the Children’s Hospital of Wisconsin from 2005–2009 who required invasive ventilation. Weight <italic>z</italic> score was used to categorize patients as normal (–1.89 to 1.04), overweight (1.05–1.65), obese (1.66–2.33), and severely obese (&gt;2.33). Underweight patients were excluded. Age, gender, admission type, Pediatric Index of Mortality 2 score, operative status, trauma status, admission Pediatric Outcome Performance Category, and diagnosis categories were also collected. The outcomes were mortality, total ventilator days, and PICU LOS. Univariate analysis was used to compare the groups, and multivariate logistic regression was used to compare mortality. Total ventilation days and LOS were modeled with linear regression. <italic>Results</italic>: In total, 1030 patients were included in the study, with 753 normal weight, 137 overweight, 76 obese, and 64 severely obese. The risk-adjusted mortality rates in overweight (odds ratio [OR], 1.06; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.62–1.82), obese (OR, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.31–1.48), and severely obese patients (OR, 1.02; 95% CI, 0.45–2.34) were not significantly different compared with the normal-weight group. Total ventilation days (<italic>P</italic> = .9628) and PICU LOS (<italic>P</italic> = .8431) were not significantly different between the groups after adjusting for risk factors. <italic>Conclusion</italic>: Critically ill overweight, obese, and severely obese children who require invasive mechanical ventilation have similar mortality, length of stay in the PICU, and ventilator days as compared with normal-weight children.</p>

<p>Overweight and obesity among children and adolescents continues to be a public health concern in the United States. Since 1980, the prevalence of body mass index (BMI)-for-age ≥95th percentile has tripled among school-age children and adolescents, and it remains high at 16.9%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0148607112441801">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0148607112441801"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0148607112441801">3</xref></sup> As the prevalence of obesity is increasing and because of its frequent association with many diseases, the prevalence of obesity among hospitalized children is concomitantly high at approximately 20%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0148607112441801">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>Obese children often become obese adults,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0148607112441801">5</xref></sup> who are at risk for many chronic conditions such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and certain cancers. High BMI in children may also have immediate consequences, such as elevated lipid concentrations, higher blood pressure,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0148607112441801">1</xref></sup> and worsened respiratory status with diseases such as asthma.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0148607112441801">6</xref></sup> Obesity has also been associated with obstructive sleep apnea in children.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0148607112441801">7</xref></sup> Multiple adult studies have investigated the outcome of hospitalized obese patients in the intensive care unit (ICU). The results have been mixed with regard to whether obesity is associated with higher mortality and morbidity in critically ill adults.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0148607112441801">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0148607112441801"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0148607112441801">10</xref></sup> Some studies have shown that obese adults hospitalized for acute lung injury have a longer duration of mechanical ventilation and longer hospital stay than nonobese peers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0148607112441801">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0148607112441801"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0148607112441801">13</xref></sup> In contrast, other studies have shown no difference in mortality, length of ventilation, and length of stay between obese and nonobese adult patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0148607112441801">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0148607112441801"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0148607112441801"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0148607112441801">17</xref></sup> During the recent influenza A (H1N1) pandemic, overweight and obese children had a more severe course of illness.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0148607112441801">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0148607112441801">19</xref></sup> Data also suggest that obese children are less likely to survive an in-hospital cardiac arrest.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0148607112441801">20</xref></sup> Currently, there are no data on the outcomes of mortality or morbidity in critically ill obese children.</p>
<p>We hypothesized that critically ill obese children requiring invasive mechanical ventilation would have a higher mortality rate, have a longer length of stay (LOS) in the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU), and require a longer length of mechanical ventilation than critically ill children of normal weight.</p>
<sec id="section1-0148607112441801" sec-type="materials|methods">
<title>Materials and Methods</title>
<p>We performed a retrospective cohort study on critically ill children from ages 2–18 years who were admitted to the PICU at the Children’s Hospital of Wisconsin from 2005–2009. Only patients who required invasive mechanical ventilation were included in the study. Patients who had a tracheostomy at baseline were excluded. Weight <italic>z</italic> score, adjusted for age and gender, was used to categorize patients as normal (–1.89 to 1.04), underweight (&lt;–1.89), overweight (1.05–1.65), obese (1.66–2.33), and severely obese (&gt;2.33).</p>
<p>The weight categories correlate with normal (3rd–85th percentile) and accepted BMI-for-age definitions of overweight (&gt;85th–95th percentile) and obesity (&gt;95th percentile).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0148607112441801">21</xref></sup> Because there is no accepted definition for severe obesity, we used a <italic>z</italic> score that correlated with the 99th percentile. Patients who were underweight were excluded from the study.</p>
<sec id="section2-0148607112441801">
<title>Data Collection</title>
<p>Data were collected from the Virtual PICU Performance System (VPS), a clinical database that connects a global network of children’s hospitals and standardizes data sharing and benchmarking between PICUs. We obtained the following data from VPS: age, gender, admission type (scheduled vs unscheduled), severity of illness score (ie, Pediatric Index of Mortality 2 score [PIM2]),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0148607112441801">22</xref></sup> operative status, trauma status, admission functional status (ie, Pediatric Outcome Performance Category [POPC]),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0148607112441801">23</xref></sup> diagnosis categories, start and termination of invasive mechanical ventilation (additional days if patient reintubated), medical LOS in the PICU, and mortality. The medical LOS was determined by the duration in the PICU from time of admission to the time when a discharge or transfer order was placed. POPC was scored as no disability (1), mild disability (2), moderate disability (3), severe disability (4), coma (5), and brain death (6).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0148607112441801">23</xref></sup> Trauma status is defined by physical trauma as the principal cause of the patient’s injury or illness that created the need for the PICU admission. Operative status is defined by surgery (excluding diagnostic or interventional cardiac catheterizations) done within 24 hours before or after admission to the PICU.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0148607112441801">
<title>Outcome Measures</title>
<p>The primary outcome was mortality. Other outcomes included medical LOS in the PICU and total ventilation days. Total ventilation days was defined as the total duration that the patients required invasive ventilation during the entire hospitalization, which included the duration of ventilation following reintubation, if needed. The secondary outcomes were analyzed both with all patients and subsequently only with patients who remained alive as a subgroup.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0148607112441801">
<title>Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>Descriptive statistics were used to summarize sample characteristics. χ<sup>2</sup> or Fisher exact tests were used to determine significant differences between groups with respect to categorical variables. Continuous variables were compared using the Kruskal-Wallis test. POPC 4, 5, and 6 were grouped together for further analysis due to the small number of patients in these groups.</p>
<p>A multivariate logistic regression was used to model the probability of death (the dependent variable, dead vs alive); independent variables analyzed included age (months), weight categories, admission type (scheduled vs unscheduled), trauma status, operative status, admission functional status (POPC), and PIM2 risk of mortality (PIM2ROM), which was derived from the PIM2 score. A backward elimination model selection procedure was employed in all multivariable analyses.</p>
<p>Multiple linear regressions were used to model medical LOS in the PICU and total ventilation days on the weight categories and other risk factors (age, weight categories, admission type trauma status, operative status, POPC, and PIM2ROM). A backward elimination model selection procedure was employed to identify statistically significant covariates to be included in the model. Both outcomes—LOS and total ventilation days—were not normally distributed and so were log-transformed before performing linear regression analysis.</p>
<p>Because we hypothesized a relationship between obesity and the primary and secondary outcomes, weight categories were included in all the final models. A statistical significance (α) of .05 was used throughout. SAS version 9.2 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC) was used to perform all statistical analyses.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>In total, there were 1146 patients, with 65.7% in the normal-weight category, 10.1% underweight, 12% overweight, 6.6% obese, and 5.6% severely obese. Underweight patients were excluded from the remainder of the analysis. Patients did not differ in age or gender based on weight categories, but there were significant differences in other factors (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0148607112441801">Tables 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0148607112441801">2</xref>).</p>

<p>The factors associated with mortality in the logistic regression are PIM2ROM, diagnosis category, patient type, and operative status (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0148607112441801">Table 3</xref>). Weight category was kept in the model, as it was the main focus of the study, although there was no statistically significant difference between the groups (<italic>P</italic> = .7763). Overweight and severely obese patients tended to have similar mortality risk compared with patients in the normal-weight category, with adjusted odds ratio (OR) = 1.06 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.62–1.82) and adjusted OR = 1.02 (95% CI, 0.45–2.34), respectively. Patients who were obese tended to have a lower mortality risk compared with patients in the normal-weight category (adjusted OR, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.31–1.48), but none of these differences were statistically significant.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The results of the present study suggest that obesity is not an independent risk factor for death in mechanically ventilated, critically ill children. Obesity is not associated with the duration of PICU stay or length of mechanical ventilation. The results were adjusted for admission type (scheduled vs unscheduled), trauma status, operative status, admission functional status (POPC), and PIM2ROM.</p>
<p>We had 12.2% patients who were obese and severely obese (weight <italic>z</italic> scores &gt;1.65), which is lower than the most recent National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (2007–2008) in the general population, where 16.9% of the population fits into these categories.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0148607112441801">3</xref></sup> Our results are similar to a majority of the adult studies, which showed that obese adult ICU patients have equivalent or improved mortality compared with nonobese patients. Three meta-analyses that studied adult patients came to similar conclusions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0148607112441801">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0148607112441801">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0148607112441801">25</xref></sup> To our knowledge, this is the first study investigating specifically the influence of obesity in critically ill, mechanically ventilated children.</p>
<p>Earlier population-based studies had described an association between BMI and mortality as a J-shaped or U-shaped curve in young adults, demonstrating increased mortality in the lowest and highest BMI distribution, controlling for age, smoking, and history of other comorbidities.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0148607112441801">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0148607112441801">27</xref></sup> We did not see this phenomenon in our population. We chose to exclude underweight patients to focus on the effect of overweight and obesity as it has been shown that underweight critically ill patients have a higher risk of adjusted mortality.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0148607112441801">28</xref></sup></p>
<p>A recent study published from Australia showed that extreme weight centiles are associated with increased mortality in the PICU.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0148607112441801">29</xref></sup> However, this study included both extreme weight centiles in the analysis, including patients who were malnourished. By analyzing both underweight and obese patients in the same group, the underweight group could have skewed the results of the mortality of the obese group. It is possible that the risk of mortality would be higher in their underweight group if the obese patients were removed from the analysis. The patients in our study were much sicker (overall mortality 12.6%) since we included only mechanically ventilated children, whereas the previous study included all children admitted to the PICU (overall mortality 3.2%). Given that our study found no important differences in mortality and morbidity among overweight/obese children vs children of normal weight, we believe that underweight children may have skewed the data in the previous study.</p>
<p>An explanation for the lack of difference in the odds of mortality among critically ill obese and nonobese patients could be that some or all of the deleterious effects of obesity could be countered by some therapeutic interventions with the resulting increased use of resources but not necessarily worse outcomes. For instance, some of the theoretical deleterious effects related to obesity are higher chances of upper airway obstruction and decreased chest wall compliance, which could lead to difficulties in weaning from mechanical ventilation, resulting in longer ventilation times and its associated comorbidities. However, our study shows no significant differences in this population compared with patients in the normal-weight category. It is possible that the proposed theoretical effects of some of these obesity-related processes are counterbalanced by careful ventilator management and the use of alternative ways of respiratory support, such as noninvasive mechanical ventilation or high-flow oxygen delivery systems. Given the retrospective nature of this study and because we did not analyze the rate of use of these or other therapies among the different weight groups, it is not possible to determine by what mechanisms obesity might affect the outcome of critically ill ventilated children.</p>
<p>To examine the outcome of only critically ill children, we have elected to only include patients who required mechanical ventilation. This, however, may result in a biased population of patients who are already mechanically ventilated. This study was not designed to address differences in the need for mechanical ventilation in obese children or to investigate the differences in mortality that might arise from being mechanically ventilated. We excluded patients who died in our subset analysis for LOS and total ventilation days to avoid the effect of time to death with withdrawal of mechanical ventilation or being discharged at death.</p>
<p>The fact that there were no differences in all 3 outcomes in our study suggests that our results are probably real. The time period of the study also encompassed the H1N1 pandemic, which caused worse morbidity and mortality in overweight and obese children.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0148607112441801">18</xref></sup> Because we did not specifically exclude children with this diagnosis, this may have countered any protective effects of obesity on critically ill children with other diagnoses. Since ours was a retrospective study, we did not ascertain how long our children had been overweight or obese. Although it is possible that a long history may predispose to poorer outcomes, in our study, patients who were older and obese did not do worse than their younger obese or normal-weight counterparts.</p>
<p>We have used the PIM2ROM for severity of illness risk adjustment instead of the widely available and more frequently used Pediatric Risk of Mortality III (PRISM III) scores.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0148607112441801">30</xref></sup> The PIM2ROM may be better suited to studies such as ours because it uses data obtained through the first 1 hour of PICU admission as opposed to PRISM III, which uses data obtained in the first 24 hours of PICU admission. Thus, the PIM2 may be less affected by individual variations in PICU management. The PIM2 score has not been formally validated in the United States except in abstract form.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0148607112441801">31</xref></sup> Although PRISM III has been validated in the United States, it was not available in the public domain during the time frame of this study. Two publications compared PRISM III and PIM2 scores as predictors of mortality and found them to be equally good,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0148607112441801">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0148607112441801">33</xref></sup> and one study found the PIM2 score to be superior in Australia and New Zealand.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0148607112441801">34</xref></sup> The PIM2 score has also been validated in other countries.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0148607112441801">35</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0148607112441801"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0148607112441801">37</xref></sup> For the above reasons, we believe that PIM2 is an appropriate risk of mortality score for this study.</p>
<p>This study has the limitations of a retrospective study. Although we intended to use BMI to quantify level of obesity, the lack of consistently recorded height data precluded us from doing so. To be able to include all patients, we used weight <italic>z</italic> scores to classify the patients into weight groups instead of BMIs. It is possible that some of the nonobese children were also short for age, and their BMI-for-age percentiles pushed their BMIs into the overweight category. Similarly, some of the heavier children might have been taller, and their BMI values might have been normal. These may have skewed the results of the study. We have used total ventilation days to capture patients who required readmission to the PICU and reintubation rates because we suspected that obese patients might be prone to more airway problems than their nonobese counterparts. It is possible that a patient discharged from our PICU required another readmission for invasive ventilation in another facility. This is unlikely as our institution is the only tertiary children’s hospital in the region. We used medical LOS to avoid problems associated with discharge delays from the PICU that are unrelated to medical issues.</p>
<p>The limitations of registry data regarding the integrity and validity of the data and sampling bias were addressed through the use of uniform operational definitions, uniform data collection, rigorous prospective abstractor training and competency-based certification, detailed periodic reabstraction, and large sample size. Sampling bias was minimized through the use of strict inclusion and exclusion criteria, comprehensive methods to verify data completeness, and large sample size. However, it is possible that the existing VPS data elements failed to capture unmeasured confounders of outcomes.</p>
<p>In conclusion, our study demonstrates that obese, critically ill mechanically ventilated children have similar mortality risk as normal-weight children. The PICU length of stay and duration of invasive ventilation in obese children are not longer than in normal-weight children. As the prevalence of obesity continues to rise, it will be important for critical care physicians to consider these findings when discussing prognosis and expectations with patients and families. Prospective multicenter trials are needed to confirm these findings and to elucidate the mechanisms by which obesity may affect critical illness.</p>
