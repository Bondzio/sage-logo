<p>The inaugural RANZCP Symposium on Youth Mental Health was held in Melbourne on 18 February 2012. Hosted by the College’s newly formed Special Interest Group (SIG) in Youth Mental Health, the day provided a valuable opportunity for Fellows and trainees with an interest in youth mental health to meet colleagues, hear presentations from a range of experts, and discuss current issues in an open forum. Participants were welcomed by Professor Pat McGorry from Orygen Youth Health, the Centre for Youth Mental Health at the University of Melbourne and Chair of the steering committee of the Youth SIG, and by a peer support worker at Orygen Youth Health.</p>
<p>The day opened with a video message of support from the Australian Minister for Mental Health, Mark Butler, who outlined the Government’s recent commitments to mental health reform over the next five years. The Minister highlighted the Government’s recognition of the unique mental health care needs of Australia’s young people, with the expansion of the headspace program to 90 services nation-wide, and the national roll-out of a specialised early psychosis program comprising up to 16 centres across the nation by 2015.</p>
<p>The program for the meeting covered two broad themes: the knowledge base relevant to youth mental health, and service models for young people with mental health issues.</p>
<p>A summary of the scientific proceedings of the day has been distilled into a brief and informative report which also outlines the discussion on issues surrounding service provision and training for psychiatrists with a specific interest in youth mental health.</p>
