<p>Transient ischemic attacks have been well defined and studied in adults. However, among children, transient ischemic attacks remain comparatively understudied. We present a cohort of 68 children with transient ischemic attacks and describe their clinical characteristics and describe the association of transient ischemic attacks in children with subsequent stroke. We searched the patient medical record database at Boston Children’s Hospital using the search terms “transient ischemic attack” or “TIA” in the year 2010. We examined cases of transient ischemic attacks in children 18 years of age or younger who had a transient ischemic attack between the years of 2009 and 2011. Transient ischemic attack was defined as a focal neurologic deficit that resolved completely. We only included children who had a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) done close to the time of the event. A blinded neuroradiologist evaluated all MRIs. Our cohort comprised 43% females, 79% white, 9% black, 1% Asian, 9% other, 1% unknown, and ranged in age from 2 to 18 years. Neuroimaging obtained following transient ischemic attack revealed that 9 of 68 patients (13%) sustained a stroke as indicated by new evidence of ischemic injury in a vascular territory. Males predominated in children with transient ischemic attacks who did not have a stroke, 37 of 59 (63%), whereas females predominated in children who had a transient ischemic attack and subsequent stroke, 7 of 9 (78%). Among the children who had both transient ischemic attack and evidence of stroke, 100% had either adult or pediatric stroke risk factors compared to 30 of 59 (51%) who had transient ischemic attack with no stroke. Because all children who had transient ischemic attacks and subsequent stroke had adult or pediatric stroke risk factors, these children could constitute a subgroup of children with transient ischemic attack at higher risk for stroke. This could be a subgroup of children with transient ischemic attack that should be evaluated and treated aggressively to prevent stroke occurrence.</p>

<p>Encephalitis in children has been associated with neurologic impairment and increased risk of epilepsy. The goal of this project was to determine effects of seizure during encephalitis on the risk of developing epilepsy and cognitive outcome. A retrospective record review of 62 patients with encephalitis was conducted. Families were contacted by phone for follow-up of cognitive functioning using the PedsQL Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory and Cognitive Functioning Scales. Parents were questioned regarding change in their child’s thinking, behavior, school performance, and seizure status. Of the 62 patients, 49 had known seizure status: 11 (33%) patients of 33 with seizure during the acute encephalitic phase developed epilepsy whereas 2 (13%) patients did not. Thirteen (68%) families of children having seized in the acute phase reported change in thinking or behavior from baseline, whereas 7 (53%) of patients without seizure reported a change. The average PedsQL cognitive functioning score patients with seizure versus without seizure was 66.9 versus 72.8 for parent report and 61.1 versus 75.9 for child report. PedsQL cognitive subscale means for a published healthy sample were 90.1 and 82.1, respectively. Relative risk of developing epilepsy is 2.7 times higher for patients presenting with seizure during the acute encephalitis phase than for patients who do not. There could be an association between seizure at presentation and decreased cognitive functioning on follow-up, shown by the higher number of patients with changes in thinking and behavior as well as lower scores on the PedsQL cognitive functioning module. Evaluation of a larger sample is necessary to determine whether seizure in the acute phase of encephalitis predicts a poorer cognitive outcome.</p>

<p>In the last 20 years, many studies have been published on the genetic etiology of epilepsy. Over 400 different chromosomal imbalances and several deletion syndromes have been associated with epilepsy. Although the current literature proposes a complex genetic disease association for approximately 40% of cases of epilepsy, there are no national guidelines assisting medical professionals when ordering genetic testing in cases of epilepsy. A retrospective chart review of 147 children diagnosed with epilepsy that received single-nucleotide polymorphism microarrays will be conducted to determine if a single-nucleotide polymorphism microarray is a genetic test yielding a clinically significant number of abnormal results. The study will also compare the seizure type and other presenting medical indications of those with epilepsy with an abnormal microarray to those with epilepsy and a normal microarray. Seizure types are classified according to the International League Against Epilepsy seizure classification. Other presenting medical indications include developmental delay, intellectual disability, autism, and other organ system based diseases. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings including clinically significant abnormalities (epilepsy correlating) not clinically significant findings (abnormal but not epilepsy related) and normal imaging, will be compared to the results of unknown significance microarray findings to determine if different MRI findings are associated with certain single-nucleotide polymorphism microarray results. The results of these associations concerning epilepsy, seizure types, MRI results, or other medical indications with abnormal microarray results could offer clinically important information that could guide a clinician’s diagnostic evaluation in patients with epilepsy.</p>

<p>Congenital generalized lipodystrophy is rare autosomal recessive disease characterized by paucity of body fat tissue and accompanied by metabolic complications. There are 4 known types caused by 4 congenital generalized lipodystrophy loci: AGPAT2, BSCL2, CAV1, and PTRF. The most recently described is due to <italic>PTRF</italic> (polymerase I and transcript release factor) mutation and it presents with neuromuscular weakness. PTRF is essential for the formation and proper function of caveolae in human cells. The patients, a 4-year-old girl and 14-year-old boy, are siblings of nonconsanguineous Hispanic parents. Their genetic analysis showed a homozygous mutation, c.135delGp.Lys45AspfsX5, resulting in an abnormal, short PTRF protein. Each parent carries a heterozygous c.135delG with no evidence of disease. Both of the pregnancies have been complicated—one by oligohydramnios and the second by hypertension, both requiring cesarian section. The patients have a marked lack of subcutaneous fat with reduced body mass index and evidence of congenital myopathy: hyper-CKemia, weakness, and percussion-induced myoedema. They had surgery to correct pyloric stenosis in their first month of life. The girl also had a patent ductus arteriosus. She has unsteady gait and marked lordosis, with hip and shoulder contractures. Her magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed mild global brain atrophy and C3/C4 stenosis. The boy has a milder form with normal tone and diminished strength. His phenotype also includes supraventricular tachycardia triggered by strenuous activity. <italic>PTRF</italic> mutation is a rare cause of congenital muscular dystrophy. There is a phenotypic variability even within the same family, proven by the diversity of clinical manifestations. The central nervous system findings of brain atrophy and cervical stenosis have not been previously described among the other 20 reported patients.</p>

<p>We report a case in which intravenous corticosteroids were given as an initial symptomatic treatment for Moyamoya-induced chorea. A 6½-year-old left-handed white girl with normal development and no significant past medical history presented with choreiform movements of her right arm, slurred speech, and unsteady gait for a week. Examination revealed intermittent choreiform movements of tongue, neck, and right arm, full motor strength, sensation and coordination of extremities, unsteady gait with slight dystonia of right leg. Routine blood tests, cerebrospinal fluid analysis, hypercoagulable workup, complement and anti-streptolysin O (ASO) titer were normal. Electrocardiogram and echocardiogram were normal. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain revealed scattered T1 hyperintensities with restricted diffusion in frontal white matter and severe occlusion of bilateral carotids with collaterals indicative of moyamoya disease. Cerebral arteriogram confirmed these findings and ruled out vasculitis. The patient was treated with high-dose intravenous corticosteroids for 4 days with resolution of symptoms. She underwent successful elective bilateral pial synangiosis. Moyamoya disease, and idiopathic occlusive intracranial arteriopathy, is characterized by bilateral occlusion of internal carotid artery with collaterals at the base of the brain. The most common presentation is transient ischemic attacks/ischemic stroke, whereas the estimated frequency of movement disorders such as chorea as an initial manifestation is 3% to 6%. These involuntary movements were attributed to disruption of the basal ganglia-thalamo-cortical circuits. Immediate measures classically include low-dose aspirin whereas definitive treatment is surgical revascularization. We present a child with acute-onset chorea secondary to moyamoya who responded to corticosteroid treatment with cessation of choreiform movements. To our knowledge, ours is the second case demonstrating symptomatic improvement of chorea after corticosteroid therapy. We propose corticosteroids should be considered for symptomatic treatment of moyamoya-induced chorea. Further research is needed to help provide this treatment modality for other patients with this disease.</p>

<title>Herpes Simplex Virus Encephalitis in a Patient Undergoing Radiation Therapy for a Brainstem Neoplasm</title>

<p>Herpes simplex virus encephalitis is an uncommonly reported but potential fatal complication of radiation therapy for cranial neoplasms according to multiple case reports and series. Here, we report on a case of herpes simplex virus encephalitis occurring during radiation therapy and adjunctive treatment with temozolomide in a 19-year-old female with a brainstem tumor. Confirmation of diagnosis of herpes simplex virus encephalitis was delayed because of lack of findings on initial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan and a prolonged period of time between initial presentation of encephalopathy with seizures and diagnostic lumbar puncture. The patient is currently receiving treatment with intravenous acyclovir therapy. A review of current literature suggests that an increased incidence of developing herpes simplex virus encephalitis exists among patients who undergo radiation therapy for cranial malignancies. The prevalence of latent herpes simplex virus is very high among the general population, with most individuals unaware of previous exposure to the virus. Considering that cutaneous herpes simplex viral eruptions can occur as a result of exposure to ultraviolet radiation, it is likely that radiation directed to the area of the gasserian ganglion can lead to the reactivation and subsequent retrograde dissemination of a previously latent herpes simplex virus infection into brain parenchyma. Antiviral prophylaxis has been used to prevent reactivation of cutaneous herpes simplex virus and herpes zoster virus under certain circumstances, such as in patients undergoing chemotherapy for other indications or in those who have compromised T-cell immunity. However, there is a scarcity of evidence to support the benefit of antiviral prophylaxis in the prevention of herpes simplex virus encephalitis in at-risk populations. With the incr-eased risk of herpes simplex virus encephalitis in patients undergoing radiation therapy for cranial malignancies, it is our opinion that prophylactic treatment should be strongly considered. Furthermore, additional studies into the efficacy of prophylaxis need to be undertaken.</p>

<p><italic>Bartonella</italic> infection is an unusual cause of seizures and encephalopathy in the pediatric population, but one that is important to recognize owing to effective treatments. A case of first seizure in a previously healthy 8-year-old girl is described. Shortly after presentation, the patient developed high fever, lymphadenopathy, and papular skin lesions typical of cat scratch disease. She did not appear to be ill and had no meningeal signs. Lumbar puncture was performed and cerebrospinal fluid examination revealed zero white blood cells with normal protein and glucose. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings were quite unusual and have not previously been described in this condition; the child had widespread near-symmetric restricted diffusion throughout her subcortical white matter. Follow-up MRI 3 months later demonstrated resolution of diffusion restriction. Serology was consistent with bartonellosis (serum IgG 1:256). Typically, bartonellosis manifests as regional lymphadenopathy with papulosis at the inoculation site; children often have mild constitutional symptoms and one-third of cases will develop fever. Two percent of cases will have neurologic manifestations, among which encephalopathy and seizure are common. Although cat scratch disease is most often self-limited, central nervous system involvement is evidence of disseminated infections and warrants dual antibiotic therapy for 10 to 14 days; in our case, successful treatment with rifampin and azithromycin for 10 days was utilized. <italic>Bartonella</italic> encephalopathy must be included in the differential diagnosis in children who present with new-onset seizures in the setting of febrile illness, particularly when associated with lymphadenopathy and/or papulosis.</p>

<p>Krabbe disease or globoid cell leukodystrophy is one of the most common leukodystrophies. Structural findings on MRI and computed tomography have been well documented and include signal changes in the cerebral and cerebellar white matter and thalami, as well as generalized cerebral atrophy and enlargement of optic nerves. A 5-month-old girl presented with developmental regression, extreme irritability, and fever. Basic metabolic and infectious workup including cerebrospinal fluid studies and cultures were unremarkable. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of her brain revealed enlarged ventricular system with some degree of cerebral atrophy. Additional extensive metabolic testing yielded positive markers for Krabbe disease. Four months later, a follow-up brain imaging demonstrated progressive hydrocephalus without other radiologic features commonly ascribed to this condition. The ventriculoperitoneal shunt was placed but was of minimal benefit, and the patient eventually expired because of natural progression of her condition. In the literature, there are only a few sporadic reports of hydrocephalus in patients with infantile form of Krabbe disease. To our knowledge, this would be the first report documenting continuous development of this rare feature associated with globoid cell leukodystrophy.</p>

<p>Research on opsoclonus-myoclonus syndrome (OMS) has been hindered by the lack of an animal model, diagnostic marker, studies of brain pathology, or known antigen. Investigation of cerebrospinal fluid, however, has been very productive at documenting and characterizing neuroinflammation, in conjunction with clinical significance testing. Immunophenotyping by flow cytometry revealed intrathecal B cell expansion, the first biomarker of disease activity in opsoclonus-myoclonus syndrome. This led to the first biomarker-targeted therapy for opsoclonus-myoclonus syndrome, which was the anti-CD20 chimeric monoclonal antibody rituximab, demonstrated to be efficacious in a phase I/II clinical trial (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT 00244361) and to confer long-lasting cerebrospinal fluid B cell depletion despite peripheral B cell reconstitution. The fully humanized anti-CD20 mAb ofatumumab also depleted cerebrospinal fluid B cells. Fluid-attenuated inversion recovery multimodal immunotherapy (front-loaded corticotropin, intraveous Ig, rituximab) for new-onset opsoclonus-myoclonus syndrome was clinically effective in a pilot study and reduced cerebrospinal fluid oligoclonal bands. With the launch of the OMS Multiplex Chemokine/Cytokine Profiling Project (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT 00806182), new potential biomarkers of disease severity were found in cerebrospinal fluid: B Cell Attractant-1 (CXCL13) and B Cell Activating Factor (BAFF). The frequency of cerebrospinal fluid memory B cells expressing CXCR5 was also increased in untreated opsoclonus-myoclonus syndrome, implicating the CXCL13/CXCR5 axis in B cell recruitment. Pharmacodynamic studies of corticotropin, corticosteroids, and intravenous immunoglobulin revealed several candidate treatment-response biomarkers in cerebrospinal fluid (CXCL13, BAFF) and serum (CCL22, CCL21, BAFF), with distinct response patterns. Steroidogenic therapies downregulated elevated CXCL13, BAFF, CCL22, and CCL21; intravenous immunoglobulin did not, but upregulated serum APRIL production, which was unaffected by steroids. Rituximab-induced blood B cell depletion triggered a reciprocal rise in serum BAFF and parallel decline in serum CXCL13, with levels normalizing after B cell repopulated. These studies have identified a unique profile of opsoclonus-myoclonus syndrome and the agents used to treat it. This translational research has ushered in a new biomarker approach to opsoclonus-myoclonus syndrome and other paraneoplastic disorders.</p>

<p>Seizures are more common in the newborn than at any other time in life and are among the most common reasons a child neurologist is consulted in the newborn nursery. However, the effects of seizures on the immature brain, means of diagnosis, treatment, and importance of successful treatment of seizures remains controversial. Animal models consistently demonstrate deleterious histologic and behavioral effects of seizure, but the relevance of nonprimate models to the human condition is uncertain. In all human studies of neonatal seizures, the most common cause ascribed is hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy, but no series includes routine placental pathology. Chorioamnionitis is important and, as an etiology of brain injury, can involve mechanisms of epileptogenesis related to inflammation. There is general agreement that clinical diagnosis of neonatal seizures is inadequate and that conventional electroencephalography (EEG) is the gold standard, but problematic for general application. The use of amplitude-integrated EEG, which is easier to use, has become widespread. However, amplitude-integrated EEG has significant limitations of which treating physicians must be aware. Focal neonatal seizures of low amplitude are often missed by amplitude-integrated EEG, and it would appear that the use of amplitude-integrated EEG in neonatal nurseries could result in the over-diagnosis of seizures. Currently most approaches to the treatment of neonatal seizures do not consider the unique characteristics of epileptogenesis in the immature brain, and first-generation antiepileptic drugs are relatively ineffective. Adjunctive bumetanide treatment of neonatal seizures is in clinical trial, but clinical trials that are prospective, randomized, and incorporate safety, efficacy, and pharmacologic information of second-generation anticonvulsants currently used without adequate study design are needed. Our understanding of vitamin-responsive seizures has been advanced, and the use of magnetic resonance spectroscopy has improved diagnosis. Our hope is that the successful treatment of neonatal seizures will improve the outcome of the newborn. Studies are limited, but at present there are no data to support the conclusion that successful treatment of seizures with phenobarbital and/or phenytoin improves the outcome of neonates with seizures.</p>

<p>Assumed to be underreported and underrecognized, lymphocytic choriomeningitis presents as aseptic meningitis transmitted by the wild mouse, <italic>Mus musculus</italic>. Although asymptomatic or mild febrile illnesses are commonplace, we report a case of a 17-year-old previously healthy girl who presented to multiple facilities with the chief complaint of headache. Temperatures of up to 100.4°F accompanied headaches, as well as myalgias and abdominal pain. She was admitted to the hospital 2 weeks after the onset of headache. Lumbar puncture was performed, revealing straw-colored cloudy fluid with a white blood cell count of 3135 μL<sup>–1</sup>, red blood cell count 145 μL<sup>–1</sup>, glucose 41 mg/dL, and protein 388 mg/dL. Cytology and flow cytometry of cerebrospinal fluid showed heterogeneous lymphocytes and no oncologic process. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed mildly increased T2 signals of the convexity sulci in the fluid-attenuated inversion recovery sequence without abnormal leptomeningeal enhancement, suggestive of meningitis. Headache, neck stiffness, lower back pain, and photophobia remained constant throughout her admission. Repeat cerebrospinal fluid examination was performed on 2 occasions, revealing protein levels as high as 600 mg/dL and with subsequently improving cell counts and normalizing protein. She was discharged home after pulse steroid treatment on a prolonged steroid taper. After discharge, titers returned positive for lymphocyctic choriomeningitis virus IgG and IgM and a diagnosis of lymphocytic choriomeningitis was made. Headaches persisted after discharge and she was readmitted a month later with additional complaint of joint pain. Arthralgias were thought to be related to chronic infection. Secondary to complaints of poor memory, neuropsychological examination was obtained revealing deficits in attention, concentration, and short-term memory. Her headaches eventually responded to slower steroid taper at an increased dose. Four months after her initial presentation, she returned to school part-time with daily headaches, and normal neurologic examination.</p>

<p>Congenital myasthenic syndrome is a group of rare genetic disorders resulting from known mutations in several causative genes related to the neuromuscular junction. Congenital myasthenic syndrome is typically characterized by muscle weakness following prolonged use and can be precipitated by stress or infection. This report details an unusual case of congenital myasthenic syndrome in an 11-month-old healthy and developmentally normal male with a known history of asthma who presented to the emergency department with acute recurrent episodes of generalized weakness, decreased respiratory effort, and altered mental status following albuterol administration. He required intubation and intensive care unit admission, but became hypotonic each time extubation was attempted. There was no history of weakness or hypotonia prior to the use of albuterol. Initially, this presentation raised concern about hypokalemic periodic paralysis , which was further supported by significant drops in potassium levels with albuterol administration. However, genetic evaluation revealed a mutation in the <italic>RAPSN</italic> gene, one of several known mutations causing congenital myasthenic syndrome. This was unexpected, as one potential treatment for congenital myasthenic syndrome is albuterol, which seemed to precipitate the child’s condition. Further investigation is therefore warranted to characterize other presentations of congenital myasthenic syndrome as well as its relationship to albuterol and other drugs.</p>

<p>Persistent primitive trigeminal artery is a rare congenital vascular anomaly that usually remains subclinical and has various clinical presentations in adults, usually due to aneurysm formation or from vascular steal phenomenon from the basilar artery to the carotid system. We report the first case in a toddler presenting with an acute stroke. A 2-year-old white boy presented after a 2-day febrile illness with left-side weakness. The patient had a previous episode of left hemiparesis following a seizure at the age of 8 months. Examination showed a left hemiparesis more pronounced in the leg. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of brain showed restricted diffusion with bright signal on T2 and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery in the right frontal lobe. Magnetic resonance angiography showed a hypoplastic right A1 segment and right persistent primitive trigeminal artery. In addition, computed tomographic angiogram demonstrated bilateral moyamoya. Extensive workup excluded extracranial vascular anomalies, infectious processes, and hypercoagulable states. Transcranial Doppler showed a steal phenomenon from the internal carotid artery to the basilar artery. Persistent primitive trigeminal artery has been previously associated with moyamoya (<italic>J Neurosurg</italic> 1983;59:166-171) resulting in a hemorrhagic stroke. Most strokes reported from persistent primitive trigeminal artery involve the basilar system and the posterior circulation. In our case, a large persistent primitive trigeminal artery in conjunction with moyamoya caused an anterior circulation stroke due to steal phenomenon from the internal carotid artery to the basilar artery.</p>

<p>Benign familial neonatal seizures is an autosomal dominant disorder associated with heterozygous mutations of either <italic>KCNQ2</italic> or <italic>KCNQ3</italic> gene. Most cases have mutations of <italic>KCNQ2</italic>. A handful of cases with <italic>KCNQ2</italic> and <italic>CHRNA4</italic> deletions have been identified with different phenotypic presentations. Only 2 cases presented with typical benign familial neonatal seizures features. Benign familial neonatal seizures are associated with normal examination and workup, and seizure remission is seen in the first month of life. We report 3 unrelated individuals with <italic>KCNQ2</italic> and <italic>CHRNA4 </italic>deletion, presenting with neonatal seizures and developmental delay. Their seizures started within 1 week after birth; all required antiepileptic drugs. Each had normal brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and at least 2 electroencephalograms (EEGs) with either normal or abnormal findings. All were developmentally delayed. None presented with autosomal dominant nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy (ADNFLE) phenotype, associated with <italic>CHRNA4</italic> mutation. This study supports reports of <italic>KCNQ2</italic> and <italic>CHRNA4</italic> deletion associated with phenotypes different from typical benign familial neonatal seizures.</p>

<p>Methotrexate was among the first drugs discovered to have significant activity against leukemia and remains an integral component of treatment for acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Subacute methotrexate neurotoxicity occurs 5 to 14 days after administration of methotrexate, especially in conjunction with intrathecal administration. It can mimic stroke with acute focal neurologic deficits and restricted diffusion on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The key to differentiating this from acute ischemic stroke is the history of methotrexate administration and the nonvascular, subcortical white matter distribution of MRI changes. The symptoms and MRI changes usually resolve after discontinuation of methotrexate. MRI changes could resolve in 1 to 4 weeks. We present 2 cases of subacute methotrexate neurotoxicity who presented to the hospital with focal neurologic deficits. The first patient was a 13-year-old girl with acute lymphoblastic leukemia treated with intrathecal methotrexate. She presented to the hospital with acute right hemiparesis and dysarthria. MRI of the brain revealed restricted diffusion in the left centrum semiovale. Her symptoms resolved after 24 hours but then almost immediately developed left hemiparesis involving the face and upper limb, and left tongue deviation. Repeat MRI 48 hours after the initial MRI showed resolution of the prior MRI changes and the development of new restricted diffusion in the right parietal white matter. The second patient was a 17-year-old boy with acute lymphoblastic leukemia treated with intrathecal methotrexate. He developed acute-onset encephalopathy and dysarthria and then progressed to anarthria and right facial weakness. MRI of the brain showed restricted diffusion bilateral posterior white matter and splenium of the corpus callosum. The changes were in nonvascular territory, consistent with methotrexate neurotoxicity. MRI 3 days after the initial MRI showed a mild decrease in the area of restricted diffusion. Likely reversible but very significant leukodystrophy could occur with intrathecal therapy.</p>

<p>Group B streptococcal meningitis is most commonly seen in infants; however, in recent years there has been an increase in invasive infections caused by group B <italic>Streptococcus</italic> (GBS/ <italic>Streptococcus agalactiae</italic>) in adults (&gt;18 years of age). Nevertheless, there have been no documented cases of group B meningitis in adolescents. The overall incidence of group B <italic>Streptococcus</italic> meningitis is only 0.15/100 000 cases in adults. In addition, adults who have invasive group B <italic>Streptococcus</italic> infections usually have an underlying medical condition or could have an immunodeficiency. We will present the case of a 16-year-old girl with history of hypoplastic left heart status postrepair that was in good health prior to presentation. She initially presented to the emergency department with a 1-day history of fever and throat pain and no focal neurologic deficits at that time and was discharged with the diagnosis of mononucleosis. Four days later she returned to the emergency department because of profound weakness and a decreased sensorium. She was admitted to the intensive care unit for suspected meningitis and her examination evolved demonstrating significant cranial nerve impairment with associated magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings of basilar meningitis. We will discuss her hospital course including both neuroimaging and pathologic findings and the current literature about invasive group B <italic>Streptococcus</italic> infections including meningitis in the noninfant population.</p>

<p>Sickle cell disease predisposes individuals to infection with <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic> and other encapsulated organisms. The rate of infection in the pediatric sickle cell disease population has dropped significantly after the initiation of routine vaccination and the use of antimicrobial prophylaxis against these contagions. However, there have been recent reports demonstrating an increasing number pneumococcal infections by serotypes not contained in routine vaccinations. We present an atypical clinical presentation of an afebrile adolescent with sickle cell disease diagnosed with <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic> meningitis. It is currently hypothesized that immunologic dysfunction, an increasing rate of nonvaccinated serotypes, and decreased use of antibiotic prophylactic can contribute to the continued incidence of <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic> meningitis in this population. There are limited data on the incidence of cases of afebrile meningitis in patients with sickle cell disease, which could be related to increased incidence of nonvaccine pneumococcal serotypes. Moreover, in an afebrile patient with sickle cell disease, meningitis could easily be mistaken for poorly controlled or concurrent pain crisis. Complicating this clinical picture is the frequent neurologic and neurocognitive deficits that patients with more severe forms of sickle cell disease can have at baseline. This case emphasizes the importance of routine evaluation for streptococcal pneumonia or other infections in sickle cell disease patients who could present with symptoms of pain and other pseudo-neurologic symptoms regardless of their vaccination status, antibiotic prophylaxis, or febrile status. Finally, this case has prompted an investigation of pneumococcal vaccine response in the pediatric sickle cell disease population at Tulane University School of Medicine.</p>
