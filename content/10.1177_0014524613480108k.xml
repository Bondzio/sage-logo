<p>If ever a book justified being called a ‘<italic>tour de force</italic>’, this is surely it. MacDonald’s book seeks to rewrite much of the traditional history of the Jesus tradition with his radical new theories about gospel origins and relationships. His starting point is the work of Papias. MacDonald argues that Papias knew at least two Greek translations of Matthew: one approximating to our Matthew, the other similar to, but differing (especially in order) from Matthew. Luke knew Papias. Luke also knew Matthew. One of the ‘versions’ of Matthew known to Papias was in fact a ‘sayings’ source, similar enough to Matthew to be explained as a faulty translation. The vast bulk of the book (600 out of 700 pages) is devoted to reconstructing and analysing this lost ‘<italic>Logoi</italic>’ source (called here ‘Q+’). A key assumption (introduced with little or no argument) is that Mark also knew this <italic>Logoi</italic> source. (A few who have argued for Mark’s knowledge of Q are mentioned on p. 73; and then on p. 88 it is slipped in as a basic [but subsequently key] assumption that Mark knew the <italic>Logoi</italic> source known to Matthew.) Firstly, Matthew and Mark are mined for common tradition that might lie behind them (especially Matthean doublets): this then produces a far larger ‘Q’ than traditionally assumed since much Markan material is also included. This is confirmed by evidence from Luke. MacDonald then claims to be able to reconstruct the Greek text of this <italic>Logoi</italic> source, divided into ten clear ‘chapters’ with their own internal sequence, and also a very detailed Greek concordance of the text. Briefer concluding chapters discuss the <italic>Logoi</italic> source as literature, as a source for Mark, as a witness to the historical Jesus, and also offering possible reasons why this source, as well as Papias’s work, might have been ‘shipwrecked’ and not preserved.</p>
<p>It is impossible, in a short review, to do justice to a work of over 700 pages and corresponding detailed argumentation. One has to say that the evidence is pushed at times very hard to make it support the theories proposed. An important assumption about ‘Q+’, viz. that this was known to Mark as well, is asserted rather than argued for (cf. above). Many ‘parallels’ are found in numerous places, pressing small verbal agreements, or similar general motifs, not always in a very convincing manner. For example, common features of the birth narratives in Matthew and Luke are pressed to argue for Luke’s knowledge of Matthew (where many would argue that the differences are far greater and more inclined to show no such knowledge). In the claims to try to establish so much Markan material in ‘Q+’, the alleged parallels are remote at best. MacDonald argues that possible Q+ material must be shown to be traditional in Matthew, and also reasons given for Mark’s non-inclusion or transformation of it if there is no clear Markan parallel. But some of the claims of possible Markan ‘rewritings’ are not all convincing. (E.g. is Mark 2.1-12 really a secondary version of the story of the healing of the centurion’s servant? Or is the story of the Syrophoenician woman in Mark 7 evidence of Mark’s use of Matt 10:5-6?) In addition the claims that much of the Markan material ‘coheres’ with other material ascribed to the putative <italic>Logoi</italic> source only works at a level of high generality, and other claims about Matthew’s alleged greater primitivity in some respects are at least disputable.</p>
<p>This is not a book for the faint-hearted! The study clearly reflects a vast amount of labour expended and many of the individual arguments repay detailed consideration. But it remains the case that the overall theory (especially about the nature and extent of ‘Q+’) is unlikely to persuade many.</p>
