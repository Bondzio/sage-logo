<p>Over the last several years, there has been considerable evidence from different areas suggesting that how teachers behave in the classroom and the instructional approaches they use significantly affect the degree that students learn. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1076217511427431">Sanders and Rivers (1996)</xref> reported the effects of ineffective teachers over 3 years as having a depressed effect on student achievement in math by as much as 54% regardless of the ability of the learner. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1076217511427431">Wenglinsky (2000)</xref> found positive effects of using key practices such as critical thinking and metacognition on student learning in math and science across elementary and middle school levels. The literature in gifted education suggests that teacher behavior is the link to differentiated programs and services for this special population. Studies consistently report that regular classrooms have very limited differentiated activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1076217511427431">Westberg, Archambault, Dobyns, &amp; Salvin, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1076217511427431">Westberg &amp; Daoust, 2003</xref>). Moreover, gifted and talented teacher behaviors are not systematically monitored.</p>
<p>Classroom differentiation is highly dependent on positive teacher behavioral change in key areas. A study of math and science programs found that teachers will use strategies linked to content that show results with students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1076217511427431">Kennedy, 1999</xref>). Collegiality and support have also been found to be necessary for change to occur (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1076217511427431">Garet, Porter, Desimone, Birman, &amp; Yoon, 2001</xref>). Another study showed that the use of higher level teaching behavior took 2 or more years of intensive training to demonstrate results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1076217511427431">Borko, Mayfield, Marion, Flexer, &amp; Cumbo, 1993</xref>). Based on these findings, it is clear that attention to classroom-level instruction must be carefully monitored for the results used to improve teaching.</p>
<p>Yet, use of classroom monitoring and evaluation, alone or disconnected from ongoing professional development, appears to be unsuccessful as a catalyst for teacher change. A recent study of teacher evaluation practices in three districts in Wisconsin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1076217511427431">Kimball, 2002</xref>) found that few teachers reported substantial changes in their instructional practice as a result of their evaluation experiences, and the large majority of teachers did not see the evaluation process as an incentive to seek out professional development opportunities.</p>
<p>The field of gifted education is recognized for advancing the introduction of innovative instructional practices into the classroom, such as inquiry learning, critical and creative thinking skills, higher order questioning strategies, metacognition, and the use of rich and varied curricular materials, rather than sole reliance on textbooks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1076217511427431">Tomlinson &amp; Callahan, 1992</xref>). In the last decade, the introduction of content-based curriculum tied to state and national standards and evaluated on student learning gains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1076217511427431">VanTassel-Baska, Bass, Ries, Poland, &amp; Avery, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1076217511427431">VanTassel-Baska, Zuo, Avery, &amp; Little, 2002</xref>) has again positioned the field in the forefront of curriculum innovation and differentiation, with the emphasis on “going through the standards and not around them” to achieve instructional impact.</p>
<p>In spite of such advances, there is little evidence that gifted education programs systematically assess student gains using appropriate learning measures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1076217511427431">Avery &amp; VanTassel-Baska, 2002</xref>). In the absence of student impact data, evaluators must often rely on the quality of the instructional experience as a proxy method for investigating program effectiveness. In fact, teacher effectiveness has been shown to be the main determinant of student progress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1076217511427431">W. L. Sanders &amp; Horn, 1998</xref>). Classroom observation provides a nexus between the input variables of the teacher and his or her students and the process of instruction itself, a process that combines instructional intent (goals and objectives), curriculum resources and materials, instructional and assessment strategies, and classroom management skills within a delimited period of time. In meeting the needs of the gifted learner, the observer must focus on three dimensions of practice: good teaching in general, key elements of educational reform, and differentiation for high-ability learners.</p>

<p>There are certain assumptions made about the Teaching Act that underlay the use of any observation tool, especially one like the Classroom Observation Scale–Revised (COS-R), which is extensive and in depth in respect to behaviors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1076217511427431">Figure 1</xref>). Teaching is a complex social activity requiring the capacity to split attention by student, by area of the room, and by activity. It requires making multiple decisions during a teaching episode by instructional regulation, strategies, use of time, and lesson emphasis. Moreover, teachers must think in complex ways to implement many behaviors simultaneously. For example, one type of thinking that teachers must use relates to following the lesson plan, responding to pacing, modulating student–teacher interaction, and ensuring a variety of stimuli. A second type of thinking required of teachers is awareness of teaching to multiple objectives, such as teaching a concept at the same time as they are teaching content and skills, and at the same time they are attending to the teaching of group dynamics. A third way of thinking involves orchestrating feedback strategies and responses, flexibility in grouping patterns, and questioning and activity choices. Planning, monitoring, and assessing both group and individual learning are another level of thinking that teachers must orchestrate in their daily practice. How does the current lesson relate to yesterday’s and how will it link to tomorrow’s?</p>

<p>Teaching has traditionally been a solitary activity; thus, teachers are not socialized to having external observations of their work and oftentimes are uncomfortable with the observation process. Yet, improvement in teaching clearly requires a change in teacher behaviors that promote learning in students. Such improvement appears to imply the use of higher order thinking, problem solving, and metacognitive approaches. To ensure that teachers are using such strategies, some form of monitoring teacher behaviors must occur.</p>
<sec id="section1-1076217511427431">
<title>Goals for the COS-R</title>
<p>Classroom observation is a seminal part of understanding positive change in education. It affords an opportunity to access the actual instructional experience that is at the heart of teaching and learning. It provides a nexus between the input variables of the teacher and his or her students and the process of instruction itself, a process that combines instructional intent (goals and objectives), curriculum resources and materials, instructional strategies, and classroom management skills within a delimited unit of time. It is the one part of professional development that allows the critical pieces of teacher knowledge and skills to come together in an authentic opportunity to gain insight about the quality of the learning experiences that are delivered.</p>
<p>One way of thinking about a classroom observation component is to see it as a performance-based assessment of the teacher within the context of the learning environment. It affords many of the features of performance-based assessment with the teacher, rather than the student, as the unit of focus. For instance, it is a relatively open-ended experience, with teachers exercising much control over the selection of the lesson to be taught. It allows for the demonstration of complex and higher order behaviors, recognizing that good teaching derives from a sophisticated set of skills that unfold in an integrated way. It also allows for self-assessment, providing a metacognitive dimension to the experience. Most importantly, by using a structured form, it provides a benchmark against which the teaching process can be assessed based on expectations derived from best practice in a given field. However, it is important to distinguish between program and teacher evaluation in terms of the parameters used in the classroom observation process. The focus of program evaluation targets the collective whole. Teacher behavior is sampled through the classroom observation process, and the intent is to allow teachers to prepare for the observation period to reduce the level of threat that permeates this current school climate of accountability. By aggregating data across classrooms, a snapshot of instructional practice is created that helps inform our understanding of program quality. Direct observation is also an important component of a teacher (or staff) evaluation process, but deeper sampling of the individual being assessed must occur when used for this purpose. Also, teacher evaluation should involve some opportunity for unplanned visits to the classroom to assess the consistency of instructional performance. While the two uses of classroom observation (program and teacher evaluation) can complement one another, it is important to acknowledge that the limited sampling template used for program evaluation is not sufficient to make inferences regarding individual staff performance tied to retention or promotion decisions.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1076217511427431">
<title>Applications of the COS-R</title>
<p>If classroom practice for the high-ability learner requires “differentiated” services, then how is this criterion translated into expectations for teacher performance and accountability? What constitutes “practice” in classrooms serving gifted learners? The COS-R provides a mechanism for using quantitative parameters to answer these questions. We cannot afford to ignore teacher behaviors that theory and research have found to contribute to improved teaching effectiveness. The COS-R is one way to assess individual teacher performance in response to high-ability learners.</p>
<p>The process of COS-R development has involved several stages and forms occurring over more than a decade (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1076217511427431">VanTassel-Baska, 2004</xref>). At the first stage, the project team reviewed extant literature on effective teaching, differentiated instruction for gifted learners, educational reform and change, and professional development research. Based on expectations derived from best practices in mainstream and gifted education classrooms, the form was developed to be used in all classrooms and in all subject areas. Only the most critical behaviors for general teaching and differentiation features culled from research-based evidence of effective classroom-based instructional behaviors were included. These focus on the use of strategies that promote student learning and growth especially in the area of higher order thinking, problem solving, and metacognition. Clusters were created based on predominant teaching behaviors within each category. In its final iteration, the COS-R comprised a total of 25 items in six clusters.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1076217511427431">
<title>Technical Adequacy</title>
<p>The analyses in three studies showed that, overall, the scale was highly reliable (α = .91 to .93). The subscale reliability for all the clusters averaged above .70. Based on a content-validity assessment by four scholars in gifted education, the scale achieved an intraclass coefficient of .98. Interrater reliability was assessed in four studies, with results suggesting a range of .87 to .89 across trained raters.</p>
<p>Research suggests that although teachers of the gifted appeared strong in many categories of good teaching, they fall short in many others that examine differentiation practices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1076217511427431">VanTassel-Baska, 2004</xref>). For instance, higher level thinking models were less in use than might be expected in classrooms when gifted learners form a critical mass of the student body. Very little emphasis was placed on accelerative strategies in gifted programs. Rate differences between gifted learners were not routinely attended to by classroom teachers, even those trained in gifted education. Models that explore different types of thinking and problem-solving behavior were not routinely used in gifted program classrooms. The most prevalent problem-solving behavior observed was brainstorming, many times used in isolation of more fulsome models that examined a broader array of problem-solving behavior. Little evidence of the use of metacognition in gifted classrooms was observed. Moreover, little emphasis of out-of-class learning was found in observed teachers of the gifted classrooms as judged by their lack of provision for extended activities. Individualizing for differences within the gifted population, critical thinking, and problem solving were found to be underused in most observed classrooms. Core teaching behaviors like lesson planning and clarity in providing directions were more routinely observed. Curriculum reform elements were in evidence unevenly, with greater prevalence of concept teaching than other behaviors.</p>
<p>Thus, the COS-R provides direct evidence of the need for specific emphasis in developing programs and may be effectively used as a planning tool for that purpose. Professional development plans must take into account the evolving skills of teachers such that workshops and seminars are more tightly focused on needed skills as opposed to desired areas of interests. Gifted programs need to consider the sophistication of using higher level skills effectively and the need for teachers to develop these skills over time through appropriate methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1076217511427431">VanTassel-Baska &amp; Little, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>The COS-R may also prove useful in charting overall growth in desirable teacher behaviors by school or district in respect to the new National Association for Gifted Children standards for curriculum, environment, assessment, and professional development (Sulak &amp; Johnsen, in press). Diagnoses of individual teacher skills needed to work effectively with gifted learners can also easily occur through the use of the COS-R. Videotape analysis of teaching can employ self-assessment using the instrument as well as external observers.</p>

<sec id="section4-1076217511427431">
<title>Implications of Using an Observation Model for Monitoring Differentiation</title>
<p>For many teachers, there is still a hesitancy to open their classrooms to observation, whether from building administrators or outside trained observers. Yet, for differentiation to progress in a meaningful way, teachers must be willing to reveal their practice and learn from the experience. Putting them into situations where they can converse with observers before and after a lesson, where they can self-assess, and where there is a critical mass of teachers experiencing the same process makes the experience more useful and points the way to improvement in strategy use.</p>
<p>Another implication of using such a tool is a potential conflict with existing teacher evaluation forms that are widely used and accepted by schools and teachers as a basis for making judgments about teacher competency. Because the use of successful differentiation techniques goes beyond the level of competency expected on many of those forms, the COS-R and instruments like it can cause confusion in schools about how it relates to the districtwide forms and models used. It is often advisable to align both the forms and the processes used to clarify purpose and intent. Because differentiation strategies require higher level skills of the teacher, using the form at a second level of review may be warranted.</p>
<p>Finally, the COS-R requires multiple use with the same group of teachers. Observations should be three to four per year to get a good snapshot of classroom practice. Multiple use also allows for teacher improvement to show as discussions can be held to target particular differentiation strategies to be in evidence. For example, teachers may plan to activate certain research strategies at a particular time and invite observers, deliberately, to view such lessons. Feedback to teachers, then, can be based on stated desire rather than an inflexible schedule of visitation.</p>
<p>Teaching is a performance art. Therefore, the test of success is demonstrating mastery of relevant techniques. Use of monitoring approaches, including coaching, structured observation, and videotape analysis, increases the chance that teachers will improve in important ways in behaviors that optimize learning for our best students.</p>
