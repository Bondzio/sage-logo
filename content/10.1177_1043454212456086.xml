<abstract>
<p>Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a lifelong disorder that involves progressive organ damage and requires ongoing medical attention to prevent and treat episodic acute complications. Children with SCD need ongoing monitoring and extra attention that may be stressful to family members. Communication within families can help resolve family stress and may be associated with medical follow-up and management of SCD. Focus groups were conducted with 12 African American families to explore the communication that occurred within and outside of the family from the perspectives of adolescents with SCD, siblings, and parents. Factors that influence family communication were explored. The extended family was an important social network and resource to adolescents, siblings, and parents. Family member knowledge of SCD was an important factor that influenced communication about SCD; adolescents and parents communicated more easily than siblings and also reported having more knowledge of SCD than siblings. Future research focusing on the knowledge of immediate and extended family members and their recognition of their contribution to the child with SCD is recommended.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a group of genetic disorders that result from mutations in the β-globin gene that produces the abnormal Hemoglobin S (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1043454212456086">Bender &amp; Hobbs, 2012</xref>). A lifelong disorder, SCD involves progressive and unavoidable organ damage combined with episodic acute complications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1043454212456086">Platt et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1043454212456086">Powars, Chan, Hiti, Ramicone, &amp; Johnson, 2005</xref>). SCD affects persons of African, Mediterranean, Middle Eastern, and East Indian ancestry. In the United States, 1 in 10 African Americans have sickle cell trait and approximately 100,000 have SCD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1043454212456086">Hassell, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1043454212456086">Lerner, Platania, &amp; LaBella, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1043454212456086">Michlitsch et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1043454212456086">National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, 2002</xref>). As persons with SCD age and reach adolescent and young adult years, they begin to experience organ dysfunctions because of cardiac, pulmonary, renal, and retinal damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1043454212456086">Aygun, Mortier, Smeltzer, Hankins, &amp; Ware, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1043454212456086">Brousse et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1043454212456086">Darbari et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1043454212456086">Leikin et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1043454212456086">McPherson et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1043454212456086">Platt et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1043454212456086">Powars et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1043454212456086">Sachdev et al., 2011</xref>). The acute and chronic nature of SCD requires ongoing medical attention to prevent and treat complications.</p>
<p>The care of children with SCD requires extra attention and ongoing monitoring from parents, which may be stressful and disruptive to the family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1043454212456086">Gold, Treadwell, Weissman, &amp; Vichinsky, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1043454212456086">Herzer et al., 2010</xref>). Communication within families can help resolve family stress and disruption related to differences in attention given to the adolescent with SCD and other children. Family communication is associated with sibling adjustment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1043454212456086">Gold et al., 2008</xref>), family functioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1043454212456086">Herzer et al., 2010</xref>), and severity of SCD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1043454212456086">Panepinto, Hoffmann, &amp; Pajewski, 2009</xref>). Family communication may also be associated with adolescents’ management of sickle cell pain at home (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1043454212456086">Barakat, Simon, Schwartz, &amp; Radcliffe, 2008</xref>) and their adherence to clinic appointments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1043454212456086">Crosby et al., 2009</xref>). Communication within the family may mediate or moderate the association between the health of children with SCD and other factors. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1043454212456086">Brown, Connelly, Rittle, and Clouse (2006)</xref> noted that communication within the family may influence the association between the frequency of emergency room use by children with SCD and factors such as caregiver psychological distress. Poorer psychological adjustment among caregivers was associated with more frequent emergency room visits by their children with SCD.</p>
<p>Building on prior research that explored parent perception of the communication between parents and siblings of children with SCD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1043454212456086">Graff et al., 2010</xref>), this study explores the communication among adolescents with SCD, their siblings, and their parents. Findings from the earlier study suggested a need to explore sibling perception of communication about SCD, parent and sibling perception of the impact of frequent clinic and hospital visits on the family, and the perspective of the child with SCD. As with the earlier study, family communication was explored using <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1043454212456086">Fitzpatrick and Caughlin’s (2002)</xref> taxonomy.</p>
<p>According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1043454212456086">Fitzpatrick and Caughlin (2002)</xref>, a family defines itself and recognizes the importance of communication within the family. Communication establishes interdependence and commitment, forms ties of loyalty and identity, and conveys family identity, history, and future. Because communication alone is inadequate to understand, explain, or predict family outcomes, this taxonomy considers the factors within (endogenous) and outside of (exogenous) the family that influence family communication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1043454212456086">Fitzpatrick &amp; Caughlin, 2002</xref>). Endogenous factors include internal (eg, family roles), performance or behavioral activities (eg, tension management), and output or outcome (eg, family stability) variables. Exogenous factors include the social, political, and economic environment of the family; family value orientations; social class; and access to resources and social networks. This taxonomy proposes examining the links among endogenous factors and considering the exogenous factors and their influence on endogenous variables in family communication.</p>
<p>This study explores the communication within families of adolescents with SCD from the perspectives of adolescents with SCD, siblings closest in age to the adolescent, and their parents. Specifically, the researchers sought to understand the adolescent, sibling, and parent perspectives of (<italic>a</italic>) the occurrence of communication among adolescents, siblings, and parents; (<italic>b</italic>) the information, attitudes, and opinions about SCD that are shared in this communication; (<italic>c</italic>) factors that influence this communication; and (<italic>d</italic>) communication about the impact of SCD on the family members.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<p>Focus group interviews were conducted to explore communication among adolescents with SCD, their siblings, and their parents. Participants in focus group interviews have opportunities to share their points of view about a certain topic by interacting with others in a group. The interactions can provide participants with insights into each other’s experiences and opinions as they compare and contrast their experiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1043454212456086">Stewart, Shamdasani, &amp; Rook, 2007</xref>). Focus group interviews place fewer burdens on participants to respond and can be useful when participants may not have thought out the topic of interest or are hesitant to share their views (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1043454212456086">Krueger &amp; Casey, 2000</xref>).</p>
<sec id="section3-1043454212456086">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>A purposive sample was recruited from families whose children received services in the St. Jude Pediatric Sickle Cell Program (Center), following approval by the hospital and university institutional review boards. Of the approximately 800 children and adolescents with SCD who are served by this Center, approximately 250 are adolescents between 12 and 18 years. A letter was mailed to parents of these adolescents introducing the study and encouraging parents to contact the investigator if they were interested in participating in focus group interviews about SCD. Parents were informed in the letter that their adolescent with SCD and 1 sibling closest in age to the adolescent with SCD were invited to participate in focus groups with other adolescents and siblings. Families were eligible if they included an adolescent with SCD between 12 and 18 years old who received services at the Center; a sibling of the adolescent with SCD who was between 8 and 18 years old and did not have a chronic illness, disability, or genetic disorder; and an adult who was the parent or guardian of the adolescent with SCD and the sibling.</p>
<p>The parent contacting the investigator was selected as the parent participant. During the initial telephone conversation with the investigator, parents were informed of the time, date, and location of the focus group interviews. Two Saturday mornings were chosen for the interviews to allow adolescents and siblings to participate and avoid a conflict with their school attendance and parent’s work schedule. A reminder letter was mailed 1 week prior to each interview date and a reminder telephone call was made the day before the interview. The focus group interviews were conducted at the research hospital campus in comfortable conference rooms in a building adjacent to the Center’s clinic.</p>
<p>Efforts were made to recruit 24 families to yield 12 participants per each of the 3 separate focus “subgroups” on each Saturday morning. In other words, 12 adolescents would participate in the adolescent subgroup, 12 siblings would participate in the sibling subgroup, and 12 parents would participate in the parent subgroup on 1 of the 2 Saturday morning sessions. The potential number of participants was 72 or 3 participants (adolescent, sibling, and parent) from each of the 24 families. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1043454212456086">Stewart et al. (2007)</xref> suggest that a “good rule of thumb is to assume that at least 2 participants will not show up for the interview” (p. 58). Following this rule, the expected number of participants for each individual focus subgroup would be 10 participants. This is consistent with the group size suggested by Stewart et al. and approximates the group size recommended by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1043454212456086">Krueger and Casey (2000)</xref>.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1043454212456086">
<title>Interviews</title>
<p>After all participants arrived, the consent form was discussed with all participants in 1 room. Each aspect of the form was explained carefully to assure adolescents, their siblings, and their parents understood the purpose of the study and were willing to participate. The investigators were available to answer questions from individual participants. After consent was obtained from parents and written assent was obtained from children if ≥14 years of age, adolescents, their siblings, and their parents were guided to separate rooms for the focus group interviews.</p>
<p>The moderators conducted the semistructured interviews using interview guides. The adolescent interview guide is shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1043454212456086">Table 1</xref>. Interview guides for the sibling and parent groups follow the same format and included similar questions that were relevant to the family member group. Social workers moderated the adolescent and parent groups, and a child life specialist moderated the sibling group. The assistant moderator for the parent group was a psychologist; assistant moderators for the adolescent and sibling groups were doctoral nursing students. The moderators and assistant moderators received training on conducting focus group interviews and recording the discussion. Guidelines recommended by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1043454212456086">Krueger and Casey (2000)</xref> were followed when preparing the moderator and assistant moderator training and scripts. Opening questions were broad and were followed by more specific questions about SCD and family communication.</p>

<p>The moderators and assistant moderators followed their scripts carefully to establish an environment that was safe, responsive, and conducive to participant sharing. The moderator script consisted of (<italic>a</italic>) introductions, (<italic>b</italic>) purpose of the focus group interview, (<italic>c</italic>) ground rules (eg, there are no right or wrong answers, participant views will differ, participants are free to respond to what others say and ask each other questions, information shared during the group discussion should be held in confidence), and (<italic>d</italic>) interview guides. The script for assistant moderators provided directions for audio recording the interviews and taking notes during the participant discussion. At the end of each focus group interview, the assistant moderator summarized the discussion and asked the participants to support, disagree, or add to the summary. In addition to this opportunity for member validation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1043454212456086">Green &amp; Thorogood, 2009</xref>), participants in each group offered additional insightful comments about the discussion in their group.</p>
<p>Focus group interviews lasted 1.5 to 2 hours followed by lunch provided by the research team. Each adolescent and sibling received a payment of $10 for their time and parents received $20 to cover the cost of child care, transportation, and their time. Debriefing sessions between the moderators and assistant moderators occurred following each focus group interview. Two weeks following the focus group interviews, adolescents with SCD, siblings, and parents each received a letter of appreciation for participating in the study.</p>

<sec id="section5-1043454212456086">
<title>Demographic Form</title>
<p>Each participant completed a demographic form that included questions about age, gender, race/ethnicity, income, education level, school/employment, number and ages of siblings/children, birth order, and SCD severity of the adolescent with SCD.</p>

<sec id="section6-1043454212456086">
<title>Participant Views Form</title>
<p>This form was completed by each participant and included open-ended questions about their experience in the focus group. Participants were also asked to rate how knowledgeable they were about SCD on a scale from 1 (<italic>know nothing</italic>) to 10 (<italic>know a lot</italic>). Parents were also asked to rate how knowledgeable about SCD their unaffected children were on a scale from 1 (<italic>know very little</italic>) to 10 (<italic>know a lot</italic>).</p>

<sec id="section7-1043454212456086">
<title>Analysis</title>
<p>Audio recordings were transcribed verbatim and the transcripts were checked against audio recordings for accuracy. Final transcripts for each of the 2 adolescent, the 2 sibling, and the 2 parent focus groups were imported into NVivo9 software to assist with data organization and analysis. Two researchers independently coded data for each transcript, resolved differences, and defined each code. Codes were organized into categories and categories were organized into themes. The first author was responsible for coding adolescent and sibling data; the last author was responsible for coding parent data; a psychology fellow and psychology graduate student assisted with this coding. The assistant moderators for the adolescent, sibling, and parent groups assisted with coding data from their respective group. Researchers engaged in an iterative process in which they returned to the data to ensure categories and themes represented the data. Group meetings were held with the investigators, moderators, and assistant moderators to plan for data analysis and discuss the coded data. Data from the demographic and participant views forms were analyzed using descriptive statistics.</p>
<p>Although participants were not contacted to discuss or elicit their impressions of the findings, the investigators, moderators, and assistant moderators discussed their differing views and conclusions about the data during the group meetings. These meetings included professionals who were and who were not members of St. Jude Hematology Department. The in-depth discussions during these group meetings contributed to the confirmability of the data as the intent was to support findings with the data rather than the biases of the researchers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1043454212456086">Miles &amp; Huberman, 1994</xref>).</p>

The adolescent with SCD from Family 4 did not participate because the necessary transportation to accommodate her wheelchair was not available to her family. The sibling from Family 3 was unable to participate in the study because she was visiting relatives out of town. Adolescent ages ranged from 12 to 18 years (mean [M] = 14.09, standard deviation [SD] = 2.12); sibling ages ranged from 10 to 15 years (M = 12.91, SD = 1.81); and parent ages ranged from 31 to 58 years (M = 42.42, SD = 8.33). Two thirds of the parents had completed 1 year of college or specialized training and 10 were employed.</p>

<title>Adolescent Exogenous Factors</title>
<p>Social networks discussed by adolescents included extended family members, friends, teachers, and peers at school. Their resources included extended family members, the Center’s Hematology Team, other individuals with SCD, and friends. Adolescent communication centered on disclosing their diagnosis of SCD to others; educating others about SCD; and explaining SCD, absences from school, and reasons for hospitalizations. Adolescents considered, sometimes cautiously, who they would talk to and what information about SCD they would share. One adolescent explained, “I don’t like telling my teachers or my friends. But I feel like, if I don’t, how will they know why I want to go to the restroom or why I need to carry a bottle of water?” An important resource for adolescents was spending time and talking with others who have SCD. One adolescent found answers to his questions about life expectancy of persons with SCD by talking with his niece and cousin “because they got sickle cell, too.” Another adolescent reflected on the importance of SCD camp:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>That’s why I like going to camp because it’s the only time, like you can be yourself and not front about you having it because other people at the camp also have it. You can be yourself and have friends and not have to worry about anything.</p>
</disp-quote>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1043454212456086">
<title>Sibling Exogenous Factors</title>
<p>Sibling social networks included extended family, friends, and neighbors; their resources were the extended family and the Center’s Hematology Team. Sibling communication within their social networks involved educating others about SCD and deciding whether to disclose information about SCD and the adolescent’s health. One sibling reported that he has never talked about sickle cell disease with anyone else and further qualified this with, “I don’t tell my friends about it but I tell them my sister has it.” Adolescents may ask siblings not to tell others about SCD. “I usually don’t tell unless they ask. [Moderator: Why is that?] Because most times he (adolescent) don’t want me to tell nobody unless they ask.” Another sibling described how she shared information about SCD with a friend.</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>Well, I would say we pretty much talk about sickle cell all the time because my best friend, her sister has cancer and she also comes here (to the Children’s Research Hospital). And I tell her a little bit about sickle cell and she tells me a little bit about her sister’s cancer.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Siblings educated others about SCD.</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>Well, they (sibling’s friends) be like, “Why she’s (adolescent with SCD) so skinny?” Then I try to explain to them and they like still don’t understand, so I tell them to go on the computer and look it (SCD) up.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Siblings took advantage of opportunities in school to educate others about SCD. “In my school we have to do a capstone project . . . and I did mine on sickle cell.” Spending time with relatives when the adolescent with SCD was hospitalized or attended clinic facilitated verbal exchanges between siblings and their extended family. “I’ll ask my auntie cause she works with a nurse and she works with a lot of people with sickle cell.” A sibling who asked his grandmother how a crisis started described her answer as, “Sickle cell is when your blood, the blood cell is not a circle.”</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-1043454212456086">
<title>Parent Exogenous Factors</title>
<p>Social networks included the extended family, teachers, church family, parent’s employer, the adolescent’s pediatrician, and staff at the adolescent’s school. Parents’ resources were extended family, the Hematology Team, adults with SCD, the children’s hospital, their church family, and other parents of adolescents with SCD. Parents advocated for their child with SCD; disclosed information about their child’s diagnosis and health to others; and educated others about SCD. “But sharing with other people, I think I have a problem with that, because I don’t want people feeling sorry for him, or feeling sorry for me. It’s been different. It just depends on who it is.” Teamwork and coordination of services by health professionals was important.</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>We’ve had a good experience with the (children’s) hospital. Uh, especially, whenever we have to come in if she’s got a fever or she’s in pain crisis. All I have to do is dial the hematology doctor on call, tell him what’s going on. They say, “Take her to the (children’s) hospital. I’ll call ahead and let them know you’re coming. Go in the ER, they already have her name down.” As soon as we get in there, her name goes up to the top of the list.</p>
</disp-quote>
</sec></sec>
<sec id="section13-1043454212456086">
<title>Endogenous Factors</title>
<p>Endogenous factors include internal variables, behavioral activities, and outcomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1043454212456086">Figure 1</xref>). These factors influence and are influenced by exogenous factors, and the associations among these 3 factors. Internal variables explain patterns in behavioral activities and communication translates the internal variables into outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1043454212456086">Fitzpatrick &amp; Caughlin, 2002</xref>). Thus, family members’ cognitive and affective perspectives of SCD will help account for the verbal and nonverbal exchanges (ie, patterns in behavioral activities) occurring within the family. These patterns in verbal and nonverbal exchanges help translate internal variables such as knowledge into outcomes. For example, an adolescent’s feelings about living with SCD (internal variables) may affect how he or she discloses the SCD diagnosis to others (behavioral activities), which may result in increased advocacy (outcomes).</p>
<sec id="section14-1043454212456086">
<title>Adolescent Endogenous Factors</title>
<p>Internal variables included adolescents’ knowledge of SCD, their perspectives on their siblings, and the sickle cell experience. Behavioral activities involved necessary and unnecessary communication within the family. Outcomes focused on opportunities related to SCD, their acceptance of SCD, future aspirations and expectations, attempts to live what they perceive to be a normal life, and self-esteem issues.</p>
<sec id="section15-1043454212456086">
<title>Internal variables</title>
<p>Adolescents recognized the importance of having a good understanding of SCD so that they could use their knowledge to take care of and advocate for themselves. They talked about first learning about SCD and how learning will continue over their lifetime.</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>I feel that I am a teenager. So along the way there is going to be more things that I will have to learn about it (SCD). But at this time, like right now, I just know the basic things. But like when I start growing up and becoming an adult, there are going to be some things that I’m gonna have to really know.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The sickle cell experience involved being viewed and treated differently by parents, being unable to “take it (SCD) back,” and recognizing how SCD “gets in the way.” Being told by a parent that they could not participate in sports or activities with their siblings or friends was difficult. “Like sometimes I’ll want to go outside and do something, and like, she’ll let my brother go outside, but not me.” Adolescents described SCD as a part of who they were, something they can’t take back, and a disease without a cure. “Well for me, sickle cell is the norm.” “It’s a disease I live with every day. Sometimes I wish I never had sickle cell. Other times, it’s like this is part of who I am and I can’t take it back. I just got to deal with it.” SCD “gets in the way” or interferes with school work, sports, and other activities at school and with friends. “And my problem with sickle cell (is) that I can’t think and focus. Like, I’m always out, or I’m in la la land. As far as school work, it (SCD) gets in the way.”</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section16-1043454212456086">
<title>Behavioral activities</title>
<p>Adolescents considered communication within their family, particularly with parents, as necessary and unnecessary and discussed the need for a balance in how much and what information to communicate. Parent–adolescent communication focused on managing SCD, preventing health problems related to SCD, and getting medical care when the adolescent was ill. Discussing their parents’ reminders to take medication or drink water (unnecessary communication) created cohesion among participants in the second focus group. Parents’ “being overprotective” and balancing the necessary and unnecessary communication was the focus of the following dialogue.</p>
<speech>
<speaker>Adolescent:</speaker>
<p>“Should I worry because she’s like, you know, not overprotective?”</p></speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Adolescent:</speaker>
<p>“You don’t want her too overprotective. If she is too overprotective, you might be like my uncle—37 years old and still living at home. It’s good to let her let you live because you learn how to be your own person.”</p></speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Adolescent:</speaker>
<p>“And you learn to take care of yourself.”</p></speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Adolescent:</speaker>
<p>“So it’s good that she cares, but don’t let her get too overprotective.”</p></speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Moderator:</speaker>
<p>“Sounds like I hear the word, balance.</p></speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Adolescent:</speaker>
<p>“Yeah, balance. Try to communicate with each other about that.”</p></speech>
</sec>
<sec id="section17-1043454212456086">
<title>Outcomes</title>
<p>Adolescents discussed their opportunities related to SCD, their acceptance of SCD, their future aspirations and expectations, attempts to live what they perceive to be a normal life, and self-esteem issues. SCD provided adolescents with opportunities to trust and feel respected by members of the Hematology Team, educate others about SCD by using classroom projects, and consider a career related to SCD. This adolescent described a gradual acceptance of SCD.</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>In middle school I had caught pneumonia back to back. I was trying to fit in, wasn’t wearing coats and trying to keep up with everybody else in high school . . . when it all come down to it, I was the one who had to deal with it, not my mom, not my dad, not my friends, my coaches, or anybody.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Adolescents discussed their aspirations to pursue higher education and occupations with determination, confidence, and motivation. “Well, I’m not really a sports guy. So when I grow up, I want to be an astronomer. It (SCD) doesn’t get in my way of wanting to study astronomy. . . It really doesn’t affect my grades as much.” Adolescents searched for information on longevity of adults with SCD. “I was researching and noticed some people with sickle cell have a limited time of how long they will live . . . on the Internet, it said that people with sickle cell live to like 45 or whatever.” “I want to be a technical engineer with sickle cell. Sickle cell, it’s going to help me.” The enormity of SCD contributed to low self-esteem.</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>. . . but sometimes I just feel like I have all this almost no self-esteem to the point where I just wish I just lived in a big bubble where nobody knew that I had it or whatever. And I don’t really like to tell people. I don’t even like to talk about it with my parents because it really takes a huge toll on you because you realize you have this disease, and it’s like it’s with you for the rest of your life. There’s NO cure for it . . . it’s a huge deal.</p>

<sec id="section18-1043454212456086">
<title>Sibling Endogenous Factors</title>
<p>Internal variables included sibling knowledge of SCD, the perceived impact of SCD on the adolescent, and sibling issues related to SCD. Behavioral activities included direct and indirect parent–child communication about SCD and interactions with the adolescent with SCD. Outcomes included extraordinary opportunities related to being the sibling of an adolescent with SCD and future challenges for the adolescent.</p>
<sec id="section19-1043454212456086">
<title>Internal variables</title>
<p>Sibling discussion about their knowledge of SCD focused on their understanding of SCD, the etiology of SCD, and knowledge gaps. “My mom has the trait and my dad has the trait. It skipped me, then my brother that was before my sister, he has it. Then it skipped me. Now, my little brother has sickle cell.” “My brother has always had sickle cell and I knew he had sickle cell but never understood what it was like.” “I still don’t know what it is.”</p>
<p>The impact of SCD on their brother or sister was viewed by siblings from physical, social, and psychological perspectives. The following comments focus on the physical impact of SCD.</p>
<speech>
<speaker>Sibling:</speaker>
<p>“It (SCD) makes your bones weaker than other people.”</p></speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Sibling:</speaker>
<p>“They have to drink more water and eat more healthier.”</p></speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Sibling:</speaker>
<p>“He tried to play football but my mom says he can’t play with sickle cell . . . if he get(s) hit (playing football) that it might bring on an attack” (speaking softly).</p></speech>
<p>Siblings described social challenges for the adolescent. After this sibling’s friend learned about his brother’s diagnosis of SCD, the friend “don’t want to go riding anymore because he thought he was going to catch it.” A sibling shared that friends of her sister “check her cause she is so small . . . they look at her and talk about her because she’s really skinny.” Physical and psychological consequences of priapism were revealed hesitantly by this sibling.</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>They have this thing where, you know. Their penis won’t go down. . . . Sometimes he has that problem and it’s kinda hard for him to explain it or when he’s having a problem going to the restroom. Or explaining to his friends why he can’t go out and play football with them.</p>

<p>Sibling issues and concerns included being aware of differential treatment by parents, having extra demands and tasks, feeling guilty that the adolescent has SCD, protecting the adolescent from physical and psychological harm, needing to be a responsible person, and worrying about the adolescent’s health. “They (people with SCD) can’t be around a lot of bacteria. So, you know, when you take a shower or wash up in the bathroom, you have to make sure the bathroom stays clean.” This sibling explained differential treatment:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>Like she (mother) helps him fix his breakfast in the morning, his lunch. So, I get up, I got to do that all by myself. So, um, it’s just like, I think sometimes, I think, that my mom pays attention to him more than she does to me but I know that he has sickle cell. So, I know that he needs more help than I do.</p>

<title>Behavioral activities</title>
<p>Siblings initiated communication with their parents when they wanted “to learn more (about SCD),” when the adolescent “gets sick,” and when the adolescent cannot engage in activities that are typical for other adolescents. Siblings used care when determining whether to ask the parent or adolescent about SCD.</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>Well, it depends on the question. . . . If I want to know how he (adolescent with SCD) feels about it, I’ll ask him. If I want to know how he takes care of it and why he can’t do some things, then I’ll ask my mom.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Parents initiated communication with siblings when the adolescent “gets sick” and to explain the diagnosis and its genetic basis. Siblings learned about SCD indirectly by listening to their parents talk with others about SCD.</p>
<p>Siblings listened to their brother or sister with SCD describe their pain and desire to avoid hospitalization. “He (adolescent) tells me sometimes, some things . . . cause he was up here not too long ago in the hospital. He says it hurts him and he don’t want to come back to the hospital.” Siblings asked adolescents questions to better understand the adolescent’s thoughts and feelings and sometimes altered what would be considered typical sibling interactions because of their brother or sister’s SCD.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section21-1043454212456086">
<title>Outcomes</title>
<p>Siblings’ extraordinary opportunities related to SCD included having a special bond or closeness with the adolescent, having increased sensitivity and empathy toward the adolescent, becoming an advocate for the adolescent and others, and maturing early. “But I do remember us all going to the hospital together. All her doctor’s appointments, I was always there. And then when me and my sister, like she’d be in the hospital and I’d spend the night with her.” This sibling replaced jealousy with assisting her mother to free up her time.</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>Well, I used to be jealous because he would be gone, him and my mom would be gone for long periods of time. . . . Or my dad would spend more time with him. . . . But as I got older, I came to decide that I could, you can spend time with your parents more. Or saw where, it seemed like she would be doing things for him, taking away her time with us and I thought, Well, if I do this for her, then it will leave time for her to spend time with me. So, you know, I learned not to be jealous of him but to be a help.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Siblings described future challenges for the adolescent as going to college, getting a job, living alone, and managing their SCD on their own. A sibling pointed out that SCD “gets worse when they (persons with SCD) get older” and elaborated,
<disp-quote>
<p>When he’s older and like when he’s in college and starting to live by himself in a dorm room or whatever, is he gonna be able to take his medication or drink enough water, do that and other stuff? And, then is he gonna get the right job that won’t affect his sickle cell disease?</p>

<title>Parent Endogenous Factors</title>
<p>Internal variables included parent knowledge of SCD, impact of SCD, and responsibility. Behavioral activities included parent–adolescent communication and parent–sibling communication. Outcomes included advocacy, anxiety, expertise, and family strengths.</p>
<sec id="section23-1043454212456086">
<title>Internal variables</title>
<p>From an early diagnosis, parent knowledge of SCD evolved over time to include learning about the management of their child’s SCD, resources for their child and family, increased life expectancy of individuals with SCD, and genotype differences. Parents discussed the impact of SCD on the adolescent, sibling, and themselves. This parent described a younger sibling’s response, “He (sibling) has asthma. He’s like ‘Why can’t I go to (the Center)? I’m sick.’ I say, ‘You’re not sick like that.’ So I have to deal with that, but I try to balance them. It’s kind of difficult.” Parents expressed a fear of being judged, did not want pity, and did not want their child to “use sickle cell as a crutch.” Parents discussed their responsibility to (<italic>a</italic>) be aware of the adolescent’s SCD-related issues and desire to participate in activities with other children, (<italic>b</italic>) make sure the adolescent follows the current treatment, and (<italic>c</italic>) prepare the adolescent to take care of their health in the future.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section24-1043454212456086">
<title>Behavioral activities</title>
<p>Parents’ activities were consistent with their perceived responsibility to the adolescent with SCD and their family. They talked with adolescents about the adolescent’s interactions with peers and friends and intimate relationships. Parent communication with the adolescent focused on managing pain, adhering to the treatment plan to manage SCD, and sharing information about SCD with others. As mentioned above, they engaged in these activities to prepare the adolescent for the future.</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>I (mother) said, “Because I have been to the doctor with you (adolescent) a couple of times, and I know you have been in pain, but not severe pain, and I see that you are getting addicted to some medicine, and I don’t want that.” But you know, like she said, I don’t know her pain, how severe her pain is. Only she knows, and she knows what she can get down to control that pain, and she seems like she tries to understand that.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Parents responded to sibling questions about SCD, addressed sibling issues (ie, jealousy, favoritism, and over protectiveness), and described their awareness of sibling views.</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>It’s a really thin line, you know. Because at home, I often say, “You all need to clean up, and you all need to do this.” But he (sibling) was the one that pointed out to me, he said, “You never tell (adolescent with SCD) to do those things.” In MY head, I thought I did (laughter among parents) because my son with sickle cell already knows he is not going to work in the yard. That’s a given. So, he just stayed in playing a game and they (siblings) cut the grass. So, I really am learning, you know, because they told me, “You don’t really know (adolescent with SCD). He is tougher than you think.”</p>

<sec id="section25-1043454212456086">
<title>Outcomes</title>
<p>Parents discussed their engagement in advocacy, anxiety about the health and future of the adolescent with SCD, recognition of their own expertise, and awareness of family strengths. As parents reflected on their challenges and how they have overcome challenges, they shared their expertise and knowledge with each other. Parents also described how SCD made their family and family members stronger and more resilient. Parents discussed how a lack of knowledge about SCD among health and education professionals contributed to parent mistrust and lack of confidence. Parents developed strategies to overcome this lack of knowledge about SCD among school staff and teachers, the adolescent’s peers, family members, and their own employers. Parents’ advice to other parents of children with SCD was to find support, keep appointments in the hematology clinic, educate themselves about SCD, pray, and develop self-awareness.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Adolescents, their siblings, and their parents communicated with each other to share information about SCD, understand SCD, and consider its impact on the adolescent. According to these family members, communication about SCD occurred for the most part between the adolescent and parent. From the adolescent perspective, adolescents initiated communication about SCD with their parents to alert them when medical care was needed. Adolescents engaged in lively focus group discussion about their communication with their parents. They acknowledged their need to talk with their parents about SCD but desired a balance between talking and not talking about SCD. That SCD is a lifelong condition whose curative treatment (bone marrow transplantation) is not available or a reality for all patients was a “huge deal,” which was made more evident when adolescents talked about it with their parents and others.</p>
<p>From the sibling perspective, they initiated communication with their parents to learn more about SCD when the adolescent patient “gets sick” and when the adolescent patient cannot engage in sports and activities. Siblings listened to the adolescent talk about pain and a desire to avoid hospitalization and asked about the adolescent’s thoughts and feelings about SCD. Siblings sometimes used this information to decide how to interact with the adolescent. During focus group discussions, siblings disclosed, sometimes quietly and hesitantly, their conversations with the adolescent. Siblings in the initial focus group were reticent and had difficulty engaging in discussion. A get-acquainted activity used at the beginning of the second focus group resulted in open and lively sibling discussion.</p>
<p>From the parent perspective, they talked with adolescents about managing SCD symptoms, about talking with others about SCD, and about friendships and relationships. Some parents encouraged the adolescent to inform others about the SCD diagnosis while other parents hesitated because they did not want the adolescent to “use SCD as a crutch.” Communication with the unaffected child involved imparting knowledge about SCD and addressing sibling issues such as jealousy, favoritism, and over protectiveness. During the focus group discussion, parents found commonalities among their experiences and provided support to one another. Some of the parents expressed an interest in forming a support group for parents.</p>
<p>Factors within the family that influenced communication varied by family member. The exceptions were knowledge of SCD and impact of SCD, which were discussed by adolescent, sibling, and parent focus groups. Adolescent, sibling, and parent knowledge of SCD influenced communication about SCD and communication about SCD influenced family member knowledge. Adolescents discussed their own experiences with SCD and their views about their parents’ and siblings’ perspectives on SCD. The impact of SCD was most evident in the adolescent focus groups where they engaged in intense discussion about the sickle cell experience. This experience was influenced by adolescent social networks and resources and involved challenges related to SCD. Although the adolescent discussed challenges related to having a genetic disorder that is a lifelong condition, the outcomes of their communication about SCD reflected a positive and hopeful outlook for the future. Siblings described the impact of SCD on the adolescent and discussed their own issues and concerns that were related to being a sibling—sometimes a bystander to the SCD experience. Parents discussed the impact of SCD on the adolescent, sibling, and themselves and their responsibility to the adolescent.</p>
<p>Sibling experiences of extra responsibilities, feelings of guilt, and worry about the adolescent may contribute to opportunities that were unique to having a brother or sister with SCD. The experiences and extraordinary opportunities described by siblings in the present study are consistent with those reported by previous publications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1043454212456086">Graff, Neely-Barnes, &amp; Smith, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1043454212456086">Meyer &amp; Vadasy, 2008</xref>) with one important exception: participant siblings did not discuss feelings of anger toward the adolescent with SCD. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1043454212456086">Hines and Boyd-Franklin (2005)</xref> explained that African American children may be “parentified” (p. 91). When their parents work or there are many children in the home, children may be assigned responsibilities by parents or children may assume responsibilities on their own. When children are assigned responsibilities they are not developmentally prepared for, because their parents are not carrying out their responsibilities, children may have behavior problems at school and at home. Most siblings in this study discussed assuming responsibilities they were developmentally prepared for, possibly contributing to the extraordinary opportunities they described.</p>
<p>Parent communication about the impact of SCD on family members was both similar and different from parents of children and adolescents with disabilities and genetic disorders. Like parents of children with disabilities and other genetic disorders, parents in this study advocated for their child with SCD and learned how to navigate the education and health care systems. Parents in this study openly discussed their anxiety about the adolescent’s health and future. An issue for parents of children with SCD that is less often a concern for parents of children with other genetic disorders is management of the adolescent’s pain and use of pain medication. Adolescent and sibling awareness of parent efforts to educate the adolescent about self-advocacy and prepare the adolescent for the future may contribute to family cohesion and is consistent with parent views of the family as strong and resilient. Adolescents, siblings, and parents wanted education and health professionals to have knowledge of SCD, which they connected to having trust and confidence in these professionals.</p>
<p>The extended family was part of adolescent, sibling, and parent social networks and a resource that influenced factors within the family and family communication. As resources, the extended family and the hematology team influenced factors within the family and family communication; and both contributed to adolescent, sibling, and parent knowledge of SCD. In African American families, grandparents or other extended family members may informally adopt a child to provide a healthy and nurturing environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1043454212456086">Billingsley, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1043454212456086">Boyd-Franklin, 2003</xref>). Extended family members may assume a supportive and nurturing role when a family member is ill or hospitalized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1043454212456086">Hines &amp; Boyd-Franklin, 2005</xref>). This practice is evident in comments made by adolescents, siblings, and their parents.</p>
<p>Adolescents’ hesitation to disclose their diagnosis and information about SCD to their peers, teachers, and coaches may be associated with adolescent egocentrism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1043454212456086">Elkind, 1974</xref>). This egocentrism is evident around ages 11 to 12 years as adolescents begin acquiring the ability to conceptualize the thoughts of others but have difficulty differentiating between their own and others’ thoughts. As a consequence, adolescents anticipate how others will respond to them based on their own ideas of themselves. By age 15 to 16 years, adolescent egocentrism begins to diminish as they can recognize the difference between their own and others’ preoccupations, concerns, and interests. Adolescents’ view of people with SCD as a resource and the appeal of attending the SCD summer camp can be understood from the perspective of adolescent egocentrism. Knowing that others have SCD can be comforting to adolescents who expect that others with SCD will have thoughts similar to their own.</p>
<p>The results of this focus group study highlight the importance of understanding the influence of the family environment and not viewing the adolescent patient in a vacuum. The siblings in these focus groups had an awareness of the different aspects of the adolescent patient’s care and its impact on their own family experience. A study examining the psychosocial functioning in healthy siblings of children and adolescents with SCD found that increased number of emergency room visits was associated with poor psychosocial adjustment in healthy siblings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1043454212456086">Gold, Treadwell, Weissman, &amp; Vichinsky, 2011</xref>). However, this association was mediated by family functioning in that families with high levels of family expressiveness and support and low levels of family conflict were associated with better adjustment among the healthy siblings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1043454212456086">Gold et al., 2011</xref>). It is important to note that even though the participant families face challenges related to or in addition to caring for an adolescent with SCD, for some parents, the experience of SCD has fostered resilience and strengthened relationships within the family, the extended family, and community. This suggests the need for more research examining the positive psychosocial impact of SCD on the family and exploring ways to promote and enhance family strengths.</p>
<p>A limitation of focus group research is the common concern that participants may not be representative of the larger population. The validity of the findings may be threatened as parents who agreed to participate may be “participating” families who are engaged in the care of the adolescent with SCD. Family members who participated in this study described the hematology team as an important resource, which may have been the impetus to their volunteering. However, adolescents, siblings, and parents, in separate focus groups, viewed the hematology team as a resource. Although focus group interviews provide data that can arise naturally from discussion or represent the researcher’s view, focus groups have structure and allow participants to respond in their own words (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1043454212456086">Stewart et al., 2007</xref>). Although the initial sibling focus group discussion did not flow easily, all focus group discussions provided an understanding of the similar and differing perspectives of adolescents with SCD, their siblings, and their parents. Parents and siblings acknowledged that adolescents needed extra attention from parents, yet the impact of this difference and SCD on family members, the family, and extended family was not clear. Sibling concerns and interest in learning more about SCD and the importance of extended family members can be the impetus for future research that includes these family members and focuses on improving their knowledge of SCD and recognition of their contribution to the child with SCD and family. The taxonomy used in this study to explore family communication served as a useful and open approach. Theoretical approaches such as the bioecological perspective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1043454212456086">Bronfenbrenner, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1043454212456086">Darling, 2007</xref>) may also be useful to examine family communication in the context of child and family developmental changes.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Participants’ ability to communicate about SCD appears to reflect their knowledge and understanding of SCD as adolescents and parents reported having greater knowledge of SCD than siblings. Parent responses to and communication about SCD were linked to the diagnosis of SCD and the adolescent’s sickle cell experience. Sibling understanding of SCD and themselves as a family member was linked to parent responses to and communication about SCD and the adolescent’s sickle cell experience. Although these findings are similar to those reported in early research with families of children with a genetic disorder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1043454212456086">Bluebond-Langner, 1996</xref>), the link between adolescents, siblings, and parents as well as their extended family is an important finding that deserves further investigation.</p>
